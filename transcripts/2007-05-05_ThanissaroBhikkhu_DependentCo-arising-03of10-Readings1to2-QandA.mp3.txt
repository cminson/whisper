Okay, let's start looking at the readings. Reading number one. Ananda, who is kind of
the straight man of the polycanon. It says, it's amazing, Lord, it's astounding how deep
this dependent chorizing is, how deep its appearance, and yet to me it seems as clear
as clear can be. And the Buddha says, don't say that. Don't say that. Deep is this dependent
chorizing, deep its appearance. It's because of not understanding and not penetrating this
Dharma that this generation, i.e., the human race, is like a tangled skein, a knotted ball
of string, like matted rushes and reeds, and does not go beyond the cycle of the planes
of deprivation, low and bad destinations. So basically what we're saying up front here
is, if you don't understand this, you're in good company. And don't expect that after
one day you're expected to know all about dependent chorizing, or that I will be able
to entirely explain it to you in the course of one day. It's one of these topics that
takes time, a lot of repeated reflection. And what we're going to be doing is essentially
soundings into the topic, some explorations of different points that I hope we will find
useful. And then hopefully from here you will take these initial soundings or these initial
explorations and explore them further. So this is just to get you in, you know, give
you a toehold on the topic, because it is complex, and it is, as the Buddha said, it's
very deep. Okay, now many times dependent chorizing is explained as the working out
of a causal principle. The causal principle is explained here in passage number two.
Looks pretty simple. When this is, that is. From the arising of this comes the arising
of that. When this isn't, that isn't. From the cessation of this comes the cessation
of that. There are passages where the Buddha explains that the central insight to his awakening
ingests those terms. Now think about it. You know, the Buddha saw his previous lifetimes,
he saw the cosmos, he saw beings dying and being reborn. You know, there's a lot of
technicolor and panorama to his awakening. And yet what he explains that they're really
important, less than he learned from his awakening, is this causal principle. Now it looks basically
like, basically, when there's A then there's going to be B. A very simple causal principle
actually turns out it's more complex than that. What you've got here are two different
causal principles working together. The first causal principle is sentence one and sentence
three. When this is, that is. When this isn't, that isn't. What we're talking about here
is arising of causal relationships, arising and passing away in the present moment. When
you've got A then you're going to have B. If you don't have A, you don't have B. They
come and they go together. An example would be spitting in the wind. Instantaneous. When
you spit in the wind, there's going to be spit in your face. When this is, that is. When
this isn't, that isn't. Another thing is when you light a fire, there's going to be heat.
When the fire goes out, the heat goes away. Sort of instantaneously coming and going away
together. There's also the explanation that says that when there's up, then there's down.
When there's no up, there's no down. When there's east, there's west. When there's no
east, there's no west. That's another way of explaining it. But more to the point is
when there's contact, there's going to be a feeling. When the contact ends, the feeling
stops. That's an example. You put your finger in the fire, it's going to hurt. You take
your finger out of the fire, it stops hurting. So these are instantaneous things arising and
passing away together. The second relationship is from the arising of this comes the arising
of that. From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that. Now this is causality
that can happen over time. You have one event today and then something's going to happen
tomorrow. You eat bad food today, you have indigestion tonight. You don't study today,
you fail the exam tomorrow. I mean, there's things that happen over time. Here we're talking
about the relationship between events over time. So what you've got here is two principles
interacting. Instantaneous cause and effect and then cause and effect over time. And I
said this is precisely when you've done any study of chaos theory. This is what chaos
theory is all about. You've got feedback loops that come because some things arise and pass
away together. Other things arise, take a while before they show their effect. And it's
a combination of the two that the Buddha said is what creates your present experience. If
you weren't conscious right now, your past karma wouldn't mean anything at all. The fact
that you're conscious right now means then you can experience the results of your past
karma. It gets deeper than that. If you have intention right now, you will experience the
past. If you have no intention right now, there's no experience of past input. And this
is why the Buddha was able to gain awakening at one point in his life before all of his
past karma had worked itself out. Because it was at that moment, there was he brought
the mind to the point where there was no intention adding to the present moment. With a lack of
that intention, there was no experience of the present moment. So he was outside of time
and space. That was his experience in the past. Now the fact that you have these two
factors working together, this explains an awful lot about the Buddha's teachings. First
is it explains why we have the teaching to begin with. If you put an end to the causes
of suffering and it was all totally instantaneous, then as soon as the Buddha put an end to the
causes of suffering, he would die. If there was no input that was going to carry over
from the past. He would have come to the end of suffering, would have died, and that wouldn't
have been it. We wouldn't have known what he had done. So there would be no teaching
here to begin with. At the same time, it wasn't only through past karma that he was put in
a position to gain awakening. Because he didn't have to wait until all of his past karma was
worn out before it could see if the path actually worked or not. We mentioned this earlier.
Suppose everything happens over time. The Buddha has his awakening insight, but he's
got all this other past karma standing in line. It would be like coming down to the
same place. You've bought down all your shopping and you get to the line and there's this long
line of the cash register. You don't know whether you're going to actually get to pay
in time or not. It's going to take a while. But in the case with the Buddha, he goes to
the front of the line. As soon as he gains his insight in the present moment, that cuts
things apart. So he doesn't have to wait for all of his other past karma to work itself
out first. This is why we have the teaching. Secondly, because this is a complex causal
principle, this explains why we need a teaching to begin with. If suffering was simple, we
would have all solved the problem a long time ago. Back when I first came back to the States,
I think it was my third year at Mehta. I finally went down and taught in San Diego and I found
out why I hadn't been teaching in San Diego before. There was an old surfer there. We're
talking about the Buddha's life and the Buddha's seeing the aging illness and death and deciding
he had to go out and find something in the wilderness. The old surfer raised his hand
and said, I've always wondered about this. He said, suppose after seeing the old person
and the sick person and the dead person, what if he'd gone to the beach? Wouldn't that have
changed his picture on life? If suffering were that easy, all you have to do is go down
to the beach. We'd all be down at the beach and that would be the end of it. But because
the causes of suffering are complex and somewhat chaotic, this is why we need a teaching to
show us why we're suffering and how we can get out of it.
Another important point about the interplay of these two causal factors is that life is
not totally deterministic. It's not totally random. When you have complex factors like
this in any kind of interplay, even in just physics, you don't have to talk about psychology.
Even in physics and chemistry, they discovered that systems that are far from equilibrium
that interact in chaotic ways like this are not totally deterministic, even on a physical
level, much less a psychological level. They do follow certain laws, so they're not totally
random. But at the same time, they're not totally deterministic. What this means is,
because there is a pattern there, it means you can learn from the pattern. The lessons
learned today will apply to tomorrow. If things were totally random, what you learned today
might not apply to tomorrow at all. There are actually some theories out there. There
are theories out there in the time of the Buddha. There are theories that you hear nowadays
something that say that each present moment is so totally individual that you can't learn
anything which you've learned from past moments. You have to be just totally present in the
present so you can grok the present moment and have an instinctive notion of what you
should do in that present moment. But the Buddha is not saying that. He's saying,
okay, there are patterns you can learn from the past, and it's in developing skills that
you can get more and more skillful about what you bring to the present moment. At the same
time, things are not deterministic. If they were deterministic, then there'd be no point
in having a teaching anyhow. We'd be locked into wherever we are. We're going. Nobody
would be responsible for anything. If I hit you, I would say, well, it was written in
the stars. I had to hit you. You can't blame me. That kind of attitude. And no matter how
much you wanted to put an end to suffering, it was totally determined that you were going
to suffer. There'd be nothing you could do about it. But because the present moment,
if you follow the, I don't know, I want to go into all the details right now, but if
you follow the logic of this causal principle, what it means is your experience of the present
moment is made up of three things. You've got input coming in from past intentions. You've
got your present intentions, and then you've got the results of your present intentions.
Which means that the only thing, the only one out of those elements is brought in from
the past. The results of past karma. And also your present moment depends on your having
your present intention and experiencing the results of those present intentions. Some
of those results will come right now. Which means on the one hand, there are patterns
coming in from the past, but you do have the freedom of choice in the present moment, how
you're going to interact with that so you can create your present experience. So this
means there are patterns, but it's also not totally deterministic. This is why the teachings
are useful. They can be learned as a skill and they can also be applied to situations
where you can make a difference. The principle of what's called this, that conditionality,
which is these four statements of causality, also explains why the function of the Buddhist
teaching is to find, give us knowledge of the sensitive points. Where in the cycle is it
important to make a difference? Where can we make a difference? So it's all meant to
be practical to be applied to this issue of where in the causal process there are the
sensitive points that you can attack. But also, it explains why we use factors that
are in the causal principle itself to take the causal principle apart. Like when you're
learning, you'll be learning, we'll be learning later on in the day, that clinging to views
is a cause of suffering. And yet, the first part of the path is right view. So you're
going to be using things that you're eventually going to have to let go of. And they're designed
so that it's almost like planned obsolescence. They're designed to deconstruct. It's more
like that rice paper that Sheryl was showing the other day. It's that clear paper you had
that you can sew things onto and then you put water on it and it dissolves. This is
right view. You use it to follow the path and then when you don't need it any longer,
it deconstructs. It deconstructs itself. So we're not bringing Nirvana in to put an end
to suffering. We're taking the things that we usually use as the causes of suffering,
learn how to use them in a more skillful way so that we can put them aside. An analogy
I like to use is the five aggregates. So like a bag full of bricks that you're carrying
around in your shoulder. But you need a path. You take the bricks off your shoulder and
you put them on the ground and you walk on them. So instead of carrying them around,
you use them as a path and then they take you where you want to go. So you're not throwing
the bricks away. You put them to use. The principle of dependent of this, that conditionality
also explains how the teachings are organized. You look at the sutras in the Pali Canon and
it's pretty disorganized. What you see here is person X comes to the Buddha with a problem
and the Buddha gives a specific answer to that problem. The next sutra, someone comes
with a different problem. The Buddha gives a different approach to that other problem.
What this comes from is the fact that if you're in a chaotic system like this or complex system
like this, there are going to be many, many different feedback loops. Different people
are at different spots in the cycle and so they're going to require different teachings.
This is why the Buddha didn't give one overarching explanation of what the Dharma is. But what
we have is if you compare it to medicine instead of teaching basic principles about medical
cures, what you've got is a lot of stories about how a really good doctor cured different
illnesses. What you do as a reading these stories is to figure out who's got the same
illness I've got and then you try that approach. This is why the Buddha never organized anything
in just one big fell swoop. The principle of this, that conditionality, also explains
the contents of the teaching. The Buddha will teach sometimes on the cosmic level and sometimes
he'll teach on the level of the present moment. If you have any experience of reading about
chaos theory, you know that they have something called scale invariance, which means that
what you see on a small level is the same thing you see on the large level. You don't
have to take the universe apart. All you have to do is take the present moment apart, which
is why so much of the teaching is focusing on how you're contributing to the present
moment. Learn how to take that particular unskillful pattern apart and the whole network
of suffering will fall apart as well. Finally, this conditionality explains how the Buddha
presented his teaching. As I said earlier, he had to be sensitive both to his listeners'
past karma and to their present attitude. There are some people whose past karma was
so heavy that they couldn't gain awakening in a couple of cases. The Buddha says, if
you've killed your father, killed your mother, killed an arhat in this lifetime, you're not
going to gain awakening, because the regret for those acts is going to get in the way.
There's a sort of a karmic blockage there. When the Buddha was encountered with people
like that, he would teach them more about the precepts, he would teach them more about
living a healthy, moral life, because they realized they had some karma there that they
just couldn't overcome in this lifetime, but at least get them on the right path. In other
cases, he saw that their past karma was ready and all they needed was a slight change in
their present attitude, so that was what he provided.
So just the way the Buddha teaches, the fact that we have the teaching to begin with, the
fact that we need the teaching, the use of the teaching, its function, its organization,
its contents, its presentation, all these things can be explained by this causal principle
here in passage number two. It's a chaotic feedback loop, not chaotic in the sense of
being totally random. There are patterns here, but it's not deterministic, so you can't
learn and can't make a difference, but there's enough of a pattern that you can also learn
from and apply.
Any questions on passage number two here? That was an awful lot for you to swallow.
Hi, John. How do you understand the saying that I think is attributed to the Buddha and
appears in the Nikayas, that if we see the present moment correctly, the causes and conditions
in the present moment correctly, then we should be able to see all of the past and all of
the future?
What you see is, you see the way things operate in the present moment, then you will understand
the way things operate in the past and the way things will operate in the future. So
it's the same pattern that goes across the board.
So you don't see that as being counter or similar to the idea of determination?
Exactly. Because what you see is that every present, if you see in the present moment that
you have the choice to make a difference, that meant in the past you also had the choice
to make a difference, in the future you will also have the choice. And if you apply that
ability unskillfully now, you're going to have unpleasant results, and the same thing
was in the past. You applied things, you used your intentions unskillfully in the past,
which is why you suffered. And if you continue being unskillful in the future, you're also
going to suffer as well. That's as much as you can learn by looking at the present moment.
Sometimes that saying is twisted a little bit when they say, if you want to know your
past, just look at your present, which is not true. All you see is a little bit of your
past when you look at the present. We don't have one karmic account, we're not watching
sort of your current balance, it's not your total balance. You've got lots of karmic
seeds, some of which are sprouting now, some of which are already sprouted in the past
and have stopped, others which have not sprouted yet. And you can't see that by looking at
any one person in the present moment. If that's the case, then how would the Buddha
be able to see all of his past lives and all of the karma of so many various kinds of things
and the arising and falling of various, what is it, innumerable world systems and all of
that? He had good eyes. What I was saying is, it's
suppose you look at a person, you're not seeing the totality of their past karma, just by looking
at what their present circumstances are. Now the Buddha could have, he had the memory to
go back and say, oh, so and so, this, this, this, this. But still what you're seeing right
now as you look at a person is not the totality of that person's past karma. Two very different
things. Do you see the distinction? No, I don't.
Very fun. There's the ability just to look at the circumstances of the person's life
right now, which anybody can do. But with looking at the circumstances of my life, you can't
tell everything that I did in the past, right? Because not every action I did in the past
was aiming at being a monk, you know, right now sitting and talking to you. I smoked pot
in college. You can't see that. It seems like if my eye were tuned really
correctly, I would be able to. Yes, but it's all led to this.
You could catch the trace of whatever's left and right. Now someone like the Buddha could
actually, he would operate on a memory, his ability to look at someone and see, okay,
what that person's past lives were, what that person's potential in the present moment
is right now, which most of us with ordinary eyesight we can't see.
Because he had a memory of it? Because he had the psychic power that he developed
through his meditation. Even then, he wasn't seeing the totality of all their past actions.
He was just seeing, okay, what are the relevant factors that can be ready to sprout right
now? And the only person whose total lifetimes he saw were his own. And he went back many,
many ayaans. And even then, he said he couldn't go, you can't find a beginning back there.
Even the Buddha says that's unknowable. You know, a beginning point for ignorance, he
says, is totally unknowable. But we, with our ordinary eyesight, what we see are just,
you know, which past karma sees are sprouting right now.
Thank you.
There's a question here.
My question was about your comment. We were talking about the Buddha and when he made
his intention and that that then allowed him to deal with this past karma, I kind of quite,
I didn't quite understand exactly what he was saying.
Back up a bit. As I said just recently, your experience of the present moment is composed
of three things. There's results of past karma, past intentions, your present intentions,
your actual experience of your present intentions. And then some of the results of your present
intentions are experienced right now. These are the three factors that make up an awareness
of the present moment. You know, what he did was he found a way not to have present intentions.
And without the present intentions, the whole, the present moment falls apart. Another question
is how you do that. That's what we're going to be talking about for the rest of the day.
The what?
Oh yes.
The screen that you can dissolve.
Well, that's actually the screen that you can dissolve is the views that bring you to
that point where you can get to the point where you develop the skill to put an end to
intention. And then you drop it.
There are other hands over here.
When you were talking earlier in response to the, I'm sorry I don't know your name, Ayatollaka.
Thank you. It struck me that what the Buddha got very good at was pattern recognition.
And he could apply that, if you will, to a lot of situations. And then as you were going
over with us, you know, the three things that it was as if those are helpful ways of remembering
to look for these patterns in all of us. And I don't know, looking at it this way kind
of lets me stand back a little bit from the intensity of the experience and gives me like
a breathing space. And I think that that's where this, I don't know, the value in learning
these things comes in really handy. Because it isn't, I mean, I want to be able to use
it naturally, but reflecting and seeing that little bit of distance I can gather, some
piece, if you will, in that moment and not identify with the whole thing, just recognize
I'm looking for a pattern here and figure out if I can see the pattern, if I can't,
then you know, say hopefully that will appear to me later.
Well, precisely, you're looking for patterns as opposed to the me in here. We're trying
to depersonalize the pattern. So our normal way of doing things, if this is my way of
doing things, this is my share a way of doing things, I'm going to continue with my share
a way of doing things, because if I don't, it's not Cheryl anymore. That's what we've
got to work through. You say, well, some of these things that I'm doing are unskillful.
And again, if you learn how to get the eye out of there and just look, okay, what is
the pattern of what's going on here? And you say, okay, this is an unskillful pattern.
Let's change the intention that's brought into it. So you're not confined by your notion
of your way of doing things, and that you have to stick to that. So we're looking for
patterns. Yeah. Thank you.
Question here. Runway. When you said that the Buddha, and I imagine anyone who experiences
awakening, goes to the head of the line at the Safeways tour, did you mean forever and
ever? Or after an experience of awakening, you still have to work on your...
You still have past karma that you've got to deal with, but you're no longer bringing
ignorance to it. Maybe as much ignorance. Well, if it's total awakening, no ignorance.
I think so. Think some more about it. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. So skillfulness and awareness.
I think I'm hearing you say that developing awareness is a skill that you can keep sharpening.
Right. And it's, I mean, you get to the point where
there's enough awareness that you can have an awakening. And they talk about levels of
awakening. There are basically four levels of... The first three are called seeing the
Dharma eye. And then the fourth is finally the total awakening. Now, for those first
three, there's still more skills to be developed around this. But finally, with total awakening,
then you have to develop all the skills you need to no longer cause suffering.
And if you develop the skill of awareness, that's just the first skill because you can't
change it. You don't necessarily have the skill to change it just because you're aware
of it. Or are you saying once you're aware of it, it's changed?
Once you're aware of it, it's changed because everything you experience has an element of
your intention involved in it. The more awareness you have around things, then that will change
the quality of your intention. Okay. So the awareness allows you to drive?
Right. That's simple. Right. Yes.
Could you give a couple of examples of intention? Intention. You come into a room, the intention
to make money off of the people in the room is very different from the intention to be
helpful to the other people in the room. Now, the intention to say, I'm doing both is another
intention. I'm going to make money off these people. I'm going to help them at the same
time. That gets complex because then you've got two alternative intentions that are fighting
each other. So then the intentions of the past, then that's
operative in terms of the results of it right now in this moment. And there's also the present
intentions that are affecting this moment and the future. And by seeing all of that, being
aware of it, total awakening. What you're trying to be aware of is what
intention are you bringing right now to the present moment, regardless of what the results
of your past intentions are. I mean, based on our past intentions, we're now human beings.
So that's kind of a given right now. Now, how much longer this is going to last, nobody
can guarantee. I mean, even the Buddhist, even in the suttas
you have, you know, the case of the monk who gains awakening and then goes out and gets
run over by a runaway cow very quickly. So that, you know, that that human, that particular
human karma, you have no idea how much longer it's going to last. But at least at the moment,
this is what you're experiencing coming up from your past karma. Now, the question is
what do you want to do with this human abilities, set of human abilities you have? And each
of us has a different set of abilities based on our individual karma. Now, if you decide
you want to give a life of service, if you want to get to vote your life to meditation,
that's a different intention right now that's going to influence the way you approach the
past moment. Or even up just, just simple thing like listening to the Dharma. The Buddha
says, you know, some people come to listen to the Dharma because they want to find fault
with him. Okay, they're going to hear a certain set of things that the other people who come
to learn are not going to hear and vice versa. The intention you bring here is going to determine
what you hear and what you take home with you. Just one other part to that, that I'm
trying to understand. If my intention is to learn how to be aware, and I think that's
my intention, then as I start looking at that intention, it's why I want to be aware. And
maybe it's I want to be aware to serve. So it keeps growing and like it's the seed just
goes by itself after you start it. That's the way it is.
That's what we're starting out with. We're starting out with fairly complex intentions.
And as we meditate, it's one to get aware of those different levels of intention and
to start paring down the unskillful parts.
