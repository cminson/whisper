So, coming this last week on the Satipetana Sutta, the discourse on the foundations for awareness,
for establishing awareness. So, I want to tell you a little bit about this text. It's kind of
cliff notes. It doesn't go into great explication of what's really being taught. It's more like
brief statements. And then down through the centuries, teachers have then expanded on it
and clarified it for people, used it as a basis for giving instructions. And the instructions,
the understanding, have changed over time. The text is amenable to many different ways
of understanding and interpreting. And maybe that's one of the reasons why it's remained so
popular is that it's, you know, it is more notes where the meat of it comes forth than the teachings
that are received about it. When I was in the first many years that I studied this text and
enjoyed it, what I kind of, the lens or the interpretation that I used to understand it,
I had a lot to do with the very common verb expressed in the text, which is repeated many
places in the different exercise, is to understand or to know, pajanati, to know. And there's so
many of the instructions were to know something, not to fix it, not to be concerned with attaining
anything or getting anywhere. It was not about judging anything or having commentary about
things, but just to know the simplicity of it. And I came to appreciate how powerful it is to
just be present for something, to know it, to be aware of it, giving it the gift of allowing
everything to be itself rather than we are becoming free. Maybe you'll never be free. What we do,
though, is that we give freedom to everything else. And everything receives our freedom from
us, including our inner life. So much so that maybe there's no sense of talking about a self
doing it. Everything is given its freedom to be itself. And so I found it so freeing and so
satisfying to have this very clear present moment awareness that was just abiding in the present,
allowing things to be as they are. It was very freeing, very nice. Then as time went along,
I came to appreciate more and more a different aspect of the Satyapatana Sutta. And that is
that I understood it now as describing a journey. And it begins by saying there is a,
nowadays it's popular to say at the beginning, there is a direct path for the purification of
beings for liberation. And another way of understanding the word direct here, literally
means the word one, is in the early, you know, the first thing the translators did is there's one way.
It was a little bit jarring for many of us. There's only one way. And then became the direct way.
But I think that nowadays I'm interpreting it more and I think it's very likely what it originally
meant, the word one here, we meant unified. There's a unified way. And all these parts of
ourselves get unified. All these practices, all these four foundations get unified and work
together. And they work together in part as a journey, as a path that unfolds over time. And
there's a number of things in the Sutta that to me suggest, a path that we follow. And one of
them is that just the idea of going from body to the fielding tones to mind states to the
inner activities of the mind, the Dhammas, is it goes from the, it goes kind of from the outside
into the depths of who we are, into the deeper, deeper areas that only we can see. So with the
body, that's, you know, you can see each other's bodies, we can see our body, other people, we
can see people's bodies externally. And a lot of it has to do with things that we feel and sense
maybe a little bit more in our physicality. Feeling tone, and that's the way the ancient world
talks about it. It's the physical aspect. The other three foundations are often seen as a part of
the inner mental world. So the feeling tone is something a little bit deeper. It's like how the
world has impacted us in a way that it's pleasant or unpleasant or is, you know, welcoming or not
welcoming. It has a little deeper kind of deeper consequence in ourselves for feeling something.
We're not neutral. It has a kind of effect on us. More deeply, it's the state of our heart,
the state of our chitta, our mind that is maybe more intimate, more personal than just what happens
in our body. And then more deeply, it becomes the operating system, the operating activity of
the mind that is really the linchpin for everything else and how we relate to everything and how we
live in this world and the choices we make. And so going from the body, feelings, mind states to
dhammas is this journey, I like to think of it a journey home, coming deeper and deeper into
ourselves to a place where we can make a difference or the practice can really make a difference to
transform something very deeply. And the transformation in this fourth foundation
foundation is represented by the transformation from the being caught in the five hindrances to
being, having awakened the seven factors of awakening. And one of them leads to, they say to
darkness, the other leads to light. One leads to obscuring wisdom, the other to revealing wisdom.
So this journey and the other place where the journey is manifested is in the refrain. We talked
about many weeks ago, each of the 13 exercises has a refrain. It's the same refrain and it begins by
kind of once we're settled and the awareness is strong, then there's ability to kind of be 360
degrees aware within ourselves, outside of ourselves, internally and externally. And then as we settle
further, then the, they're starting to see the changing nature of phenomena. And we see things
arise. And then as we also see things cease. And then we see things arising and ceasing together.
It's a kind of a journey to deeper and deeper stillness until the rising and ceasing happens
together. And then we go deeper still. And there's a deep kind of equanimity of just, just a clarity
of mind, just a clear awareness, lucid awareness, and just enough knowledge to know what's happening
in the moment in the most simple possible ways. It's a mind that's very equanimous, very peaceful,
very at ease, where then at some point, because of that ease, there's no more effort to protect
ourselves or build ourselves up or try to have something or to be anyone. And something deep
in our psyche can release that the tradition refers to as clinging and clinging to nothing
whatsoever in the world. So it's a journey of awareness that we do. So on one hand, in the
early years, I thought of it, there's no journey just being present for what is. And then later,
I came to appreciate that described a journey. And then I came to appreciate how these work
together. That as we practice just being present for things as they are, giving each things the
freedom to be its own thing, not trying to manipulate anything or change anything, just
to see it and see, see this, this, this, just that and not needing anything to change.
That involves, that brings about change. And one of the ways it brings about change is that
we're actually no longer doing the common human thing of always instigating the change,
always trying to fix and maneuver and get and understand and, you know, figure out or analyze
or plan. The whole world, whole domain of human activities comes to rest when we all we do is
be present, not trying to do anything, not doing anything is a radical thing. And it's kind of
like this house of cards has been built. And we're holding in place, running around, keeping all
the cards in place. When we stop doing that, everything settles and the cards come to rest on
the table. And the house of cards that we built is often one that's not needed, or we don't need
it all the time. And to be always shoring it up and building it up is exhausting. And so the very
practice of being present for things as they are without needing to change anything, just appreciating
that, begins a process of change. And it puts us on a path of maturing in this practice.
And you almost can't avoid maturing in this practice if your practice of mindfulness,
of attention is sincere. And if you're practicing a certain thoroughness or certain
wholeheartedness or certain kind of persistence, like this is what you're doing. And so
day by day, week by week, month by month, the practice of mindfulness is being here, practicing
meditation every day. Something settles. Just being present for what is. The advantage of having
the sense of a path is that it's a little bit encouraging to kind of give ourselves to the
practice more fully, to know that it's leading to a good place. The disadvantage is that people will
huff and puff and strain and expect and be discouraged because they're not going the way they want.
The advantage of just being present for things as they are and just not just being aware of
them in a simple way is that it's very freeing and relaxing. This advantage sometimes is that
people don't have a sense of how far this practice can go, how radical the transformation it can
bring about in us. And so they shortchange themselves. They don't kind of let their inner
system go through the open door. They don't let, kind of like the, there's something inside that
is held in check or not really allowed to kind of let go and move and flow. Because that maybe
can happen easier if we know there's an open path to walk, open door to walk through.
Open door to walk through. So there's different ways of kind of interpretations for understanding
this text and many more than what I said. But for me this has been very important, this distinction
between, or this, the distinction and then the harmony between these two very different modes
of practicing Satipatana. One is just being present for things as they are and that's it.
And the other is being present with the orientation towards a path, the practice
that we're developing. And because it's a unified path, we include everything. Everything
that comes together into this open space of awareness practice. So thank you very much.
And we'll continue the summary or conclusion for the text for the rest of the week. Thank you.
