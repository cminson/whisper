So the shape, form, sense, image, feeling we have for what consciousness might be, what the combined aggregate totality of awareness might be for us is related to different attitudes, states of mind, activities that we have. 
And two which have a big impact on it is tension on one hand and peace, peacefulness on the other. 
These also exist on a spectrum in a range where it doesn't have to be all one or all another, but oftentimes one is present with the other. 
And the advantage of that, of seeing that, discovering that, is that we could tap into the peace, the peacefulness in order to be present for the tension. 
And so if the tension predominates, we can break out of the enchantment, the allure, or the strong, maybe attachment to tension by remembering there's also peace here. 
And knowing it peacefully a little bit sets us free from it. 
If there is a lot of peace, then, and it's easy to kind of not notice any tension, it's actually helpful to then from that peaceful place to see if you can find where the tension still remains. 
Because if the subtle, maybe very slight tension that still remains, if that's held also under this peaceful gaze of attention, then that also has a chance to dissolve and be released. 
And so that the peace can grow more and more. 
At some point with the greater the peace that we have, rather than focusing on the peace, sometimes it's helpful to notice in the cracks of it all or in the somewhere in the subtle places, there's still tension and kind of began kind of working those edges. 
And so the peace can just spread and grow more and more. 
And then, so an often tension is part and parcel of life. 
It comes and goes. 
If it comes and goes, it's fine. 
But the issue is when we hold on to the tension. 
It's not just simply we're driving and someone suddenly veers into our lane in front of us and we tense up in order to quickly kind of break the car or back up or do something to be safe. 
That kind of tension is a completely biologically important. 
But when we're driving as safe again, to be able to let it all go, it's when we don't let go, we hold on to it that becomes a problem. 
And there's many kind of causes for being tense. 
But to hold on to the tension, for the tension to become chronic and tight, there's a fewer reasons. 
There has a lot to do with what goes on in our minds, that there can be strong desire for something, strong aversion to something. 
And what I'd like to emphasize today, there can be fear. 
And fear is one of the one very powerful condition for becoming tense. 
And some people have chronic tension that goes on for a lifetime because of some fear that was kind of inflicted upon them, that they experienced, that they remained afraid in some part of their psyche. 
And that tension always is there bracing ourselves against life or something. 
And when there is tension, especially a tension of fear, if we have a sense of being conscious or consciousness itself, that it tends to be shriveled and to be contracted, tension pulls in and so becoming comes tight. 
Yesterday's discussion about agitation tends to fragment consciousness, make it all kind of rough and jagged. 
But tension tends to shrink it. 
And sometimes the world shrinks to a very particular concern that we have, maybe the particular thing we're afraid of or upset with or that we want. 
And that shrinking of our attention to that one concern, if you kind of open up and look at that sense of the mind that's aware that way, it just feels like it's tight and narrow. 
When the mind is not preoccupied or caught or holding on to anything, that's when awareness can become broad and spacious, come peaceful. 
And a peaceful awareness is one that has been released. 
And because attention that localizes it in one place has been released, it can feel as if awareness or consciousness now begins to spread out. 
It gets released and opened up. 
Whereas calm, the difference between peace and calm, at least for me, and everyone's going to be different, I think, some people, the two are synonyms. 
But calm for me is a settling. 
Things relax and settle. 
It's almost like the weight of calm helps it settle into the pull of gravity. 
Whereas peace comes from release. 
And so, and it becomes things, things go open up and become wide and spread. 
Or to use a slightly different idea, that calm is a settling of the mud in water. 
And peace is the clarity that's left in that water. 
And to be, you know, swimming underwater and have clarity and just kind of sense of that you can see so far. 
It's quite lovely. 
And I've swum in water, which was you couldn't see for more than a foot in front of you. 
And it's a whole different feeling, very different feeling. 
When I was a kid, I would like to go in places where there were waves and the water was relatively clear and very clear, but it was waves coming into the rocky shore. 
And I'd love to go dive underwater, maybe about five or six feet, and hold my breath, turn around on my back, and look up at the waves and the turmoil above. 
And it felt so peaceful down below, because everything was so quiet down there and peaceful. 
And the contrast was so wonderful. 
So fear, what's fascinating about fear, and humbling and upsetting and irritating, but also maybe, hopefully beneficial, is that fear is its own danger. 
If fear is fear of danger, fear itself is a danger. 
When it's chronic, when it conditions us to see the world the way it's not, to see danger at every corner and every location, to always be looking out for what the problems are and the danger is, where that becomes a fixated view. 
And we live only from that danger. 
Everything becomes something that's dangerous. 
And in its way it does, because the fear is its own danger. 
And so it's kind of self-fulfilling, if it's chronic, that yes, we're in trouble, because of the tension, the contraction, the lens that we see through with the lens of fear. 
And so to be, so then if fear is related to tension, fearlessness is related to peace. 
And so peace is not just some kind of bland state, but it's a powerful, wonderful place through which we can be fearless. 
And we have nothing to fear. 
And of course, you know, the car pulls in front of us in a freeway, having some fear is appropriate, and it helps us become safe. 
So it isn't like we want to get rid of all fear. 
But there's this way in which discover the value of peacefulness and fearlessness, that it does protect us, because now we become safe from ourselves. 
So fear is a danger to ourselves, and fearlessness is how we become safe from ourselves, where we're not going to cause harm to ourselves. 
We're not going to contract and hold attention, and which can cause, you know, all kinds of chronic, physical, and mental, and emotional problems for people to be chronically tense and held. 
And so having something like meditation, made even something like exercise and other things that we do, that allow us to relax deeply, to calm deeply, to start experiencing a kind of states of peace, where tensions begin to dissolve, where we're not living in tension, and we have an experience of being safe for ourselves. 
And the heart of fearlessness is to have that kind of safety. 
You become safe for yourself. 
And that sense of an absence of fear changes the nature of consciousness, of how we feel we're aware. 
It's so easy to be aware with such a strong filter of fear and tension, that it just seems like that's the nature of, certainly of consciousness, it's the truth. 
But more powerfully is that consciousness, awareness, attention, that is colored by fear, then sees fear in the world. 
And we don't become necessarily objective, clear seer of what's actually out there, because in a sense everything becomes dangerous, because everything is then now seen through that framework of fear. 
If everything is seen through the framework of fearlessness, then a fearlessness where we're not, we're safe for ourselves, then we're in a much better place to track the inner wisdom, the inner clarity, the perceptions, the hunches, the reactions we have, that we need to be in touch with in order to be wise about what's out there. 
Of course there's dangers out there. 
Some are more subtle than others, but there's probably less danger out in the world than you can ever imagine. 
And so if you, you know, have the wisdom, fearless wisdom, wisdom to ascertain, really know and connect deep inside of yourself with all the different sources of intelligence that operate, then you can probably tune in to the difference between what is really a danger and what is projected danger, not really there. 
The kind of projected danger that often enough is self-fulfilling. 
It sometimes creates the very problem that we're trying to avoid. 
So for the next 24 hours, if you like, you might study how it is for you, the range from tension to peace. 
And when you're tense, where's the peace? When you're peaceful, where's the tension? And may that kind of clarity in the, in the, in the range of who you are and how you are, may that clarity help you to be less caught, stuck in the tension, but more fluid and more, more in touch with the peace that's in our hearts. 
So thank you.
