 Zen Buddhism, that a lot of the practice, where it really counts, is not so much in great abstractions, but practice is really about the moment-to-moment details of your life, how you take care of the little things, because the little things add up to become the big things. And so attention to detail is a very important part of certainly Zen Buddhism, maybe anybody who has a mindful life. So walking meditation is part of that. And in thinking today about walking meditation, I was reminded of this marvelous word, journey. And we talked about a spiritual journey and a spiritual life. Thomas Merton said, a spiritual life is first of all a life. And I like that because many times people kind of add a little bit of spirituality kind of on the weekend or something, weekend spirit, you know, Buddhists or whatever. And I realized that for spirituality to be really serious about a spiritual life, that it's something that is supposed to infuse your whole life. It's a life in and of itself. It's not something extra you add to pass things up or to make things a little bit better. So a spiritual journey, I like the word journey a lot because in this etymological sources of the word, it comes from the French word joure, means a day. And apparently in the first coin this word, it was a journey was a distance you traveled in one day. And that depended, you know, if it was mountainous or if it's flat, or if you had a horse or a donkey, you know, it varied how far you would go. But it was however far you went by the end of the day, it was a journey. And I like that in relationship to spirituality, because it de-emphasizes the goal about some particular place you're getting. It's a process of how you engage yourself, it's the how of how we live our life that is more important than what we're getting and what we're going to attain in a sense. So a spiritual journey is less about a goal than it is about how we walk, both metaphorically and literally. How do we walk through our life? And this thing, you know, most people think of meditation as something we do in sitting posture, especially sitting this way costs like it on the floor. And it kind of seems kind of special, you know, this wonderful Asian thing, you know, yogic posture, and it seems really kind of, maybe kind of mystical or special or unusual or something. But I don't think that's the point. I think the point of the posture is it's supposed to be an ordinary, simple posture that's hopefully a stable and comfortable posture to sit in. And all you're doing is sitting. And there's nothing special, you know, there's nothing like, you know, you could be doing better at yogic exercises, you know, if you wanted to do exercise and just sitting quietly doing here. It's a very simple ordinary activity we do all the time. But we invest it with our awareness, with our attention. And we take this very simple ordinary thing and we bring attention to see if we can wake up our life, to clarify our life, understand our life through this very simple activity. And we do it regularly. The repetition of it is very important in coming back regularly to this posture, this position, this activity. And then becoming familiar with what happens to our mind, our hearts, our feelings over time so we can start becoming more awake, more sensitive, more aware, more heartful. But, you know, in itself it's just an ordinary activity, just sitting here. And I stress this today because the point of mindfulness practice is not simply leave you only with a meditation practice, but it's to bring you, suggest to you that there's a possible way of living a spiritual life through bringing attention to all the ordinary activities and un-ordinary activities that we have in our daily life. And walking is one of those. I've known myself and I've known many people who have overlooked the ordinary in their life as a domain for spiritual practice because of chasing after some wonderful ideal religious abstraction, enlightenment, you know, enlightenment or bust, or try to attain some great concentration or great peace or whatever. And so we're in a hurry to get to the meditation hall and we don't notice that we cut off that pedestrian, or we don't notice that we cut off the person in the traffic getting here. Getting here, you know, that's just getting here, right? That doesn't count. The point of consciousness is getting here and then she can sit and get enlightened. But everything counts because everywhere you find yourself, that's where you are. And that's where your chance is to become awake, to become free, to be attentive, to be sensitive. And whatever way you want to talk about your spiritual life, it'll only happen if you bring yourself into the present moment. And it's the option you have to wait until you get somewhere and then do it, or begin cultivating ability to do it in all your activities. And it can be the most ordinary activities you do it in. And a lot of the value of monastic life, which traditionally were meditation practice and mindfulness practice was cultivated, is not that monastic life is again some wonderful esoteric, special, mystical kind of life, but rather that all the ordinary activities that monastics do, and they do all the ordinary activities, many of the ordinary activities that we do. Sometimes they cook and they clean and they hang out and they talk and study and teach and do many, many things. But all the things they do becomes their practice. There's nothing we just consider outside of practice. It isn't like, let's get through these dishes, wash the dishes as quickly as we can so we can get to the meditation hall. The dishes are infused with, if I use the theme from earlier when I talked about every breath is a prayer, they infuse dishwashing as a prayer, or they infuse it with sacredness, with presence, with themselves. They invest themselves, they inhabit, they bring themselves into the activity. And so that's what makes up monastic life. There's nothing really different than what we do. It's just the how, the process of what they bring to it that's different. Maybe we can do that more in our normal life. And that's my hope, is that as we take to mindfulness practice, we begin exploring ways to spread it out into our normal life. Now walking is one of the beautiful places where mindfulness meditation is practiced. It's one of the formal meditations. There's informal and formal. Sitting posture is considered a formal practice. Washing dishes is considered informal. But walking meditation can be either formal or informal depending on how you do it, but it's one of the formal meditations. And if you go on retreat, we alternate sitting meditation with walking meditation. We go back and forth, usually equal periods of each. And on retreats it's very important to do that because the tendency is in sitting meditation is that we sit around all the time, our energy tends to drop. It tends to be calming or pacifying to sit this way. And if you sit all the time without doing anything else, you start falling asleep or get very lethargic. And so it's very important to infuse your practice with a certain amount of energy. And so we get up and then produce some walking. And the walking infuses it with energy. But if we walk all the time, it'd be too much energy and be agitated in your mind and maybe think too much. So then we sit again. So we go back and forth. And on a one day retreat or on a longer retreat, going back and forth ideally creates this nice balance. And both the calm and the energy can both get strengthened with time. You can get stronger, stronger concentration in the calm because there's a proper amount of energy to balance it. So it's a very important part of retreat practice. However, there is a tendency in the Buddhist world, the Pipassana world, for people to think that sitting practice is where it's really at. Sitting practice is where you're going to get enlightened after all. And so this is where you're going to be huffing and puffing and really make your best effort and whatever. And if you're on retreat and it's time to walk, well you get up and walk and you're kind of a dutiful yogist, so you walk because the schedule says that. Or maybe you'll get some tea instead, you know, whatever. You take a break. And people don't take it off seriously. But both of them are equal in value and equal in opportunity in terms of doing the work of waking up and being present. Some people find that walking meditation works a lot better for them. And they actually will do more walking than sitting. Some people will, in their daily meditation practice, will not do sitting meditation, but will do walking meditation because they find that works better for them. And that's a wonderful and valid thing to do is to sit. Also what's nice about walking meditation is that it's much more an ordinary activity that's like our normal life. Many of you sit at desks all the time, so sitting is ordinary enough. But walking is more kind of, I think our eyes are open and we're kind of walking about. So beginning to understand or to bridge the practice into our normal life happens a little bit easier if you become familiar with walking meditation and make it a regular part of your practice. And then you might find that if you start cultivating a appreciation of awareness, of mindfulness as you walk, that you might find many opportunities in your daily life to start practicing. You don't have to simply do it in formal periods. We say, I'm going to walk now for half an hour and do the formal practice as we do. But you might, I know people who've chosen to make every day to decide to do walking meditation from their car in the parking lot to their office. So maybe it's only 100 yards or 200 yards or whatever, but that walk, they consider it to be their spiritual practice and they'll always be mindful during that walk. Maybe not the other walks during the day, but at least that one there. Or different period, different times of the day, you know, certain walks or certain places as a way of getting centered and settled and arriving here, beginning to wake up. And I love walking. I think walking is one of the great activities to be done. I don't know, maybe it's a little bit irrational, but it's just a wonderful thing, a feeling for the body. I love what it does to my inner sensibility, my sense of settledness and connectedness to myself and connectedness to the world around me. And how I find for myself usually that when I walk, it's a little bit harder to be preoccupied in really hard ways. Somehow the movement of walking lubricates the mind also, a little bit more more relaxed and then it would otherwise be. And so I find that I get more settled and more relaxed and more open, more fluid. When I used to walk, I love to walk. I walk in the hills where I live. So walking is a really great thing. There's probably many, many odes of praise made to walking. Probably many of you like to walk. And then the last thing I'll say before I tell you the actual instructions for walking meditation, and maybe I'm repeating myself, is that many of us in our activities in spiritual life focus very much on goals, on what we're trying to accomplish, and overlooking the how of how we do things. And it isn't that one is, you know, we have to set them up in opposition to each other, but spiritual life is much more to do with how we do something than it is with what we do. And so you can do many different things, but how you do it, whether you do it with presence, you do it with awareness, you do it with care, with attention, with love, or you do it mindlessly, or you do it in a hurry, you do it reluctantly, or hesitantly, or impatiently, or unconsciously. How do we do it to pay attention to that? And what is most satisfying? What's the most satisfying way to do it? Do we wash dishes to wash the dishes? Or do we wash dishes to get it over with? So we can go on and watch television and go on to the next thing. The how is important. So the how, then, of walking, walking is a wonderful place to study. How? How we do something? Because you're going to get to the same place probably almost by the same speed. Paying attention to how as the goal. But how do you get there? When you do it, when you walk somewhere, how are you when you walk there? So the formal walking meditation is done by, it can be done anyway, any old way you want. And what I'm trying to say here is we can do it informally, just as we walk around our day. But there is a formal way of doing it. And that is to choose a walkway, a pathway, that's about 30 or 40 feet long. And it should be level and clear. And it should be some place where you can simply walk back and forth without being concerned about negotiating any paths or obstacles or whatever. So you walk back and forth. And sometimes people ask, why can't I walk in a circle? Or what can I just mange or about? Well, you can't. That's what I'm saying. You can in your normal life. But in formal meditation, it's quite useful to kind of have a pathway because if you're just wandering around, then you're always negotiating your path a little bit. Should I turn the right here? Turn left here? Should I avoid this or whatever? And a part of your mind is always busy thinking about that, preoccupied, even if it's a very small part of your mind. But if you're walking back and forth 30, 40 feet, pretty quickly you know the route. And so that part of the mind can kind of be at rest and you can just be more fully present with the activity itself. So it's simply a matter of walking back and forth and being mindful in this simple activity of walking back and forth. Just being present, coming back into the body, coming back to the activity of walking in the same way as we come back to our breathing. We do walking, we do sitting meditation. The pace in which we walk is something you regulate or decide for yourself. Any pace that seems appropriate. And what appropriate, the gauge for appropriateness, I suggest, is whatever brings you a sense of ease as you walk. And some days it might be faster than other days, some days slower than other days. If you go on retreat you'll see that people walk very slow sometimes, a lot of people do. And if you go on really long retreats you sometimes wonder if they're walking at all. You go to retreat and there's 50 meditators and they're all kind of zombies, like knights are living dead. And so there's a certain amount of peer pressure to walk slow on retreats. And I always recommend that you don't succumb to peer pressure in terms of walking meditation. But rather find out what brings you a sense of ease and then walk in that pace. When you're very tired and energy is really lagging, you might want to walk really fast. My teacher in Burma, he power walked when he did his walking meditation. It was really fast, back and forth, back and forth. Certainly when I'm tired, sometimes when I do walking meditation before my morning meditation, if I'm really sleepy and haven't quite woken up yet, I'll do walking meditation back and forth, back and forth for every 10 minutes until the energy is there and then I'll go and sit. But if it's later in the day, then usually it's kind of a much slower pace. So whatever kind of brings you a sense of ease or whatever brings you the kind of energy you feel you might need to help you be present. And then, so it's a matter of one walking back and forth. So it's a matter of just walking back and forth. And you can stand in any kind of, have your hands in any way that's more or less symmetrical. I vary sometimes. I often have mine in my pocket when I do walking meditation or you have them behind your back or in front or anything. You can probably think of your own creative ways. But something that makes it comfortable so you can keep them that way for a while. And then I usually find it's nice when I begin to actually start by just standing and just kind of feel myself grounded in my body, grounded in my soles of my feet on the ground, and just kind of feel myself here. And then just start walking at whatever pace that is. Usually it's kind of slower than a normal walking pace, but again it's up to you. And whereas in sitting practice, the primary focus, the central focus is the breath, kind of the middle, the central, the mandala. In walking meditation the center is the feet walking. But first, again, establish that sense of ease throughout the whole body. So it's an embodied sense of the whole body, kinesthetic sense of the body walking, walking through space. Not just your mind walking, you know, mind thinking about walking, but really you enter your body as you walk. And then from there we drop our attention down to the feet and the lower legs. And it's the rhythmic pattern of the feet moving, that is where the attention rests. And we pay attention to the leg that's actually doing the stepping. Actually that's where the intention is to make the step. And just feeling the sensations. In the breath we feel expansion and contraction and pressure and warmth and tingling and letting go and tightening. There's many sensations in the breath on which we rest the attention. So there are many sensations in the feet as we walk. There's the hardness of touching the ground, there's the tightening of the leg as we lift it, there's the feeling of maybe vibration or something as we move it through the air, and the contact with the ground, and releasing of the tautness of the muscles. There's many sensations. And it isn't that you have to kind of analyze all these sensations, but it's the flow of all these sensations where we rest the attention. With the rhythm of it, with the kinesthetic feeling of it. And as we walk, it's very useful to label the steps, the kind of mental notes, to help us be present for each step. It's kind of encouraging us to be there rather than letting the mind wander freely. And so you can either just kind of label each step stepping, stepping, walking, walking, or whatever. What's more useful is to be a little more exact by saying right, left. So encourage the mind, kind of nudge the mind, the attention, to be there for the right foot as it does the stepping. Right, left. And then I like to point out that it gets to be kind of cute because the right and left will teach you when your mindfulness has slipped a little bit. Because at some point you'll find yourself going left, right. And then that's a sign that labeling and your attention has become even mechanical rather than really alive and living. When people walk slow, sometimes they break up the steps into three parts and they go lifting, moving, placing. So they can really connect their attention to each of the three phases of each step. Because the idea is we want the attention to be resting continuously through the movement. You can maybe imagine yourself like a dancer who is resting continuously through the movement. Rather than just kind of a checklist approach to mindfulness and just go middle of the step, stepping, and then you keep thinking about dessert. And then left foot moment and then the rest of it's about whatever. So sometimes having some very, very subtle imagery, not active imagery that you kind of think about regularly, but just something that kind of gets you started can be helped with walking like maybe as a dancer or maybe as waves, each step is a wave kind of moving through the ocean or something or coming against the shore. Just something to help you kind of connect for a moment or two with the continuous flow of sensations with each step. And then just let your attention be there with that. When we come to the end of your 30, 40 feet, you turn around and then do the same thing over again coming back and go back and forth. The mind of course as you know will wander away in all kinds of things. If it's easy then just simply come back to the steps, you just do that. If it's not so easy, you can come to a full stop in your place and just kind of take stock and just be mindful, no thinking, thinking or whatever you're feeling. And when you feel like it's kind of past or no longer grabs your attention, then you can proceed with your walking start again. If the eyes are kept open during walking meditation, sometimes sights will grab your attention. And when it does, and really what you want to do is look at something, what you want to do is again stop and do a looking meditation. What you don't want to do is do two things at once. You don't want to kind of pretend you're doing walking meditation, you're walking along. And really what you're doing is kind of like gazing at this beautiful flower. Because then you're doing two things at once and you're not really wholeheartedly in any one thing. You just stop, so you can be wholeheartedly looking and then when you're ready you wholeheartedly walk. If you ever find yourself walking really fast because you're really sleepy or tired, it's mostly a matter of just being aware of the contact of the feet touching, just touch, contact, contact, touch, touch, touch, and just doing that regularly, repeatedly. In some schools of Buddhism like in Zen where they do a lot of walking meditation also, they do it differently. One way they do it is they coordinate their steps with the breathing. And it's a wonderful way to do it, but in Vipassana we don't do it that way because of this idea that we're trying to really be with one thing at a time. And if you're trying to coordinate and have half your attention in your step and part of it with the breathing, then you're not really being able to concentrate on just one activity at a time. Let's see. Sometimes if I walk for 45 minutes or an hour or however long I'm doing the walking meditation, I'll vary the speed. Sometimes the first 20 minutes, say I'm walking for an hour, the first 20 minutes I'll walk pretty fast, maybe faster than a street pace. And then the second 20 minutes I'll go slower and then the last 20 minutes I'll go really slow, kind of just as I settle into it and become more present. So I think that's all. Do you have any questions about that? Yes. I do. I didn't quite catch that, the looking part. Are you supposed to be looking more or less at your feet? Oh, you can have your eyes kind of 45 degrees to the ground, kind of looking down. But not concentrating on looking at any particular thing? Yeah, that's not what we're doing. You have to be looking in order to know where you are, but you don't have to preoccupy it or focus on it. And kind of a loose focus. But if something does catch your attention and you really want to look at it, then just stop and look. Typically aren't sweating your hands? Typically not. I guess you could. Let's see. If I'm going really fast, what do I do? I have to do it. I think, I don't know what I do. I don't really work fast. It doesn't matter. But if you're walking slow, that's another option, just have them loosely on the side. You're walking slow enough that they're not going to swing. It's a beautiful thing, walking meditation. For some people, it takes a while to get the hang of it or appreciate it. It did for me for a long time. I spent my many times just kind of being a dutiful meditator, just doing it because I was supposed to and my teacher insisted I had to. But slowly I began to appreciate it. Now I have a great appreciation for it, towards value and usefulness, both on retreat and as a formal meditation practice. And as an informal practice throughout the day. Some of you, for example, who are relatively new, you might want to extend how long you sit or meditate. And say you meditate for half an hour at home every day, but you like to actually be able to practice more. But you can't really, knees don't really allow you to sit longer than half an hour. So what you might do is do some walking meditation, either before or after. Sit for half an hour or walk for ten and sit for another half an hour. Sit for half an hour and walk for fifteen minutes and then go about your day or some combination like that. If you're interested in extending your practice. Any other questions? Yeah? I read somewhere there's a value to walking with your hands clasped. In some cases that's not the question. It might be. In Zen they hold their hands together. And I think, you know, there are advantages to having hands together like this, like in Zen, they collapse together. Just as in sitting practice, there's advantages sitting in full lotus posture. But those advantages, we're not kind of, in Vipassana we're trying to be really ordinary. And not rely too much on the yogic effects of certain postures, like full lotus has certainly yogic effects. And perhaps doing this also has certain kind of yogic effects. We're just trying to be ordinary and cultivate the awareness in the ordinary, through the ordinariness, rather than doing something special to kind of have a special effect. But, you know, so we don't teach anything special in our tradition, in the Vipassana tradition. Yes? Right. Right. So why don't you all stand and we'll do a little exercise. And stand in such a way that there's some space in front of you to take a couple of steps. And so then just simply close your eyes. And take a moment to go from the tip of your head, just kind of scan through your body, down to your soles of your feet. Enter your body and just feel your body from the inside, all the way down to your feet. And then when you get to your feet, just feel the soles of your feet against the floor. And feel how your weight is distributed on your feet. Is your weight more on your heels or more on the balls of your feet or more on the left foot or the right foot? And if you can readjust the weight so that you're balanced and grounded, you could do that. And then bring your attention to the soles to your left foot. Bring your attention to your left foot. And then feel how those sensations in your left foot shift as you now slowly shift most of your weight over onto your left foot. And then once you have a lot of your weight there, just feel the weight, the pressure, the hardness, the different sensations. And then staying the way you are, bring your awareness, your attention only to your right foot and feel how that is. And then slowly keeping your attention in your right foot, noticing how things change, slowly move your weight over onto your right foot. And then place your attention again on your left foot, only your attention. And then this time, keeping your attention there in the left foot, slowly take a step forward and then shift your weight to your left foot. And then bring your attention to your back foot, your right foot. And with awareness, take a step forward and shift your weight. And then bring your attention again to the back foot and do the same again. Okay, and then you can go back to your place. So that was walking, you know, taking very short, slow steps. But I did that exercise in order to give you a sense, perhaps, of the kinds of sensations and where we place our attention when we do the walking. First, first thing you get to repeat, first we kind of find and establish a sense of ease as we walk. And then once we have that sense of ease, then we just go down and feel those sensations resting there. The mind wanders away, we come back to the feet. If the mind wanders away, we come back to the feet and we rest there and stay there, cultivating presence there, concentration there. And that's the basic, simple practice of walking meditation. Yes. So... So... I like this poem by the Japanese poet Nanao Sakaki. If you have time to chatter, read books. If you have time to read, walk into the mountains, deserts and the oceans. If you have time to walk, sing songs and dance. If you have time to dance, sit quietly, you happy, lucky idiot. I'll make you one. So why not all of us happy, lucky idiots? Sit quietly for a few moments. The Catholic monk Thomas Merton was convinced that if you let the hours of the day saturate you and you gave them time, something would happen. He said that one of the best things that happened to him when he entered into retreat was, and he said, Being attentive to the times of the day when the birds began to sing and the deer came out of the morning fog and the sun came up. The reason we don't take time is a feeling that we have to keep moving. This is a real sickness. We must approach the whole idea of time in a new way. We are free to love and we must get free from all imaginary claims. We live in the fullness of time. The whole thing boils down to giving ourselves in prayer a chance to realize that we have what we seek.
