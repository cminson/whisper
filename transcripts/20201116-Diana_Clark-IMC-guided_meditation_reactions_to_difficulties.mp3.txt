Good evening.
Or whatever time of day you happen to be listening to this.
I'm happy to be here sharing the Dharma with others. It's very meaningful. It's a beautiful thing.
So thank you. Thank you for joining me.
So we'll begin with a guided meditation.
And for this meditation, just allowing yourself to get settled.
Arriving here and to this moment.
Feeling yourself sitting and to sit and know you're sitting.
Maybe connecting with the felt sense of having the chair or cushion the pressure against
your body, perhaps the feet touching the ground and feeling supported and grounded.
Maybe doing a little bit of a body scan.
Checking into those places in which there might be some tension or tightness.
Maybe around the eyes or jaw.
The shoulders. Often we bring our shoulders up. Can we relax them and have them be away from the ears?
And the chest, allowing that to be open. Sometimes we collapse in the chest area.
Can there be an uprightness, an openness? It's very easy and comfortable.
And the belly, allowing softness to be in the belly.
And then resting the attention on the sensations of breathing.
The movement of the belly, the abdomen. Or maybe the movement of the chest.
Or maybe the feeling of air going in and out of the nose.
In a relaxed, easy way.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
And when the mind wanders, we just very simply, gently begin again with the sensations of breathing.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
When you find yourself waking up, so to speak, in the midst of thinking,
can you notice the tone, the attitude of your reaction when you discover you've been lost in thought?
Is it a tone of, oh, okay, that's how it is? Or is the disappointment or blaming or harshness just noticing the tone of the reaction?
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Maybe there's an uncomfortable bodily experience, pain in the knee, maybe the back is uncomfortable.
What is the tone towards that experience? Is it one of meeting it with care and compassion?
Or maybe there's an attitude of anger and trying to push it away?
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
And of course there's no need to be angry about being angry or be averse to having aversion.
We're just noticing what our reactions are when we experience uncomfortableness or difficulties.
We're just noticing. Can we hold it as it's all okay?
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Maybe when there's an uncomfortable sensation or you discover you've been lost in thought, you can turn towards it.
Some warmth and open-mindedness, so to speak, and bring some mindfulness to that experience.
That difficulty, that uncomfortableness.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.
There might be a sense of appreciation that there is a practice that we can bring mindfulness to difficulties.
Maybe we don't always have access to that, but there can be an appreciation.
There's a way to work with things that are uncomfortable.
And that way begins with just being aware that it's uncomfortable.
Resting the awareness on the sensations of breathing.

Just by noticing our reactions to difficulties.
