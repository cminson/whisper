Dharmette : Disenchantment with 
Suffering  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

I’d like to read some verses from my translation of the  
Dham mapāda. I’m going to offer three of the verses to 
you as a challenge , to think about and reflect  on – 
especially in a good way so that you  don’t quickly just 
dismiss the verses or think you know what they’re 
about. You could accept the challe nge by asking , 
“What’s in these verses for me?  How are they useful for 
me? How do I do this? ” They are  in chapter 20 of the 
Dhammapāda , entitled , “The Path .” I’ll read two of the 
introductory verses  first, before the three that I want to 
focus on .  
 
The best of paths is the Eightfold [Path];   
       The best of truths, the Four [Noble T ruths ].  
The best of qualities is dispassion;   
       And the best among gods  and humans  
              Is the one with eyes to see.  
 
This is the path  
       For purifying one’s vision ; there is no other.  
Follow it,         You’ll bewilder M āra.  
Follow it,  
       You’ll put an end to suffering.  
This is the path I have proclaimed ,  
       Having pulled out the arrows.   (Dhp 273-275) 
 
“Having pulled out the arrow s” refers to another verse of 
the Buddha where he talks about having been 
bewildered by all the suffering in the world , and his 
distress around how the world is. Sitting  with himself , he 
realized that deep inside his own heart there was an 
arrow that was emb edded. So, part of his suffering – 
that which  he had to do something about – was to pull 
that arrow out from his heart . And that was his way of 
finding a solution to the suffering he found in the  world. 
Those are  the introductory  verses , and now here  are the 
three to challenge you:  
 
“All created things are impermanent. ”  
       Seeing this with insight ,  
One becomes disenchanted with suffering.  …  
 
“All created things are suffering. ”  
       Seeing  this with insight ,  
One becomes disenchanted with suffering. … 
 
“All things are not -self.”  
       Seeing this with insight ,  
One becomes disenchanted with suffering. …         (Dhp 277-279) 
 
The interesting phrase here is, “becoming disenchanted 
with suffering ” – as if it is a good thing. May be some of 
you think you are already d isenchanted. But are you 
really?  Are there ways  for you  to become disenchanted 
that might  somehow be different, new, or more useful ?  
 
‘Disenchanted ’ implies that you need to be 
disenchanted only if you’re already enchanted. So , in 
what ways are you enchanted with suffering , or in the 
trance of  it? In what way s do you overinvest in the 
importance of your suffering ? And is  there some kind of 
healt hy way of becoming disenchanted?   
 
‘Disenchanted ’ is not the same thing as becom ing free 
of your suffering. It’s a step to becoming free. But to 
become d isenchanted with suffering is to no longer be 
enthralled by it – to no longer put a tremendous amount 
of importance in your suffering , or to no longer overdo  it. 
For some people , suffering is overrated [l aughs] . Maybe 
this teaching is about giving  up overrating it.  
 
Suffering exists for many people . It’s hard to deny that 
people suffer. Probably  some of you suffer from time to 
time. This is not a denial of suffering,  but a challenge to 
look and see what is your relationship to it. How do you 
hold it?  
 One of the ways to be enchanted with suffering is to 
make it much bigger than it is. For exampl e, you get 
enchanted with suffering if you feel that if you are 
someone who is suffering, this is an amazing ly big, 
personal flaw. Or you can be enchanted by suffering by 
assuming that if you’re doing this life just right , then you 
would not suffer at all. Certainly , you can’t let your 
Buddhist friends know that you’re suffering , because 
Buddhism is to be free of suffering , and so you must be 
doing it wrong.  
 
Or some people get enchanted with suffering because 
it’s the only thi ng they really know for how to establish a 
sense of self , or to orient themselves.  
 
Some people use their suffering as a way of getting 
attention from other people. Playing up suffering , being 
enchanted by it , and getting other people enchanted 
with your suffering is the name of the game. Some  
people are really good at playing it up.  
 
Some people’s suffering gives them a sense of value. 
They feel alive and connected to something , even 
though they’re  uncomfortable. The idea of not suffering 
is disorienting, because  there’s not s omething that’s 
pumping them up, enchanting them , or giving them a 
sense of meaning. Some people , when  they relax in 
meditation and the ordinary sufferings of life begin to 
fade away , at least temporarily , they find themselves quite disturbed by that. It’s so foreign and troubling , that 
they want to rush back to the comfort of their usual 
suffering. Some p eople actually say that their suffering 
is comforting because it’s all they’ve ever known.  
 
So, what’s it like to not be suffering?  
 
I’m suggesting that ther e are different ways of being 
enchanted by suffering. Some  people are negatively 
enchanted , where  they abhor  their suffering. They 
overrate it by saying , “This is terrible. This is the worst. 
This can’t be.” They inflat e the importance and the value 
of their suffering .  
 
There  are people who just love to  get together  and 
share their suffering:  “Let me outdo yours ,” and that’s 
their connection  – especially as one gets older. Some of 
you are getting older. Some of you are not getting older 
yet – you think  [laugh ter]! But, I’ve noticed that I’m 
getting to be an old man now . I’ve noticed that people 
my a ge often talk about their physical ailments. They’re 
enchanted with this and that about  their bodie s and  
doctors. There are  all these conversations. For some of 
you with grey hair (or who should have it), i s that true ? 
There’s  a certain kind of camarader ie that comes with 
talking about it. Instead  of gossiping about other people 
and getting  a connection that way , you talk about 
health.  
 Part of the allure of being enchanted with suffering can 
be using  it as comfort , protection, identity, or a support 
for relationship s with others . Some people have  huge 
identity issues built around being a victim  – a personal 
victim, a social victim, or some other kind . They  get 
juice from it; they get  energy from their suffering. Som e 
people hold it like a badg e. 
 
So, the challenge is :  
• In what way s might you be enchanted  with 
suffering?   
• How do you relate to your suffering in unnecessary 
ways?  
• What does it look like to become disenchanted , as 
opposed, to bringing it to an end?  
• It would be nice to snap your fin gers, be finished 
once and for all , get happily enlightened , and live 
happily ever after. That’s  nice; please  do! But short  
of that, what would it look like if you became 
disenchanted?   
 
The word ‘disenchanted ’ in English might have some 
negative connotations . But, I’m suggesting that in this 
context , it’s meant to be all good , because it means that 
you’v e been  in a trance to begin with. You’re enchanted 
in unhealthy ways. The word ‘enchanted ’ means that 
some wi tch has com e along  and put a spell on you. 
You’re in the  spell, and you’re not seeing clearly. So , what’s a healthy way of breaking the spell? What's a 
healthy way of becoming disenchanted?  
 
I think one of the things that happens in becoming 
disenchanted is that , while the  suffering doesn’t go 
away , it isn’t being overrated anymore. Perhaps  your 
suffering becomes ordinary , as opposed to 
extraordinary. There’s  something beautiful that can 
happen just by seeing suffering as  ordinary . It’s an 
ordinary part of life  that:  
• People suffer.   
• I suffer.   
• There’s suffering.  
 
I don’t have to make a big deal out of it. I don’t have to 
get frightened  or alarmed by it. It’s ordinary to have 
suffering. And t here are all different types . It is in the 
ordinariness of  suffering – the ordinariness of feeling it  – 
that suffering may even have  some value. Perhaps 
suffering  is one of our teachers. It teaches us humility , 
empathy for others, and how to let go. It teaches us to 
be more grounded . So, we become  people of the Earth 
– people who belong to these ancient cycles of birth and 
death, these ancient cycles  of nature that come and go. 
This ancient lineage that we’re part of , is to suffer.  
 
If it’s ordinary, if you’re disencha nted and not in the spell 
of it – you’re not for or against it  in some big way . Then 
you’re in a much better position to see it clearly for what it is – to see clearly what’s really going on here in this 
life of ours. You can’t see if you’re in a spell.  
 
So here the Buddha talks about : seeing with insight  that 
all created things are i mpermanent; s eeing that all 
created things are unsatisfactory in some way , for the 
purpose  of clin ging to or holding on to them;  and that all 
things are not -self.  
 
A later verse in the same chapter says :  
Destroy attachment to self . … 
Cultivate the path to peace …    (Dhp 285) 
 
So, this whole movement  – this path, the Eightfold P ath, 
the path of practice, the path of becoming disenchanted, 
the path of relaxing with our suffering  – is meant to be a 
path that leads to greater and greater peace.  
 
I hope that you’ll take up my little challenge to explore 
yourself , and think about in what ways you might be 
under  the spell of suffering , and in what ways might you 
break that spell and allow yourself to be  ordinary with 
your suffering – and in doing that , be on the path to 
greater peace in your life.  
 
Thank you.
