Dharmette: Sun Buddha , Moon Buddha  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

There’s a Zen story – a koan of sorts – that has to do 
with a Chinese Zen Master who was sick . I don’t know 
how sick he was . And  another Zen teacher , or maybe a 
senior student , came to his room to see how he was 
doing . He asked, “How are you doing?” The reply was, 
“Sun Buddha , Moon Buddha.” That’s t he end of the 
story.  
 
It refers to a Chinese Buddhist myth that the sun lives 
for a really long time , and the moon for only a short 
time. The moon changes over the month . It disappears  
and comes back . So the moon has a very short lifetime , 
and the sun has a very long lifetime. A Sun Buddha is a 
Buddha that has a really long lifetime , and  a Moon 
Buddha is a Buddha that has a very short lifetime  – but 
they’re both Buddhas . They’re both awake . They’re both 
here. And the Zen Master  who is sick – maybe he’s 
really sick , or maybe he’s dying – and he’s unconcerned 
about it . He just is what he is.  
 
Bo Lozoff, a Dharma teacher  who taught in prisons for a 
long time , wrote a story, which I read many years ago . It 
was similar . Someone is really sad , or maybe depressed . And in the story , the advice given  to the 
person  who’s sad is : “When you’re sad , just be a Sad 
Buddha. ” 
 
What does that mean: Sun Buddha , Moon Buddha , Sad 
Buddha , Happy Buddha? I think many of us have ideals 
about what we’re supposed t o be like when we  come to  
that glorious, wonderful day when we finally get 
enlightened , and we  live happily ever after in 
enlightened retirement . We can’t wait until that day , 
right? But maybe there’s no such day . There’s this day 
– this is how you are now. You can be a Sad Buddha , 
Happy Buddha, Moon Buddha, Sun Buddha . Who 
knows what kind of Buddha you’re going to be ? You just 
are who you are.  
 
There’s some way of taking on how you are and not 
making it a problem . You can  be relaxed about how you 
are, and accept that this is how it is . Sometimes there 
are Challenged Buddhas  – Buddhas who have 
problems with their family [laughs] , or with their work or 
something . And then there  are Buddhas who have it 
easy at work , or easy with their family , or they’ve figured 
out how not to work [laughs] : Sun Buddha , Moon 
Buddha ; Challenged Buddha , Peaceful Buddha . It’s like 
this right now . This is how it is.  There is something 
liberating  – something freeing – about  not needing it to 
be different : not needing to define it in some  way other 
than how it is , but rather taking it as it is now . Just relax , and don’t  make it a problem – this is how it is ! 
 
It’s easy to say that a ll kinds of things shouldn’t be th e 
way they are. I t was raining recently . You can step in a 
puddle , and all this mud spray s up on your beautiful 
pant leg . So now you’re a Dirty Buddha . You were a 
Clean Buddha , but now you’re a Dirty Buddha [laughs] . 
You can get upset and angry that your pant leg is dirty . 
You probably want to go home at some point and clean 
it up, but now you’re just a Dirty Buddha.  
 
This is a smoggy day , and so you’re a Buddha with 
asthma . You’re a Buddha who is being poisoned by the 
smoggy air. The n the  rain comes, and the air is clean , 
and no w you’re a Clean -Breathing Buddha . It’s like this.    
 
What is it that’s liberating about this approach? What is 
it that actually helps  you – in some very profound and 
deep way  – to be who you are? When we had  all that 
loud noise on the street earlier toda y, the little talk I 
gave was about becoming the sound, rather than 
resisting it , fighting it , or thinking it should be different . 
Just become the sound – be a Grinding Buddha . And, 
grinding away , just sit there.  
 
I was reminded this week of a story  from many years 
ago: 1995 or so . There was an American Buddhist 
Teachers meeting at Mount Madonna . Robert Aitken 
Roshi , who  died earlier this  year in his 90s , was there . He was a  beautiful older man , like the Dean of 
American Buddhism , who had  been studyi ng Zen since 
the late 1940s . He was a Zen teacher in the koan 
tradition, where the practice is to engage in these Zen 
statements or questions . He was getting ready to retire , 
and was talking  as an elder statesman  to all these 
Buddhist teachers about his koan practice , about how 
he taught koans, and how it all works . It was a nice talk . 
Then someone asked him if he would please give an 
answer to a koan before he retires, before he ended his 
talk [laughs] – just giv e one answer . He said, “Okay.” 
When he was a newish Zen student in the late 1940s, 
he was visiting Nyogen  Senzaki , who  was one of the 
very first Buddhist Zen teachers in America  – he came  
here in 1905 . Apparently Nyogen  Senzaki  was a very 
dignified  man. He wore  elegant clothes, had an elegant 
little apartment , and he had this elegant Chinese bowl 
with a spiral going from the bottom of the bowl to the 
outer rim . Nyogen  Senzaki  held up the bowl and said, 
“This spiral  – is it spira ling out , or is it spiraling in?” That 
was the koan – the idea that he gave Aitken Roshi to 
work with . So Aitken Roshi , who was really old,  was 
going to offer the answer to that koan to all these 
American Buddhist teachers at the meeting . He was 
sitting down , and it took him a while to stand up . But he 
got himself out of his chair , and stood there in front of 
this whole crowd of people . Standing there in the open 
space , he lifted up his arms, and spread them straight 
out at 90 degrees to his body . And then with  big, open arms , he swirled all the way around in one direction, 
and all the way around the other direction , and then 
promptly , he bowed . That was the answer . He became 
the bowl – he was the swirling . Rather than saying 
whether the spiral was  going in or out, he became it . He 
became the Bowl Buddha – the Spiral Buddha.  
 
What kind of Buddha are you today? Sun Buddha , 
Moon Buddha ? 
 
And in a few minutes , a lot of us are going to become 
Cleaning Buddhas.
