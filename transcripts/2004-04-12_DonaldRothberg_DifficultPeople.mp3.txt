 So I am happy to come back and coming from Berkeley there was no Oakland A's baseball game today as there was last week. So I barely made it last week and I was thinking about the theme of difficult people and wondering if I could shift to difficult traffic as my preparatory work. And I checked the newspaper today and they're in Texas or something. So got her right on time. So just wanted to check how many people were here last time. And how many people did some kind of practice or gave some attention in the last week to difficult people as they arose in your experience. Okay that's great. So what I'd like to do is to talk maybe 25 minutes maximum and leave some time for discussion of our work and experience together. And I'd like to explore some of the themes I looked at last time and expand on them and then go a little bit further to deal with some of the questions which came up last time. Particularly about even taking the practice of difficult people a little bit further. And so the themes that I brought up last time which I want to treat a little bit in the way I did last time but then expand somewhat. The first theme was the theme of taking our work with difficult people as an invitation to practice or to inquiry. In other words to say okay I'm interacting with a difficult person. Another chance for learning. Thank you. Thank you difficult person. So that's that's the first theme. And the second theme is to actually look carefully at our experience when we're with difficult people and see what happens. That's the mindfulness work. And the third theme is then how to how to practice. The second theme is what do we actually find when we look at how we are let's say in a relatively unconscious state. What do we actually find happens. What makes difficult people so difficult. And the third theme is how to practice. And then I want to talk a little bit further also about action in the world and combining the work that I'm suggesting with difficult people which is more of an inner work. That's what I'm focusing on. And how do we connect that inner work with acting when that's appropriate with difficult people. So the focus will be tonight especially on the inner work that we do with difficult people. But it's not to say that often and perhaps even a lot of the time we may want to compliment that with outer work. And I'll talk more. That's the theme I'll talk about further. So first of all to to say that when I'm talking about difficult people and this came out somewhat in the discussion. Last time I'm primarily talking about the kind of the kind of people that we have a lot in our life that are relatively difficult but not completely impossible or overwhelming. And I want to maybe differentiate between a few different categories of difficult people because this this seems to be necessary. And the kind that I'm talking about are the kinds that we encounter in our work in our families even in our friendships and even perhaps sometimes in our own person that we can be very difficult. And I'm very fond of a line which which Gil says maybe he says it here a lot. It's a wonderful line where he says that if someone tagged around us talking to us the way we talk to ourselves we would find that person incredibly obnoxious and probably way beyond difficult. So I do want to have us have the possibility of saying I am my own difficult person. That's your option. But I'm really talking about this basically relatively workable difficult people. I'm not so much talking about the people who are difficult who are actually trying to harm us. I'm talking about ordinary everyday difficult people. That's really my main focus and not so much people who are sort of actively trying to harm us and not at the moment so much also those who we might be let's say politically or ideologically split from as perhaps some of you have. See this came up also at the end of the discussion. Some people were talking about our current leader is a very difficult person for me and we went into that discussion and and what I want to say is that the ordinary everyday difficult people are training grounds for the more difficult kinds of interactions we have. And I would say just as the meditation practice that we just did is a training ground for being with difficult people. And so I think if you if you consider this work with difficult people as actually a form of training to me that's helpful. It's a form of training that depends on the competences the abilities that we develop in mindfulness practice. In mindfulness practice we begin to slow down our habitual patterns. We begin to see what's there in particular we start to study the reactive patterns the patterns that are linked to our suffering. We also open up to our joy and to our deeper understanding but a large part of what we do in our mindfulness practice is that we really see very closely and we study more than we ever wanted to study our own patterns of reactivity. And this is necessary training for the work with difficult people. And so last time I talked about the practice with difficult people is in some ways not a beginning practice. I would consider it a kind of intermediate practice and it depends on the ability to be mindful to see what's happening in the moment and the growing ability to be able to be mindful. Let's say under stress not easy. Normally when there's stress what we revert to well known survival patterns and so the mindfulness practice moves into that territory and lets us even when there's difficulty start to be able to be present to what's happening. So I found it also very interesting that this opening up to difficult people as a core practice is something that really is found across traditions and you don't have to think very far to think of for example the teachings of Jesus. What are they if not in large part about the spiritual practice of being with difficult people. Right. It's about what do you do with your enemies. It's not it's actually shifting the old eye for an eye tooth for tooth. Remember he says that you should actually treat your enemies as deserving of love. It's quite a quite a radical step obviously and he also counseled the people who were followers to work with those who are the outcasts of society the difficult people in his context that was often the lepers or the prostitutes or the people who are the dregs of society. These in a way were also you might say difficult people. I found also a very beautiful poem by the Islamic Sufi teacher Hafiz. He said this about difficult people. I had to seek the position because of the pain this world caused me. I could not believe what happened when I got there. I found my teacher. Before I left he said up for a little homework yet. Things that kind of a modern translation up for a little homework yet. Okay. I replied. Well then try thinking of all the people. I'm sorry. Try thanking all of the people who have caused you pain. They helped you come to me to God. That's the teaching of Hafiz. Thank all of the people who caused you pain. And there's a very similar teaching which I. Mentioned last time that is in the Mahayana tradition from the wonderful text that some of you know probably called a guide to the bodhisattva's way of life. The bodhisattva being the being who does both the inner work and works in the world to help others and this great text from the eighth century which is the Dalai Lama's favorite book. Every probably has it by his bedside or whatever has it on earphones. He listens. I don't know. And anyway in this text it says just like treasure appearing in my house without any effort on my behalf to obtain it. I should be happy to have an enemy for he assists me in my conduct of awakening. And he goes on to say because I am able to practice patience with him he is worthy of being given the very first first fruits of my patients for he is the cause of it. But surely my enemy is not to be venerated for he intends to cause me harm. How could patients be practiced. If like doctors people all always strove to do me good. He goes on to say since patient acceptance is produced independence on someone with a hateful mind that person person should be worthy of that oration like the sacred Dharma because he is the cause of patience. Very different perspective right. So this first theme is that we can somehow approach difficult people with the perspective that it can be an opportunity for learning and for practice. So it's almost as if we do this enough and we have a difficult experience that we can actually be a little happy and excited and somewhat the way that I told you that after a while not not right at the beginning but after a while when I was working with a difficult person. That I focused on last time when I was talking the person who was in a position of power over me at the institution where I'm where I'm a teacher. And I would actually again not at the beginning but after a while I would I would have meetings every two weeks with him and I would actually have some excitement. Oh I hope he really comes at me with this complete stupidity and aggression because it's almost like I was going into martial arts training or something and I was going to have a chance to work with it. And can you imagine how that would shift your work with difficult people and after a few years of that practice I could bring it to my family. Seriously and it's really it's shifting because it actually what it does is it it reminds us of the joy of learning even when it's difficult. It's really what it's about. So the second theme was the theme of looking carefully at what we actually find with difficult people. And this is the challenge really to look carefully to look mindfully. And what do we actually find. We find that when we're with difficult people what's difficult is actually our experience that difficult people seem to trigger our own difficult experiences. In that sense you could say that even though difficult people are certainly responsible for their own behavior there is something in us which is getting triggered. There's something in us which is workable and that we know that difficult people don't necessarily have to make us lose it. We know that it might be possible and sometimes we can be with people who were difficult five years ago and we can see what's happening. We don't get triggered so easily. But the important thing is to see that's what's difficult about difficult people is our anger our fear our pain our reactivity are losing it. And so what we can explore when we do this practice is we can explore what's actually happening. We can actually look at our own reactivity and the intention of our practice with difficult people is no different than our intention when we're doing mindfulness practice on the cushion. It's to learn how to develop a nonjudgmental open awareness and compassionate response to whatever is happening. And so I often like to say that the core of our practice and in a sense all that we're actually doing when we practice is we're learning better how to be able to see clearly what's happening in the moment. And then on the basis of that develop a wise and compassionate response. It just so happens that we have to do that moment after moment after moment. But that's all that we do kind of simplify his practice. You know we have endless books about emptiness about you know the intricacies of interdependence but all that we're doing is developing the ability to be present to what's happening and develop a wise and compassionate response to it on the basis of seen clearly. That's it. Don't need to read any more books. You know that that is it. And so we are attempting with difficult people to do the same thing that we do in a cushion. And in particular we're trying to learn how to be nonreactive and yet responsive. We can work with that distinction which is often used in English between reaction and response. Reaction is the automatic compulsive often unconscious way that something triggers us and response is the nonreactive and hopefully wise and compassionate way to deal with it. So what we in effect try to do is to be nonreactive when something difficult comes our way. Easier said than done. Someone comes at us with a lot of aggression. How do we begin to be nonreactive and responsive. In a way what we have to learn to do is what we practice on the cushion when we have a knee pain. We can see how we start to get reactive to that or we notice that we have a thought which we don't like. You know where we have a we play over a conversation with a friend and we notice ourself becoming reactive. What we do in our practices we try to see clearly what's happening. We try to feel the pain if there's any pain and then out of that we can find that we're not as reactive. One phrase that I really like very much to describe what we do with difficult people is that we basically learn not to pass on the pain. Typically when difficult people come our way and are difficult with us what we're difficult back in return right. And so you might say the world goes around. It's almost like this is almost like a definition of some sorrow or confusion. It's what obviously drives whatever the Middle East or Iraq right now which is in such turmoil. It's the pattern of pain leading to further pain. Again it's the way that when we're unconscious and compulsive we pass on the pain and we do that with difficult people. Difficult people come towards us and we are typically reactive. We're either reactive aggressively and outwardly or we may be aggressive inwardly either towards ourself or towards them. But what we learn to do when we actually see and work with our experience better is we learn not to pass on the pain with difficult people. And that permits a wiser and more compassionate response. So you might just reflect now just for a moment if you take a minute or two. If you were here last time think of how you might in the last week have been with a difficult of how you might have been with a difficult person. And if you weren't here last time think of what may have happened in the last either few days or week. Think of what is actually happen think of an actual experience with the so-called difficult person someone who particularly someone that you know on an ongoing basis who is sort of chronically difficult. I don't think I have to explain it more right. So take take about a minute and just reflect on if you've had experiences like that and particularly if you try to bring your practice to bear on that situation. So I want to I want to move to the third theme of what is the actual practice again. And again I think we should consider this to be training. It's a training that we as it were we come back here we debrief. We'll have a debriefing session in a little while we debrief about the difficult person and it's something that one could do with one's friends or conform a small group because it really can make a lot of our daily lives more into practice. And so when we were talking in the discussion last time I came to see that there's almost like a developmental sequence of doing this practice with difficult people. The starting point is really setting an intention. It might be the intention that I talked about like I'm going in to have this meeting I know this person is often difficult and I set an intention to bring my practice to the situation. You know we have to start with some kind of intention. Then I can notice with the experience and it may be that in the beginning of doing this work within 10 seconds we lose it. Depends on the degree of as it were the degree of difficulty of the difficult person. But often when we're the difficult person or situation our best intentions are good for a little while and then we kind of lose it. And then what a little while later we say well I think I was pretty reactive that time and that's part of the learning cycle. That's what we were exploring last time. That's part of the learning cycles because once we set the intention this way there's almost like a sequence of learning and it's fine if we lose it a lot of the time. I have to say that where I have felt myself learning with difficult people a lot of the times I just got lost. That's when the reactive patterns are powerful. So I think it's fine if we are doing this practice and we notice either late in the interaction or even afterwards or even whatever that evening or even hopefully not but in the middle of the night and you say oh my gosh. Does anyone wake up thinking about difficult people in the middle of the night? It's probably a favorite difficult middle of the night theme. And so then there's a sequence when we keep on doing the practice sometimes we start noticing in the middle of the interaction. Oh I'm being reactive. That is incredible sign of progress right. We can actually notice when we're in the interaction I'm being reactive and if we can then try to bring the same quality of mindfulness that we have on the cushion say okay what's actually happening in my mind. What's actually happening in my body. What's going on. What's the pattern here. And I think I recommended last time the the ancient meditation technique of taking a break in the middle of a difficult interaction particularly if you're in a public sphere going to the bathroom. This is an important technical what practice technique of because what we have to do is find some way to gain space in the middle of our reactivity and as they say use any means necessary. Bathroom breaks you know saying sorry I'm I have to attend to something or whatever but the idea is to find ways to gain some further presence with the situation and to come back and keep on coming back to mindfulness. So after a while we start being on the lookout for our patterns and we start being able to study them more closely. This may come with also watching the the react the form of reactivity when we're on the cushion because one of the things about difficult people is that they're difficult even when they're not present. They have this great power to actually influence when they could be miles and even thousands of miles away. It's pretty amazing and we can be sitting there stewing with the difficult person and they are you know whatever sitting on a beach in Florida or something. We're just having a difficult time. So we can study the reactivity patterns on the cushion. So after a while we start being very interested in the patterns of reactivity and we start seeing that there are some main patterns that we have with this difficult person. We start being interested in the whole sequence. What is the trigger? What's the stimulus? What happens to me with this particular stimulus? We start to be able to study it more closely both. On the cushion as it were and in more protected environments and then increasingly in the moments in the situation. The key one of the keys of this practice is being able to touch the pain that's present with a difficult person. And so I think it's also a mark as we do this practice more it becomes possible in the moment I'm having a difficult experience with this person and I can actually try to be aware of the pain there. And if it helps you to say to yourself, ouch, just to notice that there's pain there and to touch it because this is actually what's healing. This is actually what's transformative. So it's to see the patterns to touch the pain there and what that does is it gives some ability not to be driven by the pain because most of our reactivity is when we're driven by our reactions to something painful. To something difficult and as we start to study this more we start to have space around the pain even in the moment that we're interacting so that we can actually not be so driven by it not be so move by it. And as we progress we may be able to win we're with a difficult person in the moment know that you've been triggered watch the pattern know the pain and with that kind of space around it it's more and more possible to act in a responsive way. To act without just what I was calling passing on the pain. Or without just using one of our defense mechanisms which would be like to withdraw or to you know like I was saying last time my favorite defense mechanism is to withdraw and assume an air of moral superiority and judge the other person. Many of you may also have that as a favorite way to deal with difficult people it's a real one you know whether it's you know your boss your partner or the president of the United States you know so I just wanted to say one last thing before opening into discussion that even though I'm talking here very much about the inner work of difficult people I think that as we do this moment I think that we're going to have a very difficult time. And I think that as we move into the sphere of acting in a community or a group an organization or even the larger society I think that's what's called for in the situations and what's called for in terms of social change work is exactly what we're going to be doing. And it's exactly the same kind of work you know that you could interpret people like Gandhi and King as teaching about how to be with difficult people and trying to bring that to a larger sphere what this suggests to me is that there's something very very crucial in the ability of people to do this inner work and also act at the same time. In fact I think for me this is a new a newly emerging paradigm of activism because so much of what we find among activists is just reactivity for the right cause and one could question whether that just keeps the cycles going. Whether it just keeps that passing on the pain with the feeling of there being justice served and it's a complicated topic and I want to say that and not to say that everything can be summarized in that quick analysis but I think that there's something very important about learning in our own laboratory with everyday difficult people and then bringing that outward into larger community issues. And then into the larger society and that's really I think one way to understand our practice that we have first the laboratory of our individual practice just with ourselves as we mature in our practice we can bring that mindfulness and that wisdom and the compassion to our everyday interactions and as we so do I think then we can bring it into the larger and more complex spheres of our life working with other people who are inspired in that way. And so I think that this this practice of working with difficult people is the most important practice that could be connected with social change and really affecting the pain of the world the pain of the society. And so I invite that perspective for you to see really what it does is it connects the different parts of our lives. It says that my individual practice is not disconnected from the way I am with my friends my family my workmates and that's not disconnected from my participation in larger society. We bring those different dimensions together and we use ourselves as a laboratory to learn because I think it's basically about working with reactivity and learning how not to pass on the pain but in whatever sphere we're working in to respond with the best wisdom and compassion we have. So I'll stop there and open it up to our discussion. Thank you very much. Thank you please. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah well thank thank you so much for bringing that up and I think I imagine that most most of the people could identify a lot with your questions so so thank you for that. And I want to remind us that I said from my own experience I had to practice with my boss before I moved to my family that family are some of the most charged situations I remember I remember Ram Dass once saying that sometimes he felt as if you know with people know who Ram Dass is you know the he said even with whatever 30 or 40 years of spiritual experience. Sometimes it felt like it went out the window with his relatives. So I just want to remember that this is some of the most charged material. But yes I think that it's first of all think of it as a practice. So think of it as something that you're not always going to get it right you're going to experiment it's something to learn about but but definitely yes it seems to often be very appropriate to set boundaries or limits. You know into I know that that's often been important for me sometimes in terms of how long do I visit you know and to be wise about that do I visit for three days do I visit for seven days I know that at a certain everyone has a tipping point. Right. And you have to know what that is and I think it's very you know now if you have a conflict with your partner let's say who about what the limit should be that's another issue. But yeah it seems what we're looking for are ways to bring more awareness to what's happening in an inner way. So it's great to do meditation practice and we're looking the place where we can do this work is where we're not overwhelmed where it's somewhat workable. And what I'm hearing from your situation is that it's often the case that it doesn't sound that workable it's just overwhelming and it's just too hard right. And so yeah too close yeah. And so I think it is helpful as much as it's possible sometimes it's not possible but as much as it's possible it does sound wise. Basically it's giving it's saying I can't really practice unless the conditions are a little bit better. In other words I can't it's not really workable until unless I have a little more space. Otherwise I feel overwhelmed or suffocated or whatever metaphor you use. And so I think it could be very very wise to set boundaries because it doesn't do again you're not the only person involved so I'm sure it's more complex. But it can be very wise to set those boundaries because it's not doing any of you any good for you to be reactive. Does it help some? It's a start. Yeah. Please. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well both. Yeah the question is what when I'm referring to touching the pain as part of the practice of being with difficult people. Does that refer to my own pain and if so does it mean just feeling it or naming it also does it refer to sort of feeling it. Feeling the pain of the other. Does that capture most of it. Yeah. Primarily it refers as I'm talking about it to working with one's own experience and learning how to because it's looking at our own reactivity and the reactivity as we study it more we can see that it actually. It comes out of pain that is. That we don't that we often don't feel with mindfulness or awareness often we don't even know it's there. You know if you think of some kinds of reactivity where someone like one example simple one would just be where someone says something mean to us and we just say something mean right back right away when we actually study that there's actually a moment that's that's actually painful but we're hardly aware of it. We're just we're just using our defense mechanisms because we sense that someone's getting close to a painful area. And so it's very valuable to be able to touch what's painful like in the examples that I gave when when a person in authority did not listen to me. I would just start being reactive but when they actually inquired into the pattern I could find that there was some pain and so a lot of what this is about is that there's unacknowledged pain. With a lot of these situations and we don't actually feel it and my own experience I think this is also more or less the. Theory as it were behind a lot of psychotherapy as well as a lot of social change work is that when we actually touch the pain. We stop being so reactive it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt anymore but there's there's. There's a way that when we can actually touch it and feel it we can we can work with it and often a lot of healing can occur actually we can actually because there's this practice. The principle of healing is that an open nonjudgmental awareness of what's painful actually has tremendous healing potential. That's the principle we work with in all of our practice and so yes naming it is very important feeling it is more important directly experiencing it and again this practice works by kind of repetition of doing it over and over again. It's not just once it's not even just five times it may be a hundred times five hundred times and that starts to that starts to shift and it starts to it also when we can be aware of it we can again we stop being quite so automatic. So someone says something to me and I'm tuned into that it's painful. I suddenly have some space and I don't have to just say something nasty right back I can actually ask myself this is painful what should I do. This is painful what's the wise and compassionate response I think that as one does this and as one touches one's own pain in relation to reactivity my experiences that I actually tune into the pain of others. As the basis for their own reactivity it's pretty interesting that my own my own experience particularly over a period of time I did a lot of practice with judgmental tendencies and I just watched my own tendency to be judgmental like five thousand ten thousand times over several years. I recommend it. I recommend it and this is this is what this practice about again this is if you want something quicker there's something down the street probably that's quicker and more expensive. But what I found is that when I did this practice and I touched into how when I was being judgmental I was almost always following something that was painful I started to tune in to the pain. From judgmental people in relation to me which was amazing I for a long time I wanted to be around judgmental people because I could really there's something empathic going on and I could you know some of you may may have that experience sometimes if you're really tuned into your own. Suffering it can be very empathic and no because so many people when they're being reactive to us they're coming out of pain right they are and we don't we get hooked by it right that's the dynamic we get hooked by their coming out of pain. And it looks into our pain and as it were the race is on right kind of like two organisms each with pain doing this dance that leads to more pain and when one person. Works through the reactivity the dance can't go on in the same way. That doesn't mean you don't get aggression it doesn't go on the same way we talked last time about how actually it's very hard to keep being aggressive towards someone if the other person doesn't react back. And things can happen but we also can be empathic towards that person which is very very interesting it's a I think this is this is compassion. And we can actually start tuning into how the other person's reactivity comes out of pain we can experience that in a direct way when we practice enough like this. Please. Yeah. Yeah we I think we explored that question like that a little bit less and everyone here the question but but but not in the quite in the same way. Have I ever found that what was it that we're open to attitude towards them is helped them to be. Yeah that my open attitude has helped the whatever reactive or aggressive person to shift definitely because it's like what like I was saying what we start to learn is that these relationships of reactivity depend on both people being reactive. That it's very hard to for one person I mean there are masochistic people you know but generally most people need the neutral reactivity to keep their own reactivity going. It's interesting isn't it. I think this applies to communities and even nations you know if you if you want to take it that far that the Palestinians require the Israelis to keep going. You know that's why it's a system you see it's a system and when one starts dismantling the system you know in an interpersonal way it's the system of reactivity when you start dismantling that the whole system can't keep on going in the same way. And so yes I have found personally that when I in some ways work through my own reactivity that the other person sometimes. Reverts to good behavior. So I mean so not always immediately. But yeah it's possible that it's something I mean I think you can understand the concept right and you can study it in yourself but it's definitely it's it's very it's very interesting. Please you know maybe these will be the last two and if you could be a little brief because we're getting about time. Okay. Yeah. More successful in terms of this this of interactions. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see the. Generally. Mindfulness practice serves to make us familiar with the patterns of our reactivity. And so any practice so so I think the some actual techniques that can be helpful maybe this is more what you're asking would be to actually try to give some precision to the labeling and the noting. Of your thought patterns particularly the patterns of your reactivity. So one can sometimes be very general with meditation I'm meditating here I have a long discussion kind of semi argument with my boss you know and I just say thinking and then go back to my breath. Well that's one technique but if you actually start to identify it and start to say OK and call it whatever. Discussion with boss give it a label and then when it keeps coming try to study it and give it some precision and try to actually look and see what's happening. You know and if it goes on for a while and it's a strong feeling you can use the technique of trying to see. What's it feel like in the body. What does it even feel like in the heart that one of the things that's useful to do with repetitive thought patterns that happen a lot is to actually check into the bodily and the emotional dimension in your daily practice in your in your sitting practice. We sometimes call this the practice of dropping down because there's going to be a lot of the reactive patterns we have which will manifest in repetitive. Thought patterns are actually being driven by some unacknowledged pain and sometimes if we can be in the heart and actually feel just listen for what that is you know I suppose I've just had I've just spent 10 minutes having. You know rehearsing a dialogue that's kind of unpleasant with my boss OK I've just done that can I then say OK what's there. What's there and this takes some it's not a matter of figuring out or analyzing but actually listening what's actually there what's actually there in my heart. And that kind of practice can can actually lead sometimes to some recognition you can actually feel oh. I feel angry I don't like being treated like that or I feel sad I wish it were different. And that can those can start to give bring some light to the pattern which may be formally was just God I'm reactive and that's it you start to bring some precision to it you can see oh. There is sadness there's anger here's what I do when there's sadness or anger I go in this way and so forth and you start to actually see the pattern more clearly. So that's one thing another practice would be the loving kindness practice is kind of an antidote. And I think it's very good to compliment the mindfulness practice for the loving kindness practice both for ourself and for the other person and works in a little bit different way. Mostly what I've been describing is the insight practice of seeing our patterns clearly and that and that permitting wise and compassionate action. One of the things that can sort of serve a little bit like a time out is to actually forget about the patterns and just do some metta some loving kindness for ourself and the other person in certain situations that is exactly what's called for. So if you feel like you're getting really really stuck with the trying to see the pattern do loving kindness practice. You know and that could even extend to one thing I've sometimes done is give gifts to people with whom I have difficult relationships. That it's kind of cuts through certain things so those are a few practices to work with. You're welcome. Maybe the last one if we could be brief. Yeah I wasn't so brief. Yeah. And I remember just kind of looking at her and breathing in her this kind of burden saying you know there's millions of her out there that are feeling that same thing. It's a form of practice as well. Talking about. Yeah. And. After a while. And to complement that by looking at that judgmental quality in yourself right to complement it with that. So because. It's nice to give people the room to be themselves and yoga classes. And. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. That's right. So ideally. Your own you know working both with your judgments takes you in it's kind of like what I was describing before it can take you in where you actually feel. Your pain. Maybe your past pain. And it evokes some compassion for what least you imagine to be her present pain. So. Although it's tricky to think that one really knows what's there. So just be a little cautious with that. But but generally it sounds the loving kindness or that sounds like a great complement with the practice for on your own self. Well. I could stay here for quite a while and talk about difficult people but. For some of you who need to leave that would make me a difficult person for you. So I think what I'd like to do is just to finish with the 30 seconds or a minute of. Sitting and then I'll stay here a little while if anyone wants to talk further. I'm sorry I had this wonderful story to tell you that took five minutes and I have to do it another time. So. Just to be present to. What may have touched you. From the sitting. Or the talk or discussion. And to to invite if there are any intentions for your own. Practice your experience. There may be something that sort of surfaces as a question. How can I work with this or what's that about. You might have the intention just to explore this more deeply. So letting any intentions for the next. Period of time. The presence. If you want to bring this more into practice in your life also saying how am I going to do this what's going to support me. How might I how might I bring this practice more into my experience perhaps by. Setting intentions in the morning or before meeting with people who are difficult. And so let us finish just by remembering as should be really clear from this theme that we practice not just for ourselves but for others. May our work or practice our lives our action in the world. They had served. For the benefit of all for the awakening and healing and freedom of all. Thank you very much. I look forward to my next time here.
