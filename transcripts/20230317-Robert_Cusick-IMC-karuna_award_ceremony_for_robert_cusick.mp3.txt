 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Come on in. We still have several seats. Okay, so I think we'll go ahead and get started. My name is Kim Allen, and I'm a long-time IMC practitioner, sometime teacher, and it's just a long-time friend of Robert, the reason for our gathering today. And I want to welcome everyone to one of our first kind of celebratory events since the pandemic. I felt like as we came in, it really just felt like an excuse for a chance to have some food together and celebrate and come together in a celebration of our Sangha, really. First time we've done it in a while, and it feels very special, and we were blessed with wonderful weather. It didn't have to be as beautiful and sunny and warm as we're having it today, so we can be grateful for that also. It's nice to see so many familiar faces and some new ones also. So welcome. Welcome to everyone. So we're gathered tonight for the Karuna Award, as it's called, and it's not a very common event that we do here. This is actually only the third one that's been given since 2009, when the first one was given. I don't know why that is. There's no particular reason for that, but they seem to come about naturally at times, and this one feels especially wonderful. Robert's contributions to this community, and we'll hear more about the width and breadth with which his work has spread as the evening goes on. And as I'm looking at you here, Robert, I'm reminded that when you were ordained as a monk, your Dharma name was Sunyata, which means emptiness. And I think we're here tonight for the other side of that, which is fullness and compassion, which come forth as the heart becomes emptier of its self-concerns. It becomes able to connect and spread out farther into the world. And of course, one of the main insights that comes with understanding the Dharma is the interconnection of everything. So yes, we're celebrating Robert, but there's so much compassion that happens here at IMC. It comes about through all the people that we have here, and so many streams coming together so that they can spread out farther into the world. So I also want to thank you, Robert, for really just being our excuse to celebrate massive amounts of compassion happening everywhere and that you came forth as the kind of the exemplar of that for us. So thank you for that. So we'll have a few people say some things and then, you know, about Robert and his work and then the award and then there will be an opportunity for others to share their thoughts. So this is really a communal event. So please, I'll turn it over to David and Fiona. So all I have to do is look at Robert to be inspired. Everybody loves Robert. I think I remember a story that he told me once that when he was a fledgling, he was practicing in Burma and there was an abbot of his own monastery practicing there. And he just looked at Robert and he said, you're a bodhisattva. And indeed he is a bodhisattva, just his being is a bodhisattva being. I feel that in his in your presence. I always feel that I'm in safe hands. You're a refuge for me and a refuge for, I think, many, many people. And Fiona and I are especially moved that Robert is so involved with his program, this magnificent program he's doing that you'll hear more about later. And he's just, you know, busy, busy, busy from from morning until late at night and into the weekends. And that he takes a time off between meetings. He volunteers to help his true people, the senior sangha, his true home is. So he's working all day long, every day with younger people, I'm assuming, people that are really active in the world and making their way in the world, professionals, a lot of doctors and people in the medical profession. And then he comes to help this somewhat in a way, maybe somewhat marginalized group of people, seniors, and he shows up and he loves them and they love him. And he makes them feel validated and important and loved. I remember one meeting where Robert was talking and he was, he said, Oh, I'm talking too much. And immediately someone piped up from the crowd. Robert, you could never talk too much. I could listen to you all day long. And someone else piped up. Don't stop talking, Robert. We can just listen to you because he just exudes this, this kindness and this warmth and presence and validation. I should say that he also teaches. He's not just exuding his mention, mention this to everyone. He teaches. He brings his great wisdom about the geography of suffering and the geography of the connection between suffering and compassion. And he advises all of us who suffer to linger with your suffering, to feel your suffering, to be with it and compassion naturally arises. And he says that with such confidence and such care and such allowing. So we're grateful to you. You're a great gift to the senior Sangha. Thank you. I just would say you're relaxed presence and just entering in and offering so much, much gratitude for that. And I also, beyond the teaching, I just would share personally, it was maybe a week after I lost my partner and I'm bumped into Robert at Trader Joe's. And he asked, how are you? And I shared what had just transpired in my own life. And it was just this natural response of compassion so open. And I, this is Robert and I just want to share that. It's not just on the teacher's stand. It's in life. Thank you. Monica. So it's a delight to be here. Thank you very much to everyone at IMC for inviting the ACT family to come here as well and celebrate our beloved Robert. So my name is Monica Hansen. I'm one of the co-founders and directors of the Applied Compassion Training Program at Stanford in the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education. And I'm pointing in this direction because Dr. Dodi, who's the founder of Seacare and will speak probably later, is here as well. And with Robert and our beloved colleague and friend Nilama, the three of us are the co-founders of ACT. And I'd like to share three reflections with you tonight about Robert. The first one starts all the way back at Spirit Rock. You're familiar with this story. It was a family retreat week at Spirit Rock. And my son now is 6'2 and 20 years old. But at family retreat, he was eight and maybe about this tall. And my son is more of an observer than someone that went jump in and engaged. So I was a little surprised when he signed up to either help in the kitchen as a volunteer during family week or it was adjacent to the kitchen. I'm not sure which one. But what I got to observe is this distinguished gentleman in a very calm, kind manner that was competent and clear, helping this eight-year-old understand his role and how to perform that role amidst the mayhem of the Spirit Rock kitchen during family week. Which it was exhilarating and there was a lot of mayhem. And I saw this interaction happen more than one time. And it left an impression on me that I can remember to this day more of a visceral impression like might the world be like that? Might the world be where this person not knowing this person but communicates in such a clear, kind, competent way. Might the world just be like that? So I walked away with many impressions from family retreat, but that was one of them. So that's one impression that I wanted to share, reflection. And I'll link it to Robert. A couple of years later, Robert and I met at Stanford through Seacare. We were both engaged in Seacare's programs. And the first, maybe the first time or the second time, I officially met Robert through the course of our conversations. I actually recognized that he was the distinguished gentleman that had been interacting with my son. And maybe all of you already had figured that out in the story. That could be true. But I had not figured that out. And so such a tender, warm place in my heart for seeing Robert before I even knew, as his name's tag says tonight, he's the Robert. Even before I knew that, he was embodying compassion and action during the family retreat at Spirit Rock. So that's one reflection that I wanted to share with you. Now we're at Stanford together. And then this is the second reflection. So I did some math. As you may know, at Stanford, Robert's taught an eight-week compassion course for a lot of years. He's led compassion immersions for groups of people with himself as the facilitator and leader. He's co-taught with me. He's co-taught with Nulama. I'm sure he's co-taught with others. I did some math. I think you might have taught 2,700 people in those formats. Does that seem low? It could be low, actually. The first time I did it, I think it was over 3,000. But I was like, wow, that seemsâ€”but it could be over 3,000 connections like that. And what I wanted to share about those initial years through Stanford is that Robert shares the fruits of his practice. And particularly in those first few years that I knew you through Stanford, I recognized or actually heard you describe a deepening in self-compassion. That there was a moment where self-compassion arose up, and you were deepening in that. And what's so important about that is whether it's 2,500 or 2,700 or 3,000 or more students that Robert's connected with is regularly and often, I also hear those students sharing back in reflection with Robert that they themselves are deepening in their own compassion, right? Through the transmission of his teachings, through the fruits of his practice, that they too are deepening in their own compassion. And this just happened a couple of weeks ago. We were in a conversation on a new project we're engaged in with compassion and leaders. And out of the blue, one of Robert's students that we're speaking with, who's a leader at a very well-regarded technology company here in the Bay Area, pointed out that Robert and his teachings had helped this gentleman awaken to their own compassion. So the second reflection is about how generously and wisely you share the fruits of your practice with others and it transforms hearts and lives. And then lastly, this remarkable program that we have called the Applied Compassion Training. It's an 11-month program. It attracts people from all over the world. We have about 400 graduates now in the last four years from 40 different countries. And not only is it an applied compassion program for personal transformation, what makes it novel and unique is that we actually require people to go out and take action. They have to move out into the world through a capstone project to make a difference in the world. And what I'd like to say about this remarkable program is it's come to be through enduring friendships and enduring relationships. And I'd like to name two of those enduring relationships. One is with Robert and Dr. Dodi. And Dr. Dodi, I'm going to say the quote because you'll have to maybe come up with another one when you speak. But what I wanted to do is read the quote when I reached out to Dr. Dodi to have a for him to share some reflections on Robert. This is the quote that he sent back. Robert from Dr. Dodi, a true bodhisattva, a true bodhisattva who I admire deeply. And from our other colleague, Nilama, Nilama Ayers, who couldn't be here tonight. She is in a silent retreat. And she, she longs to be here. So I wanted to make sure that her words were shared to and her presence was shared. And Robert and Nilama have known each other for decades. Dear friends, spiritual partners, spiritual brother and sister, and also collaborators with me in this Applied Compassion Training Program. Nilama's quote, and you can hear this in Nii's voice. Congratulations, Robert. I cannot think of anyone better than you in all caps to receive this award. You are a remarkable human being and a masterful teacher who not only embodies, but also transmits compassion to everyone you meet. I am genuinely blessed to call you a spiritual brother, beloved friend, and partner in applied compassion. May you receive and absorb all of the goodwill that you've generated coming back to you immensely today. I love you, Nii. I know. And then lastly, on behalf of all of the ACT community, I'd like to end with some familiar blessings. So our dear Robert, may you and all beings be happy. May you and all beings be healthy. May you and all beings be freed from suffering and the roots of suffering. And may you and all beings know and enduring peace and joy. May that be so right now. Thank you so much, my beloved spiritual brother and dear friend. We are on a wild ride together. And may you continue to allow your teachings to be transmitted all over the world. Thank you. You're welcome. See who's next. Gil. Kim. Gil? Excellent. Thank you. So I stand here proud of you. That you would come through our scene and somehow flower in such a beautiful way. And that that flowering should go out into the world. That's a dream come true for me. I want everyone who comes through IMC to go out and benefit the world the way you have. And so it's fantastic. And I might be, it's possible, am I the person who has known you the longest who's here in this room? Maybe 20, 25 years or so. And I was very touched when I first met Robert because he was suffering a lot. And but he had, he told me a little bit of his story. And he's one of the few people I know who had met the Zen teacher in service, this guy named Suzuki Roshi. And he died, Suzuki Roshi died in 1971. And so I guess you were relatively young. And what you showed to me was that you had this call to a spiritual life that then you didn't follow for many decades. And that you came to see me suffering. And somehow through the how, cause and conditions, you turned your life around dramatically. And now you're involved in, you know, for better or for worse in this massive pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme for joy. And I hope that as you think back at your Dharma life and how you've been changed and all the goodness that flowed into you and through you and then out of you. And then to have been involved with bringing compassion to so many people, these 2700 people, who have they benefited? And who have those people benefited? That's where the pyramid scheme is. And so if you could, you're always tap into that joy, tap into that beauty and that wonderfulness that you have set loose into this world. And now you've done a fantastic thing and and keep practicing. So you get a gold framed certificate. And I don't think that's the most important part. So the Karuna Award to Robert Cusick. IMC recognizes Robert Cusick and applied compassion training with the Karuna Award for supporting hundreds and thousands of people worldwide to develop and enact compassion projects in their workplaces, organizations and communities. This compassion then ripples out even further, bringing incalculable benefit. With much gratitude, we celebrate the fruits of Robert's work, which emerged from the liberation in his heart. May we all discover and grow the seeds of compassion. Oh, God. So, so for a guy who makes his living by talking, I'm finding it hard to come up with with some words. It's a lot to hold. But I am so deeply, deeply touched and grateful to receive this award. Thank you so much. And when Kim notified me a few months ago that that this was going to happen, I was so stunned that I guess I didn't. I didn't really register. And I have to say that getting this award doesn't feel very personal. I'm not really feeling it in a personal kind of way because I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Gil, who put me on the path and was my patient teacher. Still is for years and years and years. And we wouldn't have ACT if it wasn't for Dr. Dodi and thousands and thousands of people that have been affected by the work that you've done as well. So in a way, I feel like I'm just paying. Is that right? Paying it forward, playing it for paying it forward. I'm just just passing it on. But the one thing that has sustained me through through, you know, the ups and downs of my personal life, my personal suffering, trying to run a program, develop a program, keep the program going, you know, is in fact the longing that you mentioned. It's the thing that is an anchor for me. When all else seems hopeless, that is still there, that longing. You can fill in the plank, but it is what keeps it going. And so in a way, it seems like a movement of compassion, a movement of self-compassion maybe in that way, but also certainly a movement of compassion. And Monica was talking about the numbers. And that's one of the things that I thought about when I thought about the possibility of a program like the Applied Compassion Training. I taught it for I taught the CCT protocol at Stanford for many years. And I would teach every quarter and I could teach 30 people a quarter unless I taught on multiple nights. But let's say I taught two courses a week so I could teach 60 people a quarter and I added those numbers up and then I wonder what would happen if we could teach people then to go out and then teach people. So as an example, in our program we had a hospital network in South Africa send us 10 students for the last two years. And those 10 students did 10 different specific and unique projects and they came from physicians, nurses, pharmacists, medical academics, human resources, all of the different departments and then they went back and then into the hospital and then they hand-picked the next 10 to come. They came and went through their program last year and they have now those 20 people have now reached more than 20,000 people in that network. And the nurses union has given a shout out to the system saying that this is the first time that they've gotten positive feedback from the nurses saying the course that they were given are the program because they went back and they created their own programs designed specifically for those environments. That this is the first time they had a course that they had to take that made a difference in their professional life as well as in their personal life. And to give you an example, this was at the height of the pandemic and they were having a really rough ride in South Africa and the hospital workers, they wouldn't pick them up at the bus stops because they were afraid. That they would be bringing the infection to them so they were like ostracized outside of work. They were on the front lines. They were exhausted. They were burned out. They were getting terrible patient scores. And so this is just part of the way that we see that we see that we might think that we're we're operating in a very small way or alone or something. We just don't know what could happen. How you could touch someone and that could awaken the possibility for them to to take a new go down a new tangent in life, which is exactly what happened to me when I met Gil. See, I remember talking to you in the early same I said, how do you get a teacher? And he said, well, you have to ask. And then he handed me his card. So the next day I was at San Hospice Roy as the director of the Zen Hospice Project. I was at the Zen Hospice and I called Gil up and said, can I come and see you? And that was it. I went and saw him and he said, did you ever think that you're working too hard? Maybe you should become a Dharma bomb. The next thing I knew I'd quit my job and I was on my way to Asia. So so it's been an interesting journey. And all along the way, I've met beautiful people who've supported me and and been patient with me and have loved me and I've loved them. And I look around the room and I see so many people who I care for deeply and personally, and it's just an honor to be to be. You know, sorry. Did you ever see a grown man cry in front of a group? Anyway, I'm very touched and I'm very thankful. And I also want to give a shout out to my my teacher Michael as well, who's worked with me and and guided me through many, many different places that I had never been before. Never expected to go. So, so thank you all. And in a special thanks to Kim and to everybody who was part of organizing this and where's my friend David and Fiona, who I work with in the senior Sangha. Yeah. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And may you all go out in the world and share your compassion with wild abandon, the world needs you more, more than ever. So, thank you. Robert was talking about seeing a grown man cry but oftentimes I'm the epitome of that so I apologize. It's interesting what happens to people when they live this life. People are often presented with suffering, and they can take two paths. The one path is that they get filled with anger and hostility, and that ends up dictating their actions in this world. And frankly, that's an easy path. The hardest path is to be able to embrace your suffering and sit with your suffering and recognize that everyone is suffering and that they deserve to be liberated from their suffering. And then when you embrace that, that is taking you on your path to be a bodhisattva. And that's the path that Robert has taken. And as Monica stole my quote, it's one of which I admire deeply. As Ty says, you cannot have the lotus without the mud. And frankly, all of us are covered in mud. But it's accepting that reality, that inescapable reality, and still doing everything in your power to support the lotus and your own blossoming. But that blossoming can only come about by being of service to others. And in many ways, that's what we're talking about with this community and all intentional communities whose goal is to promote the Dharma. And it's not an easy path. Oftentimes, it's a painful path. Oftentimes, you will have experiences that will even make you question your path. But as we see from Robert's example, and I think almost everyone in this room, it is a worthy journey to embark upon. Because, well, on some level, it's selfish. Because there's no question that when you're of service, when you're sharing, when you're embracing the other and alleviating their suffering, you were receiving benefit. But that being said, you were given a gift that is so needed and can change someone's life. And oftentimes, people take for granted. We talk about the Dharma and the Sangha, but it can be simple. It can be holding someone's hand. It can be opening a door. It can be giving a smile. And it's when you embrace this gift you have within yourself and your every action is dictated by that belief that you can help another. That's when you really are bodhisattva. And that's really what I admire about Robert. I've spent a great deal of time with him. Sometimes I'm pissed off at him. But I'm just kidding. Of course, who could ever be mad at Robert? Sometimes you can't be. But this path that he supported of my own has really been profound. And I'm thankful to say that with the efforts of Robert and Nilama and Monica and others in our own little Sangha, if you will, we've really changed the lives of thousands and thousands of people. And it's really such a privilege. But it just goes to show that each and every one of us has that flame within us that we can light a thousand candles without diminishing our own light. So thank you. My wife informs me. I left my mask. So now it's actually an opportunity for others to offer words of celebration or gratitude or memories or anything else. And that's the end of the formal part. So we can just continue. And as long as the energy seems good to anyone would like to say anything. Great. Thank you, Nikki. So I cannot let the opportunity go by and not say something to celebrate and honor Robert. So so many things I can say, but to keep it short, as Gil shared how Robert went to Asia and practice in Asia and this sense of and this desire, this this this beautiful desire for awakening, for for cultivating his his heart and mind. So I want to add some more to the to the ways that his his desire for awakening has actually supported others. So we've heard about act. We've heard about the the the senior Sangha. And another thing that actually Robert has been instrumental in in the West is is bringing Paul, Oxide, who's a venerable teacher, Eastern teacher. If it wasn't for Robert going to his monastery and practicing with him and basically making a lot of connections, etc. He would have never come to the West to teach Western to teach in the West, etc. So so similar to you, I met Robert about 20 years ago when I was sitting at Spirit Rock, this kind person in the office. And then about 15 years ago, I was sitting with him. I was sitting at three month retreat at the Forest Refuge with this dedicated practitioner who was just sitting. And then later, we became friends after sitting this three month retreat that we were both sitting with Park Saira, who had just come from from Burma to teach in the West. And then I learned that, oh, this is that Robert who's been instrumental in bringing this person who then was instrumental in changing my life, Park Saira. So if it wasn't for Robert, my life wouldn't have been changed and many other people's lives wouldn't have been changed. So thank you for your dedication to the Dharma to have brought this other to have been instrumental in bringing this other aspect of this, this gift, this beautiful gift of of of the Dharma into the West. So I just wanted to bring that in because I feel that is such an important gift for so many people that I know who've practiced in that tradition in the West with Park Saira. And again, Robert has been instrumental instrumental in bringing him. So besides that, I just want to say you're a dear friend. You're amazing. I love you. You are the paragon of compassion. Every time we get together, I love the say that I love the way you say, hey, darling, how are you just the sense of sweet, you know, sweetness and knowing the way you sign your your emails big love. Oh, yes, it's just big love and people are the people are modding their heads. So it's just so beautiful to be on the receiving end of that, Robert. It's so, so beautiful to receive that from you and be your friend to be to have the privilege to call you this friend in this brief short time that we have together in this connection and in this brief flash of lightning that is our lives. So thank you for being you. So I'm L.A. Alvarez. I'm an emergency physician at Stanford and I actually tried to meet Robert for a long time now because I've heard a lot about CCT and a dear friend of mine, Mary on my cows. Dr. Makowski talked to me about CCT and taking this course from Robert and I've emailed him so many times before to try to connect and it was never working out for my schedule. And I don't think he even remembers answering those emails because apparently he has the Gmail accounts and the Stanford account that I was never sure which one he would read. And long story short, I am one of his students from the Applied Compassion Training because that was the one thing that I could make work for my schedule. And I'm so excited for that and grateful for that opportunity because I get to now thank you. It doesn't often happen that a student gets to stand here in front of everybody to really truly honor a teacher just like what you just did for Gil. So thank you for this opportunity. When I first met Robert, my role in my department was helping teach residents. And over that course of the year, I trained in the Bronx. I didn't really believe a lot about meditation and mindfulness. But Robert kept on reminding us about being present and slowing things down and allowing things to just understand and that compassion for myself, for our own self. And he was kind of modeling that in some ways. He's getting a lot of these recognition. And recently I heard about mirrors and windows. And instead of reflecting about all the accomplishments that he's done, he was talking about being a window to showing all of us like all the things that he was able to do. So I get to be part of that window from the other side as one of his students, only to say that as one of the first students for ACT and having taken this over the pandemic, the really beginning of the pandemic. Since then, I've still been practicing meditation. I was just sharing with Rettnish that my app tells me it's like 1100 days now as of today. And all of that is because of Robert's constant reminder of, you know, like there is a process of learning how to be more self aware and also to just allow things to happen. And I also just wanted to recognize the phrase that I've really appreciated, the creative serendipity of even though I've tried to reach out to him and connect to learn from him, it took a while to get there and yet when it did, a lot of things have happened because of your work, because of your work, because of your work, and because apparently your work taught him, I get to be where I am now where I get to influence my specialty. So a lot of my work now actually not just stays in at Stanford, I at the national level, I got to add compassion, self compassion in the objectives for the Society of Academic Emergency Medicine. Because in as much as we care a lot about suffering of our patients, over the course of our work, we also are suffering the vicarious trauma that we're experiencing and I attribute that a lot to ACT. And so now I'm the director of well being in my department, and I get to do a lot of work on being that essentially the physician that takes care of other physicians. And I hope you know that I'm just one of the many people that you've touched, the flower that has blue like blossom, the lily that then is passing on to other people, other physicians, other patients, the compassion that you've taught me, just like Maryam Mikowski taught me about compassion through you. So thank you. Oh, more students. See. So my name is Ratnesh, and I'm a lotus in blooming trying to become a lotus but six, eight years ago was six, six years ago, I lost both my parents within months of each other, and I went to hear. I think this was a Zen hospice presentation you were doing at Palo Alto that's the first time I met you. I was sitting in the first row with my friend Karen, and was just blown away with what he was sharing. And there was a calling, and I talked to Karen and I said, How do I get to do this work and that led me to CCT. And from CCT we spent two years together in compassion immersion. I've done everything video, right so CCT compassion immersion first class of a CT. And then I remember the call that Sue Schafer who was the director of car at that time, asked me, she said there's a big need for South Asian mental health therapists, focusing on grief loss and trauma. And I was in a tech, you know, very focused on left brain career at that point. Two weeks later, Robert and I spoke and I applied, and I'm at Santa Clara. But that's not what I want to talk about so that's he has changed my life. That's the key point. But a robot I want to talk about is the robot that I get to meet once a month for six years he's been sitting up there and I've been on my knees listening to him. But once a month, he sits in front of me and says, everything on this menu looks amazing. Talk to me about it. So I got Robert hooked on to Indian food and and the Uthapam and that those are and seriously those 10 minutes of me walking through the menu and sharing a meal together with Robert, not as my teacher, but as a friend. And, and, and splitting our food up, you know, you get that we'll split half a. Oh, I love it. And it's, it's such a blessing. And then finally one more thing is a small thing but it's very important. So I lost my parents and the only child. And I'm an orphan, but when Robert says, brother, he always called me brother. It really touches me in the core, and I feel I have a brother. So, for those words. Thank you, Robert. I've been hearing your voice all the time on the app. Robert, I wasn't planning on speaking but just so inspired by hearing all of these different stories from different dimensions of your life. I'm going to tell you a story I don't think you've heard, which is, I'm a chaplain at Stanford hospital. And a couple of years back, a few of us were having lunch on the nurses porch kind of squirreled away in the staff area. And I learned that two of my colleagues had entered chaplaincy, because they did CCT with you. Isn't that beautiful. We had this long conversation about compassion and compassion cultivation and the ways that it fueled their spiritual care. And if you can just imagine those two, plus me, from the influence of our spiritual friendship for so many years. How many patients, how many doctors, how many family members, just those people have touched. It's really inspiring. And I guess I can also just say, I think I met you very shortly after you got back from Burma. We were at our dear mutual departed friend Victor's house. And I remember noticing you immediately in that conversation on the back porch, talking about some kind of Dharma thing. And I don't think I had a sense in that moment that you would become one of my closest and dearest spiritual friend, spiritual siblings. So thank you for the inspiration that you've shown these years for the many, many beautiful spiritual conversations we've had. And you're unfailing support of not just me, but everyone you come in contact with. It's really beautiful. Love you, brother. I'll put my pocket because I'll forget it too. My name is Roy Rimmer and I don't know what to say, but I know I have to say something. I want to say something to you, Robert, and to be witnessed in that and to honor you on this day, since after all, here we are. So I feel like I'm in your home. I've not been to IMC before, so it's lovely to be here. And I feel like perhaps I bring this other piece of this vast, long history of yours. And I have such a clear memory of meeting you at the guesthouse and even standing in the entryway that's like stuck in my head. And it's such a strong impression. The image is so clear. And we really don't see that much of each other. We come together and then we go away for quite a while and then we come together. And these encounters are always so lovely with you. And I always feel your love and I feel your friendship. And I have so appreciated the way you have met me in these moments. And so when this invitation came into my email, and I'm not sure the last time we saw each other, but it was such a clear yes. I have to be here. I have to witness you in this honoring, in this ceremony, because it makes perfect sense to me. And I have had this impression of you. I've had a sense of the way you have impacted so many. And so to be here and to listen to these folks honoring you and learning a little bit more about you makes so much sense. And it is so inspiring. And it makes me so happy and so full of joy that when I am not in touch with you, just to know that you're out there doing this work. So, so may you take good care of yourself. May you live long. May you continue to do just simply what you do in the world. I want to say one more thing. And the other thing I love so much about you is you are a wonderful dresser. You have you have a wonderful style and fashion sense about you. And that is something that I've always so appreciated about you. Is that okay to say in this sort of setting? I'm not sure. But I have to I have to honor that piece too. So anyways, it's lovely to be here. And yeah, may we sit together again soon. And thank you all. Anyone else. Here we go. So, dear Robert. So it's what someone said it's nice to be in your temple here in your home. So thank you to the community for your hold down here. The Dharma. As I was sitting what I want to say is what came two things came one was, as he mentioned, I also coach him sometimes. And when someone is a teacher, you know, and the students often don't know there's a whole inner world to be a teacher. Now, usually we get the chocolate side as I call it. Usually, but as a spiritual teacher, any teacher, there is blood, sweat. There is emotional turmoil with each new program. Will it work? Will it be accepted? What do they think? The trial and error, sleepless nights, worries, the human mind, full action in all of us. And the students usually don't know that. That's why I want to name it for a moment. You carried within yourself to be a teacher and to stick your head out and to commit. And then the other part, what I personally love about you is your love of truth, which is what a personal process such an. This is the must for any teacher is our love of truth that keeps our ego in check. The love of truth that keeps us going on our path and our discipline. I deeply honor that in you. And then I was thinking, I'm a Buddhist, but I'm also a Hindu and a Christian too. But I feel the Hindu tradition coming in me. And so allow me the name of these thousands of students whose life you have touched. Do something what I do in India with the teacher. Thank you. We're going to have to do it together. So thank you for being here. Thank you for celebrating Robert because you're celebrating so much more. I think Robert himself would prefer that we're celebrating so much more than just what Robert has done and celebrate all of you and what you've done and what you've inspired in Robert and what Robert inspired in you and what you brought into the world. And that's what we want to keep doing. It would be nice if this event here did a little bit of good afterwards. Right. Or you want to say some more. You have a big vision. No, no, no, no, no. Just a little bit of good. May I do a lot of good. May we change the world. May we be compassion revolutionaries. May we kick butt. This is we're on a mission here. So yeah. I can't even begin to tell you how touched I am with this whole ceremony tonight. And how honored I am to to stand here with Gil and to to be in my home. So thank you. So there's a way that we end sometimes. You get a Cation of Merit and all that, but we just kind of did that. And but we say three times in Pali excellent. And and the word in Pali is sadhu. And we say it's sadhu, sadhu, sadhu. But the volume in which you do it is what counts. Because he's hard of hearing. So one, two, three. Sadhu, sadhu, sadhu. Thank you, Robert. Well, well done. Well done. Thank you all very much. I think there's cake and refreshments and hang out in the outer hall.
