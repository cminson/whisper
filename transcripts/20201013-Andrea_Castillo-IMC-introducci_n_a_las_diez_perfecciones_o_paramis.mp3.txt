The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
First, I have two announcements and that is that in January we are going to offer a course in IMC on diversity.
I would like the Latin language to participate even when the reading of the book that we are going to use is going to be in English,
that is, the people who participate must be bilingual.
But I think it would be very interesting to have the Latin presence when we are going to play the subject so difficult and delicate about what is diversity, what is prejudice, racism, etc.
The group will be guided by Andrea Fela and then there will be 10 teachers who we will have groups.
That is, it will be a combination of all the group three times in two months and each week with a group of eight people.
So I can send you a email at the end of November with the information because you have to sign up for that course.
And Jairo, at the end I want to talk to you because I tried to send you an email and it didn't work.
So remember me.
Very well, so now we start with the talk.
It is nice that you now had a direct experience with the guided meditation on these beautiful qualities that are called to me, that is, it means perfections.
Let's say in short that these ten noble qualities of the heart mind are qualities that we must perfect and when we perfect them we walk towards liberation.
There is a specific teaching in our tradition about this list that is called the Treatise of the Ten Paramise and it says in this treatise that a future Buddha is who watches and realizes these noble qualities.
Now listen to how it is that in this treatise it is defined what is a Paramise.
It says, the Paramise are noble qualities that are the result of compassion and means.
They are qualities that have not been contaminated by the longing or desire of the mind, vanity and the points of view.
Then we are going to take a specific example where we can delve into the meaning of this definition.
But to start I want to tell you a very nice myth that tells how these ten qualities were established for me.
Thousands and thousands of years ago a ascetic called Sumera lived.
It is said that it was one of the past lives of Siddhartha Gautama, that is, the Buddha.
Sumera lived dedicated to her spiritual practice in a cave.
She ate what she found in the field and it is said that she wore a habit made of tree bark.
She had a long hair to the rastafari.
And one day Sumera found out that a enlightened being was coming to the town.
Her name was Dipankara, which means the one who possesses light.
Sumera rushed down from her cave in the mountains and went to the town to meet this enlightened being.
The people were preparing offerings for Dipankara.
But Sumera, as an ascetic, had nothing to offer.
When she approached Dipankara, Sumera saw that the path had a lotus part.
She quickly threw herself on the floor and placed her long hair on the lotus
so that Dipankara would walk on it and not touch her feet.
Dipankara, looking at Sumera, recognized extraordinary qualities in him,
which would allow him to become a Buddha.
And he told her,
Sumera, in a future life you will be a Buddha.
Sumera felt so happy to hear this.
When she returned to her cave, she asked herself how to practice to advance on the path
and so, in a life in the future, to become a Buddha.
Sumera, as the myth says,
then created a list of 10 qualities
and concluded that to become a Buddha,
she should not only practice these qualities,
she had to perfect them.
This is then the story of how this list came about,
which is called the 10 Perfections.
You have already heard which are the 10 Perfections
during meditation.
I will give you the list briefly again,
generosity, virtue, renunciation, wisdom, energy or effort,
patience, sincerity, opacity, determination,
bondage and equanimity.
We can say that the cultivation of these qualities is a way
to beautify our mind and heart.
We all have these qualities in us,
but few people propose to cultivate them with the intention
of benefiting all beings.
And this is a specific quality of the Paramis.
Now, the Paramis, as the myth I told you about,
do not appear as part of the teachings
until after the death of the Buddha.
The term of Parami,
in addition to having the meaning of perfection,
is the meaning of priority.
If we have as a priority to accumulate money and goods,
very soon we will notice that no matter how much we want to manipulate,
control the external situations that benefit us,
we cannot do it.
But if our priority is to cultivate, for example,
these beautiful internal qualities,
there is the possibility of change,
because here it implies an internal change,
which is something that I can take to the end.
Now, the cultivation of the Paramis
brings us a type of happiness that is indelible,
that is, that there is sufficient for all.
It does not depend on limited resources,
therefore, it is not necessary to compete for goods with others.
I do not have to take anything from anyone to be happy.
These internal qualities are unlimited.
The more perfection these qualities,
the more I have to offer to others.
And this points to a very important aspect.
Many believe that this practice is all about the isolation,
to be sitting with the eyes closed, practicing, meditating.
A little bit like the idea of the ascetic,
of Sumerian, practicing in his cave, isolated.
If we need this time of solitude and introspection,
we need it to deepen.
But we do this to later take it to other people,
to share the fruits, to help us when we fall into conflicts with others,
to free ourselves from resentment.
Let us then see, for example, that the two Paramis first,
the generosity and virtue, are totally relational qualities,
that is, they express themselves in relation to others.
Generosity implies that I am going to give myself to others,
whether they are material or immaterial.
The immaterial, such as my time, my attention, my affection.
Virtue implies that my behavior,
as we saw in the guided meditation, is impeccable,
that it does not harm anyone.
And this becomes a gift that I offer to others.
Now what we are going to do is look at the 10 Paramis as a group,
through four perspectives.
It is interesting that in Dharma,
it teaches us to investigate in a very organized and systematic way,
and it presents four perspectives to contemplate different states of mind and heart.
Then I visualize them as a way of knowing something from different perspectives.
How would we then apply them to the Paramis?
The first perspective is called the characteristic,
that is, a prominent quality.
The prominent quality of these 10 Paramis
is to benefit others without exception.
The second perspective is its function or purpose.
And the purpose of the Paramis is to offer support to others without vacillation.
The third perspective is its manifestation,
or said in another way, how the Paramis are expressed.
They are expressed as the desire to be well-being and happiness for others.
And the fourth perspective is its next cause,
or said in another way, the most immediate reason
of which it depends on its existence.
What would be the most immediate reason
of which it depends on the existence of the Paramis?
Compassion.
With compassion,
the 10 qualities are naturally displayed.
Now let's see these four perspectives in a specific example,
in theory.
Because of the pandemic,
you know that in this country, even with the wealth we have,
there is so much unemployment
and so many people who are going through hunger.
Someone near here, where I live,
had a beautiful idea.
He placed in front of his house
a wooden furniture with doors
and he established a dinner table.
He placed a letter in front of it
that says, small dinner table for free.
And the people who need food
can take what they need.
In one of my walks,
when I found it,
he inspired me,
I was very happy to see
that someone had had this initiative.
So the characteristic here,
or prominent quality,
was definitely this person
wanting to benefit others.
The second perspective,
function or purpose,
definitely comes from the desire
to decrease the suffering
of this scarcity that exists for so many people.
The third perspective
of how it was expressed,
was expressed as a gesture
that reminds us of all our shared humanity
and invites us to connect
with this quality of generosity.
In my case,
he motivated me a few days later
to take food for dinner
because in one of my other walks
there was a person,
the two women who came,
opened the dinner and took,
respectfully, only a few things.
So I said, what a wonder,
this is working.
And for me it was very nice
to realize,
after having done this gesture
of taking two bags of food,
I felt happy,
happy to have done it.
And the last perspective,
or the next reason,
or the immediate reason,
is that the person who had this initiative
had the capacity to connect with compassion.
This feeling in our hearts,
how many people have lost their job
and are struggling to pay their rent
and buy food.
So now we see this example,
the same example,
with this quote that I read
at the beginning of the talk,
of how the parameters are defined
in the treaty.
So listen to the definition again
and then unpack it with this example.
The quote says that the parameters
are noble qualities
that are the result of compassion
and noble means
and that have not been contaminated
by the yearning or desire of the mind,
vanity and the points of view.
So let's see,
to start I think it is quite obvious
that this action has a noble quality,
I think there is no doubt for everyone
and that it is the result of compassion.
And according to what I was able to observe,
that it was carried out with noble means.
I mean, I doubt, for example,
that the food that this person put
on the dinner was, for example, stolen.
Because if that were the case,
then this gesture would be contaminated
and it would not be a for me.
Now, how would this gesture be?
How would it be if it was contaminated
by the desire of the mind or the yearning?
If in some way this gesture was motivated
by a strong desire in the world,
such as getting something
to satisfy a sensual desire,
then this gesture is contaminated
and it is not for me.
How would it be if this gesture
was contaminated by vanity?
Let's say this person who had the initiative
did it with the intention of presuming
with the neighbors,
then this gesture again is contaminated.
How would it be contaminated
by the points of view?
Let's say that if for this person
who made this gesture,
this gesture is converted in a way
of awakening criticism, hatred, resentment,
bad will towards people who do not think
like him or her,
then this initiative is created,
then again this initiative,
this gesture is contaminated.
Is it clear how I took this definition?
Is it clear?
Ok, perfect.
So,
I started the conversation with a story,
I want to finish the conversation with another story,
because this story is relevant,
because with the culture of the pyramids
it is about discovering,
and I put emphasis on the word discovering,
qualities in us,
that for many people
they have been covered and forgotten,
and we need to make the effort
to discover them and share them with everyone.
So listen to the story.
More than 300 years ago,
the Burmese army was about to attack Thailand.
Some monks in Thailand
had a huge Buddha of gold,
this statue had more than 10 feet of height
and weighed more than 2 tons.
Now it is considered a value
of approximately 200 million dollars.
The monks in Thailand were determined
to protect this relic of the Burmese army.
They knew that the army would not respect the relic
and less pay attention to its monetary value.
So the monks had a great idea.
They covered the Buddha with a thick layer of clay.
They were sure that the army would leave the statue
when they saw that it had no monetary value.
That's how it was.
But unfortunately,
all the monks were murdered in this invasion,
and so the Buddha of gold was kept secret.
Hundreds of years later, in 1957,
the Buddha of clay,
like many other monks in Thailand,
was going to be transferred to a new monastery
because they were going to make space
in that place for a new road.
And it turns out that when the Buddha tried to raise the Buddha,
the Buddha was much heavier than what they had calculated
and decided to wait for the next day
that they could bring another powerful crane.
That night, the avathe went out to check
if the Buddha had been well covered.
By lifting the lotus and pointing its inner self,
by illuminating the Buddha,
the monk saw that something was shining
through one of the cracks of the clay.
Then he approached and looked again.
And he realized that there was something very shining
under the clay.
The avathe went to bring a hammer and without a seal
and removed a piece of clay.
It was very dark when he discovered
that under the clay there was gold.
For a good part of the night,
he removed the thick layer of clay
until there was a majestic Buddha of gold,
Masiso, that was shining with a beautiful splendor.
This Buddha is now in Bangkok, in Thailand,
and every year millions of tourists visit
this magnificent work of art.
My hope is that some of them,
including the admiration of gold
and taking pictures,
stop for a moment to recap
the meaning of this story
that points to the potential
of our inner beauty and wealth in each one.
We all have these beautiful qualities.
They are the gold under the clay.
Our work is to shine the light of sati
or full attention
and with great patience and perseverance
to eliminate little by little the clay
that covers what we really are.
But it is also important in this story
to have and appreciate the monks
who lost their lives during the invasion
of the Burmese army.
These monks are part of the chain
of practitioners and teachers
who have dedicated their lives to cultivate
and share the Dharma,
passing the teachings
through the centuries
from one hand to another.
I honor the memory of these monks
and of these beautiful qualities
that each one of us make the effort
to cultivate these qualities
in each thought, word and action
as a gift for others
to be inoffensive
and all beings feel safe with us.
Let's close our eyes for a moment.
Let's take note of how this teaching was received.
Let's also take a moment to see
if there are any of these 10 for me
that have special resonance for us at this moment.
The last question I want to ask you
is a moment to consider
what would be a way
that I could express
some of these qualities
in these challenging times
and benefit others.
