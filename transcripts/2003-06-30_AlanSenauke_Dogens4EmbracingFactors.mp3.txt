 Thank you. It's really nice to be here with you this evening. I haven't been here for a while. I think last time I talked, I used to speak from over there. Is that right? Okay. And every time I come, things are a little more developed. I see some old faces and some new faces. It's really nice to see, it's just wonderful to see a community, a meditation community, just unfolding in a very natural way. You're really lucky to have this place and to have each other and to have Gil as a teacher. We're Dharma brothers. We're both disciples of Sojourn Mel Weitzman in a formal sense. Then of course we have so many other things that bring Dharma into our lives. We're also both parents, which is a whole other practice in itself. I thought I would speak today about a text that I've been working with and thinking about for a long time. It's a text from Dogen Zenji. Do you know about him at all? Dogen was a 13th century Zen master who brought Soto Zen, our school of Zen, from China to Japan. He was a pretty remarkable spirit. When he was a boy, his parents both died young and he went to a monastery to live, which was not so unusual. He would read the old texts and see where it said, when the Buddha was awakened, he said, now I am awakened with all beings. The teaching was also that everybody has or is Buddha nature. Each of us is already awake. He went to his teacher at Tendai school, one of the Pure Land schools, and said, if we're already awake, why do we have to practice? She said, that's a really good question. We think you should go practice Zen, because they didn't have the answer. He practiced Zen and he went to China in pursuit of it. There met his true teacher, Japanese goes by the name of Rujing, and brought the Chinese style of practice, and his understanding and a lot of Mahayana sutras and texts back with him to Japan, and founded some temples and monastery. In the Mahayana tradition, the example of practice is the Bodhisattva. There is a story of the first Zen master who settled in America, actually settled in California. He is a man by the name of Nyogin Senzaki. He had what he called the floating Zendo. Wherever he lived, he set up a Zendo. He lived in hotels mostly. He would have people come and do seated meditation, but he figured that westerners were not likely to sit cross-legged, which I could see in this room is about half true. Everybody sat in chairs. When he began a talk, he would address them, he would say, Good evening Bodhisattvas, which kind of took people back. Bodhisattvas, those are supposed to be exalted beings. He was acknowledging the very thing that Dogen was questioning when he went to his teacher. Dogen Sisaki was acknowledging the already enlightened nature, our true nature of who we are. Bodhisattva, the word, can be translated as enlightenment being for enlightened being or enlightening being. There is some ambiguity there. As an enlightening being, again in the Mahayana tradition, we take the vow, we have Bodhisattva vows and Bodhisattva precepts. The first Bodhisattva vow, and we say this at the end of every talk, at the end of every day of retreat, we recite these four vows. Beings are numberless. I vow to awaken with them or I vow to save them. Delusions are inexhaustible. I vow to end them. Dharma gates are boundless. I vow to enter them. In the Buddha's way is unsurpassable. I vow to become it. This is kind of a high standard. Especially that first one, beings are numberless. I vow to save them or awaken with them. Now those beings, they fill the room here right now. They also fill each of our minds. Each of us has many beings. In the course of the day, we go through many lives, many states of mind. We also carry with us our ancestors and our children and the future generations of ancestors. So we have to know how to work with beings. We need to liberate ourselves. My sense is that most Westerners, like most of the people here in this room, some of you may have been born into a Dharma family, but most of us come to a meditation practice because we are at a certain point, we tune into the fact that we are suffering. Sometimes we wrestle for many years to understand, well, how do I deal with this? How do I take care of this? Life is very hard. We can see, if we look around in the world, that the world is pretty hard. Some people think we are living in terrible times, which we are. But in fact, it's not really so different than it ever was. There always were wars. Each person always has to deal with loss in our lives and ultimately our own passing. Each of us has the gift of life, has the opportunity to experience one's awakened nature and to free oneself from the suffering and anxiety that we carry around like a big package all around in front of us like this. So a bodhisattva is a being who liberates self and others. And part of their path is to vow to postpone their ultimate liberation until all beings are free. It's a deeply, deeply altruistic way to live. And they live like that very naturally. And rather than freeing themselves, which they would have the option to do because their insight is so deep, freeing themselves from the cycle of birth and death, they keep coming back for our sake. To help beings. There's a wonderful text that describes some of what they do in the world. During the short eons of swords, they meditate on love, introducing to nonviolence hundreds of millions of living beings. In the middle of great battles, they remain impartial to both sides. For bodhisattvas of great strength delight in reconciliation of conflict. In order to help living beings, they voluntarily descend into the hells which are attached to all the inconceivable Buddha fields. So in each Buddha field, in each field of liberation or freedom, there's also a hell that you can fall into. If you cling too much, if you try to live there forever. And if you fall into this field, look around. Because there will be a bodhisattva at hand to help you rise from that place. So being bodhisattvas is a vast responsibility. And what are the tools that we have to fulfill it? So this essay, this fascicle that Dogen wrote, he wrote it for lay practitioners like ourselves in 1243. And he called it the Bodhisattva's Four Embracing Darmas. There's a good version in Kaz Tana Hashi's book, Moon and the Dew Drop, which is titled Bodhisattva's Four Methods of Guidance. And the text I'm working from here is one that I've been working on with Zen priest Chohaku Okamura translating. And very succinctly, it lays out techniques of skillful means and techniques of engagement and techniques of liberation. I like the name Four Embracing Darmas because there's something about the image of an embrace. When you embrace another, when we embrace each other, we're taking two and making it into one. One being one life encircling each other. So there's something really rich about that word. The other thing about this text, which is unusual for Dogen, because usually he's talking about meditation quite single-mindedly, is that this is his most social teaching. And in it, it discusses both literally and metaphorically language about relations between nations, between rulers and subjects within families. His own formulation actually has roots in the Pali tradition, where it was known as the four, the Sangaha Vatu, the foundations for social unity. So what are these four methods? I'd like to talk about them a little while and hopefully leave time for some discussion. The Four Embracing Darmas are offering or giving, Dhanā, which you've talked about a lot, right? There's been discussion of Dhanā. Kind speech, beneficial action, and identity action. So giving takes several forms. It takes the form of not being greedy. It takes the form of material help or material support. It takes the form of just giving the teachings, giving the Dharma to another, and it takes the form of fearlessness. So to quote from this text, giving or offering means not being greedy. Not to be greedy means not to covet. Not to covet commonly means not to flatter. Even if we rule the Four Continents, in order to offer teachings of the true way, we must simply and unfailingly not be greedy. It's like offering treasures we are about to discard to those we do not know. We give flowers blooming on distant mountains to the tathāgata, to the Buddha, and offer treasures accumulated in past lives to living beings. We offer ourselves to ourselves and we offer others to others. This is what we do in meditation, when we sit. Again and again we're offering ourself to ourself. We accept it and then it kind of slips away and then we renew that. Again and again offering ourselves to ourselves. And by sitting together in this room, sitting together in community, we're also offering others to others. We create a kind of zone of peace, a Buddha field in which each of us can offer ourself to ourself. And we can kindly accept that. When we offer a word, he says, even if we offer just one word or a verse of dharma, it will become a seed of goodness in this lifetime and other lives to come. If we give something humble, a penny or a stalk of grass, it will plant a root of goodness in this and other ages. Dharma can be a material treasure and a material treasure can be dharma. This depends entirely upon the givers, vow and wish. So the spirit with which we do this is important. When you give a gift, there's a wonderful book, I don't know if any of you know it by a scholar named Lewis Hyde. It's called The Gift actually. Let me read you something from it if I can find it. It's one of my favorite books. Here's a gift. On a simple level, material goods are just given. On a higher level, teaching is shared. On the highest level, there's just connection. The highest level of giving. The endless society of being. So in Lewis Hyde's book, he describes dinner in a cheap restaurant in the south of France. The patrons sit at a long communal table and each finds before his plate a modest bottle of wine. Before the meal begins, a man will pour his wine, not into his own glass, but into his neighbor's. And his neighbor will return the gesture, filling the man's empty glass. In an economic sense, nothing has happened. No one has more wine than he did to begin with. You could economically or energetically, it would be the same thing if you poured your own wine. Then he says, but society has appeared where there was none before. In another place, Hyde writes again about the gift, about giving, about Donna. I'd like to speak of gratitude as a labor undertaken by the soul to affect the transformation after a gift has been received. Between the time a gift comes to us and the time we pass it along, we suffer gratitude. Passing the gift along is the act of gratitude that finishes the labor. The transformation is not accomplished until we have the power to give the gift on our own terms. This is really bodhisattva action. If someone gives us a gift and we hold on to it, it's no longer a gift. It no longer has a life. It immediately, as we accept it, it's wonderful and makes us feel really good. But if we hold on to it, it's dead. If we pass it along to someone else, then that gift still has life. The same thing is true. This is true of the teachings. This is the practice. We have to accept it. We have to receive it from someone, from one another, from a teacher, from our children, from our parents. And then we keep it in circulation. This gift is always in circulation. Japanese choreography is the enso, the circle. We keep things circulating. That's what a bodhisattva does. That's the bodhisattva practice of Dhanana. I've gotten all this out of order here. The second embracing dharma is loving speech, kind speech. That means telling the truth in a way that leads to right action. It also means just speaking very gently. What Dogen writes is, loving speech means, first of all, to arouse compassionate mind when meeting with living beings and to offer caring and loving words. In general, we should not use any violent or harmful words. In society, there is a courtesy of asking others if they are well. In the Buddha way, we have the words, please treasure yourself. And we have a duty to ask our teachers, how are you? To speak with a mind that compassionately cares for living beings as if they were our own babies is loving speech. So loving speech includes this wonderful line, we should praise those with virtue and we should pity those without virtue. Which means we should speak to them the same way. We can speak to them in this spirit of complete generosity. So it goes back to giving. Giving is enough. Loving speech is an expression of that. And he ends this section by saying, and we should study how loving speech has power to transform the world. And we've seen this. We've seen this, you know, when I was here last time, I think I spoke about Martin Luther King and spoke from his words. We've seen people, we see his holiness the Dalai Lama. We see various other spiritual leaders whose loving words actually transform the world. And they transform the world in a way that is so much more effective and thorough going than the language of bombs and swords, which just scar the world. But this loving speech is not so easy. If it means telling the truth, it also means that we need to consider when we feel something to be true. Is it really true or is this just my perception, my inner reality? And also, if I perceive a truth and want to share it with somebody, is it timely and is it useful and are they ready to hear it? This doesn't mean necessarily you have to be sweet or soft spoken. There's times when you have to shout. But loving speech means using words in a way at a time when one senses that they can actually reach another being. The third factor is beneficial action, which includes helping and listening. It includes the meditation that we do is beneficial action. It harmonizes ourselves and harmonizes the whole world. Again, it's another form of giving. Beneficial action in a bodhisattva way. I don't know if you've seen statues of thousand armed guanyin, guanyin or Avalokiteshvara as a bodhisattva of compassion. She's depicted in a number of ways, often as a woman and often with this kind of great circle of hands and eyes. There's a wonderful Zen koan which says, what does the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara do with all her hands and eyes? The teacher responds, it's like reaching around for a pillow in the middle of the night. She just uses these hands and eyes in a natural way to put herself at ease. In the middle of the night when we adjust our pillow, we do it so freely and naturally. It's just something we give to ourselves. It may be one of those rare moments for some of us when we don't think, do I deserve this? Do I deserve to be comfortable? You just do it. That's the spirit with which the bodhisattva acts, with which they do beneficial action, without any calculation or any contrivance just acting. The way that this figure is depicted sometimes, which is very cool, is each one of these hands has a tool. You see the statue, it's really amazing. Each tool is different. Each tool is exactly what's needed to take care of some situation in life. It's like the world's biggest Swiss army knife. Or the universe's Swiss army knife. These are the tools of bodhisattva that she uses to benefit others. Dogen writes, we should equally benefit friends and foes alike. We should benefit self and others alike. It's a difficult practice to benefit foes and friends alike. Some of us have been wrestling with the various people that we feel ourselves in difference with. Sometimes in our family, sometimes our nation's leaders, sometimes the leaders of other nations. This admonition is to benefit each of them without discerning about whether they're a friend or an enemy, because in fact each of them is a sentient being, each of them is a Buddha. If you see them, you have to cultivate this. I have to cultivate this pretty intensely to work on Donald Rumsfeld for myself. For himself, he might be right there. I don't know him. It's not so easy. But that part takes the cultivation. But it's also like Jesus advises, he's quoted in the Gospel of Matthew, where he tells his followers to love their enemies. This is a very difficult bodhisattva practice. And finally, the fourth factor is, this is the most interesting to me, it's called identity action. And it's the way in which a bodhisattva takes whatever form is necessary to meet suffering beings and relieve them from their suffering. This is how you benefit friends and foes alike, by not seeing them as foe, but by identifying with them as Buddha, and by yourself coming forth as Buddha so that they will be disarmed. What Dogen writes is, identity action means not to be different, neither different from self nor from others. That means don't draw a distinction between self and others. And we also don't draw a distinction even within yourself. So much of our lives, we have a doubt about what's true. And we feel actually separated from our self. In this kind of practice, we're stepping back from that again and again. We're focusing in on our breath. We're focusing on mindfulness. We're unifying our self. Because in everyday life, that self can feel scattered. And when it's scattered, we're uncomfortable and we suffer. So identity action means first of all, identifying with yourself. And then recognizing that everyone has this difficulty in generating compassion so that they can identify with themselves, and thereby we are identifying with them. Dogen goes on and says, when we realize identity action, self and others are one suchness. This is what I was talking about. This is where it's embracing Dharma. Self and others in identity, when we embrace them, it's one suchness. It's one true being. And when we identify thoroughly, truly, with ourselves and with them, we are free. Sometimes that freedom exists just in a moment. We can never hold on to it. But I think all of us have probably tasted it. And once you've tasted it, you know that it's there. When you've tasted it, it's a gift. It again goes back to Dhanana. It's a gift that you've given yourself. It's also a gift that the Buddhas give to us. And it will happen again. Don't try too hard to go after it. Just try to bring it forth. Once you've tasted it, then you know that you have the capability and others have the capability of bringing this forth. And that there is this kind of liberation and freedom possible for all beings. So I think I'll stop there. There's of course more that could be said. We have a few minutes for questions or comments. So thank you. Back there. Sufferer just means experience. It just means to experience gratitude on a worldly plane. Often suffering and experience have, just with a subtle shift, we can feel pain in that. So suffering also means enduring. And so one of the key elements to all these practices is actually is patience. That you have to practice patience. You have to be very patient with yourself. And then we can just move back freely. Questions, comments? Yeah. How do they think about that nature? For example, Donald Rong's film. Well, it's interesting. When I see, when I listen to him or see him on TV, I see a person there. I just see a person I disagree with. But I see somebody who's very alive. I see somebody who, I can see that, for instance, that he takes a certain pleasure in the workings of his mind. I can see that. There's nothing unwholesome about that. I wish that it were turned. The difficulty comes when one believes one's ideas, when one believes one's thoughts, and then imposes them on the world. If you don't believe them, if you see them as impermanent, then you can just enjoy them. You can enjoy the working of your mind, and you can enjoy the working of other people's minds and other people's lives. Once you start believing them and turning them into a policy, and a policy that's the opposite of a policy of kindness, then watch out. So when I see him also, when I see that pleasure that he takes in his ideas, or in the workings of his mind, I realize, oh, I do that. And I am also capable of clinging to, or possibly fighting for, or arguing for my beliefs. And so the first thing is for me to take a step back and see, if I identify in that identity, you know, where's my work? And have some sense, I do have some sense, that if I'm doing my work, then other beings are free to do theirs. There's a mysterious linkage there, you know, but I trust in that. Could you comment on the equanimity? Yeah. Well equanimity is one of the four brahma vahara's which you probably studied, and it's also one of the six paramitas, the perfections, which are also bodhisattva practices. Equanimity means patient acceptance. I think it calls for patience. It means taking whatever comes to one calmly. It means finding a kind of balance. In Japanese culture, they have these daruma dolls. Have you ever seen that they're sort of red and round? They're actually kind of homage to Bodhidharma on the first patrons of Zen. And there's like, you knock them over, and they come back to the center. Knock them over this way, they come back to the center. So equanimity is like a tree or a blade of grass. And this is what we, you know, when we're sitting, that's the way we are. That's what we're modeling. You know, our sitting is upright, we're rooted on the ground, we're in the ground, and our head is reaching towards the heavens. And our bodies are soft and flexible. They're upright. But like a blade of grass, they are very flexible. So when we bend this way, you know, wind, physical or emotional or verbal, you know, blows us this way, if we have equanimity, we slowly regain our center. So one, I keep that image in my head a lot, that image of a tree or a blade of grass, which is very upright, but totally flexible. And that's a way, if we're practicing equanimity, that's the way we become in our lives. And when we encounter someone like that, again, we feel at ease. Does that get to it somewhat? We have time for one more question. Yeah. It's an expression of identity action. It's also a gift, it's also an offering. The aspect of identity action is that for Bodhisattva, when she sees that other beings are suffering, she vows to come back and stick around and help them, even if that means continuation of her own suffering. So it's a deeply, deeply unself-centered view. It's expression of that, of this kind of ultimate altruism. It's a model, it's a metaphor. And we know people like this. We know people whose work puts them in those inconceivable hell realms that I mentioned. And they stay there. They stay there, they work there, they go home, they come back. They come back to this place that, for some of us, we couldn't imagine doing that. So that's a high aspiration. It's nine o'clock, I promised to end, and I thank you all very much. I'll be around out there. There's more to talk about. But thank you so much for coming, and for inviting me.
