Greetings, greetings friends.
Greetings and welcome.
It's lovely to spend this moment in time with all of you practicing cultivating together.
And it's lovely to see your hollows greeting, warming the space with your meta, with your heart, for each other.
So, so today, we continue to engage, we continue to engage.
We continue to engage with the practice and with considering, exploring the teachings of karma.
It's an empowerment in each moment of experience, predilections, what we pass down the stream.
Ourselves in this life, who we are becoming every moment, who we are becoming every moment.
We're making ourselves to be.
So, let us begin by meditating together.
So, I'd like to invite you to arrive in your meditation posture.
Arrive in your meditation posture.
Allowing your back, allowing your back to be straight.
Allowing there to be a sense of integrity in your posture.
And inviting your body, inviting the muscles of your body to rest in this moment to relax.
To arrive, to arrive here in this moment in time.
Allowing awareness to be bright as if awareness is waking up.
Bright in each moment, expansive like the sun, the sun in your heart, the sun in your body shining.
Awareness, this amazing, beautiful, mysterious, powerful capacity of our heart and mind.
Awareness, expensive through our bodies.
Aware of how this body is sitting, breathing.
Effortlessly, it's just here, just like the sun shines as if effortlessly.
It's there, it's just there, you don't have to do much.
Similarly, the sun of awareness internally, spacious, expansive.
Effortless, knowing, knowing this body, knowing this heart, knowing this mind.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
Each breath received in the body and the sun of awareness shines.
And the sensations of each breath.
Each sensation, each thought, each sound, each emotion.
The sun of awareness shines, warmly, smilingly.
Knowing everything, without exclusion and exception.
Knowing everything, appreciatively, openly.
Not holding back, it's knowing or it's warmed from any object that is known in the space of heart and mind.
Whether it's tightness, clinging, pain, sadness, it's all known by the sun of awareness with warmth intertwined.
Goodness intertwined in the knowing.
Effortlessly, engaged, effortlessly.

Not judgments, but receptive interest dropping in this question, this inquiry into your heart.
How am I engaging with this moment, with whatever object is arising in this moment?
What is the flavor of engagement?
Is it with greed, wanting more attachment?
Is it with hatred? I don't want this to be here.
Is it with confusion, lost, with anger, with fear?
Just knowing, how are you engaging? How is the quality of engagement?
Whatever is arising, the object is less important. It can be the best news or the worst news, it doesn't matter.
It could be pain or pleasure.
What is the quality of engagement?
Relationship.
Whatever is arising.
