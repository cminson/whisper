 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Welcome, welcome, and happy new year again. It's hard to believe, right? Here we go, one more year. And it's not uncommon, of course, at the beginning of a new year, or new season, or new something, to reflect back on the preceding era, time, and to look forward to what we would like to do, or how we would like the next year, or whatever, to be different. And so, maybe one way in which we do this is to think about what would we like to prioritize in our life the next year. Chances are, if you're here, that maybe meditation has a role there, if you made it here on a rainy, I think it's a holiday for some people today. So, if you made your way here, maybe meditation is part, not necessarily though, but... And then, so I kind of want to wrap this in with a theme I want to continue from the last time I spoke about kind of like effort and energy, like applying effort and having energy, and how can we do that in a way that's helpful and supportive and honors and respects the amount of energy we have without demanding that we have a different amount necessarily, and working with it to make our lives shape our lives, have our lives head in the direction we would like. Because it's not a secret that if we want our lives to unfold a little bit differently than effort has to be part of that equation. Because no matter what we would like to prioritize in our lives, a sense of maybe a little activity or effort or energy is what's needed to take it out of the theoretical into something that actually gets done. Take it out of just an idea or a wish into something that actually happens. I'm really good at just coming up with these great ideas. I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, I'm going to do this. Yeah, that's as far as it goes sometimes, right? Just having these ideas. So to help us kind of bridge this gap between aspiring to doing something and actually like living it. But what is this effort towards? Like maybe we can unpack this a little bit. And part of it is to do something other than just follow our preferences and follow our habits. Right, if we don't apply an effort, that's the direction our lives will go. Maybe that's okay, but if we want it to broaden or to add some different elements or shift the direction a little bit, we have to do something other than just follow our habits and preferences and this takes energy. Because there are habits, they are from this kind of like stream that we might say of activity, the body, the mind, create habits as a way to conserve energy. Things just kind of go on autopilot. So energy is required if we want things to be different, if we want to do something different than we usually do. When I was thinking about this, I noticed this is like a minor thing, but in my own life, something that I realized, yeah, this is going to take a little bit of effort. I have this habit of setting up my computer and not putting my computer glasses on. I'm saying all this time, you know, going like this, bad posture, squinting, right? It's terrible. It's just like this habit I have of I can't quite see with my regular glasses. I just don't put my computer glasses on and at the end of the day, I have this tension in my neck and shoulders. This is a minor thing, but right every day, day after day, week after week, month after month, right? So it will take a little bit of effort for me to notice when I just have this habit of doing this. We have these habits of things that we do, but we also have these habits that are part of like with our relationships, or maybe there's habits that get supported by the social structure that we're in. I had a friend who really enjoyed reading blogs that were really polemic, that were really about, you know, we are right and everybody else is wrong. And this was years and years ago, but it was quite something. If this person, my friend, had just finished reading one of these articles and then I happened to have a conversation with them, it was quite something to feel like all this righteous indignation and we got to do something and like not seeing quite clearly, like not taking in the bigger picture, just stuck in a small picture of about something. But if it's our habit, it's to look at our phones in the morning and our phones are filled with this kind of this polemic, whether it's a podcast or something that we read or sub-stack, whatever it might be, you know, that's going to have an impact on us too. So if we want to do something different, it's going to take some energy. So I'm going to define effort as applied energy. And we might think of energy as like this, maybe this sense of vitality we have, maybe it has a little bit of a buzzing, maybe a little bit of vibration to it. I don't even know if that's the right word exactly, but it can also just be a sense of like feeling good, like having energy is like feeling present. I know in the Buddhist world, energy and effort have different poly words, but sometimes those poly words have the same definition. So sometimes we talk about effort and energy and kind of just mix them up together. But for what I'm doing tonight, I'm going to define effort as applied energy. And some of you might know that in the eightfold path, which is this path towards awakening and not surprising, has eight aspects to it, that one of them is what we call like wise effort. Like how to apply effort and something that I'll highlight here that is part of the eightfold path, it's really pointing to the direction of effort. It's like what are we going to spend our life energy on? What direction are we going to go? And what direction are we not going to go? So we could say kind of in a really broad brush, the wise effort, sometimes called right effort, right in terms of not moralistic right versus wrong, but right as in terms of the best tool for the job. If we have to put a nail in, we don't grab a screwdriver, the right tool is a hammer, that kind of a thing. So wise effort is this idea that if we want to diminish what leads to suffering for ourselves and others, and we want to increase what leads to our well-being and others' well-being, that's kind of right effort in a nutshell. It has more elements to it, but diminishing suffering and increasing well-being. I don't think anybody will protest with this. I think probably all spiritual practices have this direction also. But I like Gregory Kramer, he has this definition. He says, right effort is the energy of swimming towards the wholesome and away from the unwholesome. I like this idea of swimming because if we're moving through water, there's a little bit of pressure against us. It does take a little bit of effort. But also we can float on the top too, right? It sometimes can just be a really restful effort, but sometimes there can be this sense of needing to swim. And he just summarizes right effort as out with the bad and in with the good. Again, I don't think anybody will disagree with this. But it was... So here what is the bad, or you know, those things that cause harm. But it's also, we might say, not only actions that cause harm, but mental qualities. What are we doing with our minds? Is it helpful or is it unhelpful? This word helpful is often sometimes a translation for this word, kusela. The same word gets translated as wholesome, skillful, helpful. So not only are actions, which maybe that's a little bit more obvious to be aware of that, but really what are we doing with our minds also? And so there's a classic core of teachings of what is abandoned, you know, like the unwholesome. So many Dharma talks are about these. I'm just going to list some of them. Don't worry, I'm not going to go through all of these. But what are some of these things that are the unhelpful, five hindrances, things that hinder, that get in the way of the mind being settled and having some collectedness. There's the three unwholesome roots. It's this idea that at the base, as the foundation of everything that's unhelpful, there's only just three things. Greed, hatred, we might sometimes call it aversion, and delusion, sometimes called ignorance. And sometimes it's helpful just to simplify things. Greed, really wanting more, aversion or hatred, you know, to kind of push it away, and delusion, just not paying attention at all, or being completely unaware. I know sometimes in my practice I can be helpful because maybe I don't really have the exact word, but there's maybe just this more of this feeling of maybe leaning more or wanting more. Sometimes we might use pulling, like wanting something or leaning forward. Also as part of this classic core of what is abandoned are the taints. These are said to what's abandoned when a person is awakened. We can understand these taints as the intoxication with sense pleasures, this idea that just pursuing endless sense pleasures is the way to everlasting happiness. Sometimes we're happy if we have some pleasure, but it's not reliable and it certainly isn't everlasting, right? We're always chasing the next one. So the taints, intoxication with sense pleasures, intoxication with self-making, that is setting up the, I'm the person who does X and I don't do Y. I'm the person who is kind and I am not unkind. So we have to ignore all those times when we don't let that person in front of us in traffic or ignoring the person who's talking too loud or whatever it might be. But this sense of having to adopt a belief about ourselves, and not only do we have to adopt this belief, but we have to kind of make sure that everybody else believes it too. And this takes a tremendous amount of propping up and energy and time and effort and shows up in so many different ways. It turns out that having this belief is extra. We don't need it. But this is something that kind of unfolds with practice. It's not helpful for me to just say this. It's something that really needs to have this experience. But maybe I'll point to briefly, there's times when this righteous indignation, when we hear something that really anchors us, that we feel like, oh, how dare they? And there can be a strong sense of, they shouldn't do that. There's a strong sense of self then. It might be helpful and appropriate. But if you contrast that with when you're doing your favorite hobby, there's not such a sense of self. When you're knitting or doing gardening or something like this, you're not thinking about yourself, you're thinking about whatever it is that you're doing. So to have this really strong sense of self, I'm over here and everybody else is over there, just takes extra energy that's not necessary. And then one of the taints is ignorance. So these three taints, these are what's said to be let go of with awakening. This understanding that sense pleasures are not what's going to lead to awakening. We don't need to be creating this self. There's no longer ignorance. Instead there's a clear scene of the way things are. And then maybe the last thing that I'll mention here is this classic core. Part of because this is the beginning of the year, I thought I would say some of these things, is clinging. It's amazing right to how many things we can cling to. Even the things that we don't want, we cling to them in some kind of convoluted way. So these are some of the classic core of what is abandoned with right effort. And then what is cultivated are seven factors of awakening. I just completed a series, I talked about the seven factors, and I'm teaching a course on the seven factors online. Just as the name sounds like these are things that really support awakening. Some of these seven, I won't list all of them, but some of them are like joy. And some of them is equanimity, you know, having some balance, some concentration, having some collectedness, and energy is also one of them. We need to have some energy or effort. The five faculties, something else that's cultivated, these overlap some with the seven factors. Mindfulness, energy, sorry, I'll do this in order, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. There's so many different ways we cultivate those. We cultivate the Brahma Vahara's. These are four practices of the heart, loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity. And the ten paramese, I won't go through this long list of the paramese. So there's this, you know, the Buddhist love list, right? And I'm one of those people that like the lists. Things to abandon, things to cultivate. So right effort is really pointing us towards that, but I would make a distinction between this right effort and balanced effort. So balanced effort isn't the difference or the balance between making effort and not making effort. Instead, it's the balance or it's the recognizing what is the right amount of effort to apply to the task at hand, and what's the right amount of effort to apply given the type of energy we have at the time. Sometimes we have lots of energy, sometimes we don't. Or maybe we have an illness and we rarely have lots of energy. We're not being asked to be different than who we are. We're just, it's being pointed to, to be wise about how we use the energy that we have, and to not use too much and not too little. So, Buddha, I appreciate very much this little simile about having the right amount of energy for whatever it is we're going to do. And he has this simile. Suppose a person was to hold a quail. You know, these little birds, right? We have California quails, they're so adorable with their little things on their heads. Suppose a person were to hold a quail too tightly in their hands, it would die right there. Oh, it's just awful to think about, right? Suppose a person were to hold a quail too loosely, it would fly out of their hands. So this idea of not too tight and not too loose, is about how to apply the right amount of energy. So sometimes when we hear about right effort or applying effort, we might think that this is some type of intense focus or has some intensity to it. But quoting Gregory Kramer again, I appreciate very much that he says that the half-balanced effort is like the strenuous effort required to turn the soil and plant our gardens, to get in there with the right tools, the trowel or whatever might be needed shovels. And other times, the effort is like the steady application of the sun's heat. We need all of these things to make things grow. So sometimes we're in there really exerting energy, and sometimes there's more just like this gentle heat. And so part of the art of practice is discerning, well, what is needed here? When are we giving too much and when is it too little? Part of recognizing if it's too little, it's not uncommon when there's too little effort. There often is a feeling of discouragement, which then can lead to doubt, because it's like we don't quite see anything happening. We're applying a little bit of effort and we're getting a little bit of results. And it's true, right? This practice, sometimes we don't see results in a short timeframe. Sometimes it's not until we look back over months that we start to see, oh yeah, I am showing up in the world a little bit differently. I do have a little bit different inner voice sometimes that shows up, that allows me to be more kind towards myself or kind towards others or more patient or something like this. But I also want to acknowledge that I feel like these days, like these days being like after the pandemic, and as we're still trying to find our way with the new normal, that many of us feel depleted. There's a way in which there's maybe not as much energy for what used to be meaningful for us or maybe it's a lack of enthusiasm. I don't know exactly what it is, but maybe it's like this coach in Paley Ellison, he's a Zen teacher, he describes it as like the oxygen has left our life somehow. And this recognition that we might feel flat or a little bit disengaged or not quite attuned to what's happening with our life, that there's maybe a little bit of just going through the motions. And we feel like we're living a little bit from a distance from what's really happening, not quite engaged with it. And then all our energy is going to just doing the next thing that needs to be done, just to get through the day, just to get through the to-do list or finish the tasks. So there isn't this energy to, if we want to make different priorities for our life, if we want our life to turn to be differently, if we want to be cultivating the skillful, wholesome, helpful, and abandoning the unskillful and wholesome. How are we going to do that? Or are we feeling like maybe overwhelmed, but we just don't have the energy for it? Well, often when Dharma teachers talk about effort and energy, myself included, often we're talking, well, some teachers, I tend to not do this because, maybe I'll tell this little story that at the beginning of a long retreat, there was one of the very first talks of the retreat, right where we're all kind of showing up and kind of eager to do this whole retreat thing. And this one teacher talked about a retreat he had done in Asia. It was so hard and they could only sleep for four hours, and we had to be sitting, you know, up, you are not allowed to move for hours at a time. And this person described how they lost so much weight because there wasn't enough food, and it was months of this, and all of us, well, I should say me, my eyes are getting big, like, oh my gosh, okay, I guess that's what's required. Oh my gosh, that was a horrible retreat, it was so hard. And I ended up getting myself really, it happened in tight knots, striving with my shoulders up near my ears, and it was completely unhelpful. But sometimes teachers, like, strive, you know, you got to do this. Or I don't know if they say that, sometimes that's what we hear, right, because maybe, you know, this, doing that type of work really helped us, maybe in our academic setting or in our professional life. But something different is needed here. So I'd like to offer us a little something different here, and that is this poem by a practitioner, her name is Sylvia Ostertock. And this poem is called Tiredness, and it's about how to practice with tiredness, and maybe how it actually can be really helpful. So the poem goes like this. Tiredness is no obstacle to sitting in silence, but to think tiredness is an obstacle. That is an obstacle. When you stop thinking this, you can sit in silence very well with tiredness. However tired you are, then at last you are too tired to get stressed and want to achieve anything, too tired to bully your breath and keep griping about yourself, perhaps even too tired to think. Then the only thing to do is to abandon yourself gently for this brief moment into the silence now. I appreciate this, this idea of tiredness, maybe there's a way that just supports a certain letting go. And earlier I had talked about that self-fame is something that we're moving away from with this practice, and I appreciate that she's perhaps even too tired to think. And the only thing to do is to abandon yourself gently. So when we talk about energy and effort, we often are thinking about how much we have to apply. But I also want to introduce this idea that we can practice with whatever amount of energy we have, and maybe there's even sometimes advantages to having a little bit of energy. Maybe there's times when we feel depleted or uninspired. Can we sit anyway? Without this idea, we have to achieve anything. What does she say here? At last you are too tired to get stressed and want to achieve anything. There's some sweetness to this. I think it's really tender, instead of trying to prop ourselves up in some kind of way. But there are times in which we have this exhaustion, and it may be due to not enough sleep, maybe due to illness, maybe just simply because we're working too much. Maybe we're spread thin with lots of responsibilities. But sometimes this exhaustion is not because of something external like that. Sometimes it's about what's happening internally. So can we pay attention when we start to feel exhausted and have this idea? Is it about, you know, am I just simply too overextended or not getting enough sleep? Or should I have this investigation? What is draining the energy? What is it that's draining energy? Maybe it's something like trying to please everyone. That's exhausting, right? Because it doesn't work. Or maybe we're doing too much because we're trying to feel indispensable or trying to feel important or something like this. That's also exhausting. Or maybe we're not able to ask for help or to delegate in our professional life or family life or, you know, we find it difficult to ask others to do something. So we end up doing everything ourselves and feeling exhausted. Maybe even feel a little bit resentful, and that adds to the sense of exhaustion. Or maybe it's just we're not taking care of ourselves. We're not eating well and exercising. We all know we should do this, right? And sometimes it shows up with our just being tired when we don't take the or spend the energy or effort to take care of our physical bodies. But I also want to address one more thing that might fuel exhaustion. And sometimes at the beginning of the new year we might have some ambitious ideas about what we're going to do. Okay, this is the year that I'm going to do whatever it is. Not everybody does this, but if we're going to do it, sometimes it's tempting to do it this time of year to make these, like, big changes. But in these times when we believe that anything is possible, we have, like, these peaks of energy, yes, I'm going to do it, this is the time. Finally, no matter what, I'm going to make this happen. And sometimes that works fantastic, and it does happen. But sometimes these peaks of energy are followed by valleys of energy, too. And part of that, not all of it, but part of it is if we have this idea that we're going to make a big change, even if it's something that we want, it can elicit, like, a fear response. There's something in us that's not so comfortable with making big changes. And that, of course, this fear response shows up as, like, putting on the brakes and kind of, like, sucking out all the energy of what it is we want to do. Just a recognition that that also could be something that has a role if we're feeling like, oh, we just don't have the energy for to do this right effort to orient our lives towards cultivating what's helpful and wholesome and abandoning what's not helpful and wholesome. So maybe it's helpful to just focus on little things that we can do. To improve situations. Maybe not. Maybe it's great to do grand gestures and big plans, but maybe it's helpful to just think about, hmm, is there something, a little something that I might do differently the next time I'm doing this? Is there something I can learn about this instead of this turning things into a big grand project so that we can, it can be a little bit more sustainable, this movement that we would like our direction, our life to go? So maybe I'll stop there with talking about energy and effort. And this idea that there's sometimes Dharma teachers talk about right effort and balanced effort and they kind of put them together, but sometimes it's helpful to tease them apart. Right effort is about the direction we want to go. And balanced effort is, you know, are we going to squeeze this poor little quail? Or are we going to make it fly away so that it doesn't, we don't have any energy of what we're doing? And maybe with that, I'll open it up and see if there's some questions or comments. Happy New Year, Diane. Thank you so much. I really liked your Dharma talk, especially in regards to just the effort and the sense of self and whether or not I'm applying. I think I'm just grateful that through meditation I'm more aware of that, the sense of self. I'm just now with the new year upon us. I just want to make sure that whatever it is that I'm clinging to with my sense of self, that I can approach it every day with, like, do you have any questions? Like, oh, Anne Rose, I noticed that I'm trying to be X or Y or be perceived a certain way or, you know, it's... I always help point out or to help you realize when that's a sense of self is strong. Yes, so that way I can just go about life without having to strive for or be whatever it is that I just want to just be there, just be here now. Yeah. So I think you're talking about, there's a number of things I think that you're saying. One is when there's a strong sense of self and when, especially when it's tied up with striving, like trying to make things different. Is that right? Yes. So one thing I'll say, a hint or a clue about when there's a strong sense of self is when there's a strong sense of other. Like, oh, those people over there, whenever that's happening, there's a strong sense of self too. So it's impossible for that not to happen. So just to notice and it takes... sometimes it can be energizing, like, I'm in the right and they are wrong. And then you have this sense of energy and it may be it feels nice, but it's taxing. It's really... this really doesn't lead to a good life, right, of doing this. And then this sense of striving. I even had some notes in here I was going to talk about if we had a little bit more time. But one thing that can be helpful to think about is often there's... what's fueling or underneath striving is some fear. Like this fear of missing out or fear of having regret or fear of turning into a slug or something, right? Like there can be something like that that's fueling this driving. So it can be a strong sense of self and fear is often tied up with that. But that might just be something to have some curiosity about. Is there a sense of something I'm trying to avoid or I'm afraid of or something like that? And that fear or... yeah, can be fueling striving. Is that helpful? Very much. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're welcome. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you for a nice talk about energy and effort and energy in there. And also three points you talked about were the greed, hatred and delusion. I don't know if you agree with me whether it falls under one point which is ego. I mean greed is a form of ego, delusion is a form of ego and hatred is a form of ego of some kind. So how that ego can be lowered or be dispelled is important. The second thing is when you talk about the energy and the effort and being tired. Personally, for example, I have been interested in finding more like-minded people, let's say, and for whom I can talk about, let's say Dharma talk and all these things. Not necessarily here, it's like 45 minutes and we are done. So I wonder if you have any comments on that so we can multiply that energy and do you know that? So that is one question I have. So the first one about is ego, greed, hatred and delusion. So in this tradition, we would say, and you had asked like is there a way to diminish the ego or something. This tradition points to you don't have to diminish the ego, you just recognize that it's actually not there. We would use maybe like the sense of self as with the ego. It's like the 50% part. I know about, let's say, my ego, like this introspection, but I do not know about my environment's ego or like people I am interacting with. And how, I mean, one is of course, I would want to be in a like-minded environment. So people who are, am I answering? I see, I misunderstood your question. So it's easier to not have greed, hatred and delusion when you're surrounded by people that have similar ideas. Yeah, like we were like during Glenn, his talk we were talking about, you know, we talked about Gregory Peck and the Gregory Peck of Indian cinema and whatnot. So if you're like, you know, thinking good things, you know, on top of a mountain, you know, like that. So it's that ego is down and that's... Yeah, so a few things like what I said to Anne Rose about the self, right, is the same about how to, like we would use the language, the self, for ego. Ego is like a contemporary idea about psychology. But this idea about with like-minded people, I agree it's easier, but we can't always do that, of course. And is your question like how can we or where can you or like just very pragmatic like where? Yeah, where and how can we, because it's like, I mean, for me, I've been looking for like-minded people for like a year or more. And there I don't want to really call it tiredness. I'm putting effort, but it's like, you know, it's like at some point you want to find an answer to the question. Yeah, so here at IMC, like on Sundays after the Dharma talk, there's discussions. And on Wednesdays here there are discussions too. So it's an opportunity to kind of explore and meet other people and investigate and see if it's a place that supports you bringing your best self forward, so to speak. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Is there another short question? I really liked your analogy about the quail and trying to find the right amount of energy and effort. What I find in my own life and a lot of my friends is the world today seems to like have too many demands. I'm at an age where we have young children and we still want to have careers. And the dream, I think, is to go about the day, you know, gently at a gentle pace. But I don't think that it to me, I don't find that possible because there's too much to do in a day. And so I don't know if you have any advice about how to live in a situation where it just seems like there's too much to do. And I feel like most people's reaction is to like go really fast and then get exhausted and then oversleep, you know, like doing too much and then too little and then you get into this cycle. It would be great to just go at a steady pace and feel like you have enough time in a day to tend to everything like a gentle gardener. But that's not, you know, to me, that's not realistic right now. So if we sort of can't have that, what's like the next best thing? Yeah, no, this is a legitimate question. So is there there is a way and this is not easy, but it's absolutely possible, I promise you, to have to be doing lots of things without tension, to be doing one thing after the other, but without tension. And this is what your point is, like it's the dream, right? It is possible. But part of it is to learn what does it feel like when tension is there to feel when there's this like, oh my gosh, I have to do this. And sometimes it's I'll get back to saying this idea, this strong sense of self gets created. What's going to happen if I turn this in late? I'm going to be the person who turned it in late or something like this. But can there be this recognition without a contraction and tension, the shoulders going up type of thing? And I would say one is to recognize when there is tension and two, a meditation practice actually does help because it kind of not only is an opportunity to settle, but it allows the mind to get used to or recognize when there is some more spaciousness. And once the mind recognizes, and sometimes the body, that, oh, there is an alternative to the usual way of doing things, it becomes easier to make a change. But if you don't have any experience of doing things without tension, maybe quickly and a lot of things, but no tension, then it's hard to do. So a meditation practice can help. I wish I had an easy answer, right? At least you have an answer. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. Okay, so we're at the top of the hour. So thank you all. And again, happy New Year. I wish you all a safe drive home in the rain and hopefully there isn't flooding now, right? That was quite something that we had and we'll see you next week. Bye bye.
