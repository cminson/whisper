 So, good morning everyone. So, today is a Dharma practice day and it's an opportunity to explore the Dharma in some a little more creative way than perhaps just a silent sitting retreat mode or listening to a Dharma talk or reading a book. And on different Dharma days, these kinds of days, the format, the way they're done is different. And this today will be different again. Never have seen something like this before. And maybe never again. And we're going to explore three very important topics in Buddhism because these topics have to do with the personal transformation and personal reorientation and change, change of heart that are central to many people's involvement with Buddhist practice. And so, rather than focusing on beliefs and ideas, this is really looking at how people have a fundamental and radical shift in values and priorities for how to organize their life and what really lays at the center of their life, what their whole life is about in a sense. There's no expectation that any of you will necessarily have to go along with what I say today, but I want to present to you these three very important topics for Buddhists. And in brief, they're the first turning, the first radical shift that a person can really make, and that is what's called going for refuge. And in a kind of simple way, going for refuge is that which makes a person a follower of the Buddha. So we could say kind of a Buddhist. But that's not really very important, the idea of being a Buddhist, following the Buddha. What's important is rather that it's a very deep seated reorientation about what one feels is the intention and values and priorities of one's life that is then centered around these three values that have very deep value for Buddhists, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. So going for refuge is to orient one's life somehow around these three different topics. The second, we'll explore a little bit today, is what's called stream entry. And stream entry is more than just an orientation, more than just placing something deeply into the center of our lives and organizing a life around that, but is a transformation, a turning of the mind, of the heart in a liberative way, in being liberated, experiencing what the stream of Buddhism is, what the experiencing what the the it's the first stage, first step of realization of liberation in Buddhism. The third we'll explore is what's called bodhicitta. And bodhicitta is one way of talking about the turning of the heart towards others. It's a reorientation towards other people, other beings, so that now other beings are in the field of our liberative awareness, that are, and this expresses itself often as compassion or sympathy, altruistic empathy for others. And it is a concern for the welfare of other beings. Stream entry has to do with transformation of oneself. And bodhicitta has to do with some innate, heartfelt wish or concern for the transformation of other people also. And it's said usually to come out of compassion. So all three involved involve a change of orientation of one's life or his priorities and understanding even of what it means to be a human being. I don't want to very much talk about this. I don't want to like give long lectures, you know, explaining what this is all about and pick up the big text so much and, and lay it all out, you know, this is what it all means. And if you go home filled with information, I would like this to be something that's to be something that's personally meaningful for you and something which is more experiential, that somehow you get a sense of what we're talking about here through your own experience. And so a good part of today is going to be experiential. And I think it might even be challenging to you. And I think it's okay to challenge you because the topic of the class, I'm going to take it for granted that you came because you were interested in the topic. And the topic has to do with some of the deepest transformations that Buddhism offers a human being in human life, some of the deepest aspects of Buddhist life. And if you're really interested in that, which I'm assuming you are, you're willing to take be challenged, you're willing to take some risks here. Otherwise, you should go home, you know, find something else to do, you know, there's better things to do with your time than sit and, you know, spend the day at a Buddhist center. So the idea is a little bit that there's some challenge here as we go into our experience. And I think you'll love it. I hope you will. I hope you have a good time doing this. So since we want to explore these three topics in our direct experience, it's best to start by grounding ourselves in our direct experience, in the immediacy of now. It's often said, classically in Buddhism, that you don't really want to teach someone dharma until they're well settled and concentrated and still, or their mind is more settled and receptive. So in order to have access to some of the depths of our immediate experience, some of the texture of it, or some of the subtleties of it, it's really important to be grounded in our immediate experience. And the way to be grounded in our immediate experience in Buddhism is very much to be grounded in one's body, to be in one's body, settled in one's body, to be connected to what's happening with the body kind of at the center, with the body as a kind of support or the container for what we're going to experience. If you stay too much in your head thinking about things and reacting to things intellectually or through your ego or your concerns for self, you're really going to miss a tremendous opportunity of where the dharma will speak to you and work with you. And in order for that deep speaking or deep working of the dharma of yourself, you have to really kind of be in your body, be grounded, settled in your body. So we'll start with a sitting. And so make yourselves comfortable in upright alert posture. And you might have been sitting for a long time, and that's been meditating for a long many years or whatever. If that's the case, be really careful now that your old habits about how to sit and how to be in your body and what to do when you meditate doesn't really get in the way of your direct experience now and really getting down, getting into your body, settled. So gently closing your eyes and then feeling your body, your body, your physical body itself is an organ of perception, an organ of awareness. So if we feel the contact of our body against a chair or a cushion, the experience of contact is happening there at that place, at your butt, against a chair or cushion. That part of your body is the is an organ of awareness of perception. Awareness in a sense resides in that place. If you feel your hand, maybe feel one of your hands right now. Perhaps you feel tingling or vibration or warmth. Energy, softness, hardness. You become aware of how your hand experiences itself right now. The hand itself is an organ of awareness or perception. The mind can recognize what that experience is, but the mind's recognition of it is a distinct phenomena to the actual experience in the hand, how the hand experiences itself. The body is an organ of awareness of perception. The body has its own experience. The body experiences itself. And how the body experiences itself is independent of what you want your body to experience, how you want to experience your body, your preferences, your ideals. There is a sense of not knowing what will appear in your body next, if you just allow your body to reveal itself. The body as an organ of perception or organ of awareness is a silent organ of perception. It might feel energized or vital or alive, a certain sense of aliveness in the body, but it's also in a kind of way silent in terms of words. There might be the recognition part of the mind has words and that's fine, but the body experiences itself is silent without words. And then let your attention drop lower in your body, perhaps down to your legs, lower torso. And let that your legs and lower torso be a broad foundation. It's a support, kind of like a mountain has a wide base. Feeling the depth of it, feeling the stability of it, feeling your lower half of your body. And as you feel it, always remembering that you're not in charge of how you're going to experience it. It experiences itself. And then bring your attention to the area of your lower stomach, perhaps the area below your navel. You might relax your belly there, soften your stomach and feel the aliveness or feel the awareness that is that part of your body. Perhaps you experience that part of your belly as a softness or tenderness or perhaps as a strength or hardness or heaviness. Perhaps if you go in from the surface of your belly below your navel, there's some energy there, vitality. Feeling the lower belly's experience of itself. If you listen to a sound far in the distance, a faint sound, you might let your thinking mind go quiet so you can really attend carefully. So in the same way, perhaps you can let go of your thoughts or listen or sense your way into that part of your body by letting your thinking mind become quiet. And part of the experience of lower belly can be the experience of breathing, the movement of the belly as it moves in and out. Like a balloon which expands and contracts, so the lower torso of the belly, the area below your navel expands and contracts as you breathe. And we'll sit in silence for a while and as we do, rest your awareness, your attention in this part of your belly and deepen your body, letting the breath, the movements of breath, expansion contraction help you stay connected to how the belly experiences itself. To the solidness there, the strength there, the tenderness there, the aliveness. Letting yourself become more embodied, more filled with body, filled with awareness from this lower part of your torso. As you exhale, you might try saying a silent ah as a way of settling yourself into the sensations of that lower belly, relaxing into it, easing your way into it, letting go of your thoughts. So sitting in your body, feeling your belly, torso, your body, breathing. I'm going to ask you to look for something in your body. If it doesn't make sense what I say, then don't worry about it for now. More instructions will come. So in your body, in your felt sense of your body, sensations of your body, some location in your body, is there some place that you associate with confidence? Maybe you can remember a time when you were confident. Or maybe now there's some confidence available. Perhaps you feel something, where's confidence? When you have confidence, where is it in your body? Do you feel it in your legs, your hands, arms? Do you feel it in your belly or your chest? What is your experience about how it feels to be confident? So if there's a feeling or a sense in your body that you associate with confidence, perhaps you can breathe into it for a few minutes. Breathe with it like you're fanning the flames so the flames can burn brighter. Let that confidence have a chance to show itself to be here. So so so and from whatever confidence you have or from your intuition of what it's like to act and be in the world with confidence, what would it be like for you to bring together your confidence with your deepest values, your deepest intentions or aspirations, how to live your life, what to do? So free of any inhibition or fear or ideas that you can't, to have just confidence together with your deepest aspirations, your deepest values. What's that like? So the first of the three turnings is the turning of refuge, of going for refuge. And the issue of refuge has a lot to do with confidence because it's a movement of confidence in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. And when a person discovers a very very thorough or deep confidence in these three, then there can be a movement, spontaneous movement perhaps, of what's called going for refuge to these three. In the old texts, the time of the Buddha, there wasn't any ceremony of going for refuge. So you wouldn't go to the local Buddhist temple and sign up for refuge ceremony or something or be expected to do it, but rather it was just a spontaneous movement of people who encountered the Buddha. That they would somehow hear his teachings or his sense of presence and they would have this tremendous confidence and they would ask they would declare, they would ask, they would declare, I'm now going for refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. And it wasn't something that he gave them or granted them, which is some spontaneous movement because of somehow that they were moved inside. At first, the first people who went for refuge with the Buddha had said they only did two refuges because they went for refuge in the Buddha and the Dharma because there was no Sangha at first. They're just the Buddha started walking around India and people encountered him. So it didn't make any sense to take refuge in the Sangha. But once they started having monks and enlightened monks who were around him, then people also started taking refuge in the Sangha, which is the community. And primarily it's a community of monastics who are dedicated their life to the practice, their full life, kind of very explicitly and clearly. But it's also the community of people who have somehow tasted the truth of the Buddha's teachings for themselves directly and immediately, who've had that first experience of realization. And that can be monastic or a lay person, doesn't really matter. So take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha is a movement of having, is an expression of very deep confidence in these things. The word for refuge is, oh no, say it this way, the triple refuge is also sometimes called the triple gem. And a gem is supposed to have in ancient India like crystals. Maybe we call it in Californiaese, we call it the triple crystal because crystals have these wonderful energies and powers or whatever they say, right? So in ancient India, the had idea of gems had certain kind of power inherent in them. And so that Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha had a certain power inherent in these ones. They had this quality, kind of like a gem, something you can rely on and trust and it would protect you, just like some people have crystals to protect them. So these things can protect you. The word for, as I understand it, for a gem or jewel is rattana. And Buddhist ancient teachers like to say the etymology of rattana comes from rati. And rati means, one of the meanings is to delight, to bring joy. And so the triple refuge is that which delights the heart or brings joy to ourselves. So it's not more than just confidence, but that when you have, when you find something you have confidence in, the kind of movement of the heart being inspired and joyful and delighted. Some people have the experience of devotion or faith or reverence, respect in that experience of confidence and delight. And I like to understand that to mean that there has to be something, the triple refuge referred to that which some people feel like they put their heart into it. In order to put your heart into the practice, there has to be some kind of movement of the heart, some movement of inspiration or confidence or joy or reverence or inspiration. And the triple refuge is part of the package that part of the package of the refuge is this idea that the heart's been moved and inspired. If you can't put your heart in what you do, then you're not going to, you're going to do it halfheartedly, right? And you do it halfheartedly, you're not going to get very far. So what does it take to put, you know, to do something wholeheartedly is part of the issue around refuge. There are two categories or division kinds of refuge in that's understood in tradition. And one can be called customary refuge. And the other can be called world transcending refuge. And that's a translation of the Pali words. The customary one is kind of, maybe your person was born into a Buddhist family. And you just assume that you're a Buddhist and you kind of go along with the customs and formalities. And you just take refuge because the customs of the situation. Or it's the kind of refuge where you kind of now you can say that, you know, you're a follower of Buddhism or something like that. You are a Buddhist, perhaps. The world transcending form of refuge is the kind of refuge where you could say that rather than you are, in a sense, you are a Buddhist, you have become Buddhist. Rather than saying that you are generous, you become, you know, the difference between saying you have an identity and then being changed and being that identity. So rather than just identity, I am a Buddhist, you're now living through what could be called Buddhist value, Buddhist orientations, a change of heart, a change of being. The world transcending kind of refuge has to do with some shift out of a self-centered orientation towards these three, what's called the triple refuge. You're not necessarily doing it in order to build up your ego or have an identity as a Buddhist, but you're doing it in order because there's something very much more deeper or broader or bigger, more pervasive that's invaluable here that is bigger than what your ego, your state or self-centered needs might be. The refuges are understood to be a protection. Sometimes they're called a cave. It's a place to go that protects you from something. And what does it protect you from? It's said to protect you from suffering. It's said in the tradition that the refuges are the ultimately reliable refuge and that many places, many things, many things that people put the refuge in, put their trust or confidence in are not ultimately reliable. And so people put their confidence in their bank account or in their job or in a relationship or in their home or in democracy or in all kinds of things. They put their confidence and trust in. But it's said these might be very valuable things, but they're not ultimately reliable. You can't rely on them in every possible circumstances you might find yourself in. And the triple refuge are understood to be ultimately reliable. That's what you can rely on in all circumstances. So they offer protection from suffering, protection from distress. It's said sometimes that when a person is really going for refuge in Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha, there's no longer any basis to complain about the world or to, you know, you might have disagreements with the world and not like how things are going, but you're not going to rail against the world as being the source of your problems and difficulties and assigning the blame outside. So a person would stop complaining when they go for refuge because they understand that the locus, the seat of taking responsibility for their suffering and for the reactions and responses is within themselves. So even though going for refuge is towards these things which can be understood to be outside of oneself, the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha, it's really a way of being reflected back into beginning to understand that in order to live a spiritual life, there has to be some taking responsibility, some sits in our own hearts, in our own minds, some settling here and looking here. So in a sense, the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha resonate or reflect to us something which is deep within ourselves. So it's not really what's out there, but rather what's in here. So to have confidence in the Buddha is to have confidence in the Buddha's enlightenment, that the Buddha is someone who's become free, that somehow he's freed his heart, freed his mind and that he's someone who experienced liberation and that that's possible for human beings to have, that the ways in which we're caught up, afraid, obsessed, the ways in which we get depressed or angry or, you know, the ways in which we suffer is something that can be transformed and changed and become liberated from into a state of great peace, into states of love and compassion, where the mind is feels unhindered, unbounded, unconstricted, unfettered. And to have confidence that the Buddha has done this is part of what it means to take refuge in the Buddha. So it means having some sense of who the Buddha is, whether it's intuitive or sometimes you can read the stories of the Buddha's life or somehow having some sense or maybe some people it's kind of an archetype. The Buddha is more of an archetype of liberation rather than a historical person, though in the Theravada tradition we always come back to what's not archetypical but rather what's immediate and real, human. And the Buddha is understood not to be an archetype in the tradition but rather to be a real human being who walked on the earth, who attained a degree of liberation which affected the people around him and the way in which he affected the people around him has affected people for the next 2500 years down to us. And we wouldn't be here together in this hall if it hadn't been for the liberation that the Buddha experienced. To have confidence in his liberation then becomes an aid or support to have confidence that this is possible for us also. To be inspired, this is possible for human beings. To begin to appreciate that in other people and the tremendous value that has. To have confidence in the Dharma is to have confidence in what the Buddha taught his teachings. That not only was he liberated but he knew somehow how to convey that liberation or the path of liberation to other people. And so to have confidence that he had in his teaching. More deeply it said that to have confidence in the Dharma is to have confidence in the in the path of practice that he taught. So not just his teachings but the path that he taught. That if you enter into the path of the eightfold path, the path of mindfulness, the concentration, if you enter into the path of practice that that's the way you find the Dharma. And so to have confidence in the Dharma is to have confidence in this path that he's teaching, he's pointing to. It's also said that having confidence in the Dharma is to have confidence that the Dharma, the way reality is organized, is set up, is what's often called is lawful. There's a pattern, there's an intelligence in a sense to how reality is organized. And that if we align ourselves with that then we are supported by that. Or if we misalign ourselves from that then it's to our detriment. So if we live a life of that harms others, live a life going out and killing and stealing and doing all kinds of horrible things that are even subtly horrible things, then there's a there's a lawfulness in that. There's an intelligence in the universe, in our psyche perhaps, where that then translates or comes back to us as a greater constriction, greater numbness, greater tightness, greater suffering in our lives. If we align ourselves with goodness, we align ourselves with kindness, with compassion, with generosity, that that then allows for a different kind of movement in the psyche, in the mind, in the heart than if we're stingy or hateful. And that there's a pattern to or intelligence to this that has consequence down through time. So part of having confidence in Dharma is to have confidence in the intelligence or the pattern or the lawfulness of this life that we're living. And then realizing, have confidence in that, that's actually so, if there is an intelligence or a pattern or a lawfulness, then to be inspired to try to live in accord or to live in such a way that the Dharma supports us, that the lawfulness supports us in our lives rather than detracts us from our lives. If we're interested in liberation, to live in a way that with the lawfulness of the world, the karmic unfolding of life supports us rather than detracts from that movement. And all these things are things that are supposed to be found inside of ourselves. So as we sit with ourselves and be with ourselves, we find these things are true. These things actually resonate or are experienced or seen for ourselves. The sangha, the community of people practicing is a very important refuge, but it's very important to remember that in its heart, the center of it, it means those people who've tasted the truth of the Buddha's awakening, what he's pointing to. And people who haven't had some degree of realization, it's not so sure how reliable they really are. To put your refuge in a community like IMC, I mean, we're good people here, but I don't know how many of you have some degree of enlightenment and how many of you could easily kind of do a misstep. So to put refuge in a community, Buddhist community, I've known a lot of people who've done that in naive way and then been deeply hurt when some aspect of the community life went awry. But take refuge in those people who have some degree of enlightenment. It's that those people are really reliable people to take refuge in, to be inspired by, to get a sense, to meet them. One of the things this means for me is that it's no longer the historical Buddha, someone who lived 2,500 years ago, but it's those people who are contemporaries to us, people that we can meet and encounter. There are people in the world who have some degree of realization, of enlightenment, of liberation, and to have a sense of that, to be in their presence, to meet them. It's really a wonderful thing and to have that resonate, that possibility of who they are, that who they are resonate with a possibility inside of ourselves and to go to them as a kind of refuge, a kind of support, to know these people know what it's about, these people can point me in the direction, these people can highlight where the difficulties are. Part of what it means to go for refuge in the community is something a little bit more difficult to talk about, but that is take refuge in the communication or to have something about our practice exist in communication with other people. So it's not just something that happens alone in our own solitary experience, but it's something that happens between people also. It's communicated in some way between people. And what that means, it means many different things in different circumstances. So then for some people, it comes a point in their practice, as they're practicing Buddhism, or maybe not even practicing, but somehow at some point, where they encounter something. They encounter maybe a person, or some degree of freedom or liberation, or some teaching which somehow really speaks to them in a very deep way, penetrates into the hearts deeply. Or perhaps they've done some degree of practice and they've experienced something within themselves that's shifted and changed and changed. And they have some sense, some powerful sense of a new way of orienting one's life that's possible to orient one's life around some new sense of what it means to be a human being. So for example, if a person is very ambitious in their life, and the life is all about consumerism and acquiring things and getting things, and the person spends a lifetime kind of being a collector and getting things and getting things. And then to somehow or other get a hit, somehow that there's another way to live a life that's valuable than always looking out on what you can get. And then to maybe turn away from that and say, okay, now I'm going to orient my life around different value. I'm going to orient my life perhaps around generosity, or perhaps about letting go and being still and being at peace in my own heart, rather than being agitated and looking outward for my satisfaction. So it represents a change, a reorientation in people's lives. So each of you probably has some way in which you have been reoriented, have some sense of maybe a divide in your life between one way you can be, which maybe is not so helpful for you, or not so desirable, or not so enlightened, and another way of living, which is actually much more desirable, inspiring, much more useful, you feel much more at home, you like yourself better when you're out from that place, or it feels more right, or it's more inspiring. So then the question is, how do we live from what we feel is really right? Because it's very easy for many people to swing back into the old ways. So to really want to make that shift, for some people it's very dramatic, they really want to make that shift, and some people feel like they really need to make a dramatic move in order to make that shift from one mode of being, one kind of behavior, to a new one. So some people will do dramatic things, some people will get on an airplane and go to Asia. And for me, my second time I went to practice in Asia, crossing the date line, I made it my little ceremony of reorientation in my life, okay now I'm going to get serious. I have another thing which I'm doing, a little ritual. Some people will do refuge ceremonies. There's ceremony somehow, ritual sometimes speaks to the psyche, sometimes very, very deeply, and really supportive sometimes of deep changes in us that's hard to make kind of intellectually or just out of an act of will. So they do a ceremony of refuge in order to make that shift and change. And for some people it's just something they do kind of more informally in their own hearts, they feel a change, this is now how I want to orient my life and then try to live that way, kind of come from that place. Perhaps at the heart of going for refuge is to have some understanding, intellectual, intuitive or from direct experience of the value of the Four Noble Truths. Very, very simple teachings of the Buddha but tremendously profound. And the teaching in a very brief point to again this thing of you no longer are inclined to complain or blame the world out there for your suffering. That's to understand that our suffering, the way that our heart contracts or our mind gets tight or that our body gets fearful or all the different things that go on, that we can call suffering, that they involve some movement inside of ourselves of holding on, tightening up, of narrowing our identity and that there is a possibility of expanding that identity, relaxing that narrow constriction, that tightness, so that the source of that suffering no longer is there. And so to understand that the heart of Buddhist practice is within ourselves. But in understanding that, to have the support then of the triple refuge is very, very important because it's very hard to do this. It's very hard to maintain the continuity, to have the courage or the inspiration or the patience to really engage wholeheartedly in the Buddhist path or in a spiritual path on one's own without being supported by something other than oneself. Maybe a few fantastic, you know, amazing individuals can do that but for most people there needs to be some support. And the triple refuge is symbolic, represents the healthy places we can get that kind of support for this transformation that we would like to do for ourselves. So there's the customary refuge and then there's the world transcending refuge. And world transcending refuge doesn't mean that we're kind of leaving the world behind and going off in some mountain top or some ethereal realm. World transcending here means that I think in probably Western psychological language would be called transcending our self-centeredness, transcending the tendency to cling or hold on to an identity of who we are in relationship to ourselves and the world around us. So to go to the world transcending refuge is to take refuge in that experience or that dimension of life which is not of the ego. And one way of understanding suffering and the genesis of suffering is much of it, if not all of it, comes from some attachment to a sense of self. A sense of self is kind of like a magnet for all kinds of other things. And so to have that kind of refuge where we take refuge in that which is bigger than our ego, some people might say that part of who we are which is bigger than our constricted sense of self or small sense of self. So that's a little bit about this first turning, turning of going for refuge. Do you have any questions about that? Anything you want clarification? No, I sit here and reflect. I realize one of the reasons why I haven't formally taken the refuge is because of something in the subconscious mind, having aware that it's a very big event. Take what? Good. That thing's beautiful what you said by taking it that seriously. I think anything's allowable. Any degree of being interested in practice or waking up is great. And any degree to using the Buddha Dharma Sangha as a support or as a reference is great. So it doesn't have to be all or nothing. It doesn't have to be like, I'm now going to be a Buddhist, I'm going to become a nun or a monk or something. So a lot of people will go for refuge in milder ways. It's like, oh, this is really important, but other things are equally important in my life, or even maybe more important, but this is important enough that I'm going to make some commitment to this, play some value in this. And then other people for whom going for refuge is maybe the most important turning point in their life and there's no looking back. Then everything in their life now is going to be oriented around this new value. And I like to say it's instead of, a lot of people are interested in about how can I bring this Buddhist practice more into my life, which is a great question. But for someone who makes a radical refuge, complete refuge, the question then is not how I can bring Buddhism into my life, but how do I bring my life into Buddhism, into Buddhist practice? Because Buddhist practice is what the central thing my life is about. So let's bring my life into that. One of the ways of doing what you're asking that's supportive of this ready of refuge, which is to chant, the triple refuge every day. And this is very common in monasteries and temples that chant at least once a day and maybe more. And it doesn't have to be chanting, it can be just saying it to oneself silently or whatever. And one of the important principles of the heart is that the beautiful aspects of our heart are strengthened by the recognition of them. So if the refuge resonates with something beautiful inside of ourselves, some beautiful inspiration or values or something, by recognizing them, by stating the triple refuge, it strengthens that part of our hearts. So chanting the refuges or saying them every day is a very powerful thing. Another practice which is often done in Southeast Asia is spending some time maybe at the beginning of each meditation session reflecting on the qualities of the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. So maybe taking the first 10 minutes and thinking about the qualities of who the Buddha is and how the Dharma and the Sangha. So it's not something external to you but something inside of you. And it might be for some people they might not know what to do in a situation. It might be a crisis but they don't really know how to fix the crisis of what to do. But there's always that refuge to go. And it's not a refuge that kind of takes us away from the experience where irresponsible, but it's a refuge that helps us be calm and centered and present more fully, maybe perhaps take care of it. And for some people it's very simple. It's simply, I don't know what to do here, but I know there is a way. And I'll take refuge in that way. I know there's a way, you know, and that can help kind of loosen things up. Yes. You were speaking about chanting. And I feel like I haven't really since I've been heard of chanting. I've been doing the loving kindness. Is that all right to constantly instead of chanting? Sure. And so that is a kind of a chanting if you keep doing just doing like loving kindness. I hadn't thought about it that way, but you could see it that way. I think a chanting is saying something out loud, toning it out loud in a certain way. Whereas doing loving kindness silently, I wouldn't call it chant. But you know, it maybe has the same function. So where would I, I understand. I mean, would I, with the act of the truth, I mean, coming to have really experienced chanting. Yeah. So would I really be looking at reading knowledge, figuring out the book? So would I be looking for a coming person? Yeah, we don't do a lot of chanting at IMC. It's obvious. And probably do less than we would be useful. But in our particular tradition, the place where you get the most chanting is with a monastics. So when the monastics come, there's usually chanting. And or if you go visit one of the monasteries or where they are, they do a lot of chanting, beautiful chanting. And I wouldn't be surprised if you contacted one of the monasteries like in Yukaya, they would send, they could send you a tape of their chanting.
