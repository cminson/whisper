The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
The pleasure it is to be here practicing with you all and with our friends on
online. So tonight I wanted to say a few words about, I think all of us, probably
many of us, have this experience that the more we practice mindfulness, the more
we practice meditation. Maybe there's something that we learned the hard way
that maybe I learned the hard way, is that an orientation and attitude, a
stance of kindness is so helpful. I might even say mandatory, because right as our
meditation practice we start to see all the little movements of the mind, which
we're not so kind to ourselves, in which we might not be kind in our minds to
others, and then we can just kind of get snagged and stuck and especially with
the unkindnesses towards ourselves, we can really, you know, grow and end up
really being, so that meditation practice is so uncomfortable and maybe even
unhelpful. So mindfulness, I know like Jack Cornfield now, he talks about
mindfulness, he talks about his loving awareness as this way to emphasize this
the warm-hearted quality that's associated with mindfulness practice. And
maybe we hear this in Dharma talks that we should have this, maybe non-judgmental
we use this kind of language or available allowing, accepting or something
like this to help point to this attitude that's so helpful with the
mindfulness practice. So today I'd like to talk a little bit about another
doorway in, another doorway that can really support our meditation practice,
support our mindfulness practice, and that is loving kindness practice, meta
practice. Some people have a lot of resistance, have a lot of reluctance,
pushback. I do not like this practice, loving kindness practice. It's not
uncommon. I certainly did. I thought like, okay, I don't know what that loving
kindness practice is, but it sounds sappy, sentimental, ooey, gooey, sticky. I don't
know, I just didn't even before I even really had done the practice, just the
whole idea of it for me felt like, okay, not not so interesting. So maybe I'll
just say a few words about loving kindness practice here is this, it's the cultivation
of the intention to have some warm-heartedness. And I like this
language warm-heartedness because it's kind of vague. And I like it because it's
the opposite of cold. I mean kind of have an idea what it means to be cold, you
know, to give somebody the cold shoulder or to be, you know, off-putting that
somehow to be cold is to not be welcoming. So I like this idea of warm-heartedness,
warmth or warm-heartedness kind of bringing in the heart quality, but maybe
we could even just say warmth. So loving kindness practice is not so much that we
have to or it's insisted upon that we generate, manufacture, engineer, create
some warm-heartedness. But it's more about intentionally creating the
conditions in which that might arise. No guarantees that it's going to arise, but
we create the conditions with the understanding that giving the heart and
the mind and making this distinction, which might even be artificial, but the
understanding that the being, this psychophysical being, if we can allow it
to rest, abide in, dwell in, experience some warm-heartedness, then it just
becomes easier and easier to access that warm-heartedness when we need it. It
becomes easier and easier for this warm-heartedness to be a support in all
areas of our lives, not just loving kindness. In fact, it's most common that
the effects of metapractice first really show up in one's daily life before they
might even show up in your meditation practice. You might be doing some meta
practice and it might feel dry and stale and a little bit forced maybe and feel
like I don't, I don't know why I'm doing this, but then you just notice that you
start to be a little bit nicer to the other drivers on the road. You start to
be a little bit nicer to the neighbor that doesn't put their garbage cans away
and time or you know whatever it might be. Probably everybody knows this, but I'll
just mention that loving kindness practice is kind of done systematically.
Classically it's done. There's lots of different ways you can do it, but one way
is systematically starting where it's easy and then expanding out to where it's
more and more difficult. And it's often not always done with repeating phrases, so
don't worry this whole talk is not going to be about loving kindness practice. I
just wanted to introduce it and I wanted to talk a little bit about some of
why we might have hesitation around it and one particular place in which I
think it can be really a great support for us in our regular practice. I know
that there's some years ago there was this expression no pain no gain and right
we hear this for like physical activities and I hadn't heard it for a
while but then I just heard it today like no pain no gain and there's so many
ways I think that we often bring this idea to all areas of our lives, including
our meditation practice. And so there's a way in which we might bring this to
thinking that meta practice, loving kindness, maybe it's not so useful because
it doesn't seem like it's painful enough or it doesn't seem like you know to have
this warm-heartedness like what benefit can that be when you hear me say this or
it sounds a little bit ridiculous but there might be a way in which in the
back of our minds we have this little bit of an idea about this. So that would be
one reason why people have this hesitation or reluctance around loving
kindness practice is it might feel too sappy or sentimental or it doesn't feel
like it's strenuous enough or difficulty enough or something like this but
there's another reason too. And that is because sometimes loving kindness practice
when we start it it might bring up a lot of difficulties from our hearts might
bring up a lot of pain in a way that mindfulness practice doesn't to be
sure mindfulness practice can also but loving kindness practice might get at
some of the other aspects of our experience and bring up some of these
difficulties. And to be sure that sometimes what it brings up is the exact
opposite of loving kindness. Another Dharma teacher tells this story. So now I
can't remember if it was this Dharma teacher or if they were talking about
practitioner that shared with them but nevertheless the person was doing walking
meditation and doing with metapractice to kind of repeating the phrases and they
found themselves saying these phrases I hate meta I hate meta you know just kind
of this you just these things kind of floating up right and the opposite and
then when you realize oh my goodness what's happening and I've had similar
things too happening may you be happy and then beep like I would say like you
know summer so it's can be surprising and then of course none of us want to
think that we have hatred inside of us or ill will or something like this so
really doesn't conform with the ways that we want to think about ourselves so
it's can be really uncomfortable and Jack cornfield has this expression that I
really love I appreciate 20 talks about some of the difficulties that might come
up with any kind of practice but I'd like to say maybe specifically with
metapractice and that is that unfinished business of the heart so whatever it is
some of those pains and difficulties that are recurring that maybe a deep in
some ways they show up in so many different they manifest they show up in
so many different ways often this could be a sadness or grief or anger or some
hatred even and of course some of this unfinished business of the heart might
even show up as some bodily pains maybe we don't recognize it at first but or
maybe just part of the difficulties are bodily pains to you know sitting in
meditation it's not the most comfortable certainly at the beginning in one's
practice so that's the second reason why sometimes loving kindness practices we
can have a hesitation towards it is because we might have tried it and
unknowingly just the difficulties came up a third reason and there's actually
some clinical data on this where they had to some group of individuals doing
some mindfulness practice and some individuals doing loving kindness
practice and asked them you know a whole bunch of questions before during and
after you know these being trained to do these different meditation styles and
what they learned was that at the beginning if you were to compare
mindfulness practice and loving kindness everybody prefers mindfulness
because loving kindness feels way too complicated and you have to remember
these phrases and who are you going to do it with and you know there's all this
maybe it just seems too busy or it just felt like too much effort but then
through I think it was like eight weeks after eight weeks that had switched
where after having done it for some time everybody preferred loving kindness
practice over mindfulness practice partly because it felt like you know it
was a way to be kind to themselves and they could feel some shifting happening
in the way that they were viewing themselves and others no guarantees
right that this is going to happen but I just kind of want to validate if there's
some like this initial resistance it just feels too complicated I don't want to do
it so one thing I want to talk about is how is it a maybe how can we work with
some of these difficulties that arise with a loving kindness practice but not
only that how might what we're doing meant to practice doing practicing
loving kindness how might it be especially suited to work with certain
types of difficulties that show up in our lives that show up in our mindfulness
practice so can we if we're doing mindfulness practice sorry meta practice
encouragement of course is if we can can we just expand the loving kindness to
include the difficulty just in the same way that we would with mindfulness
right we would just kind of bring whatever that difficulty might be so for
example if we're saying phrases may you be happy may you be healthy can we also
include the sadness but sometimes arises sometimes when we're wishing people may
you be happy what comes to mind is all the times we have not been happy all the
times they have not been happy maybe it come may you be happy and then we start
to think and maybe it's just for a flash we start to think like no wonder you're
not happy it's so many terrible things are happening and off we go right and
this kind of a mind stream so if we discover that oh yeah there's some
sadness can we in some way be acknowledging the sadness but still
saying may you be happy may you be healthy safe may you live with ease
sometimes with loving kindness practice there may be a real sense of boredom
we're saying these phrases so opposite of sadness right which is juicy and feel
like we have to work with it and but what if there isn't anything particular
happening and instead we're just reciting phrases having this intention of
cultivating loving kindness can we just be bored be saying these phrases that
feels dry sometimes not forcing ourselves not tightening down and drilling in
but can we still may may I be happy maybe we feel like a little bit of
suffering then and we can bring a little bit of compassion practice in for
ourselves but sometimes there can be some anxiety that arises just thinking
about having us and health so can we just make space for that while we are
continuing to do the phrases is one way we might work with difficulties that
are happening in this way we let the practice be inclusive instead of kind
of like insisting that things be match our preferences and we're more relaxing
or softening in all the ways in which we divide our experiences between this is
okay and that isn't okay like may you be happy and to notice yeah there's there's
sadness also I'll talk a little bit more about what to do if there's some real
sadness but there may if there's some twinge or some recognition of some grief
there can we allow our loving kindness practice to be inclusive so then maybe
we can think about our loving kindness practice be less about befriending
ourselves befriending others and maybe more it's about just befriending each
moment and is there a way that we can meet each moment with kindness instead of
trying to shove it away or having a version or grabbing onto it so tightly
whatever it might be so I want to read some words by Rosemary Traumer she's
this I think a very beautiful poet and part of the reason why there's a number
of reasons why I like this poem it's very short is that she talks about blue
herons and I just love blue herons they have this majesty about them those of
you don't know they're they're they're big birds maybe that's what makes them
seem so majestic they can be like three or four feet tall and their wings pants
are like you know six feet and I often go walking at a place where I could see
them I have an uncle who's lives on the east coast and he's often he's a
professional photographer and he also likes to go for hikes and stuff and
whenever he sees a blue hair and he always like sends it because you know
it's just there just have this majesty about them so here's this poem by Rosemary
Traumer nudged by hope the heart rises from exhaustion it's like the great blue
hair and I saw this morning flying up from a wasteland on broad gray wings with
strong slow beats for a moment charged with grace before did you see this
heart it chose to land again bringing all its beauty to the desolate place so we
can imagine that starts here that this great blue hair and leaves this
wasteland like this like there's nothing here it's a wasteland going up with
these kind of graceful way and then deciding to come back down I love this
idea that some ways of living kindness practice maybe is like this right this
beautiful bird she describes it as bringing all its beauty to this desolate
place there might be this wish initially to leave like okay I don't want to be
with this difficulty maybe taking a few beats and then landing again so we keep
coming back to the practice whether it's mindfulness or loving kindness but just
this idea of keeping coming back increasing our capacity for loving
kindness and I started talking about loving kindness as warm-heartedness and
I was appreciating the vagueness of it but maybe it's even too ambitious warm
-heartedness maybe it's helpful and supportive to think about it as not
dwelling in aversion not dwelling in aversion so maybe it's warm-heartedness
maybe we don't even have access to that but to just orient the mind in the heart
away from ill will away from aversion a will away from insisting demanding in
our minds if not actually that things be different so bringing all its beauty to
this desolate place in this poem is a way that it transforms the place so that
it's no longer desolate so it's no longer bleak it's no longer abandoned but
instead we choose to stay as best we can as best we can maybe we're a great blue
heron and then we turn into a crow that is crying making sounds and the bird
that's this is very different and then maybe we are a great blue heron again I
don't know but and to be sure sometimes it's really skillful to drop the loving
kindness and to bring mindfulness to the difficulties but can we meet it with
acceptance and kindness maybe this is where working with difficulties while
doing loving kindness practice really helps us with this very thing to meet
difficulties to meet all the ways in which we might get stuck with some
warm-heartedness or not dwelling in aversion and just having that experience
of doing that can help us in our daily life certainly but also in our
mindfulness practice so probably all of you know there are these five perennial
ways with practice in which our clarity gets obscured in which there's these
forces of distraction or agitation that arise or whether it's in our mindfulness
practice or in our meta practice it's called the five hindrances of conflict
five types of things that get in the way I'll just mention them here I'm not
gonna talk about all of them but just so that we recognize that we have sensual
desire ill will sloth and torpor restlessness doubt so many of our
things that get in the way I'm using this language get in the way but that was
sometimes we it's not actually in the way it is the practice but we feel like
it's some like hindering or not not supporting us and of course these five
it's a natural part of every human experience they are not personal
failings when they arise train meditation but how often do we think that
when they do arise oh I'm doing something wrong I'm not a very good meditator
this meditation practice is not going well probably that person sitting next to
me is doing fine but the committee I'm having all this aversion or I'm feeling
so restless or whatever it might be but instead of personal failings can we just
see them as part of our practice and there can be a way in which because these
will arise during metta meditation as well as mindfulness meditation if there
is a way in which we can make it a point oh yeah one metta and I see these
hindrances I feel these hindrances arise this is such a great way to practice
with hindrances precisely because we might if we're doing metta practice maybe
we're less likely to naturally fall into these ideas of oh I'm a terrible
meditator I can't meditate I'm hopeless it can be an opportunity for us to say
I'm a terrible meditator and may I be happy I am hopeless and may I be
peaceful this is terrible I can't do this and may I live with ease so just to
fold it in with the phrases that we're saying because part of what meditation
practice is is to help us something all of us know this about you know we rewire
the brain and it's amazing right how much this inner critic shows up and how
much this inner critic telling us that we can't do it we shouldn't even try or
everybody else can do it or whatever the however it shows up or whatever words
that uses for you and it can be really powerful this inner critic it can really
undermine our practice our lives but to work with it while we're doing metta
makes it very so much easier to notice the inner critic and to counter the
words counter these phrases with one may I be happy so that there's a ways like
if this word come if this sentence comes up oh you're a terrible meditator and
then to say may I be happy kind of like takes the the authority out from this
idea may I'm a terrible meditator maybe it helps soften the the blow so to speak
that might even become familiar that we haven't even noticed but with loving
kindness practice we can start to undo or rewire some of those neural circuits
that might be such a habit that we don't even notice a second way in which it can
be really helpful and fruitful for our lives and for our meditation practice in
general to be working with hindrances to be working with difficulties while
we're doing meta practice while we're doing loving kindness practice is because
there might be some repeated patterns that we have probably all of us have
repeated patterns of difficulties that arise in our lives and of course arise
in our meditation and one way to work with these some of these repeated
patterns so just do a very gentle inquiry what is asking for acceptance what
is asking for some warm-heartedness what is asking for us to not be dwelling in
aversion with regards to it and if we have been practicing loving kindness and
have this intention to have this warmth or to have this openness or spaciousness
that might be just be creating the conditions in which it might become
clear what is asking for acceptance and to be clear I'm not talking about doing
a very like type of archaeological dig or you know discovering exactly what it
is that thing that happened when you were eight years old and you know
whatever it might be but there's something about asking the question it's
not so much about finding the answer is about asking the question what is it
that's asking for acceptance what is it that's asking for kindness what's asking
to be loved to be seen within us so if we if we're in the doing loving kindness
practice there it might be a way in which the conditions are such that there
might be some new insight some new understanding that becomes available
because these repeated patterns they remain because there's some level of
resistance right there's something that's not being accepted there's
something that we continually are trying to push away or not acknowledge and so
in the scheme of not trying in the scheme of practicing kindness that might be
just the conditions in which there might be some new understanding and so this
also asks you know that this asking us maybe what's to be asking for
acceptance is our fear or judgments our aversions not always easy to see this in
ourselves sometimes it doesn't match the image we want to have of ourselves but
this process of gentle warm-hearted investigation can be transformative in
such a way that maybe there isn't a big bang and everything gets resolved and
we live happily ever after but there can just be a little bit of a shift by
having practiced some loving kindness to be seeped in that and to ask what's what's
need for acceptance it can be a little bit different understanding so maybe one
last thing here that I'll talk about with working with difficulties in the
context of doing loving kindness practice is when there are difficulties whether
it's emotional difficulties physical ones or whatever ones they are whatever
they might be there's a way in which our attention can shrink and the only thing
that we notice is what is difficult at that moment we have this pain in our
knee then it just becomes all about can I move my knee now should I wait to move
it or it's I shouldn't have walked that extra mile this week or I thought I would
be better maybe I should call the doctor you know whatever it is there's the all
of our attention tends to be about the knee or if it's this repeated patterns
I'm talking about some of these emotional ones for example there might be a
repeated story I'm just making this up about the divorce of our parents and
and over and over about what happened to which child or and when or you know
something like this and then we might have this maybe this memory or this
thought that just shows up repeatedly in the context of loving kindness retreat
what this shows up is there a way in which we can expand the field of
attention or there I talked about when there's pain in the knee it's always the
knee but now I'm talking about maybe there's this thought or this memory so
it's more a bodily experience so can we expand it so what do I mean by that this
idea with the let's say this story that I'm so with the divorce of the parents
and there's this pain or is or there's this memory that keeps on coming up
that's that's more like a mental event a memory to expand is to say oh how does
that feel in the body to bring in something a little bit more than just
that difficulty how does this thought feel in the body what is this oh we might
recognize oh there's some tightness in the chest and the diaphragm and a lump
in the throat and with that just expanding that this area of awareness
already that has a little bit of a shift so we're not completely consumed with
this with the memory and with that little bit of shift there's a little bit of
space just a little bit of maybe a little more breathing room and then we
might also ask ourselves maybe maybe it'll be skillful maybe not something
for you to explore for yourself if it seems like the appropriate thing to do
but we could then with this expanding our awareness and now a little bit more
space we could ask ourselves is it true and of course we're gonna think well
yes it's true I'm thinking it so it is true or we might think well that's kind
of rude to ask right there's this of course it's true feeling but again this
just kind of dropping in this gentle warm-hearted inquiry makes space for
something else to unfold something else to arise something else to happen in the
context of it when we were doing meta-practice this warm-heartedness you
know is it true might allow for well part of it's true but maybe not the
magnitude or maybe even just the answer is I don't know so there may be a time
in which it's not helpful to ask this question is it true but there might be a
time in which it is supportive and is wise and so that's all of us to find our
way with this but if we find like we're really stuck and if we're doing loving
kindness practice and just find that we can't connect or we can't do the loving
kindness practice this is a way in which we might be able to find a little bit
more ease so our difficulties are often found you know in the body the pain in
the knee in the mind memories about something that happened emotionally or
energetically or something like this but this idea that can we be expand of our
awareness can we become aware of another dimension of it of this persistent
visitor we'll use that word visitor so beyond what's the obvious beyond what's
the most prominent way it shows up because this release or a shift or a
type of letting go only can if we find that we're stuck a release can only
happen if we kind of are shifting our way that we are with the difficulty what
I mean by that is the way that our stance our perspective and so often the
easiest way to do that is to if we find it's a mental thing to go to the body if
we find it's a bodily thing well to go maybe to a neutral place in the body or
maybe to hearing but to shift a little bit our our awareness what we're bringing
to our attention and then of course this expanding our awareness helps us to
become a little bit disidentified with whatever it is that's causing the
difficulty and that can open up space to recognizing what else is here if we've
been practicing some loving-kindness there might be might be some of this
residual this residue the perfume maybe of some warm-heartedness even if right
then we haven't there might have been easy access or easier access to that if
we had just been practicing it earlier and it might be a way in which that we
can orient towards the warm-heartedness as a way to make space and
disidentify with difficulties so tonight I talked a little bit about why
there are difficulties even starting a loving-kindness practice there's a
number of different reasons why people have a hesitation or reluctance to not
even do loving-kindness practice and then I talked about some of the ways in
which we can work with difficulties while we are doing loving-kindness
practice and the way in which it might be a really fruitful place to work with
loving I'm sorry with difficulties of course mindfulness practice is very
skillful in a way to do that too but there might be some ways in which in the
context of living-kindness practice to work with difficulties can be really
helpful also there's something about
reminding ourselves of the goodness the warm-heartedness that exists in
everybody ourselves and in others that can really make it can be
transformative and can be really powerful practice as an alternative to maybe
just feeling stuck or feeling like we can't find our way forward or in a way
that doesn't feel like it's supporting our life or our practice so that we can
show up for our life and our practice and show up for others in a way that is
supportive helpful uplifting so that all of us can find more freedom more ease
and more peace so thank you
