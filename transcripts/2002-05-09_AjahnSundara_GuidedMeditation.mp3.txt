 Give a little bit of guidance just in the beginning for those who have never done any practice before. All right. For you. So, and those who have some experience, just listen to my words as if you were listening to sounds. You don't want them to be in the way of your quiet mind. Okay? Just listen to them as if they were just leaf in the wind. So for the others, for those who have never done this before, sit upright with your back straight up. Your spine should be held straight if you can, with your hands resting on top of the other. It doesn't have to be so. You can relax your hands on your knees or just let them relax. This just gives you the standard posture. Make sure your chin is slightly tucked in so your neck and your spine are aligned. Relax your face. It doesn't hurt to smile a little bit. You find that it makes a great difference just to spend about 10 seconds smiling to space. And you don't need to close your eyes if you don't want to. You can keep your eyes slightly open or closed as you wish. And for the next few minutes, just feel what it is just to be still physically sitting. Your attention is turned inwardly now so you're not distracted by what's going on around you. Just bring in one's attention onto the body, just sitting, feeling, relaxing into your posture, breathing normally. How do you feel now? How are you feeling? Let your mind, your attention rest in what is happening in this moment right now without trying to figure it out, figure out what's going on. Just let it, whatever feelings, whatever sensations are rising in this moment, just let it be as it is. As I said, breathing naturally, normally. Feel the space around the body as you are sitting, breathing, sensing the body. Maybe your mind is wandering in all directions, thinking about this, thinking about that, remembering this, remembering that, trying to figure out this or that. For the time being, you don't need to reject or push away any of this mental activity. Just let it be, don't touch it, just leave it there and come back to your body, breathing, sensing the sensations in the body. How are you feeling right now? Is there any pain in your body, any physical pain? Is there any tension, any tingling sensations or pressure or feeling of weight, density or lightness? Note how you are feeling, bringing your attention into the whole, entering the body, entering the heart. Note how you are in your awareness of the body and in the present moment, note how things come and go, how thoughts and feelings and sensations just don't remain the same for very long. Take note of that, you don't need to think about it, just look at it with your awareness, being aware of the movement of the body and the heart. Relaxing more and more, letting your breath gently help you to relax, especially on your out-breath, notice the in-breath and the out-breath, very gently like a little background sound. You feel the in-breath and the out-breath in the background and in the space of the present moment, all sorts of things come up and you just let them be and take their own course naturally. Always gently and with a lot of kindness towards yourself, it's not a time of fighting and struggling and sorting things out, it's just a time of calming down and making peace with oneself, time of rest, time of friendship with one's heart. Relaxing more and more, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath gently help you to relax, let your breath of your momentary experience. So stretch your legs, relax your back. Stand up if you need to.
