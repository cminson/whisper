The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So the topic for this evening is about Dharma and time travel.
So this is continuing in this series about Dharma and magic that I've been doing these last couple weeks.
So first we talked about the Dharma of Harry Potter, some of you are here for that.
Then last week we talked about the Dharma of Resurrection.
This week is Dharma of Time Travel and next week is going to be Dharma and the Magic Internet.
So this week, time travel. So I bet that all of you did some time travel, even in the last half hour of the sitting.
So how many people while you were sitting had a memory of something that happened in the past to come up?
Pretty much, yeah.
And how many people had some thought of something that might happen in the future?
Could be the near future, like when will they ring the bell?
Or it could be the extended future, what you would do when you got out of here.
It could be the way extended future, what you do for vacation, etc.
So time travel in some ways is magic, in some ways we do it all the time.
The concept of time itself I think is something both mysterious and also very important to us.
Both on a very mundane level in our life and also extremely profound.
Like I think understanding time is a way of understanding the deepest of the truths that there is to know.
So for myself this was a big driver in my own spiritual practice, I could call it, as a young person.
I was kind of a very curious child and I remember thinking about time a lot and trying to understand time.
Like what is time? How does that work? How does it go?
You know there's one kind of time that's in the clock and then it seems to be some kind of regular agreed upon time,
like this second hand ticks and it's the same amount of time,
but then some time would seem to stretch on for a really long period, subjectively in one's experience.
Like if I was in a class that I didn't really like, it seemed like going on a long time.
But then if I was doing something that I really liked it would seem like it was gone like that,
the time just flew, it was gone instantly.
So what is this time and what is the past?
And I remember trying to look to freeze time in some ways.
I would do some experiments of trying to say like,
okay this is now 8, 10 p.m. here on October 6, 2011, trying to remember that.
And then we're like, okay what happened to that? Where did that go?
Like what happened to that? That was the now, is now the past, and now what is that?
So playing with that a lot.
So in the Buddhist teaching the scope of time, first of all I should say,
the scope of time that's talked about on the relative level is actually vast.
And I think it's helpful to get some orientation to this.
So it's both expanded in terms of vastness beyond what we usually consider in sort of modern western life.
And it also is even brought to a very infinitesimal small gradients of time
in a way that's hard for us to imagine.
So I'll describe this to you.
So for example, you know we'd say like a second or millisecond or something like that.
Now in the Buddhist teaching what we conceive of reality is actually the arising and rapid succession
of different mind moments, I could say.
And each of these mind moments is actually an experience of consciousness meeting with an object.
And the consciousness can come through any of the six main sense doors.
So the sense doors are the ones that you usually think about.
So seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, hearing.
And then the mind is the sixth sense door.
So in every moment of existence, each mind moment, there is a sense experience arising with consciousness
in the moment and then passing away.
Then the next one, then passing away.
Next one, passing away.
So then everything that we call an experience, everything that we call something is actually
sort of a rapid succession of these mind moments in some way
that have aggregated together and we're calling it this or that.
So it could be like a sight, then a sound, then a smell, then a taste, then a sight, then et cetera.
So even if you are looking at your hand, like your hand, say oh, look at my hand, right?
So look at your hand now, if you will.
So there you see something, there's a sight.
But then also you might be experiencing something that you call your hand, like energetically, right?
Like an experience of that.
And it could be pulsing, it could be cold, it could be hot, stuff like that.
And then there's the sight again, right?
But those are actually two distinct things.
So the sight of the hand, the color, the shape, the outline,
is actually different than the experience of the energetic movement there, right?
Now it's happening in rapid succession so it seems like it's the same
and then conceptually say okay, this is a hand, so that's good, it's fine.
It works for conventional description.
But actually it's these different arising experiences together, right?
So they're actually, in each second there's actually like thousands, millions of these mind moments.
Like it happens so fast that unless you actually really are able to develop your concentration,
which you can, by the way, it's difficult to be able to see them
with a sort of mundane level of concentration that we have.
But it's possible to sort of, it's kind of like instead of watching a movie
to actually see the frames on the film strip, you know,
which then when you play it fast it becomes the film, right?
So in each, you know, blink of an eye in the snap of a finger,
there's thousands, millions of these mind moments, right?
So that's the gradient of very fine time.
Now then on the other end of the spectrum there's this vast sense of time.
So the sense of time of the universe, of expansion, contraction of the universe,
which has happened innumerable times in the Buddhist cosmology, right?
Expansion, contraction, destruction of world systems, on and on.
So how long is this time?
And they go into like Kalpas, Mahakalpas.
So it's only able to be described in metaphors.
So supposing that there was a large mountain,
and this mountain was 16 miles high, 16 miles around.
So this is much bigger than Mount Everest, right?
Bigger than any mountain.
And every hundred years a bird flew by this mountain with the silk scarf in its mouth,
and the scarf brushed the mountain.
So the amount of time that it took the mountain to grind down to nothing
is less time than this Mahakalpa, right?
It was a huge, vast expanse of time.
Or another metaphor is if you have a huge cube,
there's 16 miles by 16 miles by 16 miles, right?
So bigger than your biggest Tupperware container, right?
And here now, every hundred years,
you put one mustard seed into this cube, every hundred years.
So then the amount of time that it takes for this cube to fill up
also is less time than the Mahakalpa, this, you know, eons and eons kind of thing, right?
So it's kind of mind-boggling in some way, right?
There's like, how much time is that?
That's so vast, right?
And then even the small gradient of time is kind of mind-boggling.
How small is that?
Like, can I actually learn to see that?
Can I see this, you know, kind of gradients of time like that?
And then what is there in between, too?
If anything.
So one of the helpful and interesting things that I learned
when I was first practicing was about this thing that I described to you
about the six scent stores.
So, you know, mind as a scent store is a new concept, you know,
for most people educated in the West.
And it basically simplifies the idea of time instantly.
So basically, here's the story on that, is that everything that we call the past,
yeah, this is a vast generalization coming up,
but everything that we call the past is actually only a thought in the present.
And everything that we call the future is also a thought in the present.
So actually, all there is is the present in terms of time.
There's only this, you know, the eternally arising now, now, now,
some of which we label past, some of which we label future,
and there you have it, it's all wrapped up there.
So a helpful thing about that is that when you pay attention,
particularly with mindfulness to what it is that we take to be true,
what we perceive to be true,
and also once we start to pay attention with mindfulness
to what it is that is the cause of our suffering.
So what is it that's causing this difficulty suffering in our life?
You can start to notice that a lot of it is actually caught up
in this little conundrum here about this past and future business.
Not all of it, but a lot of it is caught up in this past and future business.
So grieving about the past and reaching out for the future.
So this sense of leaning backwards, leaning forwards.
So actually not being able to be in this constant now.
So having some different kind of relationship to what arises in our mind as a thought
than that it's just a thought.
So our inability to see thought as thought is a big source of suffering for us.
So check it out and see if this is true in your own experience as you go through.
And this is actually among the promises of our practice
is that you'll be able to let go of grief and longing.
Grief and longing are two big sources of suffering for us.
They also are ways in which we believe that we are able to create the world
or we're able to control the world.
So something that happened in the past, for example, is already gone.
So it's only a thought in the present now.
So there is in fact actually nothing that you can do about that at this moment
as far as it already having transpired.
Also that which we're imagining as the future is not here, is never here.
By the time it's here, it's actually the present.
So the sense of longing, of leaning out of the present moment,
leaning out of what's really here right now towards some imaginary future
or towards some imaginary past is a way that we spend a lot of our time
missing what's actually happening right now in our own imagined constructed world.
And in this imagined constructed world, things are sometimes good
and things are sometimes bad.
So there's a well-known quote from Mark Twain.
It's something like,
the most calamitous things in my life never actually happened.
So it's basically like you imagine all these terrible things that could happen
like what if this or what if that.
And actually live that out in your mind,
suffering as if you're actually going through that.
But it didn't actually happen, right?
It never happened, like you're still sitting here.
So this happens in, you know,
technicolor when you're sitting in meditation.
It's helpful to see this in practice because you're sitting in this like
relatively decent room, right?
Temperature is relatively okay, you know,
not too terribly uncomfortable.
And meanwhile you go through like the hells in the heavens,
like ups and downs, right?
You know, just sitting here quietly breathing,
no one's really bothering you except yourself, right?
And it's quite amazing to see that, right?
So the other story that I like about this is,
you know, the person who goes into a cave,
Monk goes into a cave and paints a picture of a tiger,
and then looks at it and says,
ah, tiger, and like runs out of the cave, right?
So this is what we're also doing all the time
when we're having these thoughts about the past, about the future,
and believing them and reacting to them,
and, you know, then a whole drama plays out, right?
So here's, this is like the dangers of time travel right there.
The dangers of time travel in that particular way, right?
But it still is a mystery, right?
It seems like there is something called time.
It seems like there's a present.
It seems like there's a past.
And it seems like there's a future.
And in fact, actually, some of our,
some of the teachings of the Buddha point to the importance
of realizing that in some way.
So for example, you know, one of the teachings about the characteristics
that it's helpful to understand is that of impermanence.
So that everything is always changing.
And change can only happen if there is something
that we could see of as time, right?
And particularly, it's helpful to understand change
as it pertains to oneself.
So the thing that we identify with most is usually our body,
our mind, some sense of identity, et cetera.
And we feel like there's some sense of solidity there,
some sense of permanence, something that we thus need to protect,
something that we need to make sure everyone believes
the same thing that we do about,
something that we want to stay in a certain format all the time.
We pour all this energy into that whole project, right?
That whole, like, project doomed to fail, in fact, right?
So among the practices, and I talked about this in the last one,
the Dharma Resurrection is actually the reflection on the fact that,
you know, I am aging.
I am of the nature to age. I have not gone beyond aging.
I'm of the nature to die.
I have not gone beyond death. You know, I'm going to die, right?
So all of us are going to die, whoever you are, right?
So this week, now that I'm down in the peninsula,
I'll reference, you know, Steve Jobs died, right?
Guy invented a whole bunch of things, right?
Very wealthy. He had done a lot of different things,
but still, you know, he couldn't invent eternal life, right?
Also passed away.
And that's true of every single person,
including the Buddha, including Gandhi, including Jesus,
including everyone, right?
So none of us are exempt from this law, really.
So there is a way in which it's helpful to realize this,
but the helpfulness of realizing it is that there's only now, really, right?
There's only the moment.
So both the idea, like, we're going to live forever and we're eternal,
and, you know, I get all the time in the world is not true, right?
And also not recognizing, like, what is really here in the moment is also,
like, a delusion, too.
There's all kinds of, like, stories about time travel.
And, you know, it's a big part of science fiction.
It's a big science fiction, like a trope, if you will, of, like,
you know, what if you went into the past and tried to change something, right?
But then, what if you tried to change too many things
and then it would create something, you know, different in the future?
Can you travel into the future and then interact with people in the future in some way
and how will that affect if you go back to your own time and all this stuff, right?
So it's kind of interesting to play with those notions,
but the really hard thing is actually to stay in the present, right?
You know, like, you can have these ideas about, like,
well, what do I do if I go back in time and I do this or, you know, like that?
But really, in some way, we're playing with that all the time, with this illusion of time.
And also with the illusion of space.
So, you know, like, we did this thing with the hand, you know, with the hand looking at it.
So actually, space is similarly an illusion that's been created through a composite of our experience, right?
So space is a composite of the sense of the energy also, sense of sound, sense of visual, right?
So, again, like, conventionally, it's true.
I can say, like, oh, there's that room over there and, you know, later on I'll go over there
and it'll be this kind of experience to be over there.
But actually what will happen is that there's this flow of different experiences of energy in the body as I'm moving.
There's different visual experiences, right, as I'm moving.
And then I put them together and it seems like, oh, there's space here, right?
So some of you have done walking meditation before, might relate to this, where if you're actually paying
really close attention to the sensations in the feet, in the legs as you're moving,
so you just, like, stand and then focus on the legs and the feet.
Like, lifting, moving, placing, lifting, moving, placing, lifting, moving, placing, right?
You tune into the energetic level of that in a very focused and detailed way.
And then that sense of time and space both can start to fall away.
You can start to see through that as an illusion, right?
And it's very helpful to do that, right?
So in the conventional world, yes, we have to use these kinds of things,
but also it's helpful to understand the extent to which it's true and also the extent to which it's illusion.
So at the same time, as you start to practice, sometimes you might get a sense that there's a different,
there's a different relationship to time also, right?
So you can start to see, like, oh, that thing that arises in the past is just a thought,
that thing that arises in the future also, right, just thought.
Sometimes you get the sense that, like, oh, I'm starting to be able to, like, see the future more, or something like that, right?
So here's one explanation for that, is that as you become more and more mindful,
like, as you're actually able to see what's happening right now more clearly,
you actually get more moments of now, so to speak, right?
And there sometimes is some trajectory that's easier to notice with that.
So for example, supposing that you see this glass of water, right,
and you see it, here we go, you see it on this shelf like this, right?
That's one picture you get of it.
Then you see it in midair, right, falling off like that.
And then the third picture that you get of it is it's broken on the ground with all the water spilled, right?
So you get just those three pictures, so a glass of water, midair, spilled.
So if that's all that you get, then it seems like, wow, it was impossible to stop that,
because one moment it was up there, then it was falling, and then it was gone, right?
There was, like, there's not much space in between, right?
And this actually happens in our life too, it's like, wow, how did that happen?
Like, how did this thing happen to me?
Like, how did my marriage fall apart?
How did that car crash happen? How did I lose this thing?
How did, you know, so many different things, it's like, wow, how did that happen, right?
So as you practice mindfulness, you actually get more moments back in some ways, right?
So instead of the in-between moments being ones in which you sort of drift off into your own daydreams, illusions, etc.,
you're actually able to be present with whatever it is.
And then you get, like, this picture, this one, right?
So you get, like, you know, 50 pictures of that, right?
So then it seems like between, you know, 1 and 45, you can see, like, oh, there's some trajectory happening here,
there's some intervention that can happen, right?
And you can actually respond in some way that is appropriate in that manner, right?
So it seems like you have some sense of the future sometimes, differently, right?
And it's helpful, right? It's helpful both in a practical way to stop glasses of water from falling off, right?
But also for, you know, being able to understand the way things are, to be able to understand cause and effect, right?
To be able to live a more harmonious life, too.
Everything about anything that you might have done ever that is something that you regret, right?
So if you ever say something to someone and then later you're like, oh, I shouldn't have said that, you know?
That was like the heat of the moment or, you know, that was a stupid thing to say or, you know,
now they have this impression or that was kind of a mean thing to say, right?
So how did that happen like that, right?
So how that happened was that actually there's something arising in you, some intention arising, anger, fear, jealousy, right?
Unbeknownst to you, so you didn't know that that was there.
Bring an awareness, actually there's probably moments when it starts to arise, it arises, gains strength,
then there's actually an intention to speak that comes from that and then, right?
There it is, and then, you know, at whatever point somewhat after that you realize like, oh, that was, oh, shouldn't have done that, right?
So similarly as we practice mindfulness, you get more, you know, you get more pictures of that.
You get to see more like, oh, this is the beginning of jealousy arising, okay?
Better pay attention, right?
This is the beginning of rage, okay?
Get to be present with that, get to work with that in different ways of being present with the energy of it, not suppressing it,
but also not having to spew that out, right?
So that's a practice that can sort of help you in the, you know, future, so to speak, right?
There are also stories about people who can actually go back into the past in a certain way.
There's one teacher and yogi who I admire, who some of you may have heard of Deepama,
who was a, someone who lived until maybe 1979 or so.
She was a teacher of some of my teachers.
I never met her.
She was an Indian woman who became a great meditative adept.
She was someone who had a very difficult life.
So she was married when she was quite young, and then her first child died, and then another child died,
and then she loved her husband, the husband died.
She had just a lot of, a lot of tragedy in her life, and she was actually like so much grieving from this
that she was like almost, she was like sick, like she was in bed.
She had no more energy.
She was like dying of broken heart from all of this, right?
And then someone told her, you know, you should go to the meditation center.
You should, you should practice.
And she's in Burma, and she actually dragged herself there.
The story is she actually like climbed the meditation hall stairs and like crawling up them, right?
So if you ever feel like, oh, I'm a little tired to come to IMC.
I don't know, you know, you can, you can think like, oh, Deepama, she crawled up the stairs, right?
And she just started doing the practice and she had very good parames.
She had very good concentration.
She had very good, also intention, but she knew like this was like a life or death thing for her.
You know, it was going to be over.
And she had a small daughter and, you know, one child was alive.
She had to, she had to do this.
So she practiced very intensively and she actually broke through into understanding the way things are.
And then the, her teacher actually recognized that she had this very strong power of potential power of concentration
and actually trained her in a lot of the psychic kind of powers that you can learn as a meditator also.
So she actually describes, you know, going back in time to both not, not just past lives, which, I mean,
I don't want to say that's common, but that people, you know, learn to do that, sort of see past lives, etc.
But also actually she could go back in time to the time of the Buddha and be there like listening to the talk, the Dharma talk, right?
So it's said that you don't have to believe this, but, but then when she's asked like, well, so how did you do that?
Do you know what people are like?
How do you do that?
And she said, I just go back like moment by moment, you know, just like moment by moment by moment like that.
So it's like rewinding, right?
So you can think about this like, I think we have some mundane experiences like this too.
Like if you know a song, a song that you know, say a pop song or a common song and someone says, hey, do you know what?
What's the, what's the chorus of that song?
You can actually kind of rewind or fast forward in that song in your memory like quickly, right?
Because you know that song, right?
Or if I ask you like, what do you have for breakfast today?
You can kind of go back like, you know, you kind of skip over the lunch quite quickly and then your breakfast.
Okay, right.
You could remember it.
So it's interesting, like there's this way in which you can also, you know, train your mind in this way to have a different relationship to that.
So I just put that out there also to help you expand your sense of what is possible and also in relationship to time.
But the main thing that I want to get at is really this illusion of time, this past, this present, this future.
And they're all inherently connected in some way and yet the connection is all in the present, right?
And that's really the place that we have the possibility of being aware.
That's really the possibility where we can see what we need to see in order to awaken, right?
And that's actually the moment where we can be free in the present.
So catch yourself.
Notice when you're thinking about like, go in the future, this will happen in the future, this will happen, right?
And just see that as a thought as much as you can, right?
And then likewise, this thing's about the past, the grasping of the past, right?
So it's not that if something arises that's a memory of the past, you can know that as a memory.
And also if something arises that's a memory of the past that you regret,
it's actually considered good to actually feel the regret in a wholesome way, right?
Not in a self-flagellating egotistical way like, I did this bad thing, I'm such a bad person,
but actually recognizing like, oh, this was an unwholesome thing to do, you know?
That was unhelpful, right?
And then try to learn from that and try to let that go.
So actually feel the burn of that in a way that will teach you,
but then, you know, see it's a thought in the present of that.
This is the lesson it's bringing me, and then, right?
So the more that we can learn to do that, the more free that will actually be, you know?
So working with thoughts in this way is really a way of working with time.
So I've shared a lot of different things there,
so I'll stop here and see if you have any questions or reflections yourself about time,
since we're all caught in it together.
So what's your relationship to time?
Did it make sense, would I say?
Yes, what about using the present to plan for the future, like setting goals and things like that?
I guess, how does that fit into just being in the present?
Yeah, yeah, so it's like there's nothing wrong with planning,
and, you know, in the relative sense, like that's a useful thing to do.
And in fact, if all of you hadn't planned to come here, like it's unlikely you would actually be here, right?
At this meditation talk, right?
Like it takes some planning and all that stuff.
But there's a way of doing planning that it can just be that, like it can just be what it is, basically.
And it can be a thought in the present, and, you know, you do it when you're doing it,
and then it's done, and then you can let it go, right?
There's another way in which planning can become sort of more obsessive, right?
And you find yourself doing something like, you know, the metaphor of like the cow chewing the cud, you know?
Like you chew it, and then digest it in one stomach, then it comes back, and you chew it, and goes to another stomach,
and comes back, and you chew it, you know?
So those times, then it feels like, okay, there's something else going on here.
So it's always good to know the planning is only happening in the present, right?
And so it's good to know when there's planning, like, okay, now this is what's happening,
what's planning happening, and then to do it, right?
But there also is a way in which we're usually, like, not able to be that aware of what's happening,
and so we get dragged around by our minds.
And also there are often times, you know, as there are with repetitive thoughts,
like some kind of emotional charge underneath of it that's actually driving a repetitive thought pattern that we're not aware of, right?
So for example, if you notice yourself planning something over and over and over again,
you know, drop into what is the emotional feeling or energetic field that's there while that's happening, right?
Oftentimes it's some anxiety or something like that, right?
And then actually just try and drop into that, like, be present with that.
That's what's happening in the now.
So we usually get caught up in that story of, like, oh, if I plan this,
then that's what I need to do is plan this more, right?
And actually what's here is this energy of anxiety, right?
So noticing when planning is just like, planning and it can be that, and it's good.
And then also there's this, like, slight urge to sort of, like,
slight or sometimes huge urge to, like, control things or to be able to figure out everything or, you know.
So that's the thing, too, is, like, it's good to know that when you're planning, you're planning,
but also it's just a plan, right?
So it's not actually reality.
In, you know, it's an idea of what will happen that will sort of guide you towards that.
The truth is that there's a lot of things that you don't know about that could happen like that, right?
So, like, today, actually, I was in my apartment.
I was doing some work in my apartment and I don't know if this happened down here,
but in San Francisco it was, like, cloudy, cloudy, cloudy.
Suddenly there was a downpour for about 15 minutes.
It just poured rain and then it was done.
It was, like, blue sky and, you know, like that, right?
And I totally didn't expect that.
And then I heard some wrestling outside of my apartment door.
I opened the door and our hallway had gotten flooded in the building.
So, like, the second floor and the drain right outside had gotten, you know,
filled with, like, leaves and things like that.
And then the water had come up and then come all in the hallway, right?
So I had this plan about what was going to do that day,
but it turned out that, you know, right here today was work with my neighbor
who got a wet vac and then we got these fans and then, you know,
spent all this time doing this, like, unglamorous activity of, you know,
cleaning up this hallway which is still going on, you know, while I'm here.
So, you know, this plan, like, what I'm going to do today, right?
But it's good to know, like, oh, this is just a plan, right?
So if not, you're like, oh, no, what happened to my plan?
Who's ruining my plan?
My plan is supposed to happen.
I'm supposed to be in control of everything, you know.
You get too attached to that plan as exactly how it is.
Like, you're not able to be responsive to what actually does arise.
And also, actually, you miss a lot of things that are fortuitous,
that are actually outside of your plan,
but that actually are even more amazing than your plan was, too, right?
So, you know, you don't know a life unfolds.
Like, you meet certain people just fortuitously or different things happen.
You know, and if we're actually open to that, then there's a lot that you can learn.
There's a lot you can receive.
There are a lot of, you know, just the mystery of connections and things, right?
But if you're too much like, okay, this is my plan,
and so my plan is exactly how it needs to transpire,
then everyone who does something different than your script is, like, thwarting you
and, you know, becomes an obstacle and you need to destroy them or change them.
You know, it's just like a recipe for suffering, right?
So it's good to have a plan.
It's good to have a vision, but also to just know, okay, this is a plan.
This is a vision.
And then, yeah, so, thank you.
So, in Buddhism, is the concept of time a circle or a straight line?
Oh, so describe what it would be if it was a circle and it was a straight line.
It repeats itself.
It repeats itself?
Mm-hmm.
Meaning?
Events, cycles of life and time and universe, and it's built, it's destroyed,
it's built, it's destroyed, versus the straight line is infinity,
where things just keep going on and on and on and on and on,
but in a direction of not necessarily, you know, rebuilding, building, rebuilding,
building, rebuilding.
I don't know, do you understand what I'm saying?
I think I understand what you're saying.
It's sort of physics, kind of.
It's sort of both, you know, so in the Buddhist cosmology, as it were,
you know, there is this sense of, you know, kind of like the Big Bang,
but there's this idea that there's actually this constant expansion
and then contraction and expansion, contraction, expansion, contraction,
that, you know, goes on.
So, in that way, cyclical, you could say.
As well as there's a recognition of, you know, cycles of birth,
birth, aging, death, birth, aging, death, you know.
There are different cycles that happen.
And, you know, we can recognize that even as people, like there's that.
So, even as, you know, as women, like it's clear, like, oh, there's this cycle of the,
you don't know this, but maybe you do.
You know, the moon cycle or the menstruation.
You know, that's like in our bodies, there's cycles, right?
Or even the seasons, right?
The seasons are cyclical, which are, you know, so the way the Earth rotates,
and, you know, there's a cycle of a day and there's a cycle of the seasons
and, like, you know, all this kind of stuff.
So, there's something that's clearly as cyclical and in that way of patterns.
And yet, at the same time, in some ways, there's a trajectory that's not necessarily cyclical, right?
And among the helpful things to pay attention to is around,
like, when you get to the space of sort of karmic causes and conditions
and the playing out of that in our life and our spiritual development and things,
like, it's not necessarily either cyclical or straight line, right?
But there is cause and effect that is playing out all the time.
And, you know, all of this that I've just said before is, like, highly conceptual in some way,
and, you know, it's hard to prove and this and that.
But when you get down to what you can do now about karmic cause and conditions,
it's actually paying attention to what's happening in the moment,
what's arising, and what am I acting upon.
So what seeds am I sowing now for the future in terms of intention, in terms of action?
And that brings up my next question, which is, when you say cause and effect,
in Buddhism, do you believe in randomness,
or is there always a cause and effect, and it's sort of just planned that way?
Not randomness, but perceived randomness.
So it could be that because we don't, you know, understand all of it, right?
It can be perceived as random for us, right?
At the same time, it's not necessarily true that every single moment,
what arises in every single moment is the direct result of some individual karmic action on my part.
There's also sort of, there's sort of a whole complex circuit of things,
for example, like weather, you know, that affects, like, all of us in some way or another, right?
So it's not individual or, you know, different things like that, right?
But the teaching is that the part that we actually have some influence over again, you know,
is this part that's around paying attention to the seeds of intention planted in the moment, like, etc.
So in Buddhism, is there a concept of a non-random universe
and some sort of a divine plan, either for individuals or for a larger entity,
a population or a world or whatever?
So I think the answer for that is basically, basically no, not.
There is no divine plan, you mean no, not?
Yes, not.
So then why isn't it random?
So then the question I asked for you in this kind of question,
when someone asks this kind of question, is what would the difference be for you if it were or it weren't?
Like, what makes you ask the question and what would the difference be for your life if it were or it weren't?
Well, it directly impacts my observation and investigation into good and evil.
How so?
Well, why does evil happen?
And if there is a larger divine plan, what does it mean?
Why is it put here?
Why is it so awful?
What is it trying to teach us?
What could be the possible use for it?
So I kind of arrive at, yes, it is a random universe because it's really kind of the only way I can come to some peace in my own mind for why atrocities happen.
So that's the dilemma that most theistic religions have in explaining the universe, right?
Because it's like there's a God and if there's a God who can control everything, then why do bad things happen, right?
Right.
Or is there just a force that's holding all of this together?
So the teachings, the Buddhist teachings, like the Buddha was pretty much cut to this chase.
In fact, like, probably, you know, he didn't answer like a lot of these kinds of questions.
He was basically like, here's the deal on suffering and the end of suffering, liberation, right?
And that's really the point of this whole, you know, with this, is there, you know, the question about good and evil, right?
So good and evil, as that plays out, the pointer in the teachings is back to here, you know?
So not like be like good and evil out there, but good and evil here, right?
And good and evil, you know, isn't really the concept that's used in the Buddhist teachings.
It's more about skillful and skillful, right?
So wholesome and wholesome.
Which sounds similar, but actually around like, well, what are the things, the intentions that arise in my heart,
the actions from which lead to happiness and harmony for myself and others, right?
And what are the intentions and actions that arise in my heart that lead towards suffering for myself and others, right?
What are the intentions and actions that come from a place of an understanding of actually interconnection,
which is another dimension of seeing through time, right?
And what are the intentions and actions that arise from a sense of separation,
like there's just me and the obstacles around me, right?
So in that sense, this question of like, it is a lawful universe in that way in the Buddhist teaching.
A lawful universe in that the part that we have some control over again is like what is happening in the moment
and whether we are able to see that and then take action on wholesome versus unwholesome, right?
So this is where we can plant the karmic seeds for positive or negative results in the future, right?
Based on what's happening in the present moment.
So in that way, it's not like divine, like someone else besides us is paying attention to that, right?
But there is an us, right?
This is under your control, right?
So then you say like, well, what is the me who is having this control, you could say, right?
So then you could question like, well, it could be just this movement of wisdom and ignorance, right?
So wisdom sees ignorance doesn't see, wisdom sees ignorance doesn't see, wisdom sees ignorance.
But whatever it is, however you want to perceive it, you might as well aim towards wisdom, right?
Aim towards wisdom, aim towards seeing, aim towards being present, right?
And then in that way, there's some possibility of influencing how things play out, right?
Does that make sense?
Yeah, but let's take it down to a more personal level then.
If that's what the Buddha was doing, he was speaking on a very personal level.
The title of the book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People.
Would the Buddhist teachings say, well, that's just the laws of the universe are acting out,
and several of them have landed on this one particular person at once,
like the meditator, the woman whose husband died or children died, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Yes, death is inevitable.
We haven't moved beyond death.
So then with the laws of the universe, they've just come together that that law is acting out in her life in a condensed way.
In which case, isn't that rather random?
When death occurs, isn't death a random occurrence?
We don't know when we're going to die.
We know there's a law that says, yes, everyone will die, but we certainly don't know when.
So isn't that random?
It certainly is perceived as random.
Yeah, perceived as random, yes.
But if it's not random, then where is the law that is governing when it is going to happen for each one of us?
So the question is, what is the law determining when people are going to die?
What I'm saying is, if that's only a perception of mine and other peoples that you cannot know exactly when you're going to die,
it certainly appears like a random occurrence.
Sometimes, right?
Right, right.
Often it does.
Even if you're diagnosed with some terminal illness, the exact moment of death is still beyond your knowledge at this point.
But if that's not random, as you say, if that's just my perception of it, then what is the law behind it that can tell you,
yes, this is how these things work?
Or is there a law that we can know that tells us, that explains some of the perceived randomness?
Right.
Is that clear now?
I think it's clear, yeah.
It sounds so clear to me.
I mean, I hear some poignancy behind that question because the truth is the part that you said of that we're all going to die
and that you don't know when you're going to die.
And that's the law.
We can accept that.
Yeah.
But sometimes there are some, like someone has a certain disease.
We have some understanding about some causes and conditions.
So it's not that everything is random, random, random.
So there's causes and conditions.
And we have some ability in some spheres to understand causes and conditions.
So some things lead to death, right?
Like, you know, there's certain, like, on the level of biology, you can understand, like, you get whacked with a baseball bat in the head,
right, that hits certain things, or you get shot then, you know, in certain organs, like, that means you're going to die, right?
So, but also, you know, why those things happen, which is I think where you're getting at, right?
It's hard to understand, like, why that happens.
And it's true.
That's very true.
So now behind that question of, like, is there a law governing that that I can understand, right?
I sense, like, this poignancy of the fact that, like, like, no, you don't know that, you know, like, we're not in control.
It's like, where's the rulebook?
Where can I look in the answer key and figure it out, you know?
So why isn't it random?
Yeah.
It's perceived as random, yeah.
Well, why is that just a perception?
Because I'm...
It certainly seems to play out as a truth.
Yeah, so, okay, so you could call it a truth.
I mean, I think we're cuddling about words a little bit here, about whether it's perceived as random or it's not random.
But I think it's an important point.
Yeah, so it's an important point because, well, tell me why you think it's an important point.
Well, because that's how I've sort of made peace with the fact that I'm not in control of anything.
Yeah.
And that I don't know what's going to happen five minutes from now.
Yeah.
Unless when I'm going to die, or when someone I love is going to die, or when anything is going to happen.
Or I could win a million dollars tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
So it's my poor brain...
No.
That's sorry.
Yeah, that's...
No, no, no, hold it up.
Do you remember?
It's my poor brain trying to make some sense of this movie that I'm writing.
Now turn that off.
Okay.
Is that it?
There you go.
Yeah.
It has to be on end.
These are positive conditions.
You need to be both on and near your mouth.
And I have to think and talk.
See, it's not...
That's not random.
It has to be on and near your mouth.
That's it.
Yeah, it's cause and effect.
Right.
Because random is just the way I've tried to explain the universe to myself.
That there is no overriding divine plan, or any other divine or undivine.
And it's just how kind of I've explained the world to myself.
It's the only way that's made any sense to me at all, so that I can...
It's a way of letting go.
It's a way of letting go of all that fussing and worrying and trying to be in control and
what have you.
I just say, you know, a lot of it's just random.
Out of my control, it just is.
Yeah.
So if it's a useful concept for you to be able to let go and not worry, then...
Yeah, but if it's wrong, then...
Then I better start worrying again.
Then great.
But I mean, I think the main point, so I'm going to make this point for like the tenth time today,
just for everyone, is that the place where you can have some influence in the teachings of the Buddha
is in the moment by paying attention to the intentions arising in the moment, right?
So pay attention to what is this in my heart?
Is it generosity?
Is it hatred?
What is it that when I'm about to speak, what is the intention that's coming up from this?
What is the intention arising in my heart that I'm about to act from?
That is happening in the moment, and that is where you can actually have some influence.
Both over what are the seeds that are being planted for that to arise in the future
in your own mind and heart, and also for in the teachings of the Buddha, the karmic results of that, right?
Which actually happened to be like perceived as pleasant or unpleasant or something like that, right?
So that's the place where you actually do have some potential influence, right?
So it's not like everything's...
I mean, actually we're a lot of different philosophies at the time of the Buddha,
and some of them were like everything's random.
So do whatever you want, right? It's all random.
Like you're not... whether you're nice to this person or mean to this person,
whether you steal something or don't steal something, it's all random.
So just like do what is in your own self-interest, right?
Like that could be...
Karla, like that could be something that you could think if you believe...
I don't think you're saying this, but if you were like, everything's random.
It's like everyone knocks yourself out and do whatever you feel like, right?
So that was not what the Buddha was teaching at all.
It was like, in that way, like it...
Yeah, yeah, I don't think that's what you mean,
if you're just like everything is random, then it's like,
well, I don't have any influence over anything,
and what I do doesn't matter because it's all random, so...
Hmm, right?
So it's not that nihilistic view.
Like he was very clear, like he's not teaching this kind of nihilism in that way, right?
But at the same time, he's not teaching that like you are the control of everything,
or that you can learn to control everything, you know, anything like that,
which is also very stressful on this other side,
because then it's like, oh, I need to like machinate everything
and spend all this time making details, right?
So I find it actually very freeing in this way,
to like, well, it's all being driven back to like pay attention in the moment, you know?
That's your instruction.
It's not actually to figure out the whole future,
because the present, as they say, is actually the parent of the future.
So you pay attention to what's happening now,
try to deal with that in a skillful way,
and then trust that, you know, the future will unfold, you know, as it will from that, right?
So I'll bring it up.
I feel like I have to mention some Harry Potter thing in relationship to all these topics now.
So there was actually a piece about time travel in the Harry Potter,
one of the Harry Potter movies where, in fact, actually Hermione had,
she was like a very go-getter, like ambitious smart kid,
and so she wanted to take all these extra classes,
and some of you have seen these movies know that she actually used this time turning device,
so she could actually attend one class,
and then go back in time and attend another class in the same period, and so on, right?
And then this proved to be some big device in that movie also,
in which they kind of went back through time to change something, and, you know, this and that.
But even in those movements, you know, whether or not believe that's true at the time turning thing,
their intention was always intention of helping.
It was actually intention of saving life in that particular one,
like it was saving several lives like this.
I forget the creature, like a dragon-like creature,
and then someone else who was going to be in prison and things like that.
So even in that, they were acting from wholesomeness in their actions
and their time-traveling actions, right?
So, all right, so let's sit together, try to be present for a moment.
So cracking through the mystery of time, the past, the future,
doing our best to see thoughts as thoughts,
and resting in the present, the only time that really is.
So we rest in the goodness of our own heart.
We share the merit from our practice tonight with everyone here and with all beings.
May all beings be free from suffering.
So thank you for your attention tonight.
So play with this, try and notice the future and the past just as thoughts
and see the freedom that that can bring you.
Thank you, and thank you in advance for your generosity also.
Thank you very much.
