The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, good morning again and welcome to our series on the Satipatana Sutta,
a discourse on the establishment, establishing of awareness.
And there's many ways in which awareness is lost or subsumed or collapses into our preoccupation with our lives.
And one area is with all the different aspects of our beingness, who we are, whatever that is,
that we can identify and cling to as me, myself, and mine.
And now we get to this next exercise in the Satipatana Sutta.
It has to do with five different areas in which we cling, especially clinging to me, myself, and mine.
But one idea is these five areas are areas which we, if we cling, we're clinging to one of these five areas.
And kind of the literal meaning of the Pali word for this is heaps, big heaps of stuff.
So it's not a very technical idea, though, because it became kind of enshrined in Buddhist philosophy, psychology.
It kind of took on a more technical feeling.
The word is an usual translation into English as aggregates.
The Pali word is kanda, k-h-a-n-d-a.
And it is five heaps of stuff.
And sometimes we'll find in the modern Dharma teachers, we'll say something like,
the Buddha taught there is no self, but what there is are these five aggregates, these five heaps.
The problem with that is that the Buddha never said that.
And in fact, the Buddha, if anything, saw the five aggregates of five heaps as problematic,
something which was burdensome, that the idea is to kind of overcome this burden of the five heaps.
So this next exercise has to do with these five heaps.
And the way it's described is the five heaps of clinging.
So the word of clinging is added to it.
And so these are five areas in which we cling, five areas from which we cling,
the five areas in the world of clinging.
And so we're looking deeply into this area of clinging to these five things
and seeing deeply into its nature in a very particular way in this exercise
in the third, fourth foundation of mindfulness, of awareness.
And so I want to give an analogy.
So imagine that it's a beautiful, peaceful day and you're out maybe on the beach,
or if you don't live near the oceans, maybe some make up some place,
big, big, big, beautiful meadow or field that goes on for a long while.
But imagine a beach, wide, long, beautiful, sandy beach with very clean sand,
maybe very soft, fine textured sand. Walk barefoot, it just feels so nice
and comfortable to feel the warmth of the sand and the softness of it.
The beach there is kind of a very gradual grade, so it's kind of easy to walk on.
And it may be many hundreds of yards from the water up to wherever the vegetation begins.
You can see up the coast for a long ways, and it's just an inspiring day
with lots of sky, lots of beach, and you see the suchness of the beach.
It's just a beach, just the suchness of it. It's inspiring, it's nice.
You can wander freely. The sense of freedom is wandering aimlessly up and down,
close to the water, away from the water, and just to feel so comfortable and so nice.
And you have such a wonderful day. Maybe a picnic at some point.
You can turn around, come back, and just being in the beach.
You come back a week later thinking you'd do the same thing, because it was so nice.
But now the local beach authorities have made a decision to give easier access,
or they thought to the beach for everyone, so that everyone would have equal ability
to kind of just walk the beach and don't have to worry about people kind of getting in front of them
or blocking their way or something.
So they've decided to put fences down the whole length of the beach
that maybe are maybe, you know, it could be 10 feet wide or 5 feet wide.
And so they're making lanes, and so you have to get a ticket in a reserve or spot beforehand
and you're assigned a lane, and now there's these like, you know, 10 foot or something fences
on either side of the lane, so people really stay and they have their privacy in their lane,
because they, you know, privacy is important.
And so you're given your lane, maybe your lane 38, and you can just kind of,
and you're free to walk straight on that lane, as long as there's the beach.
And so everyone is free to walk their lane, and this way it's equal, and everyone kind of equal access,
and though you can pay a little bit more to be close to the ocean.
And so what you're lost then is a suchness, the vast freedom, just the beach by itself.
Now it's been defined and laid out.
This is, you know, so it's a kind of ridiculous analogy, but this is what we do to ourselves.
We are like a vast open beach without any definition in the sand, but we make lines in the sand,
and we say that, you know, that define one thing over another.
And the five lines that these five heaps are the five kind of lines that we make.
And so they are, the word, often the first word is called form, or sometimes body that people say would form.
I prefer the word appearance, physical appearance, but form or physicality.
But not a physical physicality, but rather the way it appears to us.
The second is the feelings of pleasant and unpleasant.
The third is the basic perceptions of sensations that occur.
The fourth is the kind of mental world of other mental activities, concepts, ideas, wishes, aspirations, memories.
And the fifth is consciousness.
And it makes some sense maybe to divide up our experience this way.
But the Buddha is suggesting you don't have to divide them up this way.
Once we divide them up this way, we cling to them and hold on to them in particular ways.
And if we cling to them, it's like making a fence, making a line, making a lane in our experience.
And we're selecting part of who we are to cling to at the expense of a disconnection with the rest of it.
Some people cling a lot to their body.
Some people to their comfort and sensuality of pleasant and unpleasant.
Some people to their perceptions, their sensations, their ideas of things.
Some people to the whole inner landscape and psychology and all that.
I think it's a particular speciality of the psychological modern world where we're so hypersensitive to the little nuances of what we think and what we feel.
And how we judge and how we operate psychologically.
And there's a lot of clinging there. And then there's also this idea of clinging to consciousness, to awareness itself, as being ultimate, as being special.
And so these are five areas of clinging.
So rather than saying that the Buddha tells there's no self, but rather these five aggregates, the Buddha said that there's no need to cling.
But these are the five areas in which people cling. These are five areas in which we divide ourselves up and then get attached to those divisions.
And the idea is to be able to let go of those clinging.
To allow things to return to the suchness of our experience.
The simplicity of just the beingness of things that arise and pass and come and go.
In fact, that's the exercise is, in fact, to see the arising and passing of each of these five heaps.
And as we see the arising and passing, then at some point the sense of the division, the lines, the fences and the sand fall away.
And we start being able to see then the arising and passing of all phenomena and the suchness of things that occur.
And so we are in the simplicity, pristine simplicity of who we are.
We don't make any lines. We don't make any fences and divisions.
Everything's allowed to exist in its own naturalness, its own as it appears.
And there are sensations in the body. There are pleasant and unpleasant and all these things, but they exist in this wider, broad, peaceful beach.
And that there's no lines in it. It's just all, it's allowed to exist without clinging to any of it.
And the first of them is appearance, which is the physical appearance of how we are.
And so it's not literally what our physical body is, the physicality of it.
But it's the concepts, ideas, projections, ways of selecting out our physical experience that we get attached to.
So for example, our physical appearance of our nose, our skin, our height, our size.
There's all these physical ways in which we appear to ourselves and to others that is not just kind of the way things are,
but has something to do with how we select out this is important to judge people by or comment to people or notice about people, notice about ourselves.
And the tremendous amount of suffering occurs in the clinging to appearance and to this, you know, how things appear to us in our body.
And the Buddha's suggestion is that instead of focusing, being caught in the appearance and concerned and preoccupied by it,
step back with mindfulness and see that the world of appearance, physical appearance, belongs to the world of things that are in constant changing, moving.
Partly because one form of clinging to the appearance is to think that our appearances are constant or permanent.
This is who I am. The world of appearance is an interactive world between our physicality and the mind's values, perceptions, concepts, judgments,
selectivity, projections that the mind makes. And if we pay careful attention, we see that there's a kind of reconstruction of appearance,
reconstruction of what's important by selecting what's important and clinging to it and judging it and building up ideas around it.
And that is what begins to relax and soften as we begin our seeing that appearances both in some way and one way or the other,
as we rest back into the appearance of things, that there's a flow of inconstancy of arising and passing that goes on.
And then the clinging can begin to relax. The prioritization of certain kind of projection or certain kind of judgments or commentary can begin letting go.
And we can begin experiencing the suchness or the simplicity of being, the beingness, or just be at peace and at ease with how things are with ourselves here.
So the five aggregates, the five heaps. So that will be the topic for this week.
And so each day I'll take one of the heaps and discuss it some. And today was, appearances got kind of short discussion because it was introduction to the five.
So thank you. And I wish you well and look forward to being back tomorrow.
