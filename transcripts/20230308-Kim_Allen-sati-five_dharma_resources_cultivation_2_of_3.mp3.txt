 The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org. So welcome. Welcome to this second session of our class on the five Dharma resources. It's nice to see all of you. And just as a quick review, last time we talked about these five as inner wealth. So the five are faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom. And we talked about how those can be a source of kind of inner, yeah, inner wealth, inner value, that is something that is more stable and more reliable than the more external forms of wealth that we can gather. Not that we don't do that, but those can be taken away more easily and we don't have as much control over them. Whereas these five can serve us even as things are changing externally. And then we also talked, as we will each time, we'll talk about something about the list of five and then also a study method, a way to use the suttas to support our practice. And so we talked about the kind of straightforward method of going through a list, like instead of just taking the list of five as, OK, check, memorize these or something, really go through and notice, OK, how do these show up in my life and what are some of the relationships between them and which ones feel very natural for me and which ones not as much? And why is this a set? Why does this list somehow go together? I don't think you can figure that out so easily. Theoretically, it's really more something to be done in the reality of our life. So I had encouraged you to look at these five. We kind of went through them in class last time. So you'd have an idea of what they were about and to see if these forms of wealth appear in your life and if so, how and what do you notice about them? So I wanted to create some space at the beginning here, if anybody had any comments on that. Did anyone look for them? Yeah, Debbie. I had a really good time working with this list. In my group, I thought I had boxed myself into a wall with what I take that saying back. I saw what was strongest in my life. And then your encouragement to look at how they appear within our life, how we were aware of them. It really kind of threw me, it changed my whole thought about how I thought about myself. I guess I'm putting too much thought into self, but I was intrigued by how differently these lists found themselves in various parts of my life throughout the week. Okay. It wasn't static. It changed a lot. Well, that's good. That's good. Actually, can you give one example with such an intriguing intro? I thought being 70 and learning a lot in my life from experience, I thought wisdom was what I mean. It sounds so haughty to say I found myself as being wise, because after living this, looking at these, I found I'm more at the learning stage. I have true confidence in this path. I like living an ethical life. And I'm learning. I'm just, and I'm generous, usually generous with family, friends and giving to people who need it. I mean, I'm generous. And I'm just in the learning stage right now, just trying to understand what these lists are all about. I mean, I've only been doing this for three years. So I'm probably one of the youngest in the group. But I like learning. And it's I'm fantastic. So I think I'm at the learning stage. Excellent. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Thank you. What a wonderful engagement. What a wonderful experience. How's it been, Mary? I had a lot of I did a lot of inquiry about my resistance with learning. And I had a lot of heavy load of reading lately. I had signed up for several courses. I had a lot of writing involved. And I just became aware of the relationship for me with sloth and torpor. I never thought of myself as that being a major hindrance for me. I always feel like I don't easily fall asleep and I can kind of work through. I don't know if that was an issue, but there was a lot of resistance to really taking on some of these denser, more subtle layered teachings. And I just found so there's a lot of inquiry around what was going on with that. And if they're what that resistance is all about. So that's how it showed up for me. I started working. I was a little overwhelmed this week. I just resumed in person hospice visitations and I found just a huge amount of sadness around that because one of the places I went to the conditions were really poor. I mean, everybody was in a hospital gown, stacked two in a room with no pictures on the wall and I had to sit in a wheelchair if I wanted to sit down to visit and you know people grabbing me in the hallway and begging me for meds. And it was just really painful. So there was a lot of generosity involved in in my intention in my presence in working with these new people, but it also brought up a real layer of sadness. So again, I was sort of looking at that in terms of impermanence and wisdom and kind of my connection to aging and it just brought up a lot of real heartfelt things. I went back a second time to see my patients this week and it was a totally different experience. It was much calmer and I was able to put some old calendar pictures on their wall which delighted some of them. So it was a really lovely, joyous experience around generosity. So that's enough for now. Oh, that's wonderful, Mary. Thank you. And it's these lists really come alive when we see them in our life and there isn't just one way that they look. And, you know, as far as not wanting to engage with subtle intellectual things that sounds natural to me if you're very much in the heart space and not that they're opposites or anything but you know there's different times for different things. So that's beautiful. Thank you for your for your share. Yeah. Fred, your hand is up. Yeah, that was interesting. What I noticed in the last week was how these different aspects are already present in my life in my activities. And it's like, oh, I'm, I'm doing, you know, I'm doing generosity or this is learning and reading a book about meditators dilemma I'm reading. I'm learning about suitas. This is learning. I'm discerning to making decisions in the day that's that show wisdom taking a long walk with my dog before the rain. Visiting I'm a hospice volunteer also visit people in hospice and and homes and institutions and I'm learning about generosity and you have a lot of the way I live my life is with CELO I'm vegan and I don't drink or do drugs I just sort of live an ethical life in a lot of those respects to, and I'm not sort of noticing that a lot I just sort of I'm not really in that in those ways. Great, I guess. Yeah, so I'm leaving for I'm leaving for a long retreat next week, a month in Maui and I'll be. So I've been kind of trying to simplify this. I've been doing this for a week and not do too much and tone down and miss it more and maybe that's given me an opportunity to be able more reflective about it, I might not notice maybe so much. Otherwise, I don't know. I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah, that is one of the simplest ways to engage with these lists is it when you just bring them to mind suddenly you realize, oh, actually these things are already present or and also just being aware of them strengthens them a little bit it's kind of like the secret bonus of mindfulness is that, you know, you don't have to do a lot of work to create more of these things. And actually just by seeing them you'll start to bring them forth and integrate them. So I, I hope I maybe I should ask you for it. Did you have a sense that these five are kind of forms of wealth, you know, they're like things resources available to you since you saw all of them. Yeah, well that was a different perspective that I hadn't seen it from before. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, it was like. Yeah, because I had lunch yesterday with a friend who's kind of at a different place in his life and kind of confused and just the contrast and where I don't know, I'm not comparing or judging so much is just sort of like, wow, I feel really settled in what I'm doing and what I'm in my life and what's happening with me and, and that did feel like a wealth, it did feel like, I don't know, a rich richness or something. Beautiful enough. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so. So we'll move on then today. Yeah, last time was somewhat theoretical and I'm so glad some people took it up as a practice. But you know we needed to go through the list and talk about what each one was and so forth. And this time we're going to have a little bit more about practice. But first I want to talk about the sutra readings that we had for today. So if we consider these five, faith, virtue, learning generosity, we're letting go and wisdom. If we consider them as forms of inner wealth and maybe the next question we might come to mind is, is the amount that we have now kind of our allotment of these. And, you know, the answer to that is no, like, like outer wealth, we can gather more of these. It's sort of a process of development, more like a seed growing, let's say then like amassing something, so it's different from conventional kinds of wealth, it's more like a cultivation. And so that's actually the topic for today is to look at these five as cultivation of the five resources or, and also in reverse this list as evidence of cultivation. So the first reading that you had for today starts fairly straightforwardly you know it means these five as ways that we grow in a noble growth, meaning, maturing of the mind and heart. So we can increase the level or the intensity or the availability of these five resources and that's kind of a mark of moving along in practice. So I think that one was fairly straightforward and I just wanted you to see the direct statement. And then the second reading shows Mahanama the Sakyam talking with the Buddha. Actually he's in the he's in the next two. And I believe Mahanama was a cousin of the Buddha because the Buddha was also of the Sakyan clan, you might recall. Another name for the Buddha that you hear sometimes is Sakyamuni Buddha. So Sakya is the Sakya, it's the Sanskrit form and Muni is Rekulus or Mendekind. So he's the Rekulus from the Sakyan clan, Sakyamuni. And so Mahanama from his same clan was also was known to be a very good lay practitioner. He was a devoted follower, he actually did pretty serious practice despite having a lay life with a family and so forth. And it's said that he had attained fairly early on the first stage of awakening. And he's, but in this reading, this second reading, he is worried about dying in an agitated state. So those of you who do hospice work, maybe this comes to mind, but he gives a very concrete example. He says, I live in a crowded city and, you know, crowded Indian cities. I don't know if any of you have seen these. But he says, you know, I run into straight horses and dogs and carts and people everywhere. And he worries that he's going to come around a corner and get hit by a bus effectively. And then, you know, then his mind is not going to be in a calm state. We all imagine that we're going to we'd like to die at home with beautiful surroundings and people and our favorite music playing lots of time and, you know, not too much pain and so forth. But I don't know, maybe you'll get hit by a cart in the street. And so he's worried about this. And he has an idea as we do in this practice that we would like to die in a somewhat collected state of mind. That was actually a, that's an important part of understanding if you're if you're going for rebirth, your state of mind at death matters for that, actually. So he's worried and he says, What if I hit run over by a straight chariot on a side street, I won't be mindful. And so the Buddha, what he chooses to do with him is he could have said a lot of different things. But what he says is, don't worry, he assures him the presence of these inner qualities, even if his mind is distracted will support him. So we might infer in some way that they're going to come forth or somehow shape his response, even during a surprising encounter, like with an elephant or a wild dog or something. And so, you know, we'll also talk more next time about how these qualities can come forth as part of our responsiveness to the world. But he essentially says, you know, because you have these in your heart, don't worry, you're going to be okay, they're gonna they're going to be there for you. So another aspect of inner wealth, in a sense. So then I want to spend a little more time on the third reading, which I know is longer and a little more complex, more layered also. And there's, there's initially a set of five things that starts with faith, but it's not our list. Did you notice that it's faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, which translates Samadhi, that's how Sujato translates Samadhi, and wisdom. And those five are actually another official list. Those are the, those are the five faculties, five spiritual faculties. But that's not what we were looking for. Did you find our list. In there, it's near the end. It's under in the last part under the recollection of the deities. And I also put in, it's a longer suta, I elided it a little bit excerpted it a little bit. And then I also put in the full recollection of the Buddha, which is the first one, just so that you could see the language that's used. And then the others that are just dot dot dotted, which are the Dharma, Dharma, Sangha, virtue and generosity. Those each have their own distinct text also. I just didn't put it in because it would get kind of long. There are six recollections total. And the one on the deities is the last one. And that's the one that includes our list where it says, let me get it up here. It says, when a noble disciple, disciple, recollects the faith, ethics, learning, generosity and wisdom of both themselves and the deities, their mind is not full of greed, hate and delusion. At that time, their mind is unswerving based on the deities. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds inspiration in the meaning and the teaching and finds joy connected with the teaching. When they're joyful rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil they feel bliss. And when they're blissful, the line becomes immersed in somebody to stop there for now. So that's that last paragraph I was just reading. So, so we see that there's some cultivation of a bunch of skill qualities of mind. So let me pause briefly to say what a recollection is so these says you should recollect these six things. What are recollections recollection is a form of practice, it's a form of meditation, actually, that could also be called contemplation or reflection. There's a lot of words and sometimes they're used differently. But the Buddha sometimes offers recollection, it's a skillful use of thought. It's true thinking is not always bad for spiritual practice. So you are actually intended to reflect and recollect these five that you have and then the deities we had a question last time about the Davis. So the word is there is actually the Davis. So you remember that the Davis which are the beings that have been born in the heavenly realms because of living meritorious lives and doing good practice, you know, you get rewarded for that in the rebirth system. And they too have these qualities and so you can imagine skillfully that, first of all, you might be reborn there. And so, you know, if you have those same qualities as the Davis then that's where you're headed after death so that's good. It's, it's considered acceptable for lay people to want rebirth in heaven. And also there's the Buddha always likes to slip in cultivation of some kind. So we have the mind, becoming progressively happy tranquil, etc, joyful, and ending up in Samadhi, which is a deep gathering of the mind that can lead to insight that can lead to the experience that will take you out of having to be reborn. That's the extra bonuses to wish for awakening essentially. So recollections are skillful thoughts that we would deliberately bring into the mind in order to bring uplift refreshment ease and various other good qualities, such as these ones. So, we can also consider that the way this teaching is phrased where it says okay you recollect these qualities and you don't just sit there and kind of stop with that. It said all the mind then becomes inspired and then joyful and then the body gets tranquil and then there's lists, and then there's concentration. So, we have a way of knowing if we're doing the practice in an onward leading way. We're not just sitting there thinking forever and ever, they're supposed to be some kind of a progression in the mind and the body. So we can check do the mind and the body calm down become happy this the mind gather itself into some kind of concentration. That would be a sign that doing the recollection is in fact functioning as an onward leading practice. And I like the way this suit words the practice, because it's certainly at least partly intended to be a Christian practice, something we do in sitting meditation that's where we can become immersed in Samadhi. But then the last line throws a little loop in and says that it can be done while walking standing sitting lying down while working and wallet home with your children. How about that. So, this is something that we can clearly do in daily life also it's aimed at lay people and this teaching is spoken to Mahanama, who was a lay person. And so he says yes, I think the implication is that yes we would do this on the cushion, but why not think about it while you're folding the laundry, you can imagine these good qualities. And we have, you know, sometimes people have the idea in the rest that we shouldn't think about our own good qualities that's selfish that's statistical. It's probably a hindrance to practice and of course it would be if we started, you know, elevating ourselves and saying how much better we were than everybody else and all of this but that wouldn't really be going in the direction that the suit says right where we get joyful and calm and then gathered. If you're just extolling yourself it wouldn't be going in that direction. It's actually considered very skillful to recollect our good qualities. It gives confidence. It helps us bring a sense of goodness in our life, sense of settledness, clear meaning or purpose if that's of interest to us. So, this is one way that we can strengthen these qualities is actually by thinking about them and by recollecting them by remembering that they resonate with other beings that have these qualities to doesn't say this explicitly in the suit of in this suit of an other suit to say when you have certain qualities, you will naturally be attracted to other beings who have those qualities. And that's true in the good sense, you know, for virtuous were more likely to meet virtuous people. If we're generous were more likely to meet generous people just works that way. And similarly, if we're very angry will probably meet other angry people, you know that. That's how it works too. So what we gather in our mind will gather around us also not 100% I know there's always that irritating family number that we have no matter how good we are, things like that. But generally speaking, let's say, the Buddha says, there are these energies that that gather. So, you know what happens when one actually does this, you know what if you actually did this practice there's now there's kind of a shift. We, we start with the reflection in the line so it is a thought, it's a thought process. But then, as it penetrates into our system. It sort of goes below the level of the cognitive mind into more of an energetic feeling. And we can see that because we get more and more subtle qualities named in the suit. But I you know I want to, I want to just talk about this in more everyday terms, not just a list from the suit. Many meditators find this on their own, even with basic breath meditation instructions for example, you know, we're, we're told to sit down and put our attention on the breath coming in and going out, and we may start out feeling like the breath is the air going in and out of the lungs when we feel that as a anatomical process. And that's fine. That's true enough. But if we stay with it if you've meditated for a little while you may notice that there's a sort of comes down more to something like a rhythm, you know, we're not really thinking about air molecules and the lungs in the chest as an organ, it becomes more like this rhythm of the breath going out and then maybe we start to feel more subtle sensations through the body we feel some tingling or we notice that the breath seems to go down into our belly area, maybe even our legs but that's not where our lungs are so obviously we've tuned into something else besides just the physical air. We get to, you know, maybe we then find like knots in the body we start realizing we have some tightness and it doesn't really feel like a muscle but there's some knots in her shoulder. Or we find, you know, smooth places like places where there's a feeling of like refreshment or needs or something in the body, all just from breathing. This is a more subtle layer of the body. The body doesn't have just one layer, a way of experiencing. So then once we find that in meditation, once we find that say through the breath, then we might be able to experience that in daily life also becomes incorporated into how we walk around we can notice when we're standing in the grocery line we notice if we're in the kitchen, we notice that as an energetic feeling body like a leaning forward or a tightness in our belly, and or something you know, met a reposting the teachers always point people to this so they can learn about their experience. And again, once you've tapped into it and push it and then you can start to use it in daily life. So I would say it's the same these qualities. When we take on an energetic dimension, if we reflect on them and maybe sit with them and go through this calming process. We'll start to experience these five, not just as ideas, or even as like things that make us feel happy when we reflect on them but actual energetic sensations. What's the sensation of faith, what's the sensation of letting go. We can also put on an energetic dimension that's what that can also then become woven into our everyday experience so that we could just call it to mind while we're emptying a dishwasher, whatever. So we know we can know that this deeper incorporation is being pointed to in the suit as we read because Mahanama was told that these five qualities would support him, even when he was in a state of shock such as dying. And we're going to go back to the second reading now. So we see that, you know, in sutta is where these five are listed as we also see this in the suit as ready so I've released it as qualities that can support a better rebirth I didn't assign those but they were listed at the end there's a couple of suit doesn't mean Majima, where these this list of five appears again as related to what kind of rebirth we're going to take. These five I would say get embedded into the body, the heart, the mind in a way that's beneficial. Maybe like the way vitamins or nourishments get absorbed into the body but here we're including mind also, if that makes sense. So this idea of cultivating these five of faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom is another aspect of why I call them Dharma resources, we can build them up like nutrition or health in our mind body system. So, their resource that's there for us. So what I thought we would do then, since this is focused more on this cultivation is that we'll, we'll do a guided meditation and we'll have a chance to feel into them and then afterwards we'll, we'll talk about it and you can ask questions about what I just said in this teaching were also anything that came up the meditation. So why don't we settle in for sitting. Just allow yourself to find the spot where you're going to be for the next hour along the sense of being. And just somewhere where you'll be comfortable. It's comfortable to do so you can close your eyes. I'm going to point toward these five in some way, maybe not in order, and maybe not by name, or saying, and you'll just see what you sense in a way. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. But let's see if we can go below the level of cognitive thinking. So sitting with the eyes closed. Maybe just starting by feeling the body in the sitting posture. Just in a general way, or if you're lying down, that's fine too. Maybe feeling the general shape or stance of the body right now. Feeling the contact where you're being supported so your seat against the chair, the cushion, the bed. Just allowing yourself to be supported. Letting go into the seat. Needing to hold yourself up. Willfully. Feeling the stability for your sitting. And then the support. And rising up from that stable base is the body. Feeling the spine in the middle. Feeling a sense of uprightness. And feel that the posture has some nobility to it. And so you can invite into the mind or the heart a sense of willingness or openness. Just to see what will come about. And that's what I think is most important. Not knowing is most intimate. Somehow just being with this. Yes, it is. Maybe connecting in the heart with a sense of. Our inspiration or interest in practicing. Maybe that's felt as. Something clear. Maybe it's felt as a longing. Where is a sense of. Something of some kind. So to match the uprightness of the body, we bring a straightforwardness of mind. Just being mindful in this moment. Connecting in with the sensations of breathing. To give the mind a place to settle. And to the degree that we can. Releasing certain distractions that may be in the mind. Such as wanting. Wanting something. Wanting something to happen. Wanting something to stop happening. Sensing the energy level of the mind. Releasing any. Dullness. That's present. Calm the mind. And if there's any uncertainty. Just allowing that. To be there without letting it. Take a little bit in mind. There's no way to do this meditation wrong. There's no way to breathe and correctly. Just resting for a few minutes with. A simple connection to the breath as a whole body process. Don't need to zero in on any part. Just let it be. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. Sit quietly. Allowing into the mind, the understanding of. The ever changing sensations. Of the breath in the body. Really. Opening to the flocks of the in and out breath. And all the little kaleidoscopic sensations as the breath. Moves in and out of the body. Biting the use. Simplicity with that. Effort changing experience. You. You. You. You. Including also the. Art in the mind. Noticing that the thoughts and the emotions and. Other movements of mind. Are also changing. Looking breathe through those other things. We don't need to make anything happen. We can be present and honest with all that's there. You. Still present. Perhaps bringing the understanding that we have in the quality of. Willingness and openness. Not knowing. The quality of faith. And being willing to see clearly. As to do with virtue. Being willing to let go. Distractions. And the quality of the. Quality of letting go. And the wisdom of generosity. And the wisdom of impermanence of constancy. And the wisdom of the Christian permanence. Part of the definition of learning is that we have. The teachings. So knowing the knowing of these qualities in meditative form. And the faith. Virtue. Giving letting go. Wisdom. And learning. And learning. And learning. And learning. And learning. And learning. I'm curious then this is. Chance for. You to share or ask. How was the sitting? Could you feel each of these in your own way? And if you had any questions on the. Talk about cultivation. Yeah. I just want to introduce myself. I live in San Diego. So I have a question about the reading where he talks about joy, rapture, tranquility. And the way it is presented, it almost seems to be a sequential series of events. But I'm wondering if that is really true. Can you feel tranquility without feeling joy as an example and rapture? So are there truly sequential or is it just a way of presenting it because you have to be sequential? That's a great question. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, when we stream words together, there has to be some order to them. And so, you know, would we have exactly the feeling first of inspiration and then joy and rapture and then tranquility in the body and so forth. In my experience, there's I think I said this last time about this list actually is that there the order of things is not arbitrary. And so it does it does sort of go in a sequence, but we don't need to be kind of blindly loyal to the exact sequence. You know, we might get the bodily tranquility coming right away with the faith and inspiration in the first step. That might already be the beginning of it, but it doesn't come to the fore until after we've had some degree of use it uses joy and rapture. These are somewhat you'll see different translations for that set there that set, by the way, is a set of five. It's another group of five that's used in a bunch of places. I think there it's listed as joy, rapture, tranquility, bliss and concentration. Yeah, that's it's also sometimes gladness joy tranquility happiness and concentration, which are different translations of the same ones, and it appears in a bunch of lists. And, yeah, my experience with them is that there is generally that flow because the gladness or I guess what he translates as joy is fairly energetic, and it starts out, you know, kind of like, wow, this is really great. And then it settles a little bit more. And then eventually the tranquility in the body happens when that joy settles out because the joy and the rapture rapture is not very tranquil, but it will flow into the way you know it spiritual rapture instead of kind of our everyday overexcitement is that it actually leads to tranquility. And then there does have to be happiness for there to be concentration I know sometimes people force happiness is one of the qualities of a concentrated mind. So people say, Well, wait a minute I was trying to get concentrated so I would be happy, but it's the other way around you have to be a little bit happy in order to be concentrated. So the the sukkah happiness does actually come first. I'm talking around your question a little bit much because I wanted to make this larger point. But I think the short answer is no you don't have to have exactly one after the other they're going to come kind of as a set those five. But the one at the front is the courses and the concentration is the most subtle. So that's kind of the direction that they go in. And I wouldn't I wouldn't spend a lot of time trying to pick out exactly which of the three kinds of happiness you have at different times. Does that make sense. Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, and this set of five I see your hand there Alex and then woman. The set of five does have to do with mindfulness of breathing you actually see it listed in also in suitors that relate to that. So, it's possible for it to come about through the meditation we just did. Okay, Alex. Yeah, this is a great class and I apologize for missing the first one. But I did go back and listen to the first course on audio Dharma and redo the readings but my so maybe maybe was last course you talked about these five factors providing a sense of stability and I get that sometimes I have difficult processing processing what I perceive as like negative energy like in a situation maybe due to my lack of being able to interpret the situation or not be acclimated to the whatever but understanding it. And maybe you can verify this is I think maybe you mentioned this that these factors help kind of give you a sense of stability in your situation and ability to process this stuff that's going on around you. I think that's a nice way to say it, and that's yet another aspect of them as resources, and maybe we could see that in that second reading with my Nama worried about getting running into a car or an elephant or something and being distraught and says don't worry, you know that's these five will support you in a distressing or confusing situation and we don't need to be hit by a card it can be more simple than that you know it can be just, you know, a social situation with a lot of people or new situation where it's hard to read what's going on. So yeah, I think you've, I think you've said it very well. Does that make sense. Yeah. Okay, great. And then Josh. Thank you. I'm from Brooklyn, New York. Yeah, I apologize for coming late. You raised a lot of wonderful points. I have a couple of questions but you can ask anyone or answer anyone. The meditation. I found very profound helpful, and your guidance was very for me and I was able to enter to somewhat deep state, also using kind of breathing. But, I guess I have a couple questions. One, when I when you talked about reflection and thinking that was very helpful to me because I often end up intellectualizing things. When I think about it, and it seems to separate me from the ability to actually sense my body and what's going on. Yes. So that's number one. And number two is, I'm going to be teaching mindfulness in a very difficult setting that writers I'll imprison. And I'm wondering how I might use these different meditative techniques, teach them or convey them in a simple and somewhat straightforward way so. Yeah, that's my question. I guess I've heard that the Buddha had kind of pedagogy where it was about first hearing and listening to the teaching, and then reflecting and then meditating, is that a plot does that apply to the each of these. So, sorry. Wonderful questions. Wonderful questions. So, first of all, where you talk about how thinking can sometimes separate and intellectualizing. That's a real issue, especially for Westerners where we're so conditioned into our heads. So, what we learn as we start to explore the mind and understand how it works is that there's actually multiple different layers of thinking and modes of thinking. And some of them are unhelpful and those are the ones that have gotten the bad rap over, over the eras with relating, you know, don't think in meditation and he doesn't have anything to do with your thinking mind and just push that away. Sometimes people can be afraid to use their cognitive mind at all. Whereas, when it's used correctly, actually froze with the body. Am I back. I'm okay. Okay, so maybe it's Josh who is frozen at this moment. I think that will resolve. Well, at the very least it will be caught on the recording. So, I think his question about intellectualizing is probably something that we can all relate to. And I don't encourage, I dropped off, okay. I encourage intellectualizing in the sense of just, just thinking. So I, you know, I'm, I'm careful in how I introduce using the thinking mind but I don't think it's helpful for people to be afraid of their thinking mind or to, you know, not ever want to use that you have to be integrated eventually. So, my question is how to do it skillfully and so for example in these recollections or in what I did in the guided meditation, you'll see that there's a way to do it and maybe you can start to touch into that yourself. But yeah, we don't if you're just thinking when pushing, you'll know, it's not, it's not leading toward tranquility toward concentration, etc. Let's see, and then he asked about Rikers Island but maybe I'll, I'll wait until he gets back to that. And then, what was the middle one I got distracted when we had all the freezing when help me out. Okay, so much for mindfulness you're supposed to be able to remember these things. It's not my, I'm not doing well. My job. All right, Amy come back in a moment. I'm also getting to that age where these things start to happen. Are there other questions. Okay, well good. So I wanted to go on to talk about the second study method in a little bit more detail so remember I said each time we'd say something about the five resources and something about the study method. So, this one as you might guess is to use a teaching contemplatively, which doesn't mean ordinary discursive thought or intellectualizing like we talked about before. You know it's really much more about this particular layer of thinking that can be supportive for practice. So, one way that we can do this is to go to really go deep into the quality energetically so that is now go that that is diving down below the level of the cognitive mind but we start with the thought of these five qualities. And then, as we connect with those. We feel it into the body. I hope some of you were able to feel some of those as energetic feelings during the sit. And then with that you can kind of drop away from the thinking part, you can let that part go you don't need to think of the word anymore. You know when you think of we think faith and there's a feeling in the body, whatever it feels like for you, and then you just you meditate with that you go into the energetic sensations. You can maybe look into that suit that was the third reading about how that eventually leads to various forms of happiness and tranquility and eventually to concentration so that would be a way to know that you're going forward. You know, you can start to think of the cognitive thinking eventually but it can be that we can start to deeply contemplate in the body. I remembered his other question and it's actually relevant here. And that was about the three kinds of wisdom. He didn't call it that but he said the three kinds of three levels of said you should think and reflect about things, and then you should hear things listen and reflect on them and then practice. Think was how he said it. The way that's framed in the teachings is those are three different kinds of wisdom. So, there we go we have one of our qualities on the list. But there's the wisdom of hearing suit of my opinion, which is taking in through reading through listening cognitively, there's another good use of the cognitive mind reading the suit is for example, we have to take that in in some way. And then we need to reflect on it though or contemplate as we're talking about here. And that's kind of a way of making it your own. So, yeah, it's nice to hear a list of five but then you have to somehow reflect like how does that show up for me. And that was a little bit what I asked you to do in daily life but you can do it also just through contemplation or through energetic sensation. And then you get a sense, oh, okay, it's not just something I know in my mind is a checklist. It's something that makes sense to me, it has relevance it has meaning in my life in my mind body system in my understanding. And that's all that's still kind of cognitive, because it's reflective but it's this deeper level that's actually useful. And then we might be ready to practice to actually go into them deeply to do the sequence that dives down into all the way into somebody. So we can really get familiar with those through Bob and Bob and Amaya Panya so suit am I upon your chin to my opponent is the no one Bob and Amaya Panya the wisdom of cultivation comes from practice. And that's the one that will eventually be liberating but the first two can be doorways into that one. So, very relevant for today's topic and we're I'm kind of weaving through all of them in how we're doing it today but it's essentially the circling around that contemplative one in the middle is what I want to talk about now. So we can use that suit or another way I just want to name a few different ways that we can use contemplation. Another one is to get the mind a little bit quiet through whatever method works for you breath, for example, or, you know, often breath is good. And when you know that your mind is somewhat quiet, you can drop in a question, you know, you can literally drop in a question like should be a wise question, not like what should I have for lunch tomorrow. But, you know, like what feels wise in this moment, or should my body be more settled, something like that, something question that has meaning for you should be specific, but you're not looking for a cognitive answer, you know, you've gotten to a place that's down below the discursive mind, and you don't pop back up into, Oh, I could do such and such. But instead, it's you go the other way you drop the question down into the body like dropping a stone down into a well. It's going to hit the water and you're going to hear something coming back. So you just drop something in and then you just see what comes. Maybe nothing comes. That's okay silence. Maybe a word comes, or maybe an image or a bodily sensation, and then it's so tempting if you're not skilled at this to pick that up with the thinking mind and run off with it. But instead, you feel it, you just let it happen in your system. And then, let it settle back into silence the way it pebble dropped into water will cause some ripples and then eventually the water will be still again. And you trust that that response whenever it was that did something in your system and you don't need to think about it, but it did something. Another thing that can be done. Oh Mary did you have a question about that one. Your description just now, to me, really connected with what you were saying about energetically feeling it in the body. Did you just describe that process. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, and it was prompted by words so that puts it in that middle realm of reflective or cognitive understanding. Just briefly, we've also mentioned concentration, and I was wondering where concentration fits into the list. I was uncertain about that into which list. The one that we're considering the list of five. He doesn't have concentration in it, but the way concentration is coming in is in that third reading. And when it started why that we would reflect that both the deities or the Davis and ourselves have our list of five which is faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom. Those are the five. And when we reflect on those. If we let them settle deeply below the cognitive mind, the mind will become concentrated. Okay, thanks. Yeah, that clear things up. Okay, good question. Probably other people had it too. So maybe one more method that we can use is that after the mind becomes somewhat settled again, it's possible to put in a result. What's called a resolve, and that is not a question but a, a wish, in a sense and we can say for example, I have an understanding of a nature, something like that, and it's, it's a very simple wish it's not anything complicated like me I figure out how to handle my neighbor's barking dog. But it should be Darmic, and this is this is a method that was taught by Mahasi Sayadaw and Upandita in Burma, the last century so this is a modern terra vata method it's also described in the pursuit in Maga commentary from about the fifth century. So, it's a method where when the mind has gotten receptive, we can ask it to open to something, and it might, it might not, and if it doesn't, don't push it, you know, wasn't the right moment. But, you know, it might. And so there's like little ways to start working with the mind. Yeah, more than just sitting with mindfulness or sitting in cultivating concentration, which is a great thing to do by the way because that's what leads to awakening. But this there's this middle realm where we can play a little bit, the contemplation. So this method kind of works, all these methods kind of work as a resonance that was pretty much what Mary said, is that you know you have some understanding of how it goes. And you kind of put your mind into the into the state by invoking these five qualities perhaps energetically, and then just letting them resonate between our understanding of them and the feeling of them. And then maybe if we put in one of these results or wishes or questions, there will be a response that comes out of having these five in the mind. So I would take it slowly, let it resonate. Don't look for results, but let it play out kind of mysteriously. And then, you know, we practice with this. And when you're contemplating a list, it will come out in daily life to, you know, it'll, and we'll talk a little bit more about that next time but you may start to have experiences where you see these qualities coming forth or notice them more easily, because we've been cultivating them in a contemplative mode. So, it brings us back to our first reading for today, where it says, you know, growing in five ways and noble disciple grows by noble growth and one absorbs the essence and the best of this life. So, it's very visual way of cultivating beauty through these five. Are there further questions at this point? Yeah, Josh, you're back. I'm back. Sorry. You froze and I froze and it was a freezing kind of thing. Yeah, no, I just was still curious about. Maybe you finished your thought about the intellectual mode about this second question in terms of a way to teach it and third question about how to kind of apply that kind of go to that I described to each one of those. Okay. I did answer the first and the third. Those are the one. Yeah, and I, they're on the recording. But just briefly, it's probably helpful with you for others. The three, the pedagogy that you described is in suitors it's it's actually three different kinds of wisdom so we have the wisdom of hearing to my opponent the wisdom of contemplating reflecting to my opponent and the wisdom of practice, Bob and my opinion, and they all work together. You know that kind of the first one isn't that important you could just skip over it. Second one's a little bit important and let's get on to the third. It's, you know, it's not quite like that. In fact, you'll, you've kind of anticipated a reading that we're going to have for the, for the next session. So, thank you for that Josh. And then the one I didn't answer was the one about Rikers Island, because it was a little more specific but the teaching in prison. But I wanted to ask because I have a little follow up about that. Have you had training with a prison Dharma group of some kind. Well, I've taught in prison before. I taught writing and peer counseling. I'm in a mindfulness teachers training certification program with Tara Brock and Jack Kornfeld, and I've spent a lot of time in monasteries in Southeast Asia, here so, but I have never, I've been reaching out to different Dharma groups who do prison work. And the Zen Mountain Monastery said they would provide me with some of their guidelines and I know there are a couple of others so I'm reaching out I haven't heard back from them yet. Okay, yeah, there. There's a pretty big prison training program here in California, and someone may need to help me on the name of it. But I, if you drop me a line through the site center I can find it later, and I think they would have, I can, I can connect you with a person, a friend of mine is involved with that. So, yeah, please send email through site center and I'll get you connected they might have some additional resources for you. I have not taught in prison myself I've taught in the psychiatric board which also has people who are in a quite a quite a state. And I also have talked with people who have done a lot of done a fair amount of prison work actually. See, Leslie anymore Leslie. Yes, she is. You've been in the prison. Do you want to speak a little bit to Josh. I would say that what was important for me was in a sense, humbly, seeking to understand the experience of the people that I was teaching. What seemed to really come across to people was a sense of my respect for and engagement in their experience and sort of the culture of their world. I would also say somewhat humorously but genuinely, it was important that I speak in a mode and a language that related to their world. I can remember one time saying to them at the beginning of a class, I can't tell you, there'll be no more shit happening in your life, but I'm going to tell you we're going to learn how to turn it into fertilizer. And people made reference back to that for the entire session, five or six weeks. They kept coming in and saying, I had some great shit. Can we talk about it? I want to work on that fertilizer or whatever. But the metaphor wasn't something I'd have used at inside Santa Cruz. And I'm not stereotyping that setting, but after getting to know the guys a little bit, it worked perfectly for them. Very helpful. Thank you. Great. Yeah, there's. I want that t shirt Leslie says Amber. Yeah, I think there are a lot of resources available for you Josh I think you asked in just the right place. And I can get you some more also. I do know that some other friends of mine who go into the prison say that working with the precepts is really interesting for inmates. They're, they, yeah, they connect well with that. And I think this relates to our topic because of course we have, you know, Dharma resources, and these five would be of interest to folks, you know, being able to have this kind of inner wealth when when maybe doesn't have so much freedom externally. Fred your hand was up. Thank you. I'm a friend of Buddhist pathways prison project. Thank you Buddhist pathways prison project. Diane wild is a friend of mine is involved in that. Thank you. BP three idea I think they have a nice website and some resources. I've also donated books to them and they're very appreciative of that. Great. I'm gonna suggest your hand was up briefly was that. Now it's down. Yeah, I just had a very basic question if you don't mind. Is the definition of wisdom that you use today. Is that consistent throughout all the teachings, because sometimes it seems to me that maybe I understood it differently in some way. And yeah, so I'm trying to understand if what you're saying today is consistent with all the teaching because as an example, discrimination and wisdom seem to go together for me and so if you don't mind, if you could just talk about that. Sure. Yeah, wisdom is a wonderful multifaceted quality in Buddhism that I think doesn't have just a single definition, you might be referring to how last time we, the the suits of it defined wealth, which was our subject last time to find wisdom as a penetrative knowledge of arising and passing. You know, I forget the exact language but actually I have it here. Look, just so I'm getting it correct. What is the wealth of wisdom here and noble disciple is wise they possess the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called the wealth of wisdom. So discrimination and discernment are also associated with wisdom and here particularly tied it to seeing impermanence. And that was what we used in the meditation also. But then there are other aspects other ways we can talk about wisdom like those three that I just that Josh referred to in the pedagogy and so I said yes these are another three ways that we could define different types of wisdom. In general wisdom in Buddhism has the sense of being like understood experience, you know, it's something that has come into our being as something that we would know in an experiential way. It's not quite like wisdom like something that we know just because we've been with it for a long time or something that we acquire by adding more and more amassing. I think I talked earlier about how we don't so much a mass qualities that we're developing but we grow them like seeds. So wisdom is also grown in that way. And it becomes something that's incorporated into our being as a response that will be able to produce when we have sufficiently grown it into our being, if you will. And it does have to do with seeing clearly seeing how things really work. So wisdom is seeing how suffering works for noble truth, seeing the three characteristics of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and not self. These are the two classic definitions of wisdom has to do with right view. So yeah, it has to do with seeing in a way that is actually accurate. How's that sound. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Mary. So I'm going to go back to the question between an intention in which you're putting something out but there's no real expectation, versus some grasping some really wanting. I'm going to speak about that because I've had some disappointments with putting out intentions and I could see it if I put one out. I mean that is, that's pretty major. And I don't think it's something I don't think that's what you were talking about because. I'm asking. Yeah, you have to be careful, you know, because an intention, I'm going to say kind of wanting right but even intention which is the second step of the noble eightfold path is a kind of wanting so this is, you know, skillful leaning toward things skillful leaning toward things and Aditana, the word for the poly word for resolve is one of the parmes. So it's something that we have to perfect in ourselves in order to be a Buddha. So, it's, it's always as always a matter of skill, you know, it's, it's not that all desires wrong or that all wanting or that all moving toward is automatically grasping. And that's an extra layer that we would add on and wisdom is what distinguishes whether or not we are doing that in a skillful way or not. And so, we feel for ourselves if there's any tension around it, or is it open if there's perfect equanimity we could have that resolve and if nothing came back. Oh well it wasn't the moment. I know and. But, yeah, this is the dynamic side of practice. Does that help. Yes, thank you. Yeah. I know when I was going back to hospice after having a lot of suffering the first time, which I needed a lot of reflection on. I had an intention to be more equanimous and to have a bit of joy, and just having that in the back of the mind without it becoming a heavy expectation that I've got to make this happened. Just had a different quality like an opening in my heart that was receptive rather than pushy. I'm not sure if that's correct. See you've answered your own question in a sense. So, maybe we would say that intention is about the present moment and a desire is about the future. Right. If you say in the present moment, may this be. And then we go on to the next moment. It's not like gotta have this gotta make this in the future, I don't have it now and I gotta get it. That's different. Yeah. Thank you, that makes sense. I'm like, wow, the time is passing quickly. We're right near the end so just guess I'll put in once again, the. Don I'll link if that's of interest, and then we have, again, a little bit of homework up to you, if you want to do it for next week, and there will be another email with some reading so the practice is, you know, try the cushion cultivation of these energetically, you know, sit down and feel in your practice maybe just run through them you could have the list in front of you in case you forget, but just feel like what is what is faith feel like for me energetically what about virtue, can I sense that is there a brightness, like what would be the energetic quality of each of these. See if you can feel that and see how it works on the cushion. Just to kind of practice with this mode of connecting with them through evoking them in the mind and then feeling the resonance in the body. And then there's going to be, you can review maybe review the suitors that we've had up to now it's just five little excerpts so kind of have those qualities in mind but I'm going to send you an essay about learning. In particular, because it may have felt like we didn't focus on that one much and also it's this one that everyone has questions are we allowed to use the thinking line. How does that work. So it's about learning and it'll actually have something about the three kinds of wisdom that Josh pointed us towards so you can see what you make of that and each of these classes is going to be different. So hope to see you next week. Have a wonderful week. Bye.
