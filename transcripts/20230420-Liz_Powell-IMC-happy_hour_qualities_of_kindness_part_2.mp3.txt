The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Just giving everyone a minute or two to arrive here.
I really appreciate this evening sangha that gives everybody a chance to spend a
portion of their day or for many of us end our day with practices that lighten
and broaden the heart, grow the heart to have these beautiful qualities that we
can extend to ourselves and each other in this world. It's this practice is said
to improve sleep, so I hope that's true for people here. Not during, but after.
So, welcome. And this evening I'd like to continue what I began on Tuesday, which
was reflecting a little bit on Gilfran Stahl's translation of the meta-suta. He
offered this in his book, The Issue at Hand, and I can later share a link to
that book, which is offered freely on Insight Meditation Center's website and
is also available for purchase from Amazon. So, the meta-suta as he
translated it really broadens the definition. You know, now that I'm
looking back at it many, many years after I first saw it and memorized it, I used
to, for several years, repeat it to myself every morning mentally, and it
really brought home these different qualities that are part of meta, part of
loving-kindness, and they really make it apparent that it's not a one-dimensional
kind of practice. It actually contains a lot of different practices. So, these are
practices that we can cultivate during our sitting meditation, as we'll do this
evening, but also in daily life, just by reflecting on these different dimensions
to begin with, and then by seeing where we might grow. So, I'm going to start, again,
by reading the meta-suta as Gil translates it aloud, and then we'll talk
about a little bit. To reach the state of peace, one skilled in the good should be
capable and upright, straightforward and easy to speak to, gentle and not proud,
contented and easily supported, living lightly and with few duties, wise and with
senses calmed, not arrogant and without greed for supporters, and should not do
the least thing that the wise would criticize. One should reflect, may all be
happy and secure, may all beings be happy at heart, all living beings, whether weak
or strong, tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, seen or unseen, near or
distant, born or to be born, may they all be happy. Let no one deceive another or
despise anyone anywhere, let no one, through anger or aversion, wish for
others to suffer. As a mother would risk her own life to protect her child, her
only child, so toward all beings should one cultivate a boundless heart, with
loving-kindness for the whole world should one cultivate a boundless heart.
Above, below, and all around, without obstruction, without hate and without ill
will, standing or walking, sitting or lying down, whenever one is awake, may
one stay with this recollection. This is called sublime abiding here and now. One
who is virtuous, endowed with vision, not taken by views, and having overcome all
greed for sensual pleasure, will not be reborn again. So Tuesday, I shared a few
reflections on the first four lines, and continuing, just reflecting on a few of
these ways we might cultivate loving-kindness that are suggested by this
Suta. It can be ways of being kinder within our own hearts to ourselves, but
they're also so much about relationship. So these lines, straightforward and easy
to speak to, gentle and not proud, contented and easily supported, living
lightly and with few duties, wise and with senses calmed. This is really actually a
lot if we could embody these virtues. Straightforward, again indicates a kind
of honesty, not attempting any deception, not lying by a mission, not exaggerating,
and that certainly makes people easier to interact with, to feel trust in. Easy to
speak to suggests that we're not reactive towards what is said, and how much
easier it is to talk to someone, even if we have something difficult to share, if
we know that they're not going to be reactive, but rather respond or take in
what we have to say, and then have dialogue about it. So we can see this is a
much more multi-dimensional idea of the virtue of kindness. It's not merely
being nice, and it can develop the quality of insight. So the next phrase,
gentle and not proud, speaks to these underlying virtues that make
straightforwardness and make a person easy to speak to. Someone who's gentle and
not proud, you can imagine, isn't leading with ego identification. They're not
needing to be right, they're not needing to be seen a certain way. This is
interacting the world from this moment, not from some identification. And it, when
self-preoccupation can fall away like this, we actually can do what the next
verses suggest and live more lightly. Not meaning taking things lightly, but
living without such a burdensome sense of self-concern. We can actually
experience more contentment and more ease when we're not self-preoccupied. We
can begin to see, we are actually surrounded by some abundance in these
lives of the people in this Zoom room. I think we have enough food, shelter, and
time to engage in the Dharma. That's a lot in this world right now. The more
contented we are with what we do have, whether it's, you know, we're just
barely getting by, or we have ample resources, the more contented we are
with these things, the less we find we need in general. And when we need very
little, we can live in a very peaceful kind way. So this line about
living with few duties is also an inspiration. I think you can imagine how
if you're not overburdened with a heavy workload or too many preoccupations
that leave you harried and feeling stressed, you can take the time to
communicate in kinder ways with other people. You can even, you know, participate
in the world in ordinary ways like driving or buying groceries, you know,
your interactions at the post office with a lot less sense of Russian, with a
lot more care for other people. So it also leaves some of these qualities
that I've just mentioned leave or are conducive for wisdom. You know, they're
leading us in a direction that we can engage in activities with wisdom and
avoid activities that don't have a sense of calm to them. So with those as a few
inspirations for continuing with building, you know, the fully fleshed out sense of
kindness this evening, let's start our meditation together. Just finding, beginning
by finding some time, taking some time to settle into what is supportive for you.
Sometimes just taking a few longer or slower breaths, more deliberate
breaths, and finding a comfortable posture that's going to sustain you this
evening so that you're able to give this your full attention. Sometimes this means
making some deliberate adjustments to the way you're breathing or the way
you're sitting in order to support a level of energy that you might need right
now. For some of us, we may need to bring just a little more energy in. That might
happen by sitting up a little straighter or paying close attention to the in
breath, which tends to bring energy into the system and allowing the mind to be
right here right now with the breath. For others of us, if we have a lot of
activity in the system, we might want to bring a little ease by paying attention
to the out-breath and releasing some of the excess energy with each out-breath.
Sometimes it's possible to bring softness or ease to any area of tension or any
stress in the body, in the mind, in the heart, letting the breath be your ally.
And if there's activity that's present that will not be released right now or
tension that's present, it's fine simply to acknowledge it's here, perhaps allowing
it to be there in the background while bringing your attention to our meditation
this evening in the foreground. Perhaps calling to mind someone who is
straightforward and easy to speak to. This could be a mentor or a friend, anyone,
any being who's supportive in your life, even someone you don't know that well,
but in whom you observe these qualities. Maybe they're an inspiration to you.
Allowing images, thoughts of this person or being to fill your mind. Perhaps
appreciating the ways in which you've seen them be straightforward or be easy
to speak to, easy to speak with.
Noticing any feelings that arise with that. There may be a sense of inspiration or
simple appreciation. If you've been on the receiving end of kind straightforwardness
and found it easy to speak with this person, there might be some gratitude at
what could have been a tough conversation, ended up being doable. Seeing how these
qualities that the person has have been supportive. You may even feel some sense
of this care for this person in whatever way intellectually or emotionally or even
in an embodied way you can appreciate their quality of straightforwardness and
being easy to speak with, sending them kind wishes. May you be well, may you be
safe and free from harm, may you be happy,
may you live with ease.
Sometimes as you send these kinds of wishes, additional feelings or other
kinds of thoughts or images may arise, allowing all of them, just recognizing
them. Whether they're pleasant or challenging, continuing to bring the
mind back to these qualities that you appreciate in this person, their
straightforwardness, the way it's easy to speak with them and continuing at your
own pace to send these wishes, may you be well, may you be safe and free from
harm, may you be happy, may you be at ease,
may you be well, may you be safe and free from harm, may you be well, may you be
safe and free from harm, may you be at ease,
if the mind strays at all, gets distracted, and gently bringing it back
and maintaining or renewing your kind wishes.

allowing the mind to summon any images or thoughts of this person or another
person who is gentle and not proud, not self-preoccupied, easy to be in
relationship with, allowing any feelings of appreciation or gratitude or simple
inspiration, recognition of this person, seeing them in action, thinking of them
in action, in their gentleness, their kind engagement with other people that's not
self-centered, and sending these same kind wishes, perhaps including any
additional wishes you'd like to send, may you be well, may you be contented, happy,
may you be free from all harm, inner, harm, and outer harm, may you live with
ease, and continuing to send kind wishes in silence.

and if you wish you can turn your attention towards
sending wishes to yourself for cultivation of any of these qualities that might be beneficial to you and to your relationships.
Straight forwardness, easy to speak with, gentleness, non-self preoccupation, contentment,
living in an easily supported way, senses having been combed.
If any of these qualities stand out for you, you may send yourself a kind wish, like, may I be contented?
May I be free of self preoccupation?
May I be straightforward?
May I be easy to speak with?
Whichever one or ones that speak to you, you can send yourself these wishes or you can send them to someone whom you care about, whom you want to experience these beautiful qualities.

One of the things that I think is worth reflecting on for, you know, days, weeks, months, years about these qualities is that they are not intended to be weak.
So, for example, I think if you thought of an inspiring example, you might have recognized that someone who's straightforward is not harsh, but it also doesn't mean that they're a pushover.
If they're easy to speak with, it doesn't mean that they're not firm when they need to be.
Same with gentle, a gentle person that you admire can also deliver news in a way that people can hear it.
Not proud, it doesn't mean that they don't have character strength.
Contented does not mean complacent. Living lightly does not mean living without care or not engaging in this world.
A person can be quite an activist and hold it in such a way that they don't burn out in doing it.
So that speaks to the wisdom piece of this.
So, I hope that these are beneficial reflections to bring into awareness, and I want to now offer time that you can share a few inspirations with one another and be inspired by one another.
And as we do this, as always, it's useful to just share, we're going to be in small groups of three, it's useful to just share one thing at a time.
And when it's your turn to listen, to listen without advice or crosstalk, simply listen from your heart to what the other person is saying and also what's coming up in you.
So as we do this, we'll take about 10 minutes.
And the idea is not to say things necessarily you already know about yourself, but to see if what comes up that's new, what you might be so pondering or puzzling over, and to see what you hear that might inspire something new.
So with that, we'll go into the breakout rooms. See you in 10 minutes.
Thank you.
