The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Okay, so as an introduction to our guided meditation, just want to say that usually,
not always, but usually when there's an emotion, there's some reflection of that
experience physically in the body. There's a felt sense, there's a sensation in the body.
And some of you will be really familiar with this and it's a regular part of your
meditation practice. And for some of you, this might be a little bit new and might
require a little bit more effort to find or connect to this experience in the body.
For example, when there's anger, there can be a lot of heat or pressure in the body
and we can feel the heat and the pressure or when there's fear, there might be a
sense of butterflies in the belly or when there's joy that feels a certain way.
Often joy can have a little effervescent bubbly feeling to it or love kind of
feels maybe like smooth and expansive. So I'm using kind of vague language and all
of us have our own words to match our experience. But in general, not always,
but in general, many of the physical correlates of our emotional experiences
may be found in the central axis of the body here.
That, you know, that face, the head, throat, chest, belly.
When they have asked people to give them like an outline of the body and to
color in different areas of the body where they feel love, where they feel
happiness, where they feel joy, and they did this with hundreds of people.
It was surprising how most people had most emotions somewhere in this
central axis of the body. So when we talk about these physical sensations,
it might be something to look there or tune into that part of your experience.
And when there's a physical sensation, there's also an emotional tone to it.
Susie was talking about earlier a feeling tone, they did not, I might say.
So something, if there's a difficult emotion that feels oppressive,
then that generally has a tone of being unpleasant.
And there might be an experience of joy or love, and that has a tone of being
pleasant. And then there are a lot of emotions, a lot of our emotional
experiences somewhere in between. So when we're talking about sensations of
the body, maybe the actual sensation, heat, may be noticeable, or maybe it's
the tone of it that might be a little bit noticeable.
So we can tune into this and see what's unfolding and what is being expressed
in this physical sensation. And what does this physical sensation
really feel like? And can we touch it with our attention?
And in open-handed ways, like just kind of like, you know, with our
cupping it, like cupping our experience, not grabbing it or not shoving it,
but with our attention, but can we just hold it lightly with care, warmth,
and kindness?
And then maybe I'll say that some people that are hesitant to be with the
physical portions, physical element of their emotions, because they have this,
they have this feeling of having this very complex emotion that's going on,
a little bit afraid of making it simple, because then I might lose the meaning
and I might lose the richness, and this meaning and richness is really important
to me. So I don't want to just be with the physical sensations with it.
So I want to say it is important. The robustness, the richness of our emotions
are really important. But for right now, just for our purposes for this
guided meditation we're about to do, we're going to put the meaning and the
stories assigned. Don't worry, you can pick it up again later, it'll still be
there. But we're just going to look at the felt, the sensations, the experience
of having these emotions.
Okay. So with that as an introduction, so you can find a posture that is
comfortable. We won't be here for a really long time.
A posture that has a back that is upright and steady, but not rigid.
Has some relaxation and some uprightness.
When we can begin by just doing a light body scan, feeling into the face.
Common place to hold tension. Just a natural place.
Relaxing around the eyes, the jaw, relaxing the mouth.
The throat, the neck, shoulders.
Feeling in, feeling what's there. And relaxing, letting go, softening.
Feeling into the arms, the back, the chest, the belly.
Just letting yourself feel how it feels.
There's a feel to sit here right now.
I feel alive to the experience of sitting.
So is it possible to be aware of what the emotional state is in the body?
The emotional experience right now.
With the body just checking in and seeing what are you feeling right now?
It's probably not anything dramatic at this moment.
In this central axis of the body, the torso, front of the torso.
What do you feel?
What is being, what emotion is being expressed?
It might be your habit to be focusing on the sensations of breathing.
But for now, just let that go.
And we're just feeling what's to be felt.
The expression of emotion in a physical way.
Maybe it feels soft or fuzzy or diffuse.
Maybe it feels light or heavy.
Maybe it's clear and distinct.
We're just being sensitive to the emotional state as it's being expressed in the body.
We don't have to pin down the exact nature or the exact location of the experience.
Softening any preconceptions about what you think you should be experiencing.
Softening any expectations or pressure.
Softening any demands.
Softening any demands.
Maybe it feels a little bit slippery or maybe there are waves of intensity or always in flux changing.
And a relaxed, easy way can we draw close to the experience in the body that feels to be expressing the emotional state, the state of the heart.
And then relating to the sensations as just sensations.
Maybe it's clear and obvious.
Maybe it's not clear or obvious.
Can you be okay either way?
And then to end this meditation, you can feel the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body.
Feel your feet on the ground and when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes.
Thank you so much for that, Diana.
That was lovely.
And I would be curious to hear from you, from some of you, how that went.
What did you discover? What was challenging? Anything you'd like to share or something you might like to clarify about that practice?
I see Kathleen, your hand is up, but it maybe has remained up.
From sort of wallowing off emotions with the mind-body experience and something that I've had for about six months, I've been advised to call it unpleasant physical sensations.
It's pain from an injury and I'm more aware and especially was aware then of wallowing that off, that I don't, you know, having access to my emotions is through the body, but there's so much I want to avoid with my body and how to work with those.
I could just feel myself being able to step a little bit away from the intensity of the pain and how people work with that.
So was your experience with this practice that we just did, that was the kind of challenge, just how to even enter into this space of the body with so much pain?
Yeah, it's good. I can enter into the pain, that's very easy. It's available most of the time, but to be able to enter into the emotions, there's more than this.
Yeah, yeah.
There is this unpleasant, very unpleasant, but there's more than that and a longing, sort of a longing for that, just being able to step into it a little bit.
Well, we're going to explore today some different ways of practicing with our emotion and taking a different kind of relationship.
You know, what we did here, it had this kind of vipassana approach, you know, this noticing, attending.
You know, you mentioned you have some skill with entering into the pain that's there, so maybe you practice, you have that way of practicing already.
So it's possible that really opening up a different angle of practice, maybe coming more into the kind of the direction of heart practices or working really with the quality of our awareness and things like that that we'll explore.
It might open up because it's not going to be coming in through the same route, you know, where you've been practicing, where you've been working with how you relate to this intense painful experience.
So that that's very possible.
You know, it's also possible.
It really depends, I think, on the intensity and you will know best for yourself, but to spend a little bit of time just intentionally kind of trying to tune into the particular frequency that this more subtle frequency of the emotions to it could be something
maybe you include a little bit in this same vipassana style, but that's what that's what comes comes to me now.
Okay.
Yeah.
And maybe I'll just to help support you, Kathleen, for today, I'll build on a little bit of what Susie just said.
And one thing is to, when we're in like physical pain, often the whole body tenses up.
And so as best you can, if you can relax, I don't know where your injury is or the pain is but relax the shoulders, relax the belly or something like this.
And then maybe just do a little inquiry.
Are there areas of the body that aren't in this pain, tip of the nose, ear lobes, elbows, you know, something like this, so that you can have don't have a feeling that you have to avoid your whole body, but instead to gain some confidence or some facility
of still connecting with the body, even though the unpleasantness is there.
And, of course, one is, can you bring an as best you can and I'm not saying this is easy. I'm not saying this is easy.
Can there be an attitude of, okay, this is unpleasant.
And it's actually what's happening right now. So to be unpleasant, but allowing the unpleasantness to be there, without making it a problem.
And I know this is not easy, but can we just say this is what unpleasantness feels like. It feels like this.
I just offer that some things to think about. And as the day goes, Susie and I will be offering some more things. Thank you.
Would you think Diana, so we do one more question. Yeah, yeah.
Sheila.
Yeah, I find that negative emotions, I feel them very strongly in my body. I can sense exactly where they are, how they're moving, whether fear, sadness, feeling of being overwhelmed, anxiety.
But I can't remember ever noticing the positive emotions in my body. I don't know if I'm not aware of them or I really don't feel them in the body.
Just a comment.
Susie, do you want to say something?
Sure. I'm happy to. Yeah, that makes a great deal of sense, Sheila, and you're probably not the only person who has that experience.
Or range of factors. Some of them I think kind of related, they kind of have an evolutionary rationale. It's the impact of the negative and the things that indicate danger, fear, all of that.
It really can just have this strong resonance.
That's one thing that's really on offer for us with meditative practice is kind of like recalibrating our relationship to the pleasant and the unpleasant in our experience.
So I would suspect that you kind of postulated to possibilities, you know, is it not there or am I not sensing it?
I would suspect there's a lot that you can begin to sense in what might be, you know, begin as a more subtle thing.
But I think that that's a very kind of possible and beautiful goal to work on is to have more to kind of keep a foot in the positive and how we experience our emotional life.
It's a really beautiful goal and I think a great way to practice.
So just like opening the idea that you might want to do that and that it's possible can kind of be a beginning to start that kind of listening curiosity.
Yeah, great. That was beautiful. Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, so I think we'll take a break now.
