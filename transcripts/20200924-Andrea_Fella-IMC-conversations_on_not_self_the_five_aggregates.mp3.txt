Hi everyone. 
Nice to see you. 
So in the guided meditation I offered a little bit of a taste, perhaps, of the experiences of different aspects of experience that the Buddha pointed to in a particular teaching called the Five Aggregates. 
This teaching is very connected to his explorations around how we get confused about a sense of self. 
So he often offers the teaching of not-self in connection to this teaching on the aggregate and he points to a particular, he talks about eye-making and mind-making, which we often would call selfing and he often again points to that we eye-make and mind-make around these various aspects of experience of these five aggregates. 
So I wanted to, you know, given the format of this class being such a short time for a talk, I want to just do a kind of a brief overview of this today and then we'll see how it goes over the coming weeks, you know, whether we want to get into any one of them more specifically or not. 
Some of that will just, that will depend on you, on what questions you have and things like that. 
So the Five Aggregates, just to the term aggregate, is kind of a funny word, you know. 
It sounds so technical and it is kind of a technical word in English, you know, it's the way I had learned about this word. 
I think the main association I had with this word was through like geology of like aggregate rock, you know, that what is an aggregate rock though, you know, basically it's a rock made of other rocks. 
So it's kind of just a bunch of rock glommed together of other pieces of rock. 
And so it's just like a bunch of things stuck together in a group. 
And the word in poly, conda, actually just means something like a bunch of things stuck together in a group. 
I mean, that's a pretty good translation of the word. 
So I think aggregate's a good word, but it's just that's not a word we use so much in English. 
Another word perhaps would be group or heap or bundle, something like that. 
I understand that the word is much more common in poly than aggregate is in English, you know. 
So it would be more like saying, okay, the Buddha's going to give the teaching on the five groups, or you know, that was going to give the teaching on the five heaps, something like that. 
So, you know, we can we can set aside the word aggregate and like thinking of this is really technical. 
It's just basically five heaps of things. 
And in another way, I like the word aggregate and maybe the translation is nice too, because the teaching talks about the aggregates both being that the teaching talks about these five areas and I'll just name them right now. 
We went through them in the guided meditation briefly. 
Body, feeling, and that feeling, not emotion, but feeling of pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. 
The perception, the recognition of experience, mental formations, that that's a big area of emotions and mind states, thoughts, beliefs. 
It includes things that we think of as emotion, but also other things that we don't think of as emotion, like concentration would be a mind state and equanimity and love and patience are mind states. 
So, so there's, there's a whole, this is a, this is a big category. 
And then there's knowing or consciousness that just bear simple recognition. 
This, there's the experience and there's the knowing of it. 
So every, every experience has that. 
So the teaching about the aggregates points to that there's, there's one particular teaching where the Buddha describes and defines the aggregates as processes. 
So he calls these the five processes of body and mind. 
So there's a process of body that isn't a living, like dynamic process. 
So I think this is important because we so often think of things as things, as stable, as permanent. 
And all of this is being pointed to as very dynamic. 
And so, you know, the process of the body and, you know, the body, we can think about this in a simple way, like the body is kept alive by food and water, you know, it's like there's a nourishment aspect to keep the body alive. 
If we don't do that, it's going to, it's going to just die. 
And so, you know, we can even understand it really as a process in that way. 
And then all of these are understood as processes, the feeling, the process that, that recognizes the or, or feels experience, you know, the pleasant, the unpleasant, the neutral aspect of experience. 
So these five are described as processes, the process of feeling, the process of perception, the process of body, the process of mental formation, the process of knowing. 
But it's also, they're also talked about as the results of the processes. 
So the process of feeling is responsible for kind of feeling experience, you know, and that's the way the Buddha described it. 
When he was asked, he said, somebody said, well, why, why is it called feeling? And the Buddha said, well, it feels, that's why it's called feeling, kind of a silly, a redundant answer. 
But, but it does the process of feeling. 
So he's just, he's describing them as verbs, essentially. 
So it feels, that's why it's called feeling. 
And then he says, what does it feel? It feels pleasant, it feels unpleasant, it feels neutral. 
Then he would, he went on for the others and it's, it's, it's perception because it perceives, it recognizes, what does it recognize? And he named some things, he said, well, it would recognize that things are blue or yellow or orange or they'd recognize, it would be recognized that it's, it could even go to chair or book or, so just the recognition process. 
So the, the aggregate is, aggregates are understood, this teaching is understood to describe not only the process, but also what that process kind of does or connects to. 
So when we talk about feeling, feeling, the feeling, aggregate, sometimes we're speaking about this process of feeling and just recognizing that there is this feeling happening. 
And sometimes we're more specifically recognizing that feeling is, is knowing this is pleasant, this is unpleasant, this is neutral. 
So it's got both sides of it. 
And, and from that standpoint, the word aggregate is interesting because it can, it is also both a verb and a noun. 
You know, the, the aggregate rock is created by being aggregated, by being put together, you know, all these pieces of rock are put together, they are aggregated to make an aggregate. 
So that's a similar kind of thing happening with these, with these five processes. 
There's, there's the process and then there's the set of things that it processes, I guess we could say. 
So every experience that we have, you know, the Buddha basically described these five processes and the entirety of our human experience is happening through these five processes. 
There's no other part of experience that's happening. 
Any other piece, any piece you can think to name or describe, it can fit into one of these five categories. 
So, you know, that we recognize something, okay, well that's the process of perception or that we feel pain, well that's the process of feeling, that we can identify that feeling of pain in the knee, that's the recognition of me. 
So the, the, these processes are, the Buddha talks about them as being separate processes, but they are really interwoven, like they influence each other, they kind of weave together to form our experience, to create the human experience. 
And the Buddha, part of the reason the Buddha points to this and encourages us to understand this, is because that weaving together of experience that our minds do, very naturally, you know, our minds very quickly weave together a stabbing in a particular location of the body that's experienced as unpleasant, you know, as the knee that's painful and reacts to it with aversion, oh that happens in a split second. 
And we don't necessarily think about it as being all these different processes kind of interacting. 
We think it's my knee that hurts. 
So, you know, so there's a, this is where the Buddha is pointing to, you know, the sense of self is kind of a, you could say maybe, a misunderstanding related to these five aggregates. 
And that if we, you know, so we, we normally don't see all of these different threads of our experience, it's like we, you know, when we have that pain in our knee that we're frustrated about, it's just like one big thing. 
And we don't really recognize, well there's the, there's the unpleasant sensation, there's the unpleasant, I mean there's the sensation of the, of the burning or stabbing, then there's the unpleasantness, there's the attribution of it as knee, then there's a reaction to that of not liking and wanting to get rid of, you know, seeing that this is a, you know, set of processes, just conditioned processes tumbling on. 
What we normally do is insert a sense of self in there. 
This is happening to me, I need to fix this, this is a problem. 
And it's, it's not, you know, it's not, it's not that we don't like want to change our posture or something, but there's this attribution of being a, there being a, a kind of a being in there independent of these processes. 
And that's what the Buddha is pointing to actually, he points to this, this whatever process we think of as I, me or mine, if you start looking at that, you'll just see it's no, nothing other than an interweaving of these processes at work. 
There's nothing separate kind of apart from these processes. 
And so he pointed to beginning to recognize to understand these processes, to see them in our experience as a way both, so there's two pieces, he points to it as, you know, to help understand the sense of self and to see where clinging happens. 
Because he points to these, another name for this list is the five aggregates of clinging. 
So, you know, he points to clinging, tending to happen around these areas of experience. 
You know, we tend to cling to the body, we want the body to be a certain way. 
We cling to feeling, we want pleasant feeling, we don't want unpleasant feeling. 
We cling to our perceptions, we take our perceptions to be more solid than just, we take, we actually interpret our perceptions to be kind of what's actually out there as opposed to a reflection in the mind. 
What we are perceiving, I think there are things out there. 
I think there, like, I think there's a wall and a lamp and a guitar and a couch there. 
I mean, I think I'm seeing these things. 
I think, I think there's things are there. 
But what I can know of that, all that I can know of that has been created in the mind. 
Through this process of perception, you know, through this, the eye takes in the sight, mind, memory, knows that that shape means guitar and, you know, recognizes it as guitar. 
But that's all happening in the mind. 
And so our experience of the world is a reflection of the world, not the actual world. 
And this is, you know, so when we take our perception to be what's actually out there, what we don't know or don't recognize is that it's very easy for perception to be influenced by ideas, views, beliefs we have about that have been created based on our history with those perceptions in the past. 
You know, if I had bad experiences with guitars in the past, I might look at that and think it's unpleasant. 
You know, just a silly kind of example. 
But, you know, as it is, it's, I haven't actually played my guitar in a very long time. 
It's pretty neutral at this point. 
So, you know, the perception can easily be influenced by this other area, mental formations. 
Mental formations, this area of beliefs and ideas and emotions and another big area that we identify with and cling to, cling to particular beliefs. 
So that's a big one, we cling to particular beliefs. 
We also actually cling to different emotions, you know, different ways that we relate to experience. 
We identify with those very strongly. 
I mean, for myself, before I met the practice, I really strongly identified as being a miserable person. 
I'm just miserable, like, you know, not very happy. 
And, you know, occasionally I was happy, but, you know, when that happened, I would just say, well, yeah, but I'm really miserable. 
You know, just really like carrying an identity through, really just identifying with that emotion, being that's me. 
Yep, I recognize that. 
I feel that a lot. 
That's me. 
That's a big area of identification and selfing and clinging. 
Actually, clinging and selfing are kind of flip sides of a coin. 
When we cling, we are selfing. 
And when we are selfing, we are clinging. 
Sometimes we feel the clinging more. 
Sometimes it feels more like, oh, I got to keep that. 
And sometimes it feels more, more the sense of, I've got to do this. 
I've got to think this, you know, I've got to feel this. 
And so it's got more of the I component in there. 
The clinging may more have a visceral sense of need or want or something like that. 
So the, the Buddha pointed to these understanding these aggregates and recognizing them in our experience, because as we start to recognize them, maybe just in the little flavor we got in the guided meditation, we've got a sense, perhaps of, you know, that there are these different ways that we can see experience. 
As we begin to be curious about these parts, these aggregates, and see them as processes at work, and then see them as influenced by the other processes that there's just these interweaving processes, it begins to undermine our, our, our sense or our belief that there is an I and me or a mind here. 
Because as we look at our experience in this way, and even look at what we think of as a sense of self in this way, we see it's just an arising experience that's got these various threads to it that are weaving together. 
And so the, the exploration of the aggregates, you know, at first I think when we first start exploring them, it's helpful, you know, just to get familiar with them, just to start getting familiar with these different areas of experience. 
And then as you, as you see that, you start seeing how, for instance, the feeling tone, we, you know, when we experience something pleasant, we might start to recognize there's a difference between a pleasant feeling, and then the liking of it, and the need to have more of it, or there's a difference between, there's something unpleasant, and the desire to get away from it, or the desire, you know, the feeling of a version towards it. 
Before we really start looking at these, it can kind of feel like aversion and unpleasant are just they're, they're, they're completely tied together. 
They can't possibly be separate that if something's unpleasant, I've got no choice but to be averse to it. 
But when we start seeing them as different processes, we start seeing that the unpleasantness can be there, and that sometimes the aversion may be strong, and sometimes it might be weak. 
Sometimes it might not be there at all. 
And then we get to see a whole different experience. 
If the aversion is strong, we feel how the whole system kind of clamps down. 
And, and then there's, you know, the sense of I need to do something about it. 
And so the, the, the seeing of the process of feeling a separate from the mental formation, separate from the liking, the not liking, the, the greed, the aversion, that starts to really point to something very powerful to see through how we habitually create suffering in our minds. 
That when we, when we start to see that the, the feeling tone doesn't have to have that liking or not liking associated with it. 
It may, it, it does often. 
And, and yet then we can just recognize, okay, well there's the feeling and there's the liking or the not liking. 
Those are two different things happening. 
So just starting by beginning to get familiar with these things starts to help us to recognize how they play with each other, how they interact with each other. 
You know, how, another thing we might start to see is that when the aversion is strong, for instance, and so just playing with the feeling and the mental formation for a little while. 
So unpleasant experience, strong aversion. 
What the experience tends, what happens then is the, as aversion gets stronger, is the unpleasantness gets stronger. 
Because aversion is an unpleasant experience, and aversion itself is unpleasant, and it tends to create a constriction around experience, which then tightens the physical body. 
So the aversion actually has a feedback loop in the body, tightens the physical body, which often then exacerbates whatever pain there is, and then the aversion can get stronger. 
So, but if you can see that, if you can see the aversion strengthens, wow the pain gets stronger, the aversion weakens, the physical unpleasantness also gets weaker. 
So you can watch that happening and see how they interact with each other. 
And this also begins to undermine the sense that I'm doing any of this. 
You know, that I am, I am, I'm the one being angry, you know, it's just like, wow, this is a condition. 
When the unpleasantness is there, anger tends to arise. 
I didn't like make it happen, it was a condition. 
And so the seeing how these processes interrelate, the conditioned nature of these processes, is one of the major ways we start to understand the not-self nature of our experience. 
So I'm going to stop there, and there's a few minutes for comments or questions, and we'll see what comes up. 
It may be that, you know, we could see if there's a big question that comes up, it could go to next week, and I'll just talk about it next week, but yeah, I'm curious about what your thoughts are with us, or questions. 
Andrea, I have a simple one. 
Okay. 
We'll start simple. 
So based on what you said earlier, it would be correct to say, instead of I am hungry, this body is hungry. 
We could say the body is hungry, but also I'd say, so there's, there's two, there's more than just the body, there's also the kind of the intention, the hunger is potentially more than just the physical. 
It also, you know, can create intention to act, and so the body is hungry, the mind knows that hunger, and then an intention arises to alleviate that hunger, and then an action that would happen from that, you know, so for instance, you know, wanting to get up to get some food, or wanting to eat, you know, so the, the, let's, let's, let's take the wanting word out of it, let's say the intention, because it's, it can be neutral, this, you know, it can be much more neutral, this intention to alleviate that hunger, that intention itself does the intending. 
That's, that, I think in the area of the intention and the mental formation is one of the big areas where we tend to really attribute an I, because it's, it's very hard to think of these processes as having their own agency, and this is, this is a big, this is a big area, I think I will take some time to really dive into mental formations at some point, because that's a huge area of, of identification, but I'd say yes, you could, you could essentially say yes, you take the I out of it, you know, the body is hungry, the body is experiencing hunger, the body and mind, because it takes the mind to be, to be experiencing, that the mind has to know it. 
Well, if nobody else has a question, I can ask one more. 
Okay. 
If that's okay. 
Yeah. 
I've been pondering this for quite a while, so this is an opportune time to ask. 
I was thinking weeks ago that what contains the five aggregates, like the body contains the heart, but what would contain the five aggregates, what would we call the container? Well, I don't think the Buddha would say there is a container for them. 
They're like, man, a few weeks ago I used the analogy of the river and, you know, so, I mean, there's kind of a container. 
We could kind of say that there's a kind of container of the body that, you know, is containing some of the other processes, but that bodily process is also not a thing that's, you know, its own thing. 
So kind of like the river bed is containing the river, but that river bed is also fluctuating and moving. 
You know, in terms of the five aggregates, what I would say is shaping them is kind of creating a coherence to them, because there's kind of a coherence, right? I mean, there's a coherent flow of these five aggregates. 
It's not like, it's almost like there's some kind of magnetic force that's holding it together or something, you know. 
It's kind of like a, and I would say that that force is karma. 
The intention leads to a result of the conditioning power itself. 
I would almost call the container. 
So that, you know, the force of conditioning, the force of, you know, the next moment of experience arising, independence on the prior moment of experience. 
That's why it's got some coherence to it, because of that shaping power. 
But karma itself, it's almost, yeah, I mean, it does, it's more like an energetic force field or something. 
And so I would, I would call that, you know, the thing that shapes or coheres the experience. 
This process of intention and action, you know, yielding a result. 
So essentially the conditioning process unfolding, because it's, it is a, there's a lawful unfolding of our experience. 
It's like in this next moment, suddenly my five aggregates don't just suddenly like vanish and go poof and then reform over in, you know, in the next state. 
You know, there's, there's a lawful unfolding. 
And that lawfulness is described as, as karma. 
So that's, that's the best I think I can do with that, you know, that that to me is, is that force. 
It's not, you know, it's a container more like a magnetic field as a container. 
It's like an atom with the protons and neutrons. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. 
That that it's, it's, it's, it's like, you know, it's held together by conditions, not by a thing. 
So I don't know if that, if that. 
No, there are teachers that relate form to the body, of course, and then the other four processes, they relate to the mind. 
Yes. 
So it's very important. 
So I've been thinking about the container being the body and the mind together. 
Yes, I think of it as together, absolutely. 
Yeah, yeah. 
And I also think of the body and the other four aggregates are mental processes. 
I also think of it that way. 
That's clearly the way the Buddha spoke about it. 
So is there a sutra that I can reference that would speak of this? There's many that would speak of which? What we're talking about the container and the cohesiveness and the mind and body. 
You know, I'll have to think about that. 
Yeah, let me, let me think about it. 
There's a lot of aggregate sutras. 
And maybe what I can do is, is create a list and post it next time. 
Oh, great. 
Very good. 
No hurry. 
This takes me quite a while to even get to this point. 
So thank you. 
You're welcome.
