Allowing yourself to arrive in this room, in your body. 
I'm seeing if there can be some measure of relaxation. 
Relaxation is a great support for mindfulness. 
Basically, when our mind is not relaxed, it tends to be caught, pulled into thoughts of past or future. 
And yet when our mind begins to relax, it very naturally takes in what's happening now. 
That's in the terrain or in the direction of what mindfulness practice is, connecting to the physical, mental experience that's happening now in your mind, in your body. 
And so we'll start with a little bit of inclining towards relaxation because it's so supportive. 
I may be doing this systematically, starting with your head and face, allowing there to be a relaxing, a softening of the head and face across the brow, around the mouth and jaw. 
Relaxing the neck, shoulders. 
Relaxing the arms and hands. 
Relax. 
Allowing the muscles of the chest and upper back to relax all those muscles in the torso. 
And maybe taking a deeper breath and noticing how all of those muscles around the rib cage expand, stretch the in-breath and can release and soften, let go on the out-breath. 
Maybe another deeper breath. 
And then letting the breathing return to normal and seeing if there can be a softening of the stomach and abdomen, middle and lower back, the hips, the legs and the feet. 
And then sometimes we can also consciously soften a little bit inside the body. 
Not always, but maybe, maybe the inside of the throat can relax. 
Maybe the area around the heart can relax. 
Maybe the stomach and intestines can relax. 
And given however much relaxation there is in this moment, maybe the stomach and intestines can relax. 
And given however much relaxation there is in this moment, just letting yourself take in this body sitting here. 
Just curious, aware of this experience of a body. 
The body speaks to us, communicates with us with so many different sensations and how is this experience of sitting? It doesn't need to be detailed or digging. 
It just, oh, it's like this. 
It's like this. 
Oh, it's like this to be a human being sitting. 
Contact of your hips against the chair or cushion. 
Connection of your hands touching each other or touching your legs. 
Contact of feet. 
Maybe the sense of a more broad uprightness of the body. 
That can be a little bit subtler experience. 
And then within the body and the whole, there can be all kinds of other sensations like vibration, pulsing, tingling. 
Maybe particular areas of coolness or heat, stress, and maybe the movement of the breath. 
This is gentle rhythm of the breath coming in and going out. 
And how is that? How does the body let you know you're breathing? Maybe sensations in the nostrils or throat or the movement of the chest or abdomen, so many different places. 
Feeling a flow of the air coming in and going into the body, more of a sense of the body breathing. 
And also happening in the present moment, aside from our touch sensations within meditation, often we also notice the experience of healing and we don't have to try to fight to push sound away. 
The experience of ear waves hitting the eardrum is just the way that our bodies and minds communicate sound to us. 
And so that's happening in the present moment. 
And so sometimes the attention or the awareness may be kind of just resting with the breathing. 
And then another sound, a sound arises and the attention is with the sound. 
That's okay. 
Okay. 
There's not much sound we can be with the body. 
Curious about how the body lets us know it's here. 
Okay. 
And then every now and then there might be some sound, a distant sound, or sounds inside your body, the sound of my voice. 
Sometimes sounds seem to rumble along in the background. 
And sometimes they come in and out more quickly or they rise, intensify a little bit and recede. 
Notice the ear doing what it's designed to do in the present moment. 
You're welcome to pick an experience like the breath to kind of give preference to, but you don't need to hold tightly to it and try to exclude other experience. 
So maybe you're giving a little preference to the breath and then a sound comes up. 
That's what's arising. 
That's what the attention is curious about in that moment. 
So no need to try to stay with the breath and not hear the sound. 
The sound is being heard automatically. 
So this process of staying connected with your body in the present moment really supports a kind of settling of the mind. 
Sometimes we can notice a kind of a little bit of a feeling of settling or calming that might come. 
Sometimes, maybe not. 
But if that's the case, we can see that it's a little bit of a feeling of settling or calming that might come. 
Sometimes, maybe not. 
But if that's there, that's okay to kind of allow and let in. 
There's any pleasantness with being with the breath or ease. 
Know that too. 
That's also part of how our system communicates with us. 
With us. 
And the habit of the mind is to think. 
We will get lost in thought at some point in the meditation if we haven't already. 
And yet there is a return of mindfulness or remembering at some point, oh, here I am in the hall attempting to be present, hearing, sensing. 
In that moment when mindfulness returns, and it's a great moment. 
We don't have to beat ourselves up about it. 
It happens for everybody. 
That moment is actually a great moment to begin to learn about how the mind gets caught, what it gets stuck to. 
And so in the moment when you notice or you remember, rather than yanking yourself back to the breath or something you were paying attention to before, see if there can be a curiosity of, well, what's here now? What is the mind waking up with? Often there's some kind of a thought. 
And this waking up with the thought may begin to help us see that it's possible to be aware with thought. 
And so if thought is present in the moment that you remember, a couple of things to play with. 
First, maybe just a simple recognition of the kind of thinking that's been happening. 
Planning, remembering, daydreaming, fantasizing. 
Or maybe just acknowledging thinking. 
Let yourself recognize that the mind has become aware of thinking. 
And then another thing that's useful in that moment is to be curious about how is that thinking or has that thinking affected you? Thoughts are quite powerful. 
Have the power to construct new experience and emotions and feelings. 
And so in that moment when you return, if thinking has been happening, a little bit of curiosity, how is that thinking affected the body and mind? Is there a little more tension in the body? Is there an emotion that's here now that wasn't before? Let yourself take that in because if you kind of jump over it, that whatever it is that has been touched into while the mind was wandering can kind of come in from underneath and yank you back out. 
Notice it, oh, there's an emotion, there's some frustration that came in. 
Then there's much more possibility of staying. 
Oh, this is the experience of frustration. 
How does that get communicated through the body? It's a system, let me know frustration is happening. 
Sometimes after the mind has been wandering off in thought or drifting off, the experience when we remember the effect that seems to be happening is that there is more calm, more ease. 
So it's not always the case that the mind wandering creates something challenging. 
It actually sometimes we can wake up into ease, more relaxation. 
And if that's there, let yourself connect to that. 
How does ease get communicated to the system? And having taken in whatever is there after a wandering, you're welcome to, it's useful to not rush back to the breath or the body. 
But also you don't have to hold on to whatever has arisen. 
Take note of it, take note of the effect. 
And maybe the mind can then reconnect with the body and the breathing. 
The experience of hearing just this moment. 
Thank you.
