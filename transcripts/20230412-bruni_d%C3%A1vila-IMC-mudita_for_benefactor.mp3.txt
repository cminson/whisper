Okay.
Yes, so today we're going to continue with the practice of Mudita.
Mudita, sympathetic joy, vicarious joy, and
one way of also thinking or relating to Mudita,
of course, is through meta,
through loving-kindness, because when meta meets
encounters, the joy, the happiness,
the good fortune of others and of ourselves,
it gets transformed into sympathetic joy.
And I like to use this word, transform.
Someone yesterday said that as her pet,
her doggy was moving the tail, there was something shifting,
shifting into being happy, having some joy.
This is how it works.
It may not be meta in the moment. It's amazing.
It purifies, it purifies this mind, it transforms this mind.
We can be in a, uh-uh, okay mood, and then here it comes,
especially pets, you know.
Some of them receive us, you know, like we're the best,
best thing in the world.
So, yes, so if sometimes bringing Mudita,
bringing joy to our mind hearts is like a little,
well, I don't know, we can start with meta.
We can then move into, into Mudita.
And so today we are going to practice with a benefactor.
And it's interesting, these practice with a benefactor,
because sometimes when we bring someone that have been there
for us, it's even, it's another, another category for me,
it's another category of a friend, and it has other,
other ways in which I relate to this person.
A person that really have brought a benefit to my life,
could be a teacher, could be a parent, could be,
could be a friend, that is a, a, a benefactor for us.
And the thing with practicing Wishing Mudita to a benefactor
is that sometimes there may be these thoughts,
or this view, or this opinion, well, really, do,
do we practice, do we, for a benefactor, they, they,
they got it.
You know, they, because it's almost like,
sometimes we're looking at them like a little bit,
I don't know, higher, like, do they really,
I don't know that, you know, it's like, it's like,
well, no, I'm happy for their happiness.
And, and I mean, isn't, but it's not like,
this full Mudita is like, well, yeah, that's great.
And they, they, yeah, they, they have,
maybe I wish Mudita to someone else.
Or they may be other, other reflections of,
yes, of course, I want to wish Mudita to,
to my benefactors, I want them like,
but want to rejoice, to be delighted in their happiness.
Or there may be other thoughts of,
well, I will, I, you know, sometimes there may be a lacking
because we are being benefited, but in some ways the,
the point I want to make is like,
these mutuality, you know,
sometimes may be present, may not.
So I encourage you to see how it is for you.
And let's see what is there is anything else
that I want to say more about the,
this delight, this rejoicing for the continued,
the continued happiness, the continued success
at many different levels, you know.
And so we will start to like,
we have started previously with establishing mindfulness
and checking in with ourselves.
And, and I want to say, you know,
I've been talking also about bringing some,
what I call preliminaries is not,
is not like it's part of the traditional classical practice
of, you know, going to these preliminaries practices
that I, that I have mentioned.
So I wanted to make it that clear.
It's just that it has been beneficial for me.
And, and you can or not do them.
And those are, you know, it's like,
once you're present here and seeing what,
what, what you're grateful for in your life,
anything, you know, gratitude for this day.
It could be very simple, you know,
brief appreciating that you're here,
breathing here, being together, practicing,
or appreciating for appreciating
that we have a practice or, you know,
being in sangha, appreciating yourself or your intention,
you know, bringing up,
being conscious of the goodness within you
in one way or another.
And so we'll start the same way.
And, and then you can choose in your own practice
if you want to do that or, you know,
and after that you can go directly to Mudita.
So, um,
so establishing mindfulness
so that we are present moment to moment here.
Establishing the mindfulness of yes, I'm here,
or being aware of your surroundings here,
looking around.
If you have any other traditions,
you know, bringing whatever you want to bring from them.
And with that, really settling in in this body,
receiving the posture that the body wants to take in,
in stillness, sitting, standing, lying down,
or a movement walking or doing any other kind of movement.
Aware of how are you right now?
Receiving any physical sensations,
just the intimacy of you here inhabiting this body.
Aware of the coolness or the warmth in your hands,
the softness of the in-breath or the out-breath,
the warmth of the out-breath,
the coolness of the in-breath.
And so, shaking in,
feet touching the ground,
body resting on the chair or whatever is lying down.
Alert.
And so, appreciating,
bringing something that you can appreciate of your day today
could be just this moment of being here,
the sincerity and dedication of your practice.
The good fortune of being able to connect here,
and being all here together, no matter where you are,
being able to be in community here.
Appreciating all of us, appreciating community Sangha.
Maybe expressing some gratitude or receiving the gratitude
from all of us to you, dear friend.
Thank you, thank you for being here.
It's so great to practice together.
And bringing some gratitude for whatever you want to express.
Simple, simple phrase and a very important phrase in our lives.
Thank you, most gratitude.
And having a felt sense of how it is for you.
What does this gratitude or appreciation feels like in this body?
The felt experience.
Spaciousness or lightness.
Or some different physical sensations fluctuating.
Being embodied, embodied gratitude, embodied appreciation.
And so with this and whatever is here in a respectful way,
bringing to mind a benefactor, the image of a benefactor.
And really see if you can see in your mind clearly a sense of this being,
the image of this being clearly, maybe even with a smile.
A benefactor looking at you saying hi.
As you breathe in, as you breathe out.
Having a felt sense of how it is that this body, mind, heart relates to this being.
And maybe remembering any good fortune, anything that has happened to this being
that may be of cause of great joy, of delight.
Or if not, just to see how what arises in you when you feel sense the presence of this being with a smile.
Maybe now we can offer some phrases, I can offer some phrases to you and you can craft your own too.
But we can simply, simply say may your happiness, may your joy and good fortune continues.
I am happy for you.
May you appreciate your joy.
May you be delighted and may it continues for a very long time.
May your good fortune continues.
Your prosperity.
I am delighted, I am delighted for you.
I am delighted for your happiness.
Your good fortune.
And so continue, continue repeating these phrases.
Or any phrase that you want to bring to this dear benefactor.
Take some time and see how it is that it fills within you as you wish more detail to this being.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Dedicating yourself fully.
So almost like these phrases are anchors or a home base in your heart for offering them to this benefactor.
Thank you.
Having a clear sense of this being.
And sometimes the mind can be distracted, it's okay, not a problem.
You can come back to the phrases.
Developing continuity of practice.
If a contraction happens in the body and may be a little difficult to wish,
in detail you can step back and then gently and with care.
Become aware of how it is for you right now.
Connect with your mindfulness practice first and
when you're ready you can come back to Mudita or you can even find an easy person, a friend,
if it is better for you in this moment, nothing to be forced.
May your continued happiness keep going.
For a very long time may it never abandon you.
May you see it, may you recognize this joy and good fortune.
I'm delighted, delighted for you.
There may be also maybe strong emotions arising, it's okay.
Giving respect and space, I see you, it's okay.
Oh, this is here, it's part of the practice.
And so you can achieve to yourself and even using compassion or any of the practices that we did before starting Mudita, whatever supports you, but being with it,
name it, honor in it.
Yes, you can be here, whatever strong emotion arises.
Meeting it wisely, having a felt sense of it.
And stepping back if it is too much, seeing it from the distance or
shifting to another place in the body in which it feels a little bit more neutral or
jealous being here, keeping it simple.
I rejoice in your happiness.
Now in a sense of how does it feel in the body?
Spaciousness, lightness, warmth in the chest.
In the face maybe smiling, spaciousness in the mind some is, or maybe not, it's okay.
And so offering Mudita phrases, maybe one more time to close
the practice with these benefactor and letting the image fade away.
Gently and kindly checking in with yourself, how are you right now?
What is obvious, what are you noticing in this body, in this dear mind, heart?
What are you receiving?
Receiving in this field of being here, present, collectively, individually.
And so from here, maybe just connecting with any moment of good fortune
that you have had today or in the past days, something that brings you joy,
that you clearly remember the image or the moment.
Just even having a moment of joy, drinking tea or seeing a good friend
or just seeing a sunny day.
Whatever it is for you.
Offering Mudita now to yourself and having a clear sense of you.
A clear sense of you experiencing this good fortune.
It could be even the image of you being here.
Good fortune of being able to connect to community and practice.
And so offering phrases, phrases to yourself.
I am delighted, yes, yes, may this happiness continues in my life.
May it be so.
Just this moment, keeping it very simple.
May my good fortune however is manifested.
May it continues in any areas of this life.
Having a sense of joy for yourself.
Clear sense, felt experience, right here, right now.
With what is here, nothing more, nothing less, keeping it very simple.
And so again, not to force Mudita.
But let it come, let it be in a way that is not forced.
And if not possible at this time, maybe Mudita.
Coming back to the mindfulness practice that supports you.
Or any other Brahma Vihara that may support you.
Or just keeping it.
I'm just grateful, just grateful for this moment.
I'm happy for this, I'm delighted in this.
And so with that, we kindly and gently shift the attention
to become aware, more aware of all of us here,
of our presence in this collective, in this community, in this Sangha.
And so wishing Mudita to all of us here.
I'm delighted by your good fortune, whatever it is, however it is for you, may it continues.
May it be so.
I'm so happy for us.
Here, collective Mudita.
As you breathe in and as you breathe out.
And so now, to end this Mudita.
Mudita practice.
Connecting, reconnecting, continue connecting with the body right here.
See how it feels for you, what is sensed right now.
Feeling the nourishment of breathing in and breathing out the rhythm.
The rhythm of the breath rocking, rocking you.
And so I'm gonna ring the bell.
And receiving the sound of the bell, no need to move quickly.
Just receiving, receiving the rising and passing of the beginning, the middle and the end.
The bell.
The bell.
The bell.
The bell.
Thank you, thank you everyone.
So taking a moment just to look around, reconnecting, becoming more aware of your surroundings.
Move if you need to move.
So this is also what Mudita does.
You know, I find that when I practice Mudita, there's a sense also that is, I don't know, generated, a care.
There's like a more, more of a sense, a fuller sense of self-care that starts happening.
So we'll come back, we'll go into breakout groups and then when we come back we can share
how it was for you and how the practice is for you.
And so for the benefit of all, it will be supportive if you're not going to participate.
If you can log off and come back like in eight minutes, then we can continue.
And so we can continue sharing in community.
So let me see here.
So welcome back.
And maybe we can share out of the generosity for the community as we're all human beings.
And we may share some experiences or in different moments in our lives.
It will be of great benefit to share.
So Ali, how was it? Tell us.
Oh, sorry. Thank you for the meditation, lovely meditation.
And then in our group, we're talking about the bell.
I hadn't noticed, but you have really a nice sounding bell.
And then it goes out in the vibrations and I was like, the gentleman was describing it.
Then I just got the feeling of like, you know, how the concentric circles, you know,
the sound kind of like goes out and then all of us here, then it just goes out.
And that's how we are all connected.
You know, when we say all beings, I mean, I go from the center of me, I, Ali,
to more concentric, bigger, bigger, bigger circles to include everyone.
May everyone be happy and all that.
But it was a great metaphor that came to my mind as he was sharing about the sound that you were built,
that you have.
And he was just making it. It was wonderful. That's, that's all that just came to me.
I don't know. It's a very good one. I thought I'd share it for whatever it's worth.
It's great. Thank you. Thank you.
Because, you know, in that same way, it could be a reference point for us to see in that,
in the same way that, you know, there's this sudden, the scene of, you know,
this interconnection and the, the concentric circles.
In that way, we can also radiate, which is another way.
Actually is, is, is in the, in the early, early teachings, you know,
this is how the Brahma Viharas were transmitted, like practice, like, you know, radiating.
So, you know, from ourselves into all directions, abundant,
abundant.
Oh, how is the chanting? Abundant, abundant. Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.
Invincible, without hostility and without ill will.
Thank you, Ali.
No, thank you.
Anyone else? How was for you? What, what, what did you learn or what your takeaway from today's practice with benefactors and sharing in community?
I'm curious, actually. I'm curious between, for some of you that were here yesterday,
and we started with an easy person. Today is a benefactor.
There's an intention in this question as tomorrow we're going to move into another category and the day after we're going to move into another category.
Did you notice anything, you know, how was for you today and remembering yesterday?
How was that? Did it make a difference? It was the same for these categories? Padma, yes.
It's more of a question.
Okay.
Does the benefactor needs to be a life person?
You know, no, it does not. It does not have to be a life person.
It is usually what happens is that it's, you will hear in many of the teachings that we start practicing with a person that is alive because of the feelings of grief.
It may overwhelm us. Now, I gave an example last week as I was talking about dad's passing and I was practicing Mudita with all of you.
It did not overwhelm me. It uplifted me.
But, you know, it's kind of a tricky. We need to have, you know, being very aware of the practice and see if it is beneficial to practice with someone that has passed away.
That, you know, it will not be overwhelming because then the practice changes into other may change into other practices.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
And if by any chance, you know, sometimes we say, well, let me try it.
And here we are.
We hit the wall. It's okay.
Come back and say thank you.
And then be aware. Come back to the mindfulness practice. Here it is. Oh, this is grief.
Yes. This is the heart. This is the love. Yes.
Okay. And who else I can, I can wish Mudita now that that will be that that will bring a sense of, you know, really this Mudita and uplifting that happens.
And it will be okay. That's how we learn and practice.
Anyone else?
I do feel the difference and I mark you on my calendar for the rest of the week. I see you're here for me.
It does help with the building of it and it changes and it adds. It's kind of like the bell.
You ring it three times.
And so it makes it maybe it's an illusion, but it feels like I can go a little bit deeper each time into the practice.
That's what I get. It feels like I hold it more in my heart.
Great. Great.
Yes, we start building, you know, something builds up, you know, there's also a the reference of, you know, of self starts dissolving a little bit.
And we really can, you know, we show this Brahma Viharas to to everyone without exception.
And many other things can happen.
So, dear friends, it's time to stop. It's almost six, I mean, seven o'clock here in Redwood City, California. Thank you. Thank you again for your practice.
It makes me very happy, really, that you're here and supports my practice and just happy for you.
Your sincerity and dedication. So, may the benefits of your practice touch everyone that you come in contact with everyone and may they benefit without exception.
May all beings be free, may all beings be happy, may all beings no peace, may all beings no peace.
And so now we can, the bellies, all of us, saying hasta la vista. See you later.
Hasta la vista.
Good night. Take good care.
Thank you, Brittany. Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.
Thank you, Brittany.
Awesome.
Thanks to everyone.
Bye-bye.
Bye, everyone.
Bye.
