 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So invitation is to find the posture that's a nice balance of relaxation and alertness. And it can be helpful to kind of, um, or into this in the Zen tradition, sway back and forth a little bit if you're sitting, and find a balance left and right and front and back over your sit bones, your hip points. Just sensing into that. Kind of like you're a pendulum until you come to stillness, balance. And softening the eyes, closing them if that feels natural. Noticing. Whatever's in the space around you. Sounds, including the sound of my voice. Perhaps the subtle changes of light and texture on the inside of your eyelids. Any sense of smell or taste lingering from wanting tea or coffee? Noticing too. But the heart and mind are noticing. Noticing awareness itself. The knowing. That's helpful. Taking a couple of deliberate breaths. Perhaps longer, slower. But really noticing breathing in when breathing in. The out breath when breathing out. Awareness of all of the sensations and textures. Receptively aware. Allowing to a sense of whatever mood is in the heart and mind at the moment. No right or wrong, just notice. Notice what's there. Allowing. Resting. Resting. Receiving. Removing. with thoughts, emotions, arives, acknowledging them as thoughts, emotions and arising in mind, the heart and noticing the awareness that receives them. Noticing too. But it can be helpful to refresh the awareness. It can be a simple question or even a question mark. What's this moment like? Perhaps hearing is most predominant. Perhaps sensing the aliveness of this body, this breath. Or perhaps noticing mental, emotional activity. Allowing, resting, receiving. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body. Perhaps knowing the aliveness of this body.

So before I start the Dharma talk, I just want to invite you to kind of stay in your meditative space and whether someone's on phone, video on, video off. Take a moment to wish them well. Offer a little bit of kindness, goodness to your Sangha mates here in the Zoom room. And there's your offering, metta, good wishes for their practice, for their lives, for their health. Knowing that you're receiving those wishes, that goodness from them. Thank you. Thank you.
