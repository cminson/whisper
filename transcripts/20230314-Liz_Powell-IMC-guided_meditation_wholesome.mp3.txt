 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning. Welcome, everyone. I'm having a breath from running up the stairs, but I'm very happy to see you all. And we'll do, as we usually do, we'll start with a lightly guided meditation with about 10 minutes of guided and the rest in silence. And then I'll offer some reflections, and we'll have plenty of time for questions and discussion after that. So, with that, finding a comfortable meditation posture arriving in your body, a heart mind, receiving whatever is present, whatever is most obvious right now, allowing what's most obvious to be known, have space, time to be known. And recognizing what's here. As it arises, remains present, or whatever length of time, as it passes, or Bringing any ease, softening, or relaxing. Or relaxation that's available. And receiving with kindness any areas of body, heart, or mind that cannot be relaxed or softened right now. Accepting them just as they are. Perhaps noticing if a state of mind that's present is wholesome or unwholesome. No problem with either one, just being aware. Allowing curiosity if it wants to bubble up. If you're aware of unwholesome, allowing that and noticing how it is as you're aware of it. Sometimes with awareness, the unwholesome may fall away. Or it other times it hangs around wanting us to see something else about it. Allowing curiosity. Receiving in this moment what's prominent. If it feels wholesome, allowing yourself to enjoy that. Know that feeling. Unwholesome, wholesome, neither unknown. Allowing it all. Recognizing that just being aware of it is in itself wholesome. Allowing it all. Allowing it all. Feeling that. The cycle of being aware of whatever is most obvious is wholesome in itself. That is received in awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
