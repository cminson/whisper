 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, welcome folks. Yeah, welcome to you all. So we'll sit, yeah. Yeah, and it occurred to me just to say, in case it's not already clear, that some level, the way I approach these morning sessions is that I've already received some instruction on how to meditate. There's something you can do that you're familiar with in one way or another. And these are explorations of technique. And so, yeah, take whatever value there is in them and add that into what you already know and do. So let's find our posture and see what's greeting us today. Okay. It's both so familiar and so fresh. It's kind of dense web of associations of the stillness and the silence, as if it cues our body and then it kind of awakens the muscle memory of steadiness and silence and release. But it's also so fresh. Who knows what this moment will feel like where the body and mind is today, where the next insight lurks, latent. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. No matter what phenomena the moment brings, there's some Dharma posture, some gesture of awareness, gesture of the heart that serves our long-term welfare and happiness. No matter what's arising, there is goodness that can be cultivated. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We're still often looking for signs of our progress. We're so often looking for signs of our progress, signs we're doing it right, signs the Dharma is quote working. And so we look for concentration, we look for insight, we look for tranquility. But the mechanisms of healing and awakening are not usually evident to us. And so sometimes it's okay to stop looking for signs. And we're on the right track to stop orienting towards some trajectory we imagine is the right one. And we just settle back into a certain kind of faith and awareness, trust that the Dharma is working its way through us. And then our job description as a practitioner becomes a lot simpler. Thank you. Have a great day. See you next time. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you so there's relief in learning that we don't have to engineer the moment that the seeds of awakening are already here you you you you you you you you you you you you you we listen very carefully or the the thread of wisdom compassion you tune to that especially can and then rest you You You
