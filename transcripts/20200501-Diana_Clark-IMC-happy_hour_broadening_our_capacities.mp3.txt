The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, so I just wanted to say a few words and something that you already know
that loving-kindness practice or maybe I should say in general Brahma Vihara
practice, I tend to focus on the loving-kindness but you know all of them
sympathetic joy, compassion, equanimity, they help elicit these positive feelings,
you know warm-hearted feelings, warm-hearted emotions or experiences
and both towards others and towards ourselves and Barbara Fredricks and she's
this kind of a pioneering researcher on this whole idea of positive emotions
or positive feelings and the role that they play in our lives and what we can do
to help support them and elicit them and she's done a lot of research on this
and she has this theory that I like that maybe I'd like to share here just in a
really broad brush. She has this idea that positive experiences, positive emotions
help us to broaden and build. So maybe I'll unpack that a little bit.
This to broaden our attention, that is that often when we're having negative
experiences, we're even having physical pain or emotional pain, I think this
won't be news to any of you, when we're in difficulties our attention just
collapses down and around and that's all we can think about and all we can
notice in some ways, which is that really predominates our experience.
So in contrast is when we're having positive emotions or positive experiences
it can help kind of broaden our perspective so that we're not collapsing
on what's difficult and then this broadening our perspectives of course
as consequences. But so not only does it and I'll unpack that in a little bit
but this idea of broadening our awareness, broadening our attention also goes
with broadening our experiences. That is that we can, if we're able to
experience the positive emotion of joy, for example, Barbara Fredrickson points
to that that helps creates the conditions for there to be an urge to play.
That is to kind of like be creative and maybe push the limits or to behave
in new ways or different ways or fun ways that are get out of our usual roles
or try something new or something like that. So this positive feeling of joy
helps create the conditions in which there's this maybe an urge to play.
And then this positive emotion of interest, of being curious, of being engaged
in with our experience creates the urge to explore.
That is to go on adventures, take in new information, take in new experiences
and that way to expand our world. So having just this curiosity like what's
really going on helps to create the conditions in which we are more likely
to have new experiences or new understandings or new information.
And then she continues that the broadening of, I'm sorry, the experiencing
of contentment creates the urge for us to like savor and to really recognize
the experience that we're having. And then to integrate these into our experiences
and we can integrate them into a view of ourself and integrate them into a view
of the world, but to savor and feel supported.
And from that place we're able to maybe also have new understandings
but maybe to allow things to shift or settle or integrate or metabolize
in some kind of way. So the reason why I've gone through these three about
joy, interest and contentment is because Barbara Fredrickson kind of defines
love as part of this amalgam of joy, interest and contentment,
which can help create the conditions for play to explore and to savor.
And I really like this idea. Loving kindness isn't exactly the same as love.
Of course, I guess it depends on how we define love and how we define loving kindness.
But maybe if we think of loving kindness as a positive emotion and this warm heartedness,
it helps us know we can have this experience of wanting to have this urge to play
or just in fact doing play in all kinds of different ways, whether that's being creative
and doodling or dancing or writing poetry, singing and some kind of ways
in making music and interest, being engaged with what we're doing
and noticing that lessening the dampening of any sense of discontent
or any sense of things aren't quite right.
And then of course, the reason why we are interested in love is not only because
it makes us feel better, which has its own value and has its own worth
and is a worthwhile thing to do, but also it helps us to build our resources.
I've been talking about sometimes like how it increases our capacity.
Another way to say that is that it builds our resources.
It kind of helps us to find maybe new and creative ways to be in the world
or to interact with others, with our partners, with people that we find difficult
or find challenging in any way.
Maybe it helps us broaden our experience or ways that we can think about
some of our social bonds, our relationships with coworkers, with our families.
And this is especially important during this COVID-19 era
in which we are sheltering in place at home and don't have our usual resources available to us.
We're not able to go meet our friends for lunch or coworkers for lunch.
We're not able to, you know, just have those little breaks that we have
around the water cooler at work or to meet with the grandkids.
For me, I regularly like to visit my mother and to make sure that, you know,
she's okay and of course, you know, I love her and I want to spend time with her.
But instead, we're finding like novel ways of meeting.
So loving kindness as a positive emotion helps increase,
helps us build new experiences and new understandings
and helps us with those new understandings and new experiences can increase our capacity.
And we could all use the most increased capacity that is available for us,
that is possible for us while we're navigating this time.
Tomorrow, I'm just thinking about broadening our capacities and our social bonds.
We're trying something kind of funny tomorrow.
Well, we'll see how it works with some of my friends.
So we're going to have an express Zoom spa.
That is, we're going to show up on Zoom with some of my friends.
We're going to say hello.
And then we have to go put like funny things on her face.
Things that are moisturizer or whatever it might be, you know,
this put stuff on our face that's supposed to make our face look good.
And then come back on Zoom looking silly with all this stuff on
and just as a way to laugh and be together and do something different with Zoom
than all the work that sometimes we might be doing on Zoom.
And one of my friends, she has a lot of work on Zoom and it's very taxing for her.
So I thought this might be a funny thing for us to do together.
So I just offer that as I wouldn't have thought of doing anything like this before.
But you know, happy hour is a way in which you might support us to think of some warm hearted things
that we can do with others, some warm hearted things we can do for ourselves during this time.
So with that as an introduction, to begin our meditation practice,
we can take an upright posture or whatever uprightness however that gets expressed for you.
Uprightness more is to express our intention to be here, our intention to meditate.
So that might include lying down.
It might include sitting with a lot of cushions in a show or whatever feels comfortable and has some alertness to it.
And let's just begin by checking in with the body.
Maybe noticing what's obvious about what's happening in the body.
If there's some tension.
See what's obvious is the pressure of the chair or the cushion against your body.
Maybe it's the feeling of tightness and shoulders at the back.
We're just noticing without a feeling that it has to be different.
As best we can, can we bring some warm heartedness to whatever tension we might be finding.
Maybe bringing some relaxation to the face.
Some relaxation to the belly.
Making it a project just is more about allowing and attention than any real doing.
Then we can rest our awareness on the sensations of breathing.
Just noticing what it feels like from the inside to have in breaths and out breaths.
You might feel it in the abdomen, in the chest.
Maybe with the air going in and out of the nose.
We're just hanging out noticing the sensations of breathing.
Something in particular needs to be happening.
What does it feel like to collect the different fragments of the mind
to rest them on the sensations of breathing?
So this practice of mindfulness and the sensations of breathing can always be an alternative
but it feels like loving kindness isn't the right practice for you right now.
Then to begin loving kindness practice, bring to mind a lovable being, someone for whom it's easy to feel warm hearted, warmth, care, goodwill, friendliness, love.
Bring this person or being to mind, whether it's kittens, puppies, babies, somebody you know, somebody you don't know.
Bring them to mind and then to support our intention of cultivating loving kindness, say these phrases while keeping the lovable being in mind.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
You may check in with the body and see if there is any sense of warmth or spaciousness, softness, well-being.
And if so, can allow that experience those sensations to support you, can savor them, allow them to nourish you and nurture you, even if they're just a small part of your experience.
You might want to see if they want to get bigger, just in a gentle, organic, easy fashion.
Allow the any sense of warmth or well-being to get as big as they would like.
And if it happens that you're not feeling any feelings of well-being or warmth, can you be okay with that?
Can you make space for that?
And maybe refreshing the image of the lovable being.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
And then we can expand our loving kindness, building on what we've developed and cultivated here for a lovable being, to include ourselves.
So in the same way, bring either a felt sense of yourself or an image of yourself, either as you are now or perhaps a younger version.
I won't just modify the phrases.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
Of course, you're welcome to modify the phrases. Maybe there are other words that resonate with you.
Maybe a different language.
Maybe the language of your heart.
Maybe the language of your heart.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
But if it feels like the right thing for you to do now, we can expand even greater to include neutral persons.
People that we don't know. We don't like them. We don't dislike them. We don't really have an opinion about them.
It might be a neighbor that you sometimes see walking the dog. It might be somebody on this Zoom call that you haven't seen before.
It might be the postal carrier.
We can bring this person to mind. And can we extend to them having kindness also, warm heartedness?
Even though we don't know them. Even though we don't have a relationship with them.
So again, bringing this person to mind. May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May we live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be happy.
May you live with ease.
And then to end this meditation, feel the pressure of the chair or the cushion against your body.
Feel your feet on the ground. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes.
So this idea of that all positive emotions, including loving kindness, can help build our capacity to be with difficulties and build our capacity to be creative.
And have maybe a sense of exploration or play and exploration and play as well as love, of course, can really support our life and help us to support others.
Because really, I believe all of us want the world to be a better place. Want there to be health and happiness and safety and ease for others as well as for ourselves.
And part of the way that we can do that is to bring new ideas, bring new energy, bring new capacities to our experiences so that we can share them with others or including the experiences of our relationships or experiences of whatever difficulties we might be having.
So I'd like to encourage you to maybe talk with others and explore this idea of positive emotions, including loving kindness.
I also want to say here maybe that just because we're doing loving kindness meditation doesn't mean at that moment that we're experiencing loving kindness and warmth and ooey gooey.
We're creating the conditions in which that might arise, but it doesn't have to arise in order for this practice to be effective.
It's more that we're setting the intention again and again and again each time we bring the mind back from wandering.
And it's that intention setting that really has the power and can make the difference. It makes it easier and more likely that loving kindness will arise.
So even if you didn't actually experience some more murdered feelings, having done this practice makes it more likely that you will have those more murdered feelings.
So I'd like to encourage you to talk about this or explore this or have a conversation about this in which there might be more an opportunity to either talk about this idea of broad and build that having these positive experiences helps increase our capacity.
Or you can maybe just describe what your experience was with that meditation or loving kindness in general.
Okay, so in a moment here I'll open these up.
You'll have, let's see here.
I'll probably make this like 14 minutes or maybe now 13 minutes.
And then you'll be in groups of four.
So have fun and I'll see you in a few minutes.
