The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Each time we meditate, each time we practice mindfulness,
we were opening to a greater being.
I think we all know, especially if you've read something on Buddhism,
the term dukkha, which is generally translated as suffering.
But there's two, there's a du and ka.
And the ka means consciousness.
And the du means constricted, contracted.
And then there's another term that you may know, sukkha.
It's the same ka, consciousness.
But the su means expanded or opening, opening consciousness.
And then the same way, the dukkha is usually translated as suffering.
The sukkha is usually translated as pleasant experience.
So this way, in sitting, we were inviting a deliberateness, a steadiness.
We were inviting an acceptance.
We were inviting sukkha.
We were inviting dukkha to suffer.
And we do it in the context of subjective experience.
Each moment that arises for us is an extraordinary product of the complexity of being.
There's all sorts of influences and habit energies that bring forth moment.
There's so many ways to dissect it, neurologically, psychologically, semantically.
And in the throes of all of that, we're taking it personally.
Whether it's inwardly arisen or it's the product of external influences.
What someone said to us, what someone did.
It can be meted with this essence of mindfulness, which is inviting expansion, which is inviting acceptance, which is inviting liberation.
And then we carry the glimpses, the tastes of that liberation, of percussion, and into our life.
So maybe today you can think about that process, especially as you're in the midst of your activities, your interactions.
Sometimes it's very helpful to ask ourselves, okay, how is that being held in the body?
Is my shoulders tightening?
Is my chest constricting?
Is my mind constricting and becoming agitated?
And there's a way in which the emotionality of it all can be like an energy.
We open to emotion, we open to an intriguing way in which our body and consciousness respond to the significance of psychological being in that moment.
In the midst of that emotion, in the midst of that activity, can there be a kind of stability that arises from acceptance?
And acceptance is the blend of the wisdom and compassion.
So be it, this is what it is.
And we take it personally.
And there's, can that evoke a tenderness?
Because often in taking it personally, we're imbuing it with something of our own anxieties and desires and struggles.
It's not like we will duke for ourselves.
It arises out of our being as we're attempting to live, as we're attempting to make our life flourish.
It's evoking, you know.
It's asking for compassion.
It's asking for a deep appreciation of the human condition around and everyone else's.
Can we bring that opening to later being to our day?
Can you hold it on a feeling level? Can you hold it on a physical, somatic level?
Can you hold it as an attitude?
Like when someone says something aggressively or disturbing for you, can you remind yourself with the kind of compassionate patience?
Oh, they're going through something. So be it.
So thank you.
Please enjoy your day and hopefully find the moments of Sukha. Thank you.
