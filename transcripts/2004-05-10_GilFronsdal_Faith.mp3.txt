 One of the very important supports and expressions and fruits of Buddhist practice is expressed in a Pali word, sadha, in Sanskrit, the chraddha, I think it's pronounced that way. And it's usually translated into English as faith. And when it's translated as faith, there is at least a good percentage of the audience in the West who are troubled by the word and would rather not use it and would rather not see faith as a part of their Buddhist practice. It's when they kind of got away from a faith-based spirituality or religion in coming to Buddhist practice, which is much more practical, pragmatic, down to earth, kind of your immediate experience, how it is for you finding your own way. And faith sometimes has a kind of, people who have that kind of reaction are often associating faith with, I think, with certain kind of faith-based kind of religions where there's a creed or belief system that you're supposed to have faith in, which is equated to believing in. You're supposed to believe in completely. And so something external from you, belief system, a creed. Many people, I'm in trouble, troubled by creeds and beliefs. And what basis do you believe certain things which are passed down through Scripture and not verifiable in your direct experience, perhaps? And so to translate it as faith causes some difficulties for people. What I'd like to suggest this evening is that this very important word, sada, might be best translated into English by three English words. And depending on the context, different words work better. And the three words are faith and then trust and confidence. And to get a sense of how this sada or this faith plays out in practice in our lives, it's important to recognize that it's understood to be a capacity that we have. It's a subjective capacity. So the Buddhists tend to focus a little more on the subjective side of what we do call faith, rather than the objective side, in the sense that it's a faculty, it's a potential. And as a faculty that we carry with us in our psyche, it's a faculty that can be developed and strengthened, just like you would strengthen a muscle, just like you could strengthen your faculty, your capacity, your poor concentration. You can develop your capacity, your faculty for faith. And as a faculty, it's something which is understood to be very supportive of spiritual practice. It's very supportive of mindfulness practice or of meditation practice. And without some sada, without some faith or trust or confidence, it's very hard to really engage wholeheartedly and fully in a regular spiritual practice on an ongoing basis. And I suspect there's a fair number of people here in this room who practice meditation or would like to practice meditation and find it hard to do it every day for many reasons. And there's many reasons why it's hard in our daily life. But one of the elements that's supportive of doing it on a regular basis to have that sense of dedication and inspiration to do it is this element of sada, of faith or confidence or trust. And the stronger that capacity is developed in us, the more inspired, the easier it is than to follow through on whatever we're trying to do. As a capacity, as a faculty that we have, this faith is often associated with the emotional aspect of our being. It's an emotional expression of quality. And so it's best expressed in the English expression to put your heart into something or to be wholehearted in what you're doing. You don't want to just kind of do your practice halfheartedly. You want to do it wholeheartedly. And when you do it wholeheartedly, it's more than just kind of you do it vigorously. You put yourself into it a little bit more emotionally or kind of fully or with some kind of devotion perhaps or something to do it all, to put your heart into what you're doing. And you see it, I certainly see it at times when my faith is strong and there's a kind of uplifting feeling that comes with faith. Both kind of, all kinds of faith even, the kind of unhealthy kinds perhaps. But it kind of uplifts us, uplifts the heart, uplifts us. We feel more void or inspired or happy. Happiness can come with faith. And I've been around teachers, I've read certain teachings. I've been around practice centers where I've encountered the kind of the palpable sense of someone's practice or the sense of a practice place when people are sitting on retreat or some very, some teachings which have been gone right to the heart for me. And I've been filled with inspiration or faith by this encounter. One teeny story that I remember just sitting here is once hearing a Dharma talk and I was so moved by a Dharma talk, it was in the evening, I went right down to the meditation hall. Everybody else went to bed because it was late and I went and stayed up late sitting because the talk was so inspiring for me. So this kind of need to be inspired is often a very helpful part of a spiritual life. The important thing though is that the inspiration be well-based, that you're inspired by something that's worthy to be inspired by or inspired in such a way that it serves you in your practice rather than distracts you. Sometimes faith can be a distraction if it gets too energetic or too gushy or too blind in various ways. One of the associations in Buddhism with this idea of faith or sada is that it's a tranquil. It's a tranquil faith. So it's feeling a tranquility as part of it. So you wouldn't have the fervor of a true believer if you have Buddhist faith. You'd be tranquil about it. You'd leave your neighbors alone. So it's a faculty we have. It's something it kind of associates, for some of us at least, with kind of the more the emotional side of life rather than intellectual side. So we get moves, our hearts moves us. And at times when we're discouraged in practice, sometimes inspiration is very important, arousing our faith. In almost all Buddhist traditions that I know, in their classic way that they're done, faith practices are integral to the practices people do. So you'd go to a Theravadan temple in Thailand or Thai temple here in this country. You'd go to Zen monastery or just very many places and people would bow to the Buddha. And many Westerners don't like to bow. So I can in Zen monastery at the beginning of certain services you bow three times to the Buddha. Americans didn't like doing that. So the Zukirashi had them to bow nine times. And I thought it was just part of the ancient tradition you bow nine times at the Zen center. And then after being a few years, I thought, no, no, it's in Japan to do it three times. There's bowing, there's chanting. There is making offerings. There is listening to Dharma talks, which was meant to be kind of inspiring, also as part of that devotional side for some people, some settings. And sometimes the chanting can be quite extensive. And if you understand what you're chanting, if it's done in English or you understand the Pali, it's often, for some people, very uplifting the very words you're chanting, because they're often chanting the teachings of the Buddha, or you're chanting the description of what the Buddha is like or what the Dharma is like or what the Sangha is like. And for people who are really kind of focused on Buddhist teachings or Buddhist kind of understanding of what it's all about, that Buddhist description is very uplifting and inspiring. And you might do that every day. You do a retreat, for example, and part of that retreat would be the chanting and the bowing. And that would be strengthening your faith and your involvement. There are some people for whom the primary thing that needs to be developed at a phase of their personal growth and spiritual tradition is the element of faith. And sometimes a teacher who recognizes that will encourage them to do practices or do things that inspire faith. And sometimes the teacher recognizes they don't have to do anything in particular, but they just have to hang around. And so like in Thailand, you'll see people hang around the monastery and they're not taught to meditate right away. They might hang out for many years. And they work in the kitchen, they work around the health here and there. They're kind of doing something based on their faith, letting their faith grow and grow and grow until at some point their faith is strong enough that it makes sense to them for them to do a meditation practice and then they get a different instruction. It's a little bit strange idea perhaps for us in the West. We don't have that, that kind of idea so strongly in our kind of Western Bipassana tradition. But I'm just kind of laying out the background of how the tradition looks at the issue of faith to give you a sense of how important it's seen. And that again, it's a faculty that can be developed and cultivated. So I've talked a little bit about faith, using the word faith in a positive way, as kind of uplift of the heart, as inspiration, that fuels our practices and encourages to go along. Without some of that, I think it would be impossible to practice. At least I would feel that for myself, it would have been impossible for me to practice as much as I did, unless I had faith and inspiration in what I was doing from my teachers and fellow practitioners and the teachings and different things. One of the things that gave me faith and inspiration was when I started getting a sense of what was possible. And having a sense of possibility can arouse great faith, great inspiration. Oh yeah, this can be done. The Buddha once said, if this can't be done, I wouldn't be teaching you. I teach you because it can't be done. So people are inspired in different ways than different goals. But even the goal of learning to be completely present without any goal, that possibility, that goal, can arouse a lot of inspiration from people. It's possible to do that. I don't have to be trapped by my mind, which is always rushing around forward and backwards into the past and the future. I can discover what it's like to rest in the present moment and not need to go anywhere at all, just to be here, content and at peace. So a sense of possibility can arouse faith in people. Part of the difficulty with faith can be that when people have faith in something outside of themselves, even the idea of faith in a possibility can be a sense a little bit outside of oneself, like into the future. It can be a little bit risky to have that because there's expectation and disappointment that's possible then. But to have some faith in something outside of ourselves, to trust something outside of ourselves, rather than to trust something deep inside. So I'd like to distinguish between two kinds of trust, or two kinds of faith, switching out to the word use and word more, trust. And that is trust which is more relational, perhaps, or external, or externalized, where we trust something outside of ourselves, versus trust which is internal or innate, or something that is not found by searching outside of ourselves. And I think all of us have trust in things outside of ourselves. Human society can't function without a very high level of trust in people around us who do things. We trust that the driver is going to stop for the red light. We trust that, you know, all kinds of things. We trust, you know, we sign up for a class at a local junior college, and we trust that the college has chosen good teachers. We trust that it's worthwhile to take this class. The trust might be provisional, but, you know, we might be ready to kind of doubt it or question it. But we come, you know, with some kind of trust that this is worthwhile to do, and what we're going to do. But some of the trust we find that's kind of provisional or relational in society is something that we learn in relationship, and it's developed in relationship. So, for example, trusting a friend. You might meet someone, and you don't know how trustable that person is at first. You trust them maybe a little bit like a decent person initially. But because you get to know them for a while, you know, the degree to which you're trustable, how much you can trust them, what you can say to them and know that they're not going to tell other people, for example, or whatever. And after a while, you get a sense of where you can trust this person. Maybe trust can grow and grow and grow, and it's something that's learned through experience. Or you go to a mechanic, your car is in trouble. And then the question, can you trust this mechanic? You don't know anything about cars, so it's kind of like Greek to you. So, you know, it's kind of like you feel a little bit tentative about what this person says when he comes with a thousand dollar bill, or a thousand dollar estimate. Can you trust this person? And then not only the price, but also will the person do a good job. And then it turns out that the person did a great job, and it turned out actually was very cheap for what he had to do. And you learn, oh, I can trust this person, it's great. And so you learn in the relationship that trust is possible, is built. And so it's kind of verified trust that way. Some people, however, will trust things external to themselves, which are not reliable, or they put too much trust in it. And putting all their eggs in one basket. They trust, you know. And so many of us will have that kind of thing. So, for example, some people trust money. And some people are quite neurotic around money, wanting it and feeling they don't have enough. And it can be a real difficulty for some people. And so, for example, I'm a person today who talked about tremendous anxiety that this person has around money, money issues, even though the person is, you know, seemingly relatively well off. But people have tremendous trust that money will kind of make us safe, will offer us security, offer us happiness or something. And some people go on the money route. That's where they put their trust for their happiness, is in the money, just to get enough money. Other people put trust in relationship. If I can just get the right partner, then everything will work out. And they really trust. That's where they put their trust in relationship. That's where it's going to, my happiness, my security, well-being is going to be. Other public people might be in status, or it might be in a belief system, or in a political view, or something. There's something external they put their trust in. There's a story that I'm fond of telling, because in America we say, in God we trust on our money. When I went to Burma, when I was there overnight, the government cancelled the value of almost every paper currency that it had issued. And that was kind of unbelievable to me. I mean, money, you can rely on money. I mean, it's like, money is money, right? Some people rely on their telephones. They trust them. They trust them. It's not connection. People trust a connection. They must be connected all the time. And so, I assume growing up, money is money. You know what it is. It's absolute. There's a little bit of inflation and change a little over time. But you know, you have money. It's like, that's more reliable than the weather, for sure. And then to wake up one morning and find out that your currency had absolutely no value. It was less valuable than toilet paper, because it was kind of, you know, the texture wasn't right. You know, that was a big surprise to me. So many people will find that they put trust in certain things, and then find that that trust was maybe, didn't really live up to what they were expecting it would do for them. Perhaps they got fulfilled. Maybe they ended up making a lot of money, and they thought out the money didn't make them happy. Or they ended up having a wonderful relationship. But somehow, it was a wonderful relationship, but you know, it's not making them as happy as they thought there was going to be. I mean, the problems are still there. They're still a bit anxious and worrying about things. You know, it's still... And I did this wonderful panel some years ago, panel discussion with inter-Buddhist panel. And there's supposed to be Tibetan tradition, the Vipassana tradition, and the Theravān tradition, and the Zen tradition represented. And there's supposed to be one representative from, who was a Western teacher, and one representative who was an Asian teacher who had come from Asia. And there were these two representatives of Tibetan Buddhism. And there was the Western woman who was a Tibetan teacher, a lovely woman. Many of you might even know her, Lama Khaldun, Carolyn Khaldun. But she came dressed in a Tibetan kind of monastic kind of robe, and with beads, and she talked about how wonderful the ancient tradition was. And then this other, I forget his name, another wonderful Tibetan teacher from Tibet came, and he wore a business suit. And in the middle of Lama Khaldun's beautiful guided meditation, visualizing Tara, his cell phone rang. Meeting of the East and the West. So, sorry, so a trust. So what do we put our trust in? And some people will have things they trust, and they even accomplish or fulfill that, what they're hoping, and they find out what they were trusting didn't really cut the mustard, really didn't do it for them in the way they were hoping it would do it. And sometimes it happens in a kind of nice way. We just, we realize something wonderful and realize it doesn't really make us happy as we hoped. And sometimes we realize what we put our trust in was unwarranted, and we put trust in, and our trust was betrayed. And there was a whole time in the 1980s where a lot of Buddhist practitioners felt betrayed by their teachers. They put a lot of trust in their teachers, and sometimes they put kind of unreasonable trust in their teachers. They kind of trusted the teachers kind of like they would be like a paternal figure, great authority figure who they relied on for everything. And then the teachers betrayed them in some way by their scandals. So there's this external kind of trust or relational trust that builds over time that society has built on that's very important. And then there's a different kind of trust, I'd like to suggest. And I don't quite know the word for it, but it could be maybe called innate trust or trust in just being. Some sense of a core sense of well-being or peace or perfection or completeness in our deep in our hearts, deep in our psyche. Some trust in our innate goodness, our innate perfection, our innate beauty, our innate preciousness, our innate radiance. There's been some other kind of ways it's described. So we're not looking for something external to us, we realize that something is right here. And rather than looking externally for something that's going to fulfill us, we find that fulfillment inside in something that's here. And some people, if you have a sense of that, even an intuitive sense that's there, life becomes a very different game. Because you have this place of being, of resting then. You have this place kind of a ballast for your life that can make the difficulty, the ups and downs of life a lot easier. But if you don't have this ballast, if you don't have this core of you that feels complete and feels good and well, then a person is much more likely to look externally for something to fulfill them, to fill them up, to make them complete. Part of the function of Buddhist practice, hopefully, is to begin by paying attention, by settling down, getting concentrated, is to begin getting a sense of some deep place inside of us that can be a refuge, a place of safety, a place of beauty, a place of feeling complete and feeling at peace, where nothing else needs to happen in order to make us feel complete. So there's no in-orderness anymore. I need X, Y, and Z in order to feel good. X, Y, and Z doesn't have to happen. The US dollar, the greenback, can be cancelled tonight, and it might be unfortunate and causing difficulties, but that doesn't seem to ruffle your basic sense of peace inside, your connection to that kind of sense of trust, deep trust, treating yourself, trust in internal trust. There's a number of things we can trust in Buddhist practice. One is ourselves, our innate goodness. Another thing that Buddhists learn to trust is the goodness of their intentions. Buddhism puts a lot of emphasis on that we should pay attention to our intentions, what motivates us, the different acts, like when we're going to say something, why are you going to say that? Is that to have a cutting remark or to do one upmanship, or is that to be kind or caring for someone? What's the impulse that drives what you say and what you act on and even what you think, the intention we call it? And in Buddhism you're encouraged to look at the quality of that intention and see is that intention skillful or unskillful? Is it helpful or unhelpful? Is it good or not good? Is it kind or is it malicious? What is the quality of that intention? And if you pay attention to it, then the opportunity arises that you could only act or try to only act on those intentions which are in short hand good, which are skillful, which are helpful. If you begin to act on intentions which are good, then that gives a person, can give a person a lot of confidence in themselves, in their capacity to live in a good way, but also the kind of confidence that comes when you know that you're blameless. You go into a situation and you track your intentions and you say, oh, my intentions were good. I might have made a mistake. I might have done a faux pas or done something and someone might have gotten hurt because of it. But there's a kind of confidence or trust in ourselves that comes. We know, oh, even though I regret what happened, I know in my heart that my intentions were good. The expression the Buddha used for this gives you the ability to go into any assembly without any shame. You know, we're standing upright. So there's a kind of trust in ourselves when we learn to work with our intentions and learn to kind of know how to respond to them in ways that are healthy and good. Another kind of trust in ourselves as possible is our trust in the practice we're doing. And in particular, I find the trust in mindfulness to be very important for me. One of the really wonderful things that I've kind of received from my years of practice is a very, very deep trust in mindfulness practice itself. I like the word trust or faith because it doesn't give me unequivocal proof that in every situation I'm going to find myself in that mindfulness is going to be useful, the right thing. I mean, how could I have that kind of proof that all the possible situations in the future, that mindfulness is going to be the key? But I had this deep faith that that's the case, or trust that's the case based on many years' experience in many situations, difficult situations, wonderful situations, seeing the power over and over again of what it's like simply to be present, to be honestly present right now to what's going on. And to see that presence, relaxed presence, being here for this situation right now and really showing up, not being distracted or rushing off and just being here, opens up possibilities that would not be possible if I wasn't present, if I wasn't mindful. It's kind of like mindfulness or presence kind of makes room or opens doors through which new things can walk through or new things can occur. If we're writing our experience with a type, for example, if someone's talking to you and you have something very important to say and you interrupt them, that's very nice. Especially if he has something important to say. But by interrupting the person, you might have interrupted a whole range of other possible outcomes. So for example, if you hadn't interrupted the person and said what you felt was so important, but just listened to the person and offered listening and presence, the person maybe perhaps feels listened to in a deep way and then is willing to kind of relax and share in a deeper place. And it's amazing what comes out of the person, with their wisdom or their sharing or the depth of their feeling. And you're really glad you didn't say anything because you got all this, they presented themselves in a much deeper way because they felt they could trust you because you were such a good listener perhaps. Or perhaps because you don't rush into the conversation but you pause before you speak. And so you offer presence instead of your opinion. And in that pause, you have a chance to digest what they say a little bit more and to reflect on the thing and to let something percolate and something a whole new thing comes out of your mouth. Or perhaps they have a chance to do that and then they have a chance to come up with something new. What I'm pointing to is, what I'm trying to point to is that presence, calm, space allows for new possibilities to happen. They're not possible if you ride our experience really tight and close. One of the things that happens when we're mindful instead of reactive is that the ways in which we're wound up, tight, has a better chance to begin to unwind and relax. And as we unwind, that also opens up new possibilities. Mindfulness has a way of just staying mindful rather than reactive, just staying, staying, being honest with what's happening now and now and now. My experience over and over again is that something unknown is more likely to happen. If you're open to possibilities, then you know, I have a door that's open open to what's happened, you're also going to be open to something unknown, unknowable. And you can't be in control anymore. And some people, that's why they don't like to be present so much because presence requires some willingness to be in the edge of some unknown possibility that will arise in that mindfulness. But I've seen over and over again situations that seemed where I had no clue how to deal with or what to do. But my commitment was to stay there in the situation, stay in the difficulty and keep being mindful. And then miraculously, somehow, I don't know, we find our way. The situation finds itself, finds its way. And something happens there. And what was primarily what I attributed to is what allowed that finding our way was just staying in there and being present, being present, being present. Sometimes in great, people are in great, you know, all kinds of great, very difficult situations. I find it so useful. So it gives me a lot of faith in the practice itself or confidence. So the other word that I like for the word sadha is confidence. So there's faith, there's trust, there's confidence. And confidence is very important because without confidence, we might not have the inner strength to want to pursue what we have to do or take the next step that needs to be taken. And confidence, one of the key confidences that I imagine is confidence in ourselves. To have confidence that we can do it, that we can walk the path, that we can engage in this practice, that we can be present, that we can develop our compassion, whatever the practice is you're wanting to do. To have confidence, yes, I can do this. And confidence, yes, I can do this, can vary. It can be a wide range of how confident we can be. And confidence can grow and develop over time or it can be squashed. You can get discouraged and feel lack of confidence. You know, a little bit of discouragement happens and you don't feel so confident anymore. You go to the next situation and you're not so confident with yourself and you feel kind of wobbly. But confidence is something that can be developed partly by acting, partly by not by kind of building self-esteem in the abstract, but by actually engaging in the world and learning from our mistakes and learning from our successes and learning what we can do and can't do and developing confidence in our ability to actually do. So my opinion, my feeling is that good confidence comes from actually acting in the world. People who lack a lot of confidence, I often recommend they develop their confidence in small pieces, small steps. Do some really small things that you can feel, oh, I did that, I can do that. And then take it one step further and do something a little bit more. I can do that. I can go shopping, I can go buy my groceries and feel confident, oh, I can do that, I can do that. And then take it a little bit further and a little bit further. I can do meditation practice, maybe do the practice in short chunks rather than saying, I'm going to sit every day for the next year. That might be too much, but you might say, I'm going to sit every day for the next three days. And then the three days you've done it, wow, I can do it. And then you feel some confidence in yourself. But if you say, I'm going to sit every day for a year and you sit only three days, that's discouraging. So set your sights low at first, just to match who you are. So you can slowly build your confidence. So it's kind of realistic confidence. So I can do that, I can do that. And it builds on itself. If you leap too far forward, it doesn't work. My son, my six-year-old son is really into baseball now. And I play, we play a lot of catch. And back and forth. And so about four months ago is when he started. And now he got a glove and a ball and I throw. And four months ago he was, what to say, he couldn't throw very well, he couldn't catch very well. He had a lot of enthusiasm. And I had to be very careful just to throw to him so that he would keep his joy and his appreciation of it. I would just try to throw just the right speed and just the right land, the right, basically, you know, he had to hold his glove like this and I'd try really hard to land in the glove. And he loved it. And then at some point I wanted to try to teach him that you also need to learn how to catch the ball by having a whole new glove upright like this. Not always down like this. So I tried to hold his hand up like this, I showed him, and he was, you know, got really upset. And, you know, I can't do that, it's impossible, I don't want to do it, I can't do it. It's easy, I'll have to do it like this. And once you do it like this, and I'll get really close enough, throw the ball, really close, step further further away, and he didn't want to hear of it. It was really hard for him. So I had to back off, you know, this way that parents can be kind of ahead of the curve, head of the development of the kid, right? And so, but now, you know, after four months of doing this kind of almost every day, now he's getting it, he's on his own. He somehow just seems like he's grown naturally, you know, just, you don't have to teach the kids these certain things, they just kind of, just happens developmentally when they're ready. So one of the things that, in terms of confidence, it's very important to have some deep respect, appreciation for how things are developed, how things evolve developmentally, not to be ahead of ourselves, and think, oh, I'm supposed to be, you know, some like, like some monk who's been meditating for 30 years in a cave, when I sit down. That's not realistic. But to do it in your own, it's your own step. My son practiced every day, almost, so he knew about the regularity. And then in the regularity, his own developmental kind of growth happened organically. If you do meditation practice every day, then, and do it diligently and carefully and with some faith, then your own developmental process will unfold in its own way, in its own right way. And there shouldn't, there should be no one out there kind of pushing your head further than you are. And you shouldn't be holding yourself back by your own lack of confidence. But to have confidence in the practice, and to have confidence in the practice evolves in its own pace, in its own way, each person in a different way. But to have some experience of how it works for you and how it evolves can give you a lot of confidence, both in yourself, but also in the practice. So one of the things I've learned, for example, around practices, like when I go on retreats, is when I first went on retreat, I thought, you know, it was all up to me and I'd make this terrible effort, you know, really try hard. And after a while I realized that what was really needed on retreat is just calm, steady effort of showing up and being mindful. Just calm, instead of being mindful, being mindful, being mindful. And in its own developmental time, the practice matures and deepens. And it doesn't make any sense for me to be riding the practice, judging it and evaluating it. You know, it's like a farmer who goes out and pulls, you know, he's planting corn and so she goes out and looks at her, corn seedling is coming out of the ground and pulls them out of the ground. How's it growing? And, you know, often we do that in our practice, you know, you sit down to meditate, we follow three breaths and, you know, how well am I concentrated? But it kind of takes, you know, its own time and you have to kind of respect that, to have some confidence in the time that it takes and the way that it evolves, I think is very helpful in support for the practice. And it's said in the tradition, it's helpful to have confidence in your teachers or your fellow practitioners or people who are a little bit further along on the path than you are. Sometimes it can be a little bit discouraging or to practice. Sometimes we face great difficulties in practice. And then to know some people who've gone through it or know that phase of practice and you have confidence in them, oh yeah, they know and they've been through it. Then it's more easy for us to go through it because of our confidence in them. So I believe that mature spiritual practice has faith as one of its foundations. And some of you might prefer the word trust and some of you might prefer the word confidence and I'm happy with any choice of vocabulary around this that you like. But this quality is very important. Without it, I don't think that spiritual life can mature very well. And faith is something that we can develop. So you might look at your faith. Look at what you have faith in or what you have trust and confidence in. Look at the degree of it. How strong is it? Is it really strong or is it weak? Is it kind of like a little bit? You know, you have some, enough to get you going. But actually, you think the practice is really great, those teachers are really great, thank you. And you think that, but you know, and so you're going to do it for sure, but you wonder whether you can really, you have it what it takes, you know, you doubt yourself. It's so deflating, like having doubt in yourself is like practicing with wind drag. It's not very good. So look at your faith. Spend some time reflecting on it and thinking about what you have faith in, what you have trust in. Is what you have trust in reliable? And what is really, and talk to friends about this question. What do your friends think is really reliable thing to trust? What's the most trustful thing that you can have in your life? And see what they say is an answer and explore it with friends and offer your ideas to your friends and see what they say. Explore that. And then think about, you know, reflect on how strong your faith is. And if it's strong, or if it's weak, are there healthy ways of strengthening it and developing it? So the last thing I want to say, as a little bit of a challenge for you around this issue of faith, that one of the things that can give the most reliable faith or confidence or trust in Buddhist practice, if you really understand this well, understand how it applies to your life, can give you a kind of adamantine faith, very deep, unshakable faith. If you understand this one thing really well. And that is if you really understand well the Four Noble Truths. Some of you don't know what it is. But for those of you who know, the Four Noble Truth is not kind of just simple Buddhism. It's the core of it. If you understand that one thing, that will probably give you more confidence in faith than anything else. Don't have faith in the Four Noble Truths. Understand it. How it works. How it's applied. So, how's that for a fire and brimstone sermon? Yes, Mark? I agree with everything you said. And I've had a very powerful experience earlier in my life that gave me faith to develop my practice and I very much appreciate everything. I guess the thing that comes up around faith, I mean, is the nature, like I can think of in my field, the biological principles that all these teachers passed down over the years that were wrong. It caused people a lot of suffering. Yes. Because they were applying these principles and these rules to bring it up, to not be so. Right. We can look at what's happening in the Middle East, where people have a strong belief that they can have 72 burdens and they follow themselves up. The difference in faith. We have such a strong tribal-like biological make-up to be tribal and to collectively hold for these that distinguish us and create anti-sepration. So, I guess the other edge of this is that discernment of having faith in it and I'm not sure what it is that distinguishes it from some sort of way of applying methodology to testing. So, verified faith. It's very important what you're pointing to. And I talked about faith being a faculty capacity we have. It belongs to a list called the Five Faculties, the Five Capacities that can be developed. And in the tradition that talks about this, it makes it very clear that faith needs to be balanced with wisdom or discernment. And the image is that faith is like a blind giant and wisdom is like a lame person who can't walk, who has very clear sight. And so what has to happen is that the giant has to carry the seeing person on top of the shoulders and together they can find their way. And so without some really good discernment, faith can be very dangerous. I heard this definition of faith once, that faith is not sitting on a chair that isn't there. Faith is not sitting on a chair that's not there. Which is kind of what you're talking about really. Yeah. So hopefully, faith is a dangerous animal, but it's also very important. Don't hold back from it because it's dangerous, but do it wisely and carefully. And also I was trying to point away from that kind of dangerous kind of faith in talking about the importance of finding the faith inside of yourself, that trust inside of yourself. So I hope this has been helpful and maybe we can spend a few weeks talking about those other four faculties of the five. It might be interesting to go through them and talk about them and how they work together. So many thanks. Thank you.
