Good morning. Good morning everyone. So this morning will be a little bit more
talking than we'll have at, probably we'll have at this time, but just provide a
little bit of foundation for our loving-kindness practice. But maybe before
I jump into that, just a warm-hearted wish today is St. Meta Day, so wishing all
of you, happy Meta Day, and not only all of you, but you know ourselves too.
So Meta, to distinguish it from just maybe this usual word of love that we use
so often has two qualities that distinguish it from love, and one is
boundlessness, this sense of knowing no boundaries, just being infinite. And if
we're honest, we'll say that well actually our care, our love is usually bounded to
our loved ones, or for ourselves. Or not, maybe not even including ourselves, and
we'll talk about that a little bit as this retreat unfolds, but it's very
human that there are some boundaries for our well-wishing, our warm-heartedness. So
loving-kindness, Meta has this quality of this immeasurability, infinite, and it
certainly is a lofty ideal. It is possible, but Meta practice is going in
that direction, towards me like expanding out, out towards that infinity. So
towards less boundedness, so that's one quality that Meta has that will be
cultivating. And the second is this idea of
unconditionality. Also, if we're honest with ourselves, that we'll notice that
very often there are some conditions. I'll love you if you change a little bit, or
I'll love myself if I change a little bit, or I can't quite love you the way you
are, or something like this. So Meta is also moving towards this
quality of unconditionality. Boundlessness, unconditionality. So we're moving in
that direction, and we move in that direction by cultivating this boundlessness
and condition, unconditionality, and we'll be unfolding techniques, instructions
that are intended to help cultivate this. Actually, I find it really empowering
and beautiful that these can be cultivated. We don't have to wait for just
the perfect conditions. We don't have to wait for until we are a certain way, until
other people are a certain way. But what the Buddha is pointing to, and these
Buddhist teachings are pointing to, is that we can cultivate and develop this so
it's available to us now. We don't have to wait. And not only that, but this
activity of cultivating, until we have completely unconditional and boundless
loving-kindness, and we're still of this human tendency to have some
conditions or boundaries on our loving-kindness, our well-wishing, our
love. But the activity of cultivating is nourishing for us. It supports us. It
somehow like feeds our inner life in a way that can be transformative. Just
imagine, what would it be like to be in the world when you feel that you're
completely nourished in some kind of way? Of course with food too, we want to be
nourished, but just to feel filled up inside, like there isn't a sense of
lack. So this activity of cultivating helps us to feel more settled, more
harmonized, more happy. And from this place of happiness, maybe that's not
the best word, this sense of contentment, this sense of being filled up, of
having enough, transforms the way that we see the world, transforms the way we
act in the world. If we feel like we have enough, then we don't have to get it
from elsewhere. And then we can allow others to be how they are, and we can
allow things to unfold in a particular way, which allows the goodness to shine
through, allows things to unfold in a way that is supportive and honoring others,
honoring ourselves, respecting others, respecting ourselves. And then our lives
unfold in a beautiful way.
So we're doing loving kindness practice, met the practice to extend the
range of our care, extend the range of our well-wishing, extend the range of our
warm-heartedness. And one of the ways that we do this is we start with a narrow
place where it's easy, where it's uncomplicated. And we stay there, really
familiarizing ourselves with it, filling ourselves up with it, nourishing
ourselves with it as best we can, as best we can. And then we move out from
there, and then we move out from there, and move out from there. And every time
that we expand this range, Nikki and I will be giving instructions on a
particular schedule or, you know, just for teaching purposes, for pedagogical
purposes, it may not match. In fact, it's likely it won't match
exactly what's perfect for you. So to honor and respect what's happening for
you, let the same time acknowledge that, you know, the instructions come at a
particular time. It may not be that 8.45 a.m. in the morning, this one's perfect
time for you that day to hear new instructions. So to have some flexibility,
some malleability, and recognition that all of us will be going at our own pace.
So today, we'll start with the classically is called the benefactor. We've
kind of expanded that to mean that easy being or the lovable being. So this idea
of benefactor is some not, you know, maybe it's not so common in our English
vocabulary, but it's someone for whom you feel a great amount of gratitude. And
you have an uncomplicated relationship with maybe a heroic figure in your life.
Very simple relationship with and you just have this care and love. Often, this
is somebody who really supported us when we were young. Not always, but it's the
easiest person to send well wishing to. It's not so uncommon for somebody to say,
well, I'm actually sure if I had somebody like that in my life. No problem. We're
going to start where it's easy. That's the guiding factor here, uncomplicated,
simple and easy. Maybe it's a pet. Maybe it's even imaginary kittens, puppies,
babies. Sometimes I start there, honestly, with I just feel like, okay, doing
that time, but I'm feeling a little bit dry or something. I don't, I just have
this thing for kittens. So I bring to mind. So just starting with you. Sometimes
I do. And sometimes there is an individual where it just feels really easy. So it
doesn't have to be the same person every time you're working with the easy
being, but the guiding principle here is simple and uncomplicated. And if it
feels like it's too complicated, then choose another being, but not to jump
around all the time also, right? That's, we want to be able to settle in, but allow
yourself to be maybe playful, lighthearted, maybe a little bit
experimental, again, without just jumping all around trying to find the perfect
sense, perfect being. One way to think about it is it says if we were going to
build like a campfire, a cozy campfire, and when we're first getting the fire
going, we don't bring in a big wet log and plump it down in the middle. Instead, we
start with kindling. So that's one way to think about this. And there are a whole
number of ways in which we can cultivate love and kindness. There's a whole range
and they all have these beautiful qualities to them. But Nikki and I, on
this retreat, will be emphasizing three particular aspects, kind of the use of
the phrases, visualization, and a sense of the body. And for all of us, there'll be
maybe one or two of those three that we feel have easier access, is more
supportive, perfectly fine. You don't have to have all three of these aspects all of
the time. And then I'll, and then as the days go, we'll be refining and
expanding these instructions. But right now, I'm just giving some of the basics
to help us get going. And I'll start with saying a few things about the phrases. So
we're offering phrases that embody this directionality, this intention, this
feeling of friendliness, well-wishing, warm-heartedness, metta. And there are
many possibilities for these phrases. We'll be using specific ones. You don't
have to use these specific ones if they don't resonate with you. But this is
about listening into and tuning into or having sensitivity with these phrases
and experiencing the body and see how they resonate or feel. So what we'll be
using is, may you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy, and may you
live with ease. Again, if it doesn't feel meaningful or connected or it's
instead of even triggering, then you can modify them. But maybe here's some
guidelines. Keep the phrases general so that 20 years from now, this phrase will
still make sense. And don't, like, unintentionally embed some, like, some
amount of fixing, like, may you get a job? I guess that has this kind of
implicit something has to get fixed or may your hair grow back or something
like that, right? It's more just very general ideas. And with a sense of
spaciousness, with some lightness, gentle, patient, not demanding or insisting.
And here's the last thing I'll say before we'll actually do some meditation. And
that is, have you noticed all emotions, all experiences are impermanent? Of course
they are. Of course they are. It's impossible for you to be feeling loving
kindness all the time, all during this retreat, all during the meditation period
maybe. So we don't have to get hung up. We don't have to say, oh, this isn't
working. I don't feel anything. We're just creating the conditions. And we
don't know which it might arise. We're just planting the seeds, which it might
arise, might arise during that meditation period, and might arise later. It might
arise one week from today, one month from today, one year from today. But don't
be mistaken. We are planting seeds with this practice. And even if we don't
immediately see the sprouts, it's enormously supportive and helpful. And
just the activity of cultivating is enormously supportive. And when it is
there, when we do feel this warmheartedness to open to it, allow
ourselves to experience it. Okay, so with that as an introduction, we'll do
another guided meditation now. So finding your way into a cluster of ease. I'm
bringing a little blanket around me just to, I don't know, I like kind of the
sense of coziness. So there's no reason to sit with that pain or if it's
avoidable. So allowing yourself to use cushions, blankets, shawls. We'll talk
about alternative postures a little bit later this morning. But right now,
taking a posture that's comfortable for you. And establishing a sense of the
body. Like to sit and know you're sitting sensitive to the whole body.
Inhabiting the body with awareness.
Keeping the awareness, the attention light will have been sensitive. Just to
see the bodily experience right now.
And when the mind wanders, we just very simply, gently with kindness, bring it
back to the experience of having a body at this moment.
At this moment, there's nowhere else to be. Nothing else to do. We're just here,
present for our experience, our bodily experience.
If we notice areas of tightness or tension, is there a way that bringing some
awareness to those areas allows them to soften, allows them to release some of
their tightness. Maybe with the exhale.
If the tension or some discomfort is persistent, is there a way in which we
can gaze upon it kindly, with some warmth and care.
Being sensitive to the whole body.
And maybe having the center of the awareness be in the center of the heart in
the middle of the chest, the heart center.
and then when you feel ready, bringing to mind the lovable being and
effect or easy being, staying sensitive to the field of the body, but pulling
into the heart and mind, the image, or the sense of the lovable being.
Perhaps remembering their goodness or kindness.
And begin offering them warmth, kindness, care, and we can use these phrases as a
support for that. May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Practicing in such a way that it encourages a harmonizing, a collecting
of this whole being behind the well-wishing, with a sense of lightness, a sense of openness, a sense of ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.

So this idea of being sensitive to the body, visualizing the lovable being in a way that doesn't feel like you have to strain.
It doesn't feel like you have to work.
For some people, it's the easiest.
For some, not so much.
Just however you are is perfectly fine.
I don't feel like you have to get high definition digital, you know, quality in your visualization, but.
And for today, we're going to work with the lovable being.
And we're just going to hang out there.
We're not in a hurry. We don't have to get anywhere else.
We're just going to do this practice today.
And saying the phrases.
And every relaxed, easy way.
There's a German teacher that she was talking about.
She was talking about mental practice.
She used this expression, explore and enjoy.
So this idea that we're going for ease and some harmonizing with this well being.
But also recognize that we're not just chasing our preferences also.
We're not just doing whatever.
It's not today isn't all about bubble baths and things like this.
But it's, you know, staying with our practice and seeing what resonates how it feels.
And maybe tweaking the phrases if that feels like the right thing to do.
It can be helpful. And I always start this way with really getting grounded in the body first.
And there will be times in which it feels a little bit dry or maybe I shouldn't say there will be, there might be.
And we just keep with it with the rhythm.
Recognizing that we're planting seeds.
It may not all sprout right then.
And then have one announcement.
That is that tonight at some 15 will be a drop in practice discussion group.
Optional if you feel like it to show up and it'll be an opportunity to ask some questions.
And after a day of practice and that you might have some like some questions or some comments you might have.
And then tomorrow we'll start the small group practice discussions in the morning.
But today is a day of practice.
And with that I'll turn it over to Nikki who has some more to say.
Nikki. Thank you Diana.
Thank you and good day to you all.
I was just reflecting today being Saint Meta Day.
It's so auspicious to start a Meta retreat.
And also for us to start with the category of dear being, easy being, someone we care about.
I mean, it's so sweet to start there in the sense of, I wish you well, I care for you.
So I love the juxtaposition.
So I'd like to add a few words about walking meditation and also potentially lying down meditation.
The other postures and standing meditation too.
Many practitioners often think that sitting is where it's at and walking meditation, that's just recess.
That's what I thought when I was a new meditator at the very beginning.
And actually when I really gave my heart to walking meditation and really connected with it,
I fell in love with it. I'm still in love with walking meditation.
I see Diana nodding too, yes, thumbs up, yes.
And my sitting practice really deepened, really deepened when I connected with walking.
And see for yourself actually, see for yourself.
First, you could observe if you don't walk, if you just kind of puddle around your place and then come and sit,
how different the quality of mind would be compared to if you actually do a formal meditation, a formal walking practice and then you come sit.
See how different the quality of your mind is, be a scientist of your own mind.
And the invitation is just to give your heart to walking practice.
In fact, one thing that I've shared with a practitioner is before who didn't connect with walking.
If that is you, self-identified, not connecting with walking practice, you know who you are.
There is this idea of arranged marriages and love marriages in some cultures.
And the research actually suggesting that arranged marriages, one gets to love, one gets to really love and explore and appreciate,
not in every case, but again, research is looking at percentages and generalities.
So what if instead of you falling in love with walking meditation, what if you consider that for this practice period, for this retreat,
you have an arranged marriage with walking practice.
So you're just going to explore this beloved, this amazing walking practice thing that you have the privilege to just, you know,
I've tied the knot for you this morning, yay, the nobcholes of you in walking practice.
And you're going to explore, you're going to explore just all the beauties, all the goodness, all the characteristics of walking meditation you hadn't quite known before.
So you can be playful about it that way.
And I trust that if you do give your heart to it, just like Diana and I have fallen in love with it and many, many other practitioners,
you will to find how powerful it is in your practice.
So in terms of metta and walking, metta and walking practice,
you will do the practice of metta, the phrases, the embodiment, bringing the visualization of your whatever category you're working with.
So for today, as you do walking meditation, and you can do walking meditation in the formal and the informal way.
And let me talk about both slightly.
The formal is when you take it about a 10 steps, 10, 20 paces, be indoors in your living space or outdoors,
and you walk back and forth, just walk back and forth, which is wonderful.
It's lovely.
You can really deepen and connect with it.
There's no distractions.
And whenever you turn around, say, at the end of the 10 steps, you stop and turn around, you reconnect with your intention, and that can be really powerful.
Say, you start practicing, may you be well, may you be happy, walking with your dear being alongside you.
Yeah, you're taking a walk with them.
And then, oh, you get distracted like, oh, yeah, I haven't talked to them for a while.
You get to the end of the 10 steps like, wow, I was gone for the past five steps.
It's okay.
It's time to reconnect with my intention.
Yay, no problem, no judgment.
Turn around, reconnect, and then another 10 steps.
So go back and forth, taking a walk with your dear being.
This is really wonderful to really connect with the practice and for the mind and heart to really settle.
It can also serve as a concentration practice, which we'll say more about later.
Metta also being a Samatha practice.
Also, it is helpful to take care of your bodies and go for an informal walking meditation.
Please do that.
Please, please do that throughout this retreat, especially if you're being metta.
Go for a walk with your imaginary kittens or imaginary dog.
I love Diana's imaginary kittens.
Or your dear being, imaginary dear being, I remember on a retreat.
I was doing a month long dedicated to Brahma Viharas to metta practice and others.
And it was raining outside and I had an umbrella and I was actually doing formal practice at that point.
I was walking back and forth, imagining that I was holding the umbrella for my teacher and benefactor,
Venerable Paak Syeda.
So we were walking together.
I was wishing him well, protecting him from the rain.
It was just so sweet.
Still have the felt sense memory of it.
So see how it works for you to bring your dear being and wish them well,
protect them perhaps from the elements if it's raining or chilly where you are.
And then if you walk outside again, feel free to take a walk,
but keep the phrases, keep the dear being with you.
And also if you are aware, you know, you can have your gaze down,
you could have your gaze up, it's okay, see what is needed.
If your mind is really distracted, you can have your gaze down.
And if there's a sense of stability, stability, then you can actually, your eyes can be open.
If there are passerbys, you can share your meta with a smile.
It's quite lovely to do that actually on a meta retreat.
And then in a couple of minutes remaining, I wanted to also talk about standing practice,
which please feel free when it says sitting, meditation, the sit period.
If you're back, your body needs it, you can also stand and practice in standing position.
The Buddha taught four postures, sitting, standing, walking, and lying down.
And now it's to lying down, which doesn't get much attention.
But on a meta retreat, especially if your body needs care, if your back needs care,
and it's a time when you're not feeling very sleepy, please feel free to explore lying meditation.
In fact, I've had so many body issues that I've done a lot of practice in my life.
My deepest practice I've done lying down and my mind has learned not to fall asleep.
It's actually a very supportive state where the mind body can relax.
But if you realize, wow, hypnagogic state images are coming, kind of getting foggy,
then open your eyes or get up so that more energy comes in.
You have to be more aware, your awareness has to be sharpened.
Some people also like to have their hand, their arm at a 90-degree angle when they're lying down
so that if they get sleepy, it falls on them or just straight up so that it falls down if they get sleepy.
Do that also.
And again, take care, take care.
And taking care again isn't always saying bubble bath all day, but it's take care of wisdom with compassion.
Wisdom with compassion and with awareness, not tuning out, but with awareness.
How can you balance your body, your mind, your heart, your cultivation?
And as today is a day of practice, for the couple of sessions this morning, the practice sessions,
and also this afternoon too, myself and Tanya will offer some very light guidance,
some very light guidance today to offer just a little more support.
Not too much talking so there's plenty of silence, but it's the first day just to kind of bring us back together, bring us back together.
So with that, I wish you a wonderful 45 minutes of walking period.
Yay, go enjoy exploring and see you soon.
Take good care.
