 It's scary. I haven't been here since the opening, and I haven't seen it except with sort of formal occasions. We did New Year's Eve here, too. This is wonderful. It's... Every time I come, it's all gussied up even more, and just the right way. It feels good. It feels very good. I think I must have come to to this same group, or at least this Monday at this Sunday group, about a year ago in Portola Valley. Is that right? You remember. And I remember being so almost dazzled by the springtime, by the new leaves on the trees. There's that misty green as you travel. Everything is brand new all over again. It seems to me one of the stranger aspects of our life, that it keeps not only changing, but starting over again, and again, and again. And springtime is a very vivid expression of that. The human race has taken this springtime and turned it into a number of celebrations, Passover this week, Easter very soon, and Buddha's birthday. In some traditions, Buddha's birthday is celebrated along with his death day and his enlightenment day, all in one package. And that's usually around the 1st of May. But in most Zen traditions, it's celebrated on the 8th of April. So it fits right in. It usually comes just around Easter time. And I'm about to go to New Mexico and sit a week-long retreat in celebration of Buddha's birth. Tanjoe sashin, they call it. The birth time. And then at the end of the sashin, after the week of sitting, we have a sort of small, simple ceremony. People come and fill up the zendo with flowers, and all the neighbor children, all the kids from all around, and their parents are invited to come. And on the altar is set up, surrounded by flowers, a statue of the baby Buddha. Maybe some of you have seen those statues. It isn't exactly a little kid. Sometimes it doesn't certainly newborn. But it's supposed to represent the story of the baby Buddha, who as soon as he came out of his mom, stood up and took seven steps around, and pointed up and pointed down. And that's what you see in those statues, is the baby pointing up and down. And he says, above the heavens, below the heavens, I alone am the world honored one. I always think every little baby says that when she's born. Here I am. And it's true, of course. And all through our life, I think that becomes a kind of puzzle for us, this I alone one. What is this I aloneness of us that gets born into the world? It's very strange. Zen celebrates and practices what's called self-power, as opposed to other power of other kinds of Buddhism. Zen is a kind of a kind of self-power, as opposed to other power of other kinds of Buddhism. It's a very interesting distinction. And in this case, it seems like this Zen story about Buddha being born and saying I alone am the world honored one is characteristic. In Zen, we come to the cushion and we say, to start with, I am sitting. In Pure Land Buddhism, for instance, which is posited as the opposite of Zen, you could say, people are brought to practice by the mercy of Buddha itself. And so one is a very humble kind of practice. And one seems like a kind of arrogant one. Well, here am I sitting. But of course, as we all know, with meditation practice, however we come to sit, we become humbled pretty quick. It's an encounter with all of it, all of it as I am, this one of the world. All the thoughts and all the experiences and the creaky body and every difficulty and every glory as well comes down and sits with us. It's what we are. There's another Buddha's birthday story, though, that appears in Nanamoli's life of Buddha. Nanamoli was a bhikkhu who studied in Sri Lanka for many, many years and did wonderful translations of the early sutras. He tried to find the earliest, earliest, closest to real Buddha stories that he could and strung them all together into a life history. And the only early story he could find about the birth was very different from the Zen story. It said that when the Buddha was born, a tremendous light shone brighter than the sun and the moon. It was so bright and so golden that it shone even into the darkest places that had never seen light before. And there were beings in these places who, because it was dark, didn't know that there were other beings there with them until that light shone. That's a very beautiful way of talking about what Buddha brought to us. It's almost inexpressible. This alone feeling, this sense of being separate that haunts us so often, is shown on by Buddha's teaching, by our meditation practice. When we go outside after a long sip, the world looks brighter, doesn't it? The leaves glitter with silver and the smells and the sounds are so clear and so close. One old teacher said, when we sit, we open ourselves to the whole universe. We're no longer arranging things, adjusting our mind to things. We're simply being open to all of it. So every grass blade has a teaching in it for us when we meet it. This question of meeting is a very basic one. And he's saying we should at least have one real meeting in our life. What does that mean? One real meeting. Face to face and knee to knee and belly to belly, heart to heart, and eye to eye. In a way, I think we practice for that, or that is what practices us. We talk about beginning. Beginning. We talk about new beginnings. Philosophically speaking, we're beginning all the time. It's an illusion that we have a story that's all strung together. In Buddhism, they talk about nen moments. A nen moment is an infinitesimal fraction of a second, you could say. And those moments are happening. So that each moment is slightly different from the moment before and the moment after. It just keeps changing and changing rapidly, so rapidly that for us, clumsy beings, it all just runs together. It runs together and then from that we pull out the parts that we like and we don't like and make a story out of it. I was talking to a friend the other day and she was telling me her story and it was a very powerful and difficult one. When she started, she was so sure of the storyline and she just spread it all out and told the whole thing. Then she thought, oh, but then this thing happened over here. That sort of contradicted the storyline, actually. Then this happened over here and that was quite different from what she had been expressing. We both suddenly realized, oh my gosh, this whole story is so big that we could never even begin to get to the bottom of it. That's amazing, isn't it? It's true about everything that we are and everything that we do. It's bigger than we can conceive of. They say about concentration practice that whatever you attend to, whatever you give your attention to, know that you're leaving out everything else and that everything else is immense. It's very humbling. Yet on the large scale, of course, we can separate things out and distinguish them and try to understand them. We say it's spring, not fall. Here, of course, it's fall in South Africa, not spring. Once you start to extrapolate, it gets bigger and bigger again. It's a way of talking about how provisional and temporary and uncertain, really, our ideas about things are. Our ideas about things often are the ideas of beings in the dark who don't know what else is there. It's why we sit down. Sit down with and in and by and for the light. How we share our practice, how we stand up and go out and meet, can be seen very clearly in Buddha's life. From the time he was a child, there were all kinds of Buddha-child stories, including the one when he realized, way before he actually did it, about sitting. When he sat in his father's garden under a rose apple tree and felt such simple felicity. To be open to everything doesn't mean some special, fabulous experience. It just means being where we are and being present for where we are and who we are. Rumi says somewhere, the mind and the deep self walk and talk together like friends. So in a way, we're beginning every single moment. Often we forget that and get bored with where we are and what we're doing. It's a dreadful human condition, especially in situations where we have so much. All the mindfulness practices are so helpful in this slowing down process so that we can actually be where we are. I just talked to a friend who had learned the red light meditation. She's one of those people who's very antsy and always in a hurry. Someone had suggested to her that when she got to a red light, instead of sitting there wanting to get right through it and being very irritated and upset, to just breathe. She came back to report that she was getting upset when the light turned green now. Such funny things we are. I've been thinking, especially reading these old stories of Buddha and all the different ways of characterizing the teaching of Buddha, how very different our lives are from that. Even in India and Burma, after so many thousands of years, it's very, very different in the way that we live our lives. The amount of speed that we're twirled around in, you could say, the amount of noise I've been looking for a house to buy, and I'm amazed at how many noisy houses there are. I never really thought about it before, but most of us live on the edge of a freeway or on the edge of a very busy road. I live close to El Camino, so I hear all of it all the time. It's a very different kind of experience for us. Although we know about Buddha's life, walking, walking from town to town, everything was about walking in his day. And in most people's day, this new kind of walking that we do is very, very new. I think it takes a lot of study for us to really see how we live, how we're living now, so that the teachings don't become some extra old-fashioned thing that we're sort of sticking on to ourselves or taking on in some ways, but not in other ways. That it must apply, it must apply in the darkest bar on El Camino Real, if it's true here. And where that truth lies, how that truth lives itself in us in our life, is our great study. This Insight Meditation Center itself is part of that great study. And the fact that it began in another tradition is a part of that also. And it has Tibetan prayer flags all over the Insight Meditation Center. It's a very wonderful expression of it. But it expresses even more wherever else we go, behind the wheel of a car or in the kitchen or at the bank. Sometimes they say we should use the great teachers as models for us. We should imitate the life of Jesus or imitate the life of Buddha. But I think they would have said, your life is your practice, your life. What they did was to exemplify their own life fully and completely, to open it up. And that's our charge too. That's our charge as we came out of our mom and pointed to the heaven and pointed to the earth. So maybe that's enough. We can have a discussion if you like. Questions? Could you say something about maintaining mindfulness when we are rushed? It gets harder, doesn't it? But actually there are always red lights to stop at. I mean, we can create for ourselves wherever we happen to be reminders. I know someone who carries a rock in her pocket. It was Josephine Duveneck who always carried a rock in her pocket and every time she reached in it was there. Or you can tell yourself it's time to see the sky. Several friends who use the sky as a mindfulness practice. If you're rushing along, you can always look up. And we often fail to look up. So it's a very beautiful practice to do that. We can choose what will slow us. Even though we're traveling fast, our mind doesn't have to travel so fast. I used to go to various meetings with a friend who, when we were late, and I would be upset about it saying, oh, we're going to be late, she would say, there's nothing you can do, just relax and enjoy the trip. And that I think we can do a lot more. It's the mind that speeded up. It isn't the situation so much. We let the mind get fast in a kind of greedy way, really. Trying to accomplish more than we need to accomplish and get to more places than we need to get to. It gets to be part of this huge surge of greed that we live among. Especially, I think, in large cities like this huge metropolitan area that we're in. A big part of it is getting to know our own mind. And the red light helps, but anything helps that we can stop and be with. I have a friend who's trying to figure out a way to duplicate Thich Nhat Hanh's little bells that are ringing all the time. And finding them in different places, so when the telephone rings, that's a time to stop. When a siren goes, that's a time to stop. And as soon as we stop, we realize how unreal we're being. So it's just like sitting in a way. The mind goes wandering off and sitting, and then, if we remember and come back, then there's no rush at all. There's no hurry. So the point is to simply return. Return to the breath. Return to being. To being here. Does that help? Anything else? Just the struggle that's always there to the political realm, or something doesn't move fast enough by just sitting. So I always struggle with the yes-but, what does one really do? And as you were speaking, I thought of two things. One was clear out to live here when you have no furniture, and one was before I died, I walked to Washington with sheets of paper about what I want done. Or something. But I'm not. Go for it. The older one is, the more that might count. But that is the struggle. Sitting is very helpful, but the direct action... Absolutely. Absolutely. But the curious thing about the way our mind works is that we're very good at overall pictures of things. We get this huge picture of how... And then this huge feeling that we need to do something huge. And the reality is that all we can do is just the thing that we're doing. And it's a tremendous limitation in one way, but it's also a great power in another. Because if we're really able to be where we are and do what we're doing, we're free. Free of the tension of that overall picture, which creates tremendous tension and binds us up with frustration because we can't do it all. But we can do the things that we can do. And if it means something very simple like standing and witness in Palo Alto against the war, or going to Washington and talking to someone, there are many, many one things that we can do. But we can only do one thing at a time. And if we try to conceive too much, we just get frustrated because we're so small and so helpless, really. And although there's... And our tradition is a wonderful tradition of empowering all of us to be able to do whatever we can to change things. We have to also see the other side of it, that events and forces are like a great river. They're the river of the river of our life. And so it works both ways. Oh, please go to Washington now. Well, thank you all very much.
