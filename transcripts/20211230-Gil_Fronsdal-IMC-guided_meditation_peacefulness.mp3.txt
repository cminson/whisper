So good day and hello everyone. And for today's meditation I'd like to offer
something a little bit different. And that is that rather than thinking of
meditation as something we do as a work, think of it more as an undoing. So that
there is a little bit of doing we do of course. But mostly it's avoiding or not
doing so many of things that we normally do that add tension and stress to our
moments of being alive. So in this meditation you might try to assume
a or touch into some modicum of being peaceful or calm. It can just be most
you might be mostly not be that way but maybe somewhere you can touch into a
little bit of being calm in the middle of the storm. And then let everything kind
of settle into that calm or peace. That's the reference point to see how much
you're actually doing. And so for example tension in the body is a doing, is an
activity that we're engaged in and it's tiring to be tense. And as we sit kind of
the modicum of calm or peaceful, let that tension in the body release. Let
yourself settle into that peace a little bit more. Some modicum of calm or peace
can be a shield that protects you a little bit from too easily wondering into
thoughts which are stressful and are a lot of doing. So we're undoing the
engagement in active thinking. Coming back, letting go into this peace, staying
close to that. And when we're focusing on the breathing, it's kind of like we're
aware from that peaceful place, through the peaceful place. We're aware in a
calm way as if breathing is held in a sea of calm. So sitting upright or
get entering into your meditation posture. Perhaps gently closing your
eyes. And without doing anything more, can you find or touch into some degree of
calm or ease or peacefulness that's here now for you, the calm in the middle of
the storm? Maybe it's found someplace in your body. Maybe it lives in your chest
or your belly, in your hands or...
In whatever modicum of calm or peace you can feel, let your body relax into that.
Relax the doing of tension, holding of your shoulders, of your belly, of your
face.
In a calm, peaceful way, becoming aware of your breathing.
So it's not work to be aware of the breathing, but almost as if the breathing
are the waves of the ocean gently washing across the shore, the sand. So
gently the... your breathing washes across whatever is calm or peaceful for
you. Especially as you exhale, I kind of return to a peaceful place, staying with
the whole exhale, settling into whatever calm there is here.
And notice if you start thinking.
If that's extra work for your mind, an overactive mind is tiring. Sometimes in
the mind there's physical tension from all the thinking we do. That can be
tiring if we really feel it. Undoing the doing of thinking. The thinking mind
relax. Not so you don't think at all, but so your thinking becomes calm and
relaxed. The thinking becomes thinking about breathing. Gentle, slow thoughts
about being present here in this peaceful place. And so for this meditation, stay
close to a feeling of peace or ease. And notice what takes you away from it. And
whatever takes you away from it, can you relax? Settle back. Let go into the
peace again. And then notice what takes you away from it.
And so for this meditation, stay close to the mind. And notice what takes you away
from it. And notice what takes you away from it. And notice what takes you away
from it. And notice what you're hoping for.

dedication of aspiration, that it is our aspiration that we can contribute to the welfare and
happiness of others. Calmly, peacefully. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may our peacefulness contribute to that.
May our ability to be peaceful makes space for others. To be free, to be happy, to be safe.
Maybe our contribution is simply to stay peaceful and calm. And in that peace and calm, to be present
for others. For our friendliness, simple friendliness, to shine forth.
