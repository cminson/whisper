The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Everybody could gently return to having your eyes open and just
being aware of where you're sitting and coming back into contact with the screen
and other folks. We'll have an opportunity now for some breakout groups
to talk a little bit about yourselves. And this is a, you can feel the different
flavor of upeca or equanimity when it's offered in the context of the heart
and the different qualities. And there's a sense that it's a form of love.
Really is a form of love kind of in the way like the, when the sun shines on
everything, there's the love part where it's warming everything up.
That would be kind of the meta that we started with as the foundation.
And then there's the sameness. There's the equality that the sun shines
on everything. And this sense of non-discrimination is the equanimity
portion. And this balance that's always present and the nice linkage made is
something that Diana will talk about later, the way all the Brahma
Viharas are connected. But for our breakout groups, it would be nice if
each of you could talk a little bit about what it means to you to think
of equanimity or to experience equanimity as a form of love.
What does that evoke for you in your practice or in your daily life?
Are there ways in which you're expressing this universality and sameness
and love of truth as a form of love? And I would say maybe groups of four
would be good to have multiple voices. And it would be good, I think,
to have this be a little bit meditative, kind of stay in this space
that's close to your heart. And if each person could share and turn
for just a couple of minutes, and I'll send a little note in the,
you can look forward, it'll appear on the screen when it's time to shift
to the next person. And while somebody is sharing, if the other
people could just practice listening with an open heart, receiving the
truth of what they're saying into their heart, that would be a lovely
way to share. So we'll go around like that, and there will hopefully
be a little bit of time left at the end to share amongst yourselves
briefly before coming back, so that you're not only speaking one at a time.
So let's set the timer for perhaps 12 minutes, and we'll try to have
about two and a half minutes per person, so there will be a little time
left at the end in a group before. And when you need to choose who to go
first, if you could choose the person whose birthday is first in the year,
so January birthday goes first, and December birthday would go last.
Okay, are the groups set up?
So, now we get to hear you, hear from you.
Maybe, oh, and there's one person who needed to be admitted here.
Yeah. So, we'd like to hear from you.
Any report from your sharing, or any questions based on what we've been
talked about and shared so far, and you can again use your blue hand
or unmute directly.
Okay, Barbara.
I was just sharing with my group, and I will just say that admittedly,
I never knew the depths of equanimity, and I have learned a lot about it
since participating at IMC and certainly in this program,
and I lead with a clear explanation and understanding of how to apply it
to my practice of admitted. So, I wanted to thank you for that.
Thank you.
Yeah. Thank you, Barbara.
David.
Yeah, all I wanted to say is I was struck by how different our responses were,
but at the same time by how much they involved an expression of the dharma,
love for the dharma.
So, it was almost like people maybe were drawn and clined to one aspect
a little more than the other, but it just all seemed to be good,
you know, beautiful. So, that's all I wanted to say.
Great. Yeah. This is an analogy of a curry, you know,
all different spices and flavors, you know.
One day maybe we do cardamom the other day, I don't know, cumin.
Yes, but they're all good. Yes.
Yan Kui.
Hi, everyone.
Yeah, I want to thank my group too for their different stories.
I didn't get a chance to say this. It's so different and yet it resonated
completely, each of your stories that you shared.
I want to share with the larger group that I was contemplating equanimity
in the face of great sorrow and in the face of great pleasure.
So, with the sorrow parts, I'm facing one just currently with my 15-year-old
daughter who is under just in a state of great despair and self-loathing
happiness and as hard as a mother not want to make her feel better.
This is what I do as a mother and this is what I do as a friend.
But she did not, doesn't want any interferences, doesn't want anything
and she's made that clear in other times too.
So, it's like, I think with the practice of sitting here in a sitting,
but I'm listening but not resisting, acting, you know, just saying,
okay, to be in the connection is to feel into it.
It is painful. It's not like I'm not feeling it.
It's painful, but to just to be here, to still be here, here, here
and not going away, but not trying to push it away or acting anyway
to change that and it reminded me of how when I was younger
or maybe other times when having a hard time, most people around me
wanted to say, oh, you can do this, do this and do that
or here, can I give you this and how that is that there's something wrong
with me for feeling bad, though I shouldn't be feeling bad.
And so, like, so, you know, so that was one piece that I'm learning.
I thought this is, so thank you so much for the teaching that sort of that,
just like being with what is and then in the other things
then I thought of like equanimity in terms of great pleasure,
like leaning into another scoop of ice cream or another episode or something.
How easy it is for me to just lean into it without even pausing to contemplate
what my practice is.
And so here speaks equanimity also just staying put, enjoying that pleasure,
enjoying it completely, but whether not needing to act, you know,
not needing to have more, not needing to really lean into it more than what it is
and just leave it as is. Yeah, thanks.
Another beautiful reflection. I'm sure you're, I don't know,
your daughter maybe 10 years later will really appreciate.
So Ram.
Thank you for this teaching.
So we had a good discussion in our team and one thing I, there's a question here as well.
I've been trying to understand equanimity both as a Parimi and the sound factors of awakening.
One particular area I'm focusing on lately is equanimity as I'm listening and engaging with the people, right?
As I'm doing that, I'm getting slightly marginally better,
but I'm also noticing all the conditioning I have within me as I'm listening and engaging with others.
So, and as such, I may not be fully present for them because of my conditionality or my biases, whatever it may be.
As practitioner, can you offer any tips, teachers here, in terms of trying to not so much suppress the conditioning,
but try to overcome the conditioning aspect?
Any of my co-teachers, I'd like to say a few words.
I guess I would mention what, when you were speaking, what came to mind was something I've heard from Venerable Anaglio,
who says that true objectivity is complete acknowledgement of our subjectivity.
So it's really a matter of knowing what all of these tendencies, biases, etc.
So the more you learn through practice about your own mind and just, you know, your own conditioning, that's what it is.
It is what it is. That is what frees you from getting that entangled with other people when you're talking with them.
So you just know it's there and then keep opening to them.
I feel like my generosity of attentiveness is being challenged.
Yeah. And then in the end, it gets challenged. It's true.
So the last few, Randy, Amira and Jerry, I said the last three we'll take.
So Randy, please.
I just had a very quick question.
There is an understanding and teaching by Longchampa in the Nyingma tradition that equanimity is first.
Equanimity is the foundation for the Brahma Vahara.
And so we're kind of touching on that with equanimity as a base of love and that connection.
And so I'm wondering if that is an understanding in Theravada or Polycanon tradition too.
It seems like we've had, you know, a few questions around this, right?
And I think that's a close from earlier and the mention that in later abhidhamic tradition, the commentary tradition that there is a place for sort of equanimity that pervades the practice.
And then at least I, but I think others too have pointed toward the place for, or just the central place that establishing or cultivating equanimity have not as a destination,
but as a means.
So I think those things do, I think in a way we do begin, I don't know that we place it first.
I'm not sure it's linear, a lot of this isn't linear, but that it is available as a way to support practice.
So it's both a condition, and we see that in magma seven that it doesn't end with the cultivation of equanimity but rather that equanimity is, is both something that emerges in practice and then is a condition is, is, is a condition with which other things
just colorize. So anyway, I hope that gets to some of that point Randy I don't know if Diana Kim or Yang have other thoughts.
I'll just say briefly, in this tradition, you know, with a recognition, you know, that of course the brahman vahara has changed as time went on. I would say probably loving kindness is tends to be the foundational practice for the brahman vahara is, and then it's this warmth
and this love that as it meets different conditions gets transformed, if you will, into the other brahman vahara. So it's a little bit, and that's partly why we're calling this the capping off 2020 capstone is this idea that equanimity is less the foundation and more the capstone.
Let's go back to the mirror. I'm just considering the timing we have another teaching. So if we could keep the questions, maybe a brief that be supportive of the group.
Okay mirror please.
I don't have a question I had something I wanted to just offer into the room that's but I think it's brief.
Go ahead.
It's
it's for those of us who are
quite literally literal minded often that with the idea like flavors which I appreciate and also have to go through some translation with not only because equanimity is sometimes talked about as tasteless or flavorless, which I really love.
And that that another kind of sense other than the taste sense is a spatial sense, which I find really great with with equanimity and to mention that.
And this might relate to Natalie's question earlier. I'm not sure but that that Upeka has this sort of sense of right from above. I think of sort of skating on ice, this like smoothness ice cool this that that sort of relationship to things.
So it's a it's cooler. Well, touch a matcha top really has this feeling more like a bowl right so much as the middle. It's really you're there in the middle and it's, you're kind of being held so it's like sitting in the middle of the flames.
So there's a the equanimity there is a warmer equanimity, or it's pretty hot equanimity and possibly and but that the relationship is is.
Well, already that's a lot of words but one's cooler and one's warmer and one's maybe has some more distance and one's really there.
Thank you. Thank you for sharing that Jerry.
In many ways I really still don't know what equanimity is but my patience allows me to wait it'll come to me something to do with balance and holding.
So I'm at a retreat right now and this is not the first time but this is a good example, because it happened this morning. I was feeling vitality joy and even exuberance.
And then all of a sudden I realized if this must be some form of equanimity, because as you all may know by now I can be sort of reactive and intense.
It was turned the equanimity just turned the volume down, and I got to sit there and really be with it without too much excitement and my back hurting and rising off of my chair.
And I got to study it a lot more because it was being held in very loving and a very loving Dharma. It was it was unbelievable actually, and exuberance with in quietness and stillness is a very interesting experience.
So that's all. Thank you.
So happy for you, Jerry. So we got to move on. Diana.
Thank you. Thank you all. It's wonderful to hear from everybody.
Yeah, so equanimity is one of the Brahma Viharas. And maybe at first blush, we might think like, well, what does equanimity have to do with these other heart practices?
Maybe, you know, I'm even using this word heart, which kind of implies a sense of warmth and a sense of connection. And we might be thinking like, well, equanimity seems like a good idea.
Maybe because we could somehow, maybe, maybe it's not so in the front of our minds, but in the back of our minds, we might have this idea that it maybe can help us disconnect from difficulties or help us to not be so bothered by what's happening.
But equanimity as part of the Brahma Viharas and the Brahma Viharas, including equanimity, they really inform and infuse each other.
So the heart qualities, I'm using this word to express the Brahma Viharas that is loving kindness, compassion and sympathetic joy.
When it helps keep equanimity, like, have a warmth and vibrant and upbeat quality to it, as opposed to this indifference and disconnection that we might slip into, that equanimity we could slip into is a way to not be bothered.
It's one way we might kind of have this cruel indifference that comes from a disconnection and as a kind of a bypassing from what's actually happening.
But with equanimity, infused with the heart qualities, we could have equanimity with loving kindness, for example, brings in some of the warmth.
If sometimes equanimity gets a little bit too analytical, is a way in which we are disconnecting or not fully engaging, but just in using our minds, the compassion can come in and help us to care and to connect with our experience.
Or sometimes equanimity can slip into being a little bit aloof and not connecting with the difficulties, but also not connecting with the positive things, but standoffish.
Equanimity with this flavor of sympathetic joy allows this sense of positivity and kind of like this uplift that might be. So bringing in some of these other qualities, letting that infuse that equanimity helps it to have this vibrance and upbeat.
And I'm using the word warm and connection, but maybe you have some different words, some different ways of to not be disengaged.
But also, of course, it works the other way, that equanimity helps balance the other Brahma vahara's, that loving kindness without equanimity can slide into attachment, you know, clinging or some conditional love, you know, I only love you or care for you if the conditions are this particular way.
Or the same is true is compassion, that equanimity can help compassion, which is this capacity to connect and care about others when there's some difficulties arising and some suffering.
And then with equanimity, when it comes in with compassion, can help it from compassion, not slipping into pity or empathy in such a way that we get so identified with the other person suffering, it triggers our own suffering.
And then we go into a sense of overwhelm or something that's not so helpful.
And because empathy is important, but it can leave to this over identification and which we just feel we've ourselves start to feel the difficulty or it can even like flip into some cruelty.
And the same way that equanimity with sympathetic joy helps sympathetic joy, not slip into, well, what about me? So is it when we are seeing somebody, they have some good fortune or they're having some well, something that's going well in their lives.
If we have sympathetic joys infused with some equanimity, it could help us to celebrate the good things that are happening to everybody around us and recognizing that there isn't a fixed amount of goodness quote unquote right just because others are experiencing good rule doesn't mean that there is any less available for us.
So in this way that equanimity can kind of infuse the Brahma Vihara's and the Brahma Vihara's can help kind of balance and infuse equanimity.
And then maybe I'll just say this one last thing too, is that maybe this isn't so explicit, but the Brahma Vihara's, like a kindness compassion, sympathetic joy, they help us to have a sense of happiness, a sense of well being a sense of okayness.
That's independent of the conditions of the world in the sense that just when when we cultivate these qualities in the heart, it helps us to have this well being, which then it's so much easier to have equanimity that comes from this sense of well being.
So doing these heart practices is a way in which we can create a resource inside of ourselves, we can be filled up in some kind of way.
So that equanimity is easier to arise, it's easier to feel generous or to feel not feel blown over by experiences when we ourselves know how to connect into feelings of love and care and tenderness both towards others and towards ourselves.
So when we are no longer dependent on having everything just being perfectly the way that we would like but instead have know that it's possible, if not at that moment just to know that it's possible to have this resource of love and care.
It's much easier to be equanimous, much easier to be equanimous. So this is one way in which the heart qualities just help with the cultivation of the development of equanimity.
Okay, so now, I think I'll send this over to David and who can wrap it up for us.
Yeah, to pass it over to David who will try to help everybody leave with a spring in their step.
Yeah, we wanted to share we wanted to give you two things sort of an overview of where we are and then some ideas for homework, that is kind of how to take some of this between now and Saturday and incorporated in your, in your practice.
First, just to sort of give a sense of kind of how we're seeing this and I think in a way that addresses several kinds of questions and discussion that have come up today.
This is kind of our view of seeing equanimity as a capstone and getting back to this bigger question of well is this how it appears in the suit does, you know, this is a way it's available to us and that seemed to the four of us to be a rich way to bring this into our practice at the close of this particular
year, and the Dhammas like this, it allows us to make it relevant to where we are where we find ourselves the challenges. And again, thanks for a couple people for sharing personal challenges today gives a real sense of, yeah, what the kinds of things were up against
this year and frankly in and out of all years stuff comes up we don't get to choose the challenges and this year seemed like a reminder that we can view equanimity as in various ways serving as a capstone for our practice.
So today we talk about Upeca's place among the seven factors of awakening today we've sort of placed it in the context that is the textual context and also some of the context that comes from the oral tradition in the context of the Brahma Viharas, and
Saturday we'll take a look at it in the context of the Samadhi practice, where it also features or figures I should say as a capstone practice.
I will of course, not only continue to build this out over the next couple days but share with you. So, don't worry, you will see it again and and be able to look at it.
By way of homework.
We say homework we always smile because of course, nobody's going to be checking anybody's homework but we have a couple suggestions.
One is to take a look at the suttas again, as somebody pointed out in the comment, who was that earlier today somebody said, just, they didn't put it this way, but they implied that these suttas are incredibly rich and deep and that reading them in advance and then returning to them and
rereading them opens up each time literally each time new new things new perspectives, and this is part of the study and practice mode that we want to kind of incorporate in these classes.
We want to incorporate in these classes as returning to them. It might be interesting to look for example at this condensed version which we produced of Majuminakaya seven for today.
And look at the full version.
Because, in essence, what we've done is kind of draw attention to a logic.
On another occasion condense it and bring attention to another feature. There's a lot of different ways to look at these and it might be interesting to compare that contents version and the logic that appears there.
And with with the full, the full suit, which is not a huge long one but has a lot of other things going on and plenty of stuff to mystify and intrigue us in addition to what we've, what we share.
And then on the practice side, and I always like to emphasize this.
When we say study in practice by practice we really mean in large in significant part the meditation practice.
And I think what I would emphasize and I young we have time I might pass it off back to Kim Yang and Diana to see if they have something to add on this aspect of the homework.
Which as somebody in the chat has pointed out as humorous for number numerous reasons.
Because we're all more or less at home, which yeah, is good good point, whoever said that that's that's get brings a smile to the face.
But when we say something like and we throw these phrases we bandy around these phrases sometimes without thinking of them too carefully but we say to cultivate equanimity.
But make this kind of precision that in the practice the meditation practice whether, whether it's the Brahma Vihara practice that we talked about today or any, you know, your familiar home practice.
Part of it is watching, looking for equanimity as yin guided us finding it discovering it where it emerges.
And we cultivate it by bringing attention to it. That's how we understand these teachings it also seems to be part of the practice that's supported by neuroscience.
That when we bring attention when we show up for the equanimity that's available there, that is its cultivation.
So that means we look for it and we notice when it's there and we notice when it's absent.
We don't have a value judgment about it. We're exploring it and understanding the conditions that support it's arising and when it arises as yin led us to in the guided we lean in toward it.
We notice how it opens the heart perhaps or we notice how it can lead to seeing clearly.
We take the path we follow the path where it leads.
So when we say cultivate and don't don't try too hard just pay attention as as the teachings remind us pay close attention be curious and be open be kind and equanimity is there.
Diana yin Kim anything to add in the remaining couple minutes.
I just beautifully said David.
Can you dedicate merit. Absolutely. So, we've already had two wonderful days of practice together.
Both of those up and imagine that our practice has a way of spreading out to other beings of course the ones that we connect with in our own lives perhaps the people we live with.
But also these days the ones that we see on the screen or that we're connecting with over email.
And there's a way in which the simple love the basis of loving kindness in our heart our intention of non harming connects in to all beings that we meet the equanimity portions that we don't have any favoritism.
And maybe that everyone that we touch today somehow feels the warmth of our heart in direct or indirect ways and from there it may spread out even farther.
So through all these unseen pathways out into the world.
May the benefits of our practice spread far beyond this group.
May all beings be touched by happiness and peace.
Thank you.
So till Saturday everyone on mute and say goodbye to the next.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
