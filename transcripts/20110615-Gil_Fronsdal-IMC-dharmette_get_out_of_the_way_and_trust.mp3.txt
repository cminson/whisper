Dharmette: Get Out of the Way and 
Trust

One of the approaches to mindfulness and meditation is 
that it involves very simple attention to what  is 
happening as it’s happening. What becomes interesting 
in doing th is is to notice all the ways in which you feel 
like it’s not enough  or has to be different. There are 
attitudes towards what’s happening that we have to fix it 
or avoid it, or the grass is greener somewhere else. “I 
can be present for this , but this isn’t really what my 
neighbor in the meditation  hall is experiencing  – great 
bliss and infinite consciousness. I’m supposed to be 
having that . Not  here with a n irritated  throat and a 
persistent cough. What’s spiritual about that?”  
 
So be present for things as they’re occurring. Then  
notice what attitu des, beliefs  and assumptions  you have 
around your experience , and how hard it actually is for 
you to be willing to abide in, rest in , and pay  attention  to 
things as they’re occurring with nothing added or taken 
away.  
 One of the interesting  things  to notic e is the degree to 
which there is mistrust. We don’t trust things as they 
are. We don’t trust  that things will unfold the way that 
they need to unfold. We feel or we believe  that if I don‘t 
do something here , or I don’t avoid something here, 
then something terrible will happen to me – or I’ll be 
stuck forever this way.  
 
In the external world of work  and daily life , there are 
things we have to do. You can’t sit on your living room 
couch and trust that things w ill unfold perfectly  just the 
way they’re supposed to. There are all kinds of things 
you have to take care of:  your bladder, going  shopping, 
going to  work . There are a  variety of things that you’re 
supposed to do in th is world.  
 
But the world of meditatio n is a safe place to explore all 
the extra stuff we tend to add on top of our experience  – 
all the ways in which this is not enough , this is too 
difficult  or frightening , or I have to do something. The 
simple instructions to pay attention to what’s happeni ng 
as it’s happening , and that’s all you’re supposed to do , 
is like a wonderful mirror that helps us to see all the  
ways in which we can’t do that . We feel  that’s not good 
enough , or that something else has to happen. My hope 
is that eventually people learn how deeply trustable it is 
to have one’s  attention open to everything – and to not 
have to censor anything, or get involved in anything, or 
have to believe or disbelieve anything. Just feel and be present for the immediacy of what’s happening  – not for 
the stories, narratives  or images  that come up  – but 
rather the immediacy of how your experience is  being 
sensed and felt physically and emotionally, right here, 
right now. You learn  that this very simple attention to life 
as it’s occurring is one of the most trustable things you 
can do. Mindfulness  of your experience in meditation is 
also trustable if you’re present for it.  
 
Often w hat’s not trustable is all the judgments , beliefs, 
attachments , resistance,  and fears whereby  we 
complicate things so quickl y. So no matter what the 
terror, bliss, anger, love, pain or pleasure might be that 
bubbles up, learn that it’s trustable to be present for it.  
There are a number of rational reasons why it’s 
trustable.  
 
One is that when we can be present in a relaxed way for 
things as they are , then we’re not adding any reactivity , 
tension or stress  to our experience.  When  we’re relaxed 
about how things unfold , the whole psycho physical 
system works better . But if we’re tense and not relaxed, 
then everything  – the psychophysical  system, immune 
system, muscular system  – doesn’t work optimally . Life 
tends to work better when we can relax with how things 
are.  
 
Another  thing that works better is that when  we allow 
things to be as they are, nothing wants to stay the same. Nothing’s really frozen unless we freeze around it 
and hold  tight. Everything  is in process,  moving  and 
unfolding. If  we let things be as they are and trust, then 
what we’re saying is that we’re trusting this unfolding  
and how things move through us.  
 
In terms of this Buddhist psychological , spiritual life, the 
forces that keep us enslaved  – the forces that keep us 
from being liberated or free – are act ive forces. The 
forces are things we are  doing. If we cling  to something , 
clinging is an activity  – we tighten up around something 
mentally or even physically. It takes a lot of energy to 
cling and tighten up. What  the system wants  to do is to 
rest. It’s like a ball : when you  put a ball on a slope, what 
the ball wants to do is roll down the hill. You have to 
make effort  or apply energy to block the ball so it 
doesn ’t come down the hill. But once  you stop making 
the effort, it rolls down. Similarly , once  you stop making 
the effort to keep clinging, tightening or being resistant , 
then the tension  and holding releases and lets go. Deep 
in our psyche  and psychophysical system, there is 
almost an inherent movement towards liberation , 
because to be unliberated takes a lot of effort  and 
energy. It’s an active process to stay unliberated. To  
become liberated is partly to let go of this active process 
that gets in the way.  
 
So this idea of practicing being present for things as 
they’re occurring  is supported by a deep trust that this movement of letting things unfold the way they want to 
can be a movement toward s freedom  and liberation. 
We’re getting out of the way that prevents the  
movement  toward liberation.  Clinging to self, identity, 
pride, pleasure, desire, and fear  – and resisting – are all 
activities or things we are doing. Trust  that we don’t 
have to do anything. We can just let go and let t he 
process unfold and settle. Like when the ball rolls down 
the hill,  it settles and comes  to a place of peace.  
 
Earlier this  morning I gave the instruction to notice what 
your experience is without any censoring, and then feel 
what  it’s like. What does  it feel like to have  that 
experience? What does it feel like in the body and your 
mind  just to feel it?  Feeling it  and being present for the 
immediacy of it  – unmediated by thoughts, stories or 
beliefs  – is one of the optimal ways in which the 
unfolding can begin to happen. Sometimes it takes a 
while, but just hold it, feel it, sense and experience 
what’s there. It’s a very beautiful and generous thing to 
do because for the things that trouble  us the most , for 
the suffering we carry, some of the best medicine is not 
to understand it , but to hold it caringly. Something  about 
this feels like an accepting presence  or being seen . 
That’s what children mostly want.  They just want 
someone who can be present for them.  
 
I remember when my son was maybe two years old , I 
was on the floor playing with him. He was building something with blocks. It was a little bit boring for me , 
and after  a while I noticed that he wasn’t paying any 
attention to me. I wasn’t doing anything ; I was just 
sitting there. He was doing all the playing  and was very 
absorbed and contented. So I thought , “Since he’s 
happy and contented, he doesn’t need me and I’ll go. ” 
Then he was no longer happy and contented [laughter] . 
In fact, he was very aware that I was there . My simple 
presence – just being there – was what was holding him 
and what allowed him to be happy doing his thing.  
 
So we can do that for ourselves too  – simple  presence.  
 
Those are  my thoughts  for today . Thank you.
