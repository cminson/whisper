The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good morning.
Happy DST Daylight Savings Time Sunday.
Good day to anyone else who has used an extra hour of sleep.
But you're here! Wow! Wow, dedication! Yay!
So, how many of you were here last time?
Okay, a bunch of people. Great.
And how many are here for the first time ever?
Great. A bunch of newcomers. Welcome. Wonderful.
Oh, there was another hand up there.
Welcome. Great.
So, last time I talked about meta-loving-kindness and Brahma-viharas, heavenly dwellings, practices.
And I had just come out the day before from a month of silent meditation
and had just gotten a police ticket on the way here, driving.
I was late, if you remember, for those of you who were here.
So, today, no drama in the Dharma.
But I realized that there was so much that we could have talked about last time
about meta and Brahma-viharas.
And there was so much that the conversation could have continued, obviously,
for longer than two and 45 minutes.
But one of the things I realized that was important to bring up and mention
is that loving-kindness, meta-practice, is also purification practice.
Actually, for those who are new and for you for the first time,
let me just briefly just touch on what the meta-practice is.
So, meta-practice is a practice of cultivating goodwill for yourself,
for others in your life, for all beings.
It's just cultivating goodwill. It's a cultivation practice.
And it's done using phrases, may you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy,
may your life flow with ease.
So, as well as really touching into that sense of goodwill that we have
for various beings, ourselves, people in our lives that we care about.
And then extending the circle to people who are neutral
and then people who are difficult in our lives, the difficult people.
And then to all beings everywhere, including animals and everything that breathes, basically.
And the meta-practice is thought of both as a purity practice and a purification practice.
So, in the words of Michelle McDonald, there's a purification purity cycle that happens in this practice.
Now, what does that mean?
So, the purity when you're in the state of purity is when you're actually dwelling in a state of love and care and goodwill for a being.
And that really feels wonderful when you're in love, when, for example, you're with a child or a dear one.
You just feel that sense of care and love. It's a sense of purity.
It's beautiful. We've all experienced that.
Anyone not experienced that?
No, absolutely not. We're a human being.
It's a part of our nature to be in touch with that sense of care, goodwill, and how that makes us feel.
So, that's the purity.
Okay, what's the purification?
The purification is that when one does this practice intensely, the meta-practice,
stories and memories, the hurts can also come up.
Things that you had forgotten, things that you hadn't remembered for a long, long time, and resentment can come up,
especially as one extends this or tries to extend it for the difficult people in your lives, which could be difficult.
So, the purification is when the cycle of purification is, or the purification part of the cycle,
is when these memories and thoughts and resentments come up and one works through them,
one resolves them, one purifies them, they go away, they're underneath, they're still there,
but through this practice they come up and they get resolved, they get purified.
So, that's the purification part of this practice.
Does that make sense?
Any questions?
If any questions at any point, please raise your hand.
It would be interesting if there's a dialogue more than a monologue, but I will continue for now.
So, on that note, compared to vipassana or insight, where one is in the present moment experience
and one is really observing what is arising and passing away,
metta, loving kindness practice, can become a reflective practice when stories do come up
and one works with them and resolves them and then one goes back to the phrases and sense of loving kindness and the purity.
So, the Visuddhimaga, which is this fifth century practice manual of Buddhism,
offers a lot of ways to work with resentment and anger that may come up,
either during this practice or in life in general.
And as I was reading the Visuddhimaga while I was practicing last month,
I found personally the methods both funny and brilliant and just, I mean, there are poetry in there.
So, I wanted to share that with you.
I wanted to bring that up and share that today.
There's a lot of beauty in the practices that are offered.
So, that's kind of the lay of the land of what we're going to discuss today.
And we'll go through some exercises too so that you can feel into some of these things.
And also just to say that these are some ways to work with anger and resentment,
and there are a lot of different ways.
So, you may already have tools in your tool bag.
Please use them.
And there are many methods also from vipassana, from insight practice,
to work with emotions, with difficult emotions.
And then what we'll be talking about is another set of tools.
So, first of all, I invite you to do a guided meditation,
a little exercise for us to really feel into this.
So, close your eyes, get into your meditation posture.
Take a few deep breaths into the diaphragm.
Ah, just to settle back into the body.
Feeling your body, feeling whatever is arising in this present moment.
And just observing what you're feeling right now.
Are you in your mood?
Neutral, are you happy?
Are you bored, anxious, excited, happy, tired, sleepy?
Whatever it is, just note it simply.
Also notice what's happening in your body.
What are the sensations?
Is there a sense of ease and calm?
Is there movement?
Is there heat?
Is there coldness anywhere in the body?
Tightness?
Ease?
Just notice.
Take a pulse of where you are right now.
Okay, now that you've noted that let's continue with your eyes closed.
Now bring to mind something that recently made you really angry, really upset.
Allow the story to come up for this.
Allow the situation to come up.
What happened?
What did the other person or people do?
What was your reaction?
The sense of injustice?
The upset?
For the sake of this exercise, allow yourself to feel it.
Allow the story line to come up.
And now when you feel you have it, that story, that situation of anger,
now check into your body. How is your body feeling now?
Is there tightness?
Is there heat?
Is there anxiety?
How are your muscles in your forehead, in your jaw, your back, your stomach?
Just checking in.
What is your mood now?
Just taking a pulse of how recollecting something that happened in the past
that brought up anger, how physiologically, emotionally makes you feel.
Just checking in.
Now let that go. Let the story go. Let all of that go.
Let's take another few deep breaths into the abdomen.
Settle, come back to the present moment.
And now I invite you to bring to mind someone who makes you happy,
someone for whom you feel care and love.
Could be a child, a pet, someone in your life,
someone with whom you have an uncomplicated relationship and just a sense of goodwill.
Perhaps a smile shows up on your face when you think about this person
and how you feel about them.
Bring them to your mind's eye, what they look like.
Try to see them, visualize them.
Imagine them right in front of you.
Allow yourself to relax and just be with this person in your mind's eye
with their felt sense of this being.
Letting your feelings of goodwill and care
grow and expand in your body and mind for this person.
Thinking about their goodness, what you love about them,
how you care about them.
Just simply tapping into the sense of goodwill you have for this being.
How does your body feel now?
Is there ease in the body?
Is there warmth?
Is there softness?
How about the mind? How does the mind feel?
Is there warmth, happiness, care, sense of joy perhaps?
Or whatever else is coming up, just notice your state of body,
your state of mind right now.
And now, see if you can feel into how the state of mind and body
compares to what you were feeling,
either at the beginning when we started
or after recollecting the angry episode.
How is your body different now? How is your mind different now?
So, with that little exercise, I invite you to...
Actually, I invite a few comments.
What you observed, what you noticed
by the difference between these mind stays.
I have a comment.
When you said, let go of that angry story,
I thought, oh really?
I'll be able to do that quickly and I surprised myself
because I kind of did.
Great.
Great. Nice.
Any other observations?
I struggle with those kind of exercises
because I don't really feel the anger.
Normally, if I felt angry about something,
I kind of don't like the fact that I was angry
and I really struggle to go back to that.
I have a therapist that tries to do the same thing.
My body just doesn't want to, my mind doesn't want to,
so I struggle with it.
If that's a place that your mind just doesn't go to, wonderful.
Great. No problem.
Any comments from people whose minds and bodies do go there?
Can go there.
Yeah.
Just a brief comment and that is,
I realize that I need a reminder
when I'm in the midst of the anger and resentment part.
I don't so easily flow out of it,
but when someone says, okay, let it go, much easier.
So I don't know if I need a recording
or you have to come home with me or what,
but yeah, thank you.
And I also love how it was,
you found it easy to do when you had the reminder.
Which, Martha, is similar to what you said.
You didn't think it would be so easy to do,
but it was. Great, thank you.
I see another hand.
Anyone who observed how the body was different
after the anger scenario versus the joy scenario?
Yeah.
I noticed that my stomach, when I was the angry thought,
my stomach was kind of tight and turning,
which was kind of a surprise to me.
I didn't realize that I felt anger in there.
Yeah.
Thanks for mentioning that.
I was hoping people would mention,
as you did the physiological responses,
because the anger activates the parasympathetic nervous system
and the stomach being in knots is one of the ways
in which it shows up the activity
of the parasympathetic nervous system.
The sympathetic nervous system is the one
that calms us, cools us,
we feel happy and love and attachment
and the parasympathetic nervous system.
Everything goes in knots, including the stomach.
Great, you noticed that?
Yeah.
So with that,
basically what I wanted us to get a taste of
is that anger is a state of dukkha,
is a state of suffering, is not pleasant.
Did anyone find, people who found their way
into the anger state, did they find it pleasant?
Anyone?
Yeah? No, you're joking?
No, it's exciting.
I'm glad you raised that,
because it is also true that there is short-term excitement,
there is energy, it's an energetic system
that can excite us, but in the long term
and overall, it's like, you know, it's a...
Your body didn't like it.
Yeah, your body, I'm sure, didn't like it.
In fact, the stress hormone cortisol
is known as public enemy number one
and that's what the body produces
when we're in a state of stress and anger.
So just to give you a sense,
cortisol interferes with learning, memory,
causes lower immune function, bone density,
increase in weight gain, blood pressure,
cholesterol, heart disease, the list goes on.
And also increases the risk for depression,
mental illness, lower life expectancy.
Wow.
Now who wants to be angry now?
And that's just the worldly,
the worldly dukkha of our body,
the difficulties of the body.
And this path is about suffering,
about ease and not having any suffering.
And anger is essentially suffering,
both for us, really, in a physiological way,
both physically and in our mind,
as well as causing suffering and difficulty for others.
How many of us have, or is there anyone
who hasn't ever said or done anything
in a state of anger that they regret?
Anyone?
We're all in this together.
I don't think there's anyone in the room.
And if there is one, please raise your hand.
Myself included.
Remembering a case where, ouch,
I wish I wasn't angry at that point.
I wish there was more space.
I wish I hadn't done that.
I wish I hadn't.
So with that in mind, with that premise,
now I'd like to offer you a few things
from the Visuddhimaga.
Now that we have that background,
okay, we all get angry, right?
Let's fess up.
So what are some of the ways that are offered?
So one is, the first one is,
do love and kindness practice
for people that you care about
for whom love and kindness flows easily for you
to warm your heart and then turn it
towards a difficult person.
So it's like warming the pump,
warming the heart and then turning it
towards the difficult person.
And part of that, really,
the insight in that recommendation
is how our moods affect how we see the world.
Have you ever gotten out of bed kind of grumpy
and everything looks kind of gray,
but then you get up in the happy mood
and everything looks lovely.
It's a gray day and you're singing,
oh, what a beautiful morning.
So by changing your mood,
by changing your heart space to feel love
for the person that you care about
and then carrying that into the difficult person,
the resentment, the state of resentment
or anger that you have, that's one way.
That's the first way that's recommended.
The second one, which I really appreciated,
was anger makes you ugly.
Have you ever thought about that?
I really appreciated reading this one.
Here it is.
Now, this angry person is a prey to anger,
ruled by anger, though well bathed,
well anointed, with hair and beard trimmed
and clothed in white, yet he is ugly,
being a prey to anger.
It's so true.
Anger makes us ugly.
I mean, have you considered being around angry people
when they're angry or resentful?
It's not attractive.
And before I read this, I had never considered
that that's how I probably look too.
I mean, the ugliness is not just in my mind.
There's resentment.
But it just makes you unattractive.
It's just like, eww, bad,
like kind of bad energy all around.
It's interesting that it's the same way
that I wouldn't want to be around someone
who's angry and resentful.
Probably other people wouldn't want to be around me
if I'm angry and resentful.
Hence the person who's angry would not be,
would have no friends, would be in pain,
as we already discussed.
And also would have, here,
they'll be reborn in unfortunate and unhappy destinies.
So whether or not we believe in the multi-life model
and rebirth, whether or not we do that,
we can think of taking birth in this life
as an angry person, as a resentful person.
And when we take birth in this life,
in this state of resentment,
it's like we've taken birth in an unhappy realm.
We're living in an unhappy realm.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
So the third recommendation is that we think about
something good about the person that we don't,
we're feeling resentful about or angry about,
because everyone has something good.
There's something good about everyone,
either about their behavior, bodily behavior,
or their verbal behavior or mental behavior.
So, okay, let's do this together.
So close your eyes for a moment.
And bring to mind the angry situation
that we were just playing with a moment ago.
And let's just bring up the person
if there was a person involved.
Let's think about that person.
So try to bring to mind something about that person
that you actually like or admire.
Something good about them.
Perhaps they have good intentions,
even if they behave badly or speak harshly.
Or perhaps their action is controlled.
They don't control their behavior,
even if they don't control their speech and mental acts.
So look for something good about them,
something that they're trying to do,
something that they're good about,
something you like, something that you admire.
And realizing that they too are someone
who wants to be happy in this world.
And if you can't come up with anything about this being,
perhaps you can tap into their difficulty,
the state of their own state of pain
from which their behavior arises.
And seeing that can usually be
a cause for compassion.
So I invite you to open your eyes now.
So when I was working with my difficult person,
one thing that worked best for me
was really working with compassion,
seeing that the activity,
the harm that was coming from this person
was because of their own hurt.
And seeing how their hurt,
how the difficulties in their lives
that is causing them to act in the ways they do.
Are there other people who could see that
about people they were angry at or upset or resentful at?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, some hands.
So that's one way.
So another recommendation is to contemplate
about people who actually have,
who have managed not to have anger,
to have overcome anger in their life.
So there are examples of life of the Buddha
in the Jakata tales as he was reincarnated,
reborn in different shapes of animals
and was hurt in many ways,
but anger never arose.
I also found a beautiful example
in a speech from Martin Luther King
that I would love to share with you.
To our most bitter opponents we say,
we shall match your capacity to inflict suffering
by our capacity to endure suffering.
We shall meet your physical force with soul force.
Do to us what you will,
and we shall continue to love you.
We cannot in all good conscience obey your unjust laws
because non-cooperation with evil
is as much immoral obligation as is cooperation with good.
Through us in jail and we shall still love you.
Bomb our homes and threaten our children
and we shall still love you.
Send your hooded perpetrators of violence
into our community at the midnight hour
and beat us and leave us half dead
and we shall still love you.
But be assured that we will wear you down
by our capacity to suffer.
One day we shall win freedom,
but not only for ourselves.
We shall so appeal to your heart and conscience
that we shall win you in the process
and our victory will be a double victory.
So remembering that example,
we shall still love you.
The times when resentment and anger come up,
it can be done, it is done, it has been done.
There's another beautiful story of the Holy,
His Holiness the Dalai Lama a few years ago,
greeting an elderly monk who arrived in India
after fleeting from prison in Tibet
and meeting with the Dalai Lama,
he recounted years that he had been imprisoned,
imprisoned the hardship, the beatings he had endured,
the hunger, the loneliness that he had lived with
and the torture he had faced.
At one point the Dalai Lama asks him,
was there ever a time you felt your life was truly in danger?
And the monk answered,
in truth, the only time I felt at risk
was when I felt in danger of losing my compassion
for my jailers.
So it can be done.
And I love something that I heard recently
which is to set our standards very high
and our expectations low of ourselves.
To know that it can be done,
not to have resentment or anger towards anyone,
and yet when it does arise
to realize that we're human beings
and it arises for all of us,
that's why it's a practice, that's why it's a training,
not to beat ourselves up
and to know that there are ways that we can work through it,
work around it.
There are lots of different practices for it.
I'd like to share a couple of other things from the Visuddhimaga.
There is actually a beautiful reflection poem
that I want to share with you.
Suppose an enemy has hurt you now in what is his domain.
Why try yourself as well to hurt your mind?
That is not his domain.
Isn't that beautiful?
The hurt has happened is gone.
And now, by being angry or resentful,
we're hurting the domain that is ours.
It's not his domain anymore.
In tears you left your family.
This is for bhikkhus, for monks who've left.
They had been kind and helpful too,
so why not leave your enemy the anger that brings harm to you?
This resonates with the comments that you gave
at how easy it was to leave the anger
when you realized, oh, you can leave the anger.
This anger that you entertain is gnawing at the very roots
of all the virtues that you guard.
Who is there such a fool as you?
I love that one too.
All the virtues that you're trying to guard,
it gnaws at the very roots of all the virtues
that you try to guard.
Another does ignoble deeds.
So you're angry.
How is this?
Do you then want to copy to the sort of acts that he commits?
So basically we become like the angry person
or the difficult person when we are caught in that anger.
We start to do the kind of deeds that they do.
We resent their deeds and by anger we start to do them.
We become them.
Suppose another to annoy provokes you with some odious act.
Why suffer anger to spring up and do as he would have you do?
Basically you acting poorly is what your difficult person
or in the text your enemy would want you to do.
Essentially doing what they would want you to do
by acting poorly.
If you get angry then maybe you make him suffer.
Maybe not.
Though with the hurt that anger brings
you certainly are punished now.
So when you get angry you may or may not hurt the other person
but you're certainly hurting yourself.
There's no question about that.
Think about your cortisol levels if nothing else.
If anger blinded enemies set out to tread the path of woe
do you by getting angry too intend to follow heel to toe?
If hurt is done, if hurt is done you by a foe
because of anger on your part then put your anger down
for why should you be harassed groundlessly?
Since states last but in moments time
those aggregates by which was done
the odious act have seized so now what is it you are angry with?
So the act is done whatever happened happened in the past
whatever act happened and now basically whatever we recreate
in our mind is not happening anymore.
It's something that happened in the past
we are recreating a situation that's not there
it's not happening anymore we're not having the interaction
we're just creating in our mind so it's something that has passed
and here's the last part of the poem
whom shall he hurt who seeks to hurt another in the other's absence
your presence is the cause of hurt
why are you angry then with him?
So the last thing I'd like to say is I like the last suggestion
in the list of ten many of which I skipped was
receive or give a gift to the person that you're angry with
and that is a way to overcome the resentment and the anger
and I thought that is brilliant also it's so practical
and it's so true because by either giving or receiving gift
I mean receiving gift might be difficult
but giving a gift to a person it just opens the heart
it's a path to generosity and it just changes and turns things
so as a last resort try that.
So I want to invite you to reflect for a moment
close your eyes and reflect for a moment if you will
in the couple minutes that's left
about one thing that in your reflection today
you found interesting and valuable
and you like to take with you through the week
maybe share it with someone else
it can be something you like to act on or keep with you
and when you have that you open your eyes
and if you'd like to share anything
because I have as much to share as all of you
it's collective wisdom so.
I work as a massage therapist at an assisted living center
and I work on retired Catholic priests believe it or not
and there is a cook there that I love
a Filipino cook named Jesse
and one of the priests told me that his son
had been knifed to death two weeks ago
on a San Jose street
and I just turned around a couple of times
and experienced my anger about that incident
and I went up to Jesse after dinner
and he was his usual loving smiling self
and he asked me if I could give him a massage
at his home which told me something
and I said I heard about your son Jesse
and he said oh you know
don't worry about it
and that blew me away it sounded like he was a Buddhist
and he was trying to ease my anger
and he wasn't looking angry to me
and he had every right in the world
to be spending a lot of time getting over the loss of his son
in that way
so I think that I learned something from him
Thank you, thanks for sharing that
Any other thoughts?
Hi, my name is Mehta and I have been coming here for a few years
and it's been a wonderful experience
especially listening to you as well
your beautiful inside and out
and everything that you've taught us
especially with Mehta
I have a special request from everyone here
I have a dear friend who is my sister
in spirit
she's a family member
this is the first time and that's my aunt over there
her mom has diagnosed with a very severe malignant cancer
and if any of you guys could extend your love and kindness
and your prayers and your thought
I would deeply appreciate it very very much
thank you so much
Thank you
So on that note, let us close our day with
wishing, ease and happiness and well-being
for everyone in this room
and for all beings everywhere
may they be safe
may they be happy
and may they be free from suffering
Thank you for your kind attention
