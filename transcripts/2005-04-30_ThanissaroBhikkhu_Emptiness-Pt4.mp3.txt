I'd like to do a little recap of this morning.
Both in the Pali Canon and in Nargajana, you have two separate meanings for emptiness,
or two different but related meanings for emptiness.
In the Pali Canon, it's either emptiness as a meditative dwelling, in which case it
focuses on the issue of presence or absence of stress, and the emptiness is the absence
of the stress in any particular state of meditation.
And then this becomes a process that you continue following until you finally drop
all fabrication in the mind.
The second meaning, emptiness, as an attribute of the phenomena of experience, in this case
it's emptiness of self, or anything belonging to the self.
And as we took apart the idea of self, we realized there are two dichotomies there,
between what's mine and what's not mine, or what's me and what's not me.
And then the question of existence and non-existence.
The purpose of this is to put away all questions about whether there's anything behind the
experience that you're experiencing, or if there's anything sort of behind you watching
the experience, so that you focus specifically, again, on questions of presence or absence
of stress, and what you're doing to cause those things.
So those are the two meanings of emptiness in the Pali Canon.
In our Garjuna, there's some similarities.
Again, you have emptiness as a quality of the phenomena of experience, in this case
it's the fact that everything is dependently core-arisen.
And as a result, can't be adequately described as either existing, non-existing, both, or
neither.
And then emptiness as a state of mind that's totally free from reliance on views.
And in this case, the first form of emptiness is used as a tool to get to the second one.
In other words, you use the two things about the karmic-devanic core-arisen.
Then you use the fact of the analysis of where suffering comes from, and the main emphasis
is on the fact that there's clinging.
And if you learn to let go of the clinging, then you're free of suffering.
And for Nagarjuna in particular, the clinging there is clinging to views about things based
on whether or not they have an existence.
And then secondly, the conventional level of emptiness functions in its general pattern,
the general pattern of contingency between one part of dependent core-arisen and another.
Because things are dependently, or contingent on other things, they don't have any real
essence of their own.
You can't really say whether they're eternal, whether they're annihilated, whether they're
existing, whether they're non-existing.
And as a result, the sort of the substructure of views has no place to land, or no place
to be assembled into larger views.
As he says, the purpose of this is to get away with all views.
If you hold simply two of you of emptiness, then you're incorrigible, there's no hope
for you.
So you use the conventional level of emptiness as a tool to get to the ultimate level.
As I said, there are parallels.
In some ways, what Nagarjuna is doing, he's taking one or two of the meetings from the
Pali canon and really stressing them without emphasizing others.
The Buddha is using the teaching on the lack of self in things, as a way of letting go
of prying, loosing your clinging towards those things.
And in some cases, he does this by using logical arguments.
In other cases, he does it by just pointing out to you that if you hold on to this thing,
you're going to suffer.
So if it's causing suffering, why hold on?
So what Nagarjuna does is he focuses his emphasis on that issue of sort of taking and clinging
apart through the process of logic and reasoning.
And the specific type of clinging that he focuses on is clinging to views.
So he's taking one or two elements out of the Pali canon and giving them primary importance.
What they have in common is the use of the image of the magic show.
Remember we pointed out earlier that in the canon, the Buddha talks about seeing things
as not having self, not having any real substance, and therefore it's just like a magic show.
So why should you put any personal investment in the illusory things that come up in a magic
show?
And as for Nagarjuna, he points out that once you take apart the idea of inherent existence
or non-existence of both or neither, then the idea is about a rising, passing way of
things.
Any of the views that you may construct about things, these he says are like the cities
of the Gandharvas, like a magic show.
And if you have to know something about Gandharvas in Thai, they're called kontan.
This is one of the lower levels of devas, the kind of the teenagers of the deva world.
They like fast cars, they like sex, and they like music.
And they like to play tricks on people.
And so again, the cities of the Gandharvas are just that.
They're just illusory creations, palaces that trick people.
And so both cases, once you see that something is illusory like this, then the inclination
is to let go, not to put any personal investment in the construction of a view around this
or the construction of attachment around those things.
So for both of them, the image of the magic show gives you an idea of how they view the
emptiness of things or any notions that are built on clinging to things.
It's a magic show.
You want to let go because there's something more substantial in this case, but the more
substantial for both of them is nirvana.
It's interesting that Narayagarjuna makes one comment in his teaching that he's been
talking about dharmas and how dharmas are contingent, but he makes the point that there's
no point where the Buddha ever taught nirvana as a dharma.
It's something outside the whole analysis, outside of these views.
And you look back in the Pali canon and you can find a lot of passages to support him.
You find a few where the Buddha actually talks about nirvana as a dharma, but there are a
lot of other ones where he talks about the end of the letting go of all dharmas.
So keep that image of the magic show in mind because as we progress through a little bit
more of what happened in later centuries, the role of the magic show changes.
The image is capped, but then it's used for a different purpose, has a different valuation
placed on it.
So that's one part of what we're going to cover today.
Before we move on, are there any questions on what I just said?
Is there a point in the recent dharma here?
Dharma here means, in this particular case, it's anything that arises in your experience.
In the Pali canon they use the word dharma in several ways, one it's the Buddha's doctrine,
two it's specific elements of objects that arise and pass away, and they can be objects
of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, or in any internal event.
They can be qualities of mind that arise and pass away, like the five hindrances are dharmas.
So almost any phenomena?
Basically any phenomena that's as it's directly experienced in and of itself without placing
any concepts on top of it.
Reading in the vineyard, you find there's another meaning for dharma, and that's action.
It gives the idea that the things that happen are not so much things happening as their
events happen, or actions taking place, and I think both Nagarjuna and the Pali canon
would share that same view, same use of the term.
I had a couple of questions, one is in terms of Nagarjuna's use of sort of dependent origination
to deconstruct views, I mean outside of the fact that he focuses only on clinging to views
and on logical annihilation of them, does it differ substantially from the Buddha's use
of dependent origination in the Brahmajala Sutta?
Basically he's taking one tool out of the Buddha's toolbox.
So substantially it's similar to that one.
And in terms of the use of ultimate and conventional reality, is that different from the mundane
and the super mundane path?
Very different.
To begin with, the Buddha himself never used the term conventional truth and ultimate truth.
There's one or two passages in the canon where he's obviously taking on views that
he does not normally condone, simply for the sake of an argument, and at the end of those
he will say, well these are times when the tāgata takes on the conventions of the world.
But when the idea was then later on in the time of the Apidāma, once they had decided
that the Buddha really deep down inside felt there was no self, even though that was a
question he refused to answer.
It's like, okay, we know that you're refusing to answer in public, but maybe when you get
behind doors and you might let down whatever hair you have and talk about how there is
no self.
But once they had decided that that was the Buddha's teaching, then they were stuck with
the fact that a lot of passages in the canon he's talking about, there are four kinds of
individuals, there are five kinds of individuals, and so on.
And if there is no self, how could he talk about individuals like this?
And that's when they came up with the idea that there were two separate levels of thought,
levels of language.
So in the Apidāma, when you talk about these levels of language, that's what they are,
the levels of speaking, talking about things.
Now when you're getting into the question of path about the mundane path and the super-mundane
path, that's something different.
That's talking about types of actions and the consequences that they lead to.
Like on the mundane path, you would be virtuous and you'd be generous and do a little bit
of loving-kindness meditation for the sake of coming back and being reborn.
Whereas on the transcendent path, you're actually taken to the dakkhas.
So it's a different kind of distinction.
Okay, let's move on.
As I told you, there were several developments that happened both in and outside of Buddhism
that had an effect on later teachings on emptiness.
We've gone through one strand which is a strand that comes from the Apidāma or the Apidāma
which is kind of an analytical strand.
There's another strand which might be called a narrative strand.
And that focuses on one big issue.
The question is, okay, the Buddha in many of his teachings talks about past lives, future
lives, the whole process of rebirth and indicates in some cases he actually tells stories about
his own past lives to teach lessons in the suttas and in the vinaya.
Two of them are pretty cool stories.
There's one about an ox who can row, what can you say, can plow say a hundred rows in
about five minutes and these are really fast ox.
And the owner wants to show them off to the king.
So he takes the ox to the king one day and the king says, okay, let's do a stuff.
And so the owner starts yelling insults at the ox and saying, okay, you tail us one,
you castrated thing, whatever, let's go.
The ox just stands there.
And of course the man loses face in front of the king and he goes back home and he asks
the ox, why didn't you move?
The ox says, why did you insult me in front of the king?
And so he says, if you promise not to insult me, speak sweetly to me, then I'll do what
you want me to.
So he goes back the next day and he says, oh, beautiful ox, a wonderful ox, please plow
the row and the ox does it really fast, presses the king.
In that particular lifetime the Buddha was the ox and the Dharma lesson there, of course,
speak nicely to people if you want something out of them.
Despite that, well, some people had to teach with stories, come on.
The other great Jataka tell in the video is of Prince Dikabu, and it's quite a long evolved
story, it's almost like a novel, but it comes down to us, there's this king and queen, they're
going to lose their kingdom.
And so they slip out of the kingdom one night as the enemy king is approaching.
And they disguise themselves as beggars and then they go back in to live in the capital
city of the attacking king.
And as long as they're in their disguise they seem to be okay, well, they have a son while
they're disguised.
And they realize that they're living in that capital city, it's a dangerous place and it's
going to be especially dangerous for the son, so they have him go out and stay with friends
out in the countryside, and occasionally he'll come back and forth and visit his parents
in the city.
Well, one day the parents are discovered, and so as they did back in those days they
shaved their heads, they bound their arms behind their back, and they marched them around
the city to the sound of a harsh drum, and they were going to be taken out and drawn
and courted.
What so happens, and on that day that his parents are being marched around the city, Dikabu
decides to come visit his parents, so he comes into the city, and what does he see, his parents
being marched around and ready to be executed.
And so as the father comes near and he sees Dikabu, he says, don't look too near and don't
look too far.
That's it.
And then he gets dragged along and executed.
So Dikabu waits until that night, they placed guards around the place where the bodies were
still lying all drawn and courted.
Human beings can be really nasty, pulling people apart like that.
And so he buys some alcohol and he gets the guards drunk, and when the guards are drunk
then he takes the various pieces of his parents and he puts them in a pile and cremates them.
The king is on his palace roof and he sees, oh, somebody is in favor of these parents.
That means I still have an enemy, if he doesn't know who it is.
Well Dikabu goes off into the jungle and mourns his parents for a while, then he comes back
and he tries to get a job in the stables of the elephants of the king, and he gets the
job looking after the elephants.
And at night one of his jobs is to play the flute for the elephants.
Elephants live well in those days.
And even today, in Thailand, when they find an elephant that they think is, they call
it an albino elephant, simply because it has a little patch of white here and a patch of
white there, these are treated really, really well.
And then Dikabu plays the flute for the elephants.
So the king over here is the flute and he says, this is better than my own flute player.
So he has the young man brought in and he plays the flute for the king in the evening.
And to make the long story short, eventually Dikabu becomes his most trusted advisor.
He gets up in the morning before the king goes to bed after the king at night.
And when the king goes around in his chariot, Dikabu is his charioteer.
Well, there is one day when they are out there with the troops going into the forest
and Dikabu steers the chariot in such a way that the troops go one way, the chariot goes
another way and they are lost.
It's just the two of them out there in the forest and the king says, I'm tired, it's
time I'd like to rest.
And so he lies down, he puts his head in Dikabu's lap and goes to sleep as Dikabu will stand
guard.
Well Dikabu hears, here is my chance, what I've been waiting for.
So he pulls out his sword and as soon as he pulls out his sword, he remembers his father's
words, don't look too near and don't look too far.
He puts his sword back in.
They start slinking some more about this king and what he did to his parents, pulls the
sword out again.
Then he remembers his father's words, puts it back.
He does this three times.
After the third time, the king wakes up on a Friday and says, I just had this horrible
nightmare that this prince, Dikabu, the son of the king and queen that I murdered was
after me.
Dikabu pulls out his sword again, grabs that king by the hair and says, do you know who
I am?
And the king begs for his life.
Dikabu says, no, you give me my life.
And so the two of them vow to protect each other's lives.
And so then they get back on the chariot and go back to the palace.
And the king says to his advisor, suppose we met up with this prince Dikabu, what would
you do?
And some of them say, well, we'd cut off his ears first, the others say, no, we'd cut
off his nose first, then we'd kill him, and the others say, no, we'd cut off his ears
and his nose, then we'd kill him.
And then the king says, okay, this is prince Dikabu standing over here, don't touch him,
don't do anything at all.
And then he turns to Dikabu and says, what did your father mean about this, don't look
too near and don't look too far?
And he says, don't look too far meant don't carry old grudges, and don't look too near
doesn't mean don't be too critical to people right around you.
And so that was what saved him.
And so in that particular life, prince Dikabu was the Buddha, another example of his previous
lifetimes.
Well, these stories got people curious about what was the whole story of the Buddha's
past lives.
And a whole series of tales were put together, many times there were older Indian tales.
And they put together a whole series of stories taken from Indian folktales and other stories
in which the Buddha or some of his famous Arahant disciples become characters in these
stories.
Then the question arose, if you want to be a Buddha rather than an Arahant, what's the
difference in the path?
You've got this chance to be an Arahant, but obviously the world needs more Buddhas.
What's the difference between the Buddha's path and an Arahant's path?
And ultimately the theory that came out was sort of sorting through this collection of
tales that there were certain perfections that were developed in the tales.
And the different Buddha sects that had developed in the centuries after the Buddha passed away
came up with different lists.
The two main lists in the Sarvastivadans, they had six perfections.
In the Theravada, they had ten perfections that were drawn out of the tales.
The ten perfections in the Theravada tradition are these, generosity, virtue, renunciation,
discernment, effort, or persistence, endurance, truth, determination, goodwill and equanimity.
That's the ten.
Then the question is, will these sound an awful lot like the qualities developed by an
Arahant?
There's really not that much difference.
So what's the difference?
And eventually two answers developed.
The first answer was that it was a quantitative difference.
Basically it was the same qualities that an Arahant had to develop, but he had to do
more of them.
Like if an Arahant, you have to give X amount, then the Buddha would have to give three times
that amount.
And then the practical question came up was, okay, suppose you've got this amount of perfection
that a Buddha has to develop, and this amount that an Arahant has to develop, suppose that
you're on the way to becoming a Buddha, and you reach this level, the Arahant's perfection.
What's to stop you from becoming an Arahant?
And the solution there was the vow you made to start out with.
You make this vow, okay, I'm going to become a Buddha.
And that will carry you through.
It takes you past the Arahant level and will carry you up to the Buddha level.
And for a while that seemed to satisfy everybody.
In addition to tales about the Buddha's previous lifetimes, and most of the tales in the Jataka's
concern the Buddha when there was no other Buddha around.
If he even is a lay person in the tale or an animal in the tale, there's never a chance
where the Buddha gets the chance to talk to previous Buddhas, or gets to do anything concerning
previous Buddhas.
He has to develop his professions on his own.
It's a long, arduous task.
It's like reading the Lord of the Rings, and he just keeps working and slugging and slugging
and slugging away, and it's hard stuff, and he has to do it alone a lot.
Sometimes he does it with his friends, but each person has to develop his or her own professions.
That's the pattern of the Jataka's.
Another pattern developed in tales that they call, in Pali, they call Abhadana, A-P-A-D-A-N-A.
And in Sanskrit they call Abhadana, A-V-A-D-A-N-A.
And the basic pattern of these tales is when the Buddha or the around disciples gets to
meet a Buddha in a previous dispensation, and gets to perform a service to that Buddha.
Some of the ones that stick in my mind, the one that really sticks in my mind, is Taranaya.
I understand there's a dharma teacher who's named herself Taranaya, who has been named
Taranaya.
And the original Taranaya was a turtle.
And there's one day when the Buddha of a previous payam is having to walk across the stream,
and it's pretty deep, and this turtle is on the side of the stream, and the turtle volunteers
I'll carry you across.
And so the turtle carries him across, and as a result of that good deed, then he becomes
a deva, and from becoming a deva, and when he comes down to the human realm, he's either
a king or an emperor, and eventually becomes an Arahant named Taranaya, which means one
to carry across.
That's the typical pattern of these.
The Abhadana stories had a theory that there was such a thing as a Buddha field.
Now the concept of a Buddha field developed over time.
The original meaning of a Buddha field was kind of like the magnetic field around a Buddha,
or literally it was a field in which you planted seeds of merit.
The idea being that giving to an ordinary person is like planting a seed in ordinary
soil.
But if you put that seed in the soil of a Buddha field, you get lots of returns, a really
good investment.
And they were very clear about using this analogy, the investment and the return.
And in the Abhadanas, the pattern is this, you plant the seed of merit, and if you want
that seed of merit to have a specific result, then you make a vow as well, saying, I want
this to go either to becoming a Buddha, or to becoming an Arahant, with a particular
talent.
And some of the stories are really cool.
You read these stories, and part of the theory of the Buddha field is that this field that
surrounds the Buddha does not only surround him as a person, if the Buddha passes away,
his relics have the same field.
And where are his relics now?
They're in monuments.
They're what they call stupas or jetties in the monasteries.
And you can imagine who was writing these stories about planting seeds of merit in the
field surrounding the Buddha relics.
My personal feeling about the Abhadanas, and I think it was pretty sleazy, sleazy body
of literature here.
I'm just really trying to push people into making a lot of merit by giving a lot.
Now they're kind enough to say that if you don't have any money to give, all you have
to do is, you know, bound to the Buddha, that counts as an act of service.
But notice the word service here, that's the word that's used all the way through.
The Pali term is atigara.
And this becomes the new paradigm for what Buddhist practice is all about.
You perform service either to the Buddha personally or to his relics, and that's what sets you
on the road to enlightenment.
And the nature of the donation is going to determine special qualities that you have
along the path.
There's one story about a man who all he has is just three red lotuses, and so he offers
these to the Buddha.
And as a result, whenever he's born as a deva, he gets a red palace, and the deva maidens
wear red garments and everything.
So it's either the thing that you give, there's another case where one man finds the previous
Buddha meditating under a tree, and so he sets lanterns around him for seven days and seven
nights to keep the place really bright.
And as a result, in his current lifetime, he was born as the monk Anuruta, who had the
special talent of having the best eyesight, divine eyesight.
You could see devas for universe after universe.
Am I slipping again?
My favorite stories are two, because in most of them the pattern is you make the donation,
you make your vow, the vow is confirmed, and then you have this really easy ride through
some sara until you decide, okay, I've had enough, and then you suddenly get this feeling
of sanghwega, okay, I'm out of here, enough.
The main emphasis here is not so much on sanghwega as basada, the feeling of conviction, the
confidence in the Buddha.
That's what carries you through all those many, many realms.
At any rate, there are two stories where the ride is a little bumpy, and they're my favorite
stories.
One, there was a man in the time of, I've forgotten the name of the particular Buddha,
who hears that Buddha praising one of his students as being the Arahant disciple with
a nicest voice.
Everyone hears his voice, and they just fall in love with his voice, he says, I want that
when I become an Arahant, okay.
So he goes and he makes his vow to the Buddha, the Buddha confirms it, and on top of that,
for the rest of his life, he feeds seven Dharma teaching monks every week, and who do you
think wrote these texts?
It's the Dharma teaching monks.
At any rate, he does get to be reborn as a bird in one of his lifetimes.
And this bird sees the Buddha of that day on going for alms, and he's just so struck
by how beautiful the Buddha is that he flies up and he plucks a mango, and he comes fluttering
up in front of the Buddha, holding this mango.
And so the Buddha puts out his ball, and the bird lands on the edge of the ball and drops
the mango into the ball, and then sings this beautiful song in praise of the Buddha.
Okay, it's because of that song that he's going to get to be an Arahant with a really
nice voice.
However, there's a hitch.
In one of his later lifetimes, he becomes a king, and there's another Buddha that's
been just passed away, and the people are so impressed with that Buddha that they decide
they want to build a stupa that has no limit on how high it's going to be.
And we're talking back in the days when if anybody was going to build anything really
high, they had to get permission from the king.
You didn't want to outbuild the king, right?
And so the king hears about this, and he thinks, you know, a stupa with no limit in its height,
that's pretty wasteful.
So he puts a limit on its height.
Well, I finally, after many, many lifetimes, he gets to be reborn as the Arahant, Lukudayan,
Lakudayan, excuse me.
And Lakudayan does have that beautiful voice that he wanted, but because of the jetty,
the stupa with the limit, he's born as a dwarf.
So you have to be careful.
The other story that I really like is the one of Mahagasipa's wife.
And in the time of one of the Buddhas, she, Mahagasipa's her husband, and he builds this
beautiful stupa in honor of that particular Buddha, and he makes his vow that he wants
to become an Arahant.
And so she decides she's going to make a vow and become an Arahant as well.
What she does is she takes gold bricks and she covers the stupa that he built.
So every lifetime after this, and what's interesting about the Abhidhana or Abhidhana literature
is that whatever sex you are when you make your vow, you hold that sex all the way through.
If you're a woman when you make the vow, you're going to become a woman Arahant.
If you're a man when you make the vow, you become a man Arahant.
Well, because of those beautiful gold bricks that she covered the stupa with, she's gorgeous
every lifetime.
And after that, there's really good looking him.
Everybody who sees her just falls for him.
But there's one particular lifetime in which she makes a little slip, and this is the time
of a particular private Buddha who, one day, he's out for alms, and in those days, the
monk was coming along the street, you would take his bowl, and you would take it into
your house, and you would fill it with food, and then you'd come out and you'd hand it
back to the monk.
Well, she takes his bowl and she puts it into the house, takes it into the house, and her
stepsister, or excuse me, her sister-in-law makes some snide comment about Arahant.
She's wasting the family fortune on food for these monks.
And so she, in a fit of peak, takes mud and puts it in the bowl, and then she realizes
what she's done.
So she pours the mud out, and she perfumes it, and washes it out, puts perfumes in it
bowl, and puts a nice food in it, and then hands it to the private Buddha.
Well you don't mess with private Buddhas even for a moment, okay?
The next lifetime she's born, and she's still beautiful because of those gold bricks, but
because of the mud, she has this foul body order that nobody can stand.
So fat good that her good looks do her.
So finally, in order to overcome this, she takes perfumes, and she bathes a stupa in
the perfumes, and that takes care of her body order.
So you can imagine what kind of motive is going behind these stories.
Let's get donations in for our stupas here.
Okay so this presents the same picture that, okay, there's a similar series of tales about
the Buddha, making his initial act of service to the Buddhas of the past and the future.
This is the idea that the Buddha field is not just so much a field of merit around the
Buddha, but there are actually different universes where there are Buddha fields.
And so what this, our Buddha to be, does is that he invites all the Buddhas past and future,
excuse me, past and present, from all the Buddha fields and all the universes to this
imaginary palace that he's now, it's kind of an imaginary donation, it's like mandala
offerings in Tibetan Buddhism.
He builds this gorgeous palace made out of precious substances in his imagination, and
invites all the Buddhas from all the Buddha fields, feeds them, lets them rest for a while,
then after they've rested, then some of them meditate, some of them teach the Dharma, and
then they all go home.
So the pattern here is, again, an act of service to Buddhas of the past.
Through that act of service, you get onto the path of awakening, and the type of service
you give and the type of value you make determine what your awakening is going to, the special
features of your awakening are going to be like.
Okay, people who were more and more interested in the idea of becoming Buddhas, eventually
however, found a problem.
You start practicing along the path of meditation, and as I said, the previous idea was that
it's simply a quantitatively different path.
Okay, you make your vow, you practice, and all of a sudden, boom, you're an Arahant.
Now from the point of view of someone who wants to become a Buddha, that's failure.
You've slipped off your path.
Of course, we nowadays would say, I should be so lucky, but for people who wanted to
become Buddhas, and they said, something's got to be done here.
And so they came up with several ideas.
One was that you can't take the early canons as a guide to become a Buddha.
The early canons were compiled by Arahants.
What would they know of a Buddha's path?
There must be other sources, and they started inducing states of concentration where they
began to have visions of the Buddhas in these other Buddha fields, who would give them advice
on what kind of path to take.
They would also start inducing what we nowadays would call channeled speech.
These Buddhas would come and they would speak through you and tell you what the particular
path would be of a Buddha.
And as you might imagine, all kinds of different answers started coming up.
But one of the main issues was that, okay, it's not a quantitative difference in the
professions, it's qualitative.
The path of the Buddha requires different types of perfections than the Arahant's path.
And in particular, the main difference is in the perfection of discernment.
You can see where we're heading.
We're heading to the perfection of discernment, the perfection of wisdom, literature, Varshan
Abharmita.
And for the Varshan Abharmita, the ideal state of discernment for the Buddha to be, or Bodhisattva,
is this.
You induce a thought of bodhichitta, which is your first intention for awakening.
And that bodhichitta constitutes a state of what they call no-thoughtness.
The mind has no thoughts at all.
It's a state of pure, non-dual consciousness.
And because there are no thoughts in this state of consciousness, there can be no thought
of existence, no thought of non-existence, there can be no thought of dharmas arising
or passing away.
It's just this, in fact, the idea that dharmas arise and pass away, that for them that becomes
simply words.
The actual reality behind these words, which they say are all mirages, dreams, illusions,
is what they call suchness, which is the same non-dual state of consciousness that underlies
everything.
There's no differentiation.
For them, concepts have reality only as words and names.
So you try to get your mind into the state, and you try to course in this state, they
call it, which means you should live in this state at all times.
Now, the way this state is to be induced in the early brajna-bharmita, such as it doesn't
talk about emptiness at all, none of this Nagarjuna stuff, okay?
In fact, Nagarjuna probably wasn't even alive by that time.
They try to induce the state through a state of devotion.
You take the state, the text in which the brajna-bharmita was written, and you bow down
to it.
It comprises large passages in the brajna-bharmita, especially the very first version, which is
called the ashta, which is short for it has 8,000 lines.
Is that you develop a state of intense devotion towards this idea of suchness, the idea of
not no thoughtness, and try to, through the power of your devotion and the single-mindedness
of your devotion, induce that state of not thoughtness in yourself as well.
So far, nothing about emptiness.
Emptiness comes in a later version of the brajna-bharmita, which is the version in 25,000
lines.
Excuse me, let me back up a minute while we're still with the ashta.
For them, the idea of this having the mind in the state of no thoughtness was really
ideal because, one, if you stay in this state, you're not going to become an arahant for
sure.
Because arahants have to analyze the arising and passing way of dharmas, and this way there's
no dharmas arising or passing way, there's nothing to analyze, you just stay there in
that pure state of no thoughtness.
And yet, because that is the true perfection of wisdom, everything you do while your mind
is in that state multiplies the merit astronomically, and it really leverages it up to a way higher
level.
Because the whole point of being a bodhisattva is that you don't want to gain awakening in
this lifetime.
You've got to work on the merit, you've got to work on all the qualities and the perfections
you have to develop, so that they will yield awakening in a future lifetime when there's
no Buddha, so you can become a Buddha, and then carry on the teaching.
So in the ashta, the 8,000 line version, what they call skill in means, or what we call
tactical skill, is precisely this, that you have a state of pure mind, pure perception,
or pure discernment, which on the one hand doesn't let you become an arahant, on the
other hand it really helps you become a bodhisattva really fast, so you can get on with your work.
A later version of the brahmana brahmata, called the 25,000 line version, redefines the perfection
of discernment.
It defines it as emptiness, and it says, emptiness means two things, it means the state of what
they call the non-arising of dharmas, which is picked up from the 8,000 line version,
and it means the lack of any self-nature in dharmas, an idea picked up from Bhagavad-gita.
This one, he's got one of those devices, is that not working?
How long ago did it go out?
Okay, I'd hate to think I was talking for this 40 minutes here.
This was that, okay.
The perfection of wisdom with the perfection of discernment in 25,000 lines.
It's kind of like taking the 8,000 line version, suppose the 8,000 line version is a ham and
cheese sandwich, and you open it up and you add more layers, and you put it back together
again.
So you've got bits and pieces from the 8,000 line version, but a lot of new stuff interleaved
in between the layers here.
The 25,000 line version says perfection of discernment is emptiness, and emptiness is
the non-arising of dharmas and the lack of self-nature in dharmas.
That's all it explains.
This creates a problem, because those two teachings, the non-arising of dharmas from
the 8,000 line version, and the lack of self-nature, which you picked up from Bhagavad-gita, are
two very different teachings.
The 8,000 line version, the non-arising of dharmas, is a state that you get into through
intense devotion, intense sort of single-mindedness determination that you're going to stay on
the bodhisattva path, and not allowing yourself to think about dharmas at all, whereas the
teaching on emptiness requires that you do an awful lot of analytical thinking to get
to the state of no views.
Two, the teaching on the non-self-nature, or the lack of self-nature in dharmas depends
on observing the fact that dharmas actually arise and pass away, whereas in the teaching
on the non-arising of dharmas, it says that the name tells you dharmas don't arise, they
don't pass away.
It's all just an illusion.
So you've got two very different teachings here, and the problem is how you're going
to put the two of them together.
One of the solutions came in a whole series of treatises that were written with Nargajna's
name on them, to sort of solve the problem, in which they said, we're talking about two
levels of reality here.
The teachings on dharmas without any known nature arising and passing away, that's dharmas
on the conventional level.
But on the ultimate level, dharmas don't really arise and pass away.
So they take the idea of the two truths, and they define it, and they put these two different
teachings on emptiness together in that particular way.
The problem here is, is the teaching on the non-arising of dharmas is a teaching that's
supposed to describe.
It's a view of the true nature of reality.
Nargajna would never accept that as an ultimate truth.
Ultimate truth doesn't have views, remember?
So you've got another problem, based on these writings.
