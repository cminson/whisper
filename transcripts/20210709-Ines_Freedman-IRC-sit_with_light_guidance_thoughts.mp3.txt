 When we meditate, most of us like feeling calm and not having a lot of thoughts running around the mind. Because of that, it's easy to judge thinking in the meditation as being undesirable. To think of a sitting as a good sit only when the mind is quiet. But we all think, we're already thinking, what we want to do is make our thoughts more conscious and turn them towards what's useful. For instance, we can appreciate that it's a thought that tells us to go back to the breath or that recognizes what we're experiencing. In practice, sometimes the mind is calm. Sometimes the mind is busy. It doesn't matter. What matters is that we're aware of what's going on, that we value being mindful of a busy mind as much as being mindful of the quiet mind. When thinking is slow, it's usually skillful to keep thinking in the background. When thoughts are busier, it can be helpful to turn the attention to the process of thinking instead of getting involved in the thoughts. And what I mean by that, you might notice how the body feels when we're thinking a lot. For example, you might feel a buzzing in the head or a speeding up of the body. We can also label thinking if it helps us stay mindful and not get lost in it. Everything in the mind, thinking, thinking, or maybe you were planning, planning, or worrying, worrying. A thought that says I'm a bad meditator over and over again is a thought we can recognize is not helpful and let it go. Judging, judging. Or thoughts can be sentences, it can be words, images, or just knowing. So just notice it however your thoughts might be. So take a few breaths, deep breaths now. Breathing a little more with each exhale. And bring your attention to the breath and allow it to rest there. Whatever the breath wants to be. In the same way that we've been paying attention to the body, expand your field of attention to also include any compelling thoughts that arise. If thoughts are in the background, let them stay there. Just stay with the breath. If you notice you're thinking a lot or that you've become lost in thought, meet the thoughts with a non-judgmental awareness until the thought disappears. Even the moment we become mindful of thinking, the thought disappears. And just let it go. Just return to the breath. But sometimes the thoughts persist. So stay mindful of them while they continue. If needed, label it thinking, thinking. Notice that all thoughts are ephemeral, they arise and pass away. If thoughts become compelling, turn your attention to the process of thinking. Try not to get caught up in the story. Notice the thoughts come and go like a train going by. Just don't get on the train. But if you do, there's no need to judge that. When you notice, get off the train and just come back to the breath. Keep it simple. Don't look for thoughts. Just notice if you are thinking, if you're caught in thinking. Any time the instructions, if they feel confusing, it's skillful to just return to the breath, get settled again. Thank you. Thank you. I applaud. you you you you you you for these last few minutes. Stay close to your breath. Resting in your breath. Resting the full length of the breath. Resting in your breath. Resting in your breath. Resting in your breath. Resting in your breath. Resting in your breath. Resting in your breath.
