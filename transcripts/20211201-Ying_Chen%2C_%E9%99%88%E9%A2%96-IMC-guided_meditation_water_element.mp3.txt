 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDarma.org. Good morning everyone and good day. Welcome to our 7 a.m. sit and Darmette. Good morning everyone. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. So we'll get started momentarily. Yeah, feel free to just check in with the with the Sangha, maybe say hi and and say to yourself, since you're here a couple of minutes earlier. Yeah, thank you for those who let me know about the sound. So we'll begin momentarily just for now. I wanted to invite you to consider, you know, coming to your sitting cushion sitting chair. Maybe just as if you're coming to a quiet temple. I began to maybe invoke a sense of care, gentleness as you sit down. So we'll begin testing a few moments. Okay. So we'll begin this morning with the arriving sequence. Maybe imagine yourself arriving at a quiet temple, a temple of this body. Allow some and gentle and set up this as you settle in into the space. I remember going to the temples in Kudou, Japan. As you're walking into the temple, almost like a tiptoe. Quiet here. Arriving here. Have a little care. Care for this body. The space it's in. Taking your seat. Right here and now. Temporarily we can leave behind. Any thoughts about the future and the past? Arriving here in this moment. In the sense of arriving, maybe expressed as bringing mindfulness front and center. Becoming present. Available. Available to the sound, sound of my voice. And being sound. Being available to the movements of the breath. Without sense of the sitting posture. Whatever the posture you may be taking. Aligning. Aligning from ground up. Being supported by earth. Also being supported by the ground of the wholesome intention. My teachers sometimes use this term. St resting on the ground of a wholesome intention. Aligning with our aspirations. And our values. Integrating within. You have a sense that you've arrived here, home, in this body. The temple of this body. Inviting the felt sense of the earth element to come in. However, it may be for you. You're feeling the pelvic bones making contact with the earth. Right underneath of us. The hardness of the teeth. The weight of the shoulders, the arms. Available to the experience of the earth element. Right here. In this earthy body. Sitting like a redwood. Uplifted. Maybe a sense of stability. Steadiness. The earth element is stable. You feel a hint of stillness. You feel a hint of stillness. Letting go of the tendencies to try to figure it out. Let the body. Let the body does what it does. Body knows. Body feels. Mindfulness of the body in and of the body itself. Not in the head. With the steadiness and stillness. In the earth element as a backdrop. Make ourselves available to the movements. The contrasting movements of the wind element. Air. She in Chinese. Movements of the breath. Rising and falling of the belly. Expansion and contraction of the torso. Receiving the felt sense of the wind element. Blowing through the whole body. Maybe you feel vibrations tingling. Wing to moves. The felt sense of the stillness. May still be in the backdrop or the foreground of your experience. As you experience the movements of the air element. As you experience the movement of the body. Thank you. You may feel a lightness as you're breathing in and out. There may be a vivid sense of a vitality. And stillness and movements can coexist right here in your experience. I expand to include the felt sense of a water element today. Notice the moisture inside the mouth. Maybe in the palm. Maybe moisture in the eyes. Water takes a shape in whatever the container they're in. You're sitting, the water element takes the shape of sitting. Lying down. Water elements take the shape of lying down. Loo it. Permeating. Wrap the body. The body is still, quiet. It may feel like we're sitting in a quiet lake. I'm moving. The body has energetic, wavy experiences. You may feel as if there are ripples and waves in the body. For the rest of the meditation, feel free to stay with whatever may be prominent for you. The arriving sequence, earth element, linked element, or water element are the combinations of all of this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Let the body speak for itself. Feel into the body, sensing into it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The temple of this body provides shelter and protection from getting caught in hindrances, grasping aversion and delusion. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This last few moments of sitting together, we offer an inward bowing to the temple of this body and this mind, this heart. this heart for offering shelter, protection, and safety. Safeguarding inner integrity, inner virtue, inner goodness.
