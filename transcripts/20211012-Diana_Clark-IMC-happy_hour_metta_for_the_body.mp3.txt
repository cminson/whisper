 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. And today I'd like to do a little, a practice that isn't the usual way that I teach lovingkindness. And it's a way that really logically doesn't make sense. But it doesn't always have to make sense, right? There's maybe such a way that we use our hearts and our bodies and minds that just are, I don't know, supports greater opening, support softening. It's a way different than just like a clear understanding, a way different than just knowing something and therefore it, there's this new understanding allows something new to happen. Maybe another way to say it is that we don't always have to understand with the thinking mind. To be sure I'm a big fan of the thinking mind, right? I spend my days thinking and have, you know, I've had a professional life where I have, how I spent my time. But sometimes we forget that there are other ways so we can fall into the trap to think that that it's, that thinking and figuring it out and solving problems is the only way. Maybe it's the most common, the most obvious, the most familiar, but not necessarily the only way. And so I just have this as a little introduction as, as I'd like for us to do some loving kindness for ourselves in a way in which we, it's more like a gesture somehow of kindness. And not so much ourselves as an entity, but ourselves as a human body that has parts and just sending loving kindness to different parts. It's easier than just this whole entity that we call a self that has a whole story and a history and, but what is it like to just some loving kindness to arms and legs, for example. We can get tangled up and like wait this doesn't quite make sense, or we can just open to it and allow the heart to spread kindness in this particular way. So, maybe with that as an introduction will lead us in a meditation practice. It's a little bit different than when I'm most often doing taking a meditation posture, a posture that has some uprightness, although literally or figuratively, but that demonstrates our intention to meditate but in such a way that has openness and softness so not rigid, not stiff. I like this expression to sit and know you're sitting. So in a global way. Feel connected to what you're sitting on. Feel the posture, posture, making any adjustments. And then bringing going to do a body scan with loving kindness to bring in our attention to different areas of the body and bringing some warmth and kindness. May the top of the head. Be happy. In the top of the head. No peace. May the area around the eyes. Be happy. May the area around the eyes. No peace. May the area around the mouth. The jaw. Be happy. The area around the mouth. The jaw.

May the left lower leg. No peace. May the left foot be happy. May the left foot be happy. Now an invitation for you to do a body scan with loving kindness at your own pace. Maybe using different words. Body part by body part. Can we extend more of kindness? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe there's particular part of the body. Lingering there, perhaps. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And if you lose track. Where you are in the body scan. Perfectly fine. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe including. May my heart. Be happy. May my mind be happy. May my mind know peace. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. way in which our doing loving kindness body scans is a way of caring for ourselves, taking care of ourselves. Maybe there are parts of the body that we don't really connect with, aren't so aware of. Maybe this is some kind of warm hearted greeting. Hello right upper arm. Hello left lower leg. How are you? How are you? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe slowing down. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe the breath gets connected with this wish for happiness and peace. Maybe breathing into different parts of the body. Breaths that carries warmth and kindness and care. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So welcome back. Welcome back, everybody. Somebody have a comment or a question or something they'd like to share. So I know sometimes you have said that like expressing gratitude is sort of an easier way than expressing love. Right. And I found myself in this practice, right, there was a lot of gratitude going out to my various body parts. And I think that's what I was thinking about. I mean, it didn't feel like I was copping out, if you will. I mean, it felt loving gratitude or something like that. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are. Right. I think the context you said, you know, gratitude might be, you know, like was like a loving kindness light or something like that. So I'll stop talking. Well, let me ask you, how did it feel? Did you feel like what was your experience? It felt warm and caring. You know, I mean, I mean, I you know, I you know, thanks my eyes for seeing despite my vision problem and wish them well, you know, thank my teeth for all the food I've gotten from them, you know. I mean, I mean, it was it was nice. Great. Okay. There we go. That's what we're going for. Excellent. Right. So gratitude feels like a way in. Let's let's do it. Great. Thank you, Neil. Thank you. Jerry. I wondered, we were talking at the end about spaciousness and for those of us on the East Coast in my group, we were commenting about how nice it is for us on the East Coast. We're about to ready to go to bed. And this body scan in particular took us almost into this space for many parts. Like I always focus perhaps on the organ of my mind or my brain and my heart intrusion of my job. So when you started with, you know, my job is safe. I thought, oh, hey, John, I haven't paid attention to him. Maybe there's a problem I would be. Maybe it's just like paying attention. So by the time I I was in La La Land, I think before I got down to my legs and I was like, oh, what a wonderful place to go before I go to sleep. So I was just wondering if that's the spaciousness that you're talking about. So thank you. Yeah. There's a number of different ways you might understand spaciousness. And one is just as you described it, where there's less this pressure of self and pressure of like having to get things done, that type of thing. But another way to understand the kind of this spaciousness is like sometimes when we're like bringing attention like to the right upper arm and the right lower arm. And then they're just there's just like a sense of this anatomical region. And it just was just that part of the arm and the part, the fact that it's connected to the shoulder and is next to the torso kind of goes away. And instead, it's just this portion of the arm. And so in that way, the body parts kind of have their own existence and their relationship to the other body parts not so important for what we're doing right now. And so that's another way kind of spaciousness is that the body itself can feel big and in some kind of way. And I don't was it was that is that helpful. Jerry you're muted now. Very helpful in fact I am a thank you. Thank you. It's spaciousness at many different levels. Yeah. Which is lovely it's, it's expensive and caring and warm. And expensive and you. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. And I think if this is a lovely way to go to sleep to to kind of help with so really can be a really nice way. Okay, well, it's two minutes after the hour. So just be so much appreciation for those of you who are showing up and exploring all these different practices it's fantastic. It's just really great that we're kind of like practicing together and it's foreign these together so if you'd like you can unmute, and we'll say goodbye. Goodbye. Bye Jerry. Bye. Bye everyone.
