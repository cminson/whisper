 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So one of the central aspect of doing mindfulness practice, practicing meditation, is attention. And there's a wonderful verb, activity, associated with attention that I just really love that we use in kind of common English. We say sometimes a giving attention. We give attention to something. And so I think that for much of my life, I just took that word, that expression, to mean, you know, the same as pay attention, which seems like a strange word concept to me. But to give attention has the idea of giving, of generosity, an offering that we make. And what if your attention was a worthy gift? What if attention is an act of generosity that we do with attention to ourselves? The attention is so precious, so valuable, that when we offer it to ourselves, offer it to the world, it has some of the wonderful rebound effects of generosity. But when we're generous, when you're a host for someone, that part of the delight of it is the kind of delightful giving away or putting aside some kind of self-preoccupation, self-concern. If the Dalai Lama came to your house for tea and you knew he was coming, you would probably try to be a good host. And if you had a favorite chair that's your chair, you would probably let the Dalai Lama sit in that chair. If you had just the last tea that you were the favorite tea that you want to keep for a special occasion for yourself, but Dalai Lama comes here, I have my best tea. And there's certain kind of putting aside self-concern, self-preoccupation. At the same time as asserting oneself in a certain wonderful way in giving, in an act of generosity, when we bring attention to ourselves or bring attention to anything. So perhaps for today, when we sit to meditate, you might want to consider a way of engaging your attention that feels more like a gift than a debt that you're paying for, paying attention. More like an act of generosity that's freeing in the giving. Here, have this. And it just feels so good to let go, to open up. Here, have this. Here, have this attention. And then see what happens. And do it again. And do it again. Generous with your attention. So sitting in an alert meditation posture. And perhaps with your eyes closed or not, you can allow for a gentling of your inner life. A calming of your body. A calming of your mind. And every moment that you are attentive for anything you're doing while you're meditating, the attention part of it. See if there can be a giving, a generosity. So in attending to taking a few deep breaths at the beginning, an act of generosity to yourself to feel, be present for those deep breaths. If you relax on the exhale, being present for the relaxation is the gift. Letting your breathing return to normal. Continuing to maybe relax on the exhale or the attention given to relax and the attention given to feel the relaxation or gifts you give yourself. And then do settle into your breathing. Settle into the breathing body, your body that's breathing. And in what way can you let it be a gift, an act of generosity to offer attention to this body that's breathing. The breathing body has been serving you for years and years, keeping you alive. And now you offer your attention back. The generosity that can't be a duty, can't be a strain, can't be a forceful or aggressive, an attention that feels generous, open, allowing, respectful, giving attention, offering attention moment by moment, just now to what's here. So you can say, Hi,..............................................................................................................
