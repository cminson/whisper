Do a sound check. Sound is okay.
Great. Good morning everyone. Good morning. Good morning to folks here and good afternoon and evening and whatever time zone is.
For the folks who are joining us online. Hello. Hi. Hello Internet.
Hello Sangha here at IMC. Hi.
It's kind of fun to feel that we're being joined. Right? You were sitting here and you joined from various places in the world.
It's quite sweet. Quite sweet. Yeah.
So, let's begin meditating together.
I'll offer some light guidance to help us settle and arrive.
And yeah. So, arriving. Arriving in this body in this moment in time.
Arriving in this moment of our journey.
Arriving with a receptive stance. Ah, it's like this right now. Hello body. Hello mind. Hello heart.
And allowing awareness or knowing to greet, to greet the body.
Embodiment so important. The first establishment of mindfulness.
The body.
The body.
And letting the breath, the sensations of the breath within the body. Wherever they are experienced, however they are experienced.
To be received. To be received. To be received.
A receptive stance. See how that might feel different.
From an achievement stance, a receptive stance. A receptive stance that receives the breath, receives the body.
And letting the heart, the body and the mind soften.
And letting the heart, the body and the mind soften. Soften into a receptive stance. Receptive awareness.
Receptive. Receiving this moment. Not reaching out for the next one. Not reaching out for the past, but receiving this. Just this.
Receiving this. Fully. Wholeheartedly.
Fully.
Fully.
Notice what happens when you shift, when your mind shifts its stance.
From doing, getting, going out. To get, do, think, problem solve. Or even within the body. From the control tower. Going to the breath in the body.
No, what if? Ah, you have this sense of exhalation in the body. Relaxing, softening, receiving.
Receiving experience. Knowing. Experience with a receptive stance. Experiment for yourself. How might this be different? How might this shift?
Open something up for you in this practice.
Soften into a receptive stance.

Witness sitting here in this moment.
Such grace.

Such grace.
Such grace.
Such grace.
Is the heart, is the heart, is the mind tightening, clenching around something in the body, in the mind, a thought, an emotion?
Can we soften if that is the case?
Soften our body if there is tightness, tension.
Soften our perspective, it's okay, it's okay.
Soften our heart.
Let there be grace of knowing, simply knowing.
Being aware without judgment, without entanglement, without wanting to fix it or push it away.
Receptive, wholehearted, embodied stance of knowing.
What does it feel for you, this stance?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
What does it feel for you?
And as we turn to bring this sit to a close,
appreciating ourselves for having showed up and letting go of any judgment or regret.
It didn't work out this way or self-judgment or distractions or sleepiness or whatever might have arisen.
Let go of all of that if there is any.
No attachment to outcome. You've done your best.
You've showed up as best as you were able to,
given all the causes and conditions that came before.
So appreciating, appreciating yourself.
Your engagement, your effort to cultivate calm awareness, wisdom, kindness.
And this can be a moment of kindness towards yourself.
An appreciation for yourself and the community.
And trusting there is co-created goodness here in our practice together.
Trust there is goodness, so much goodness.
And practicing generosity, sharing this goodness with goodwill with all beings everywhere.
May my practice, may my wholeheartedness, without attachment to outcome,
may my practice, our practice, support be a cause and condition for my own freedom.
For all of our awakenings and awakening, freedom of all beings everywhere.
May all beings be free. May all beings be happy.
