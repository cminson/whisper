The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So tonight I would like to simply kind of immerse ourselves in loving
kindness, metta, metta meditation. So we don't want to give too many words
tonight beforehand so that we can a real immersive loving kindness practice.
And if you are new tonight or new to metta practice, don't don't be afraid,
we'll go through the meditation. And those of you who are very familiar with the
practice, maybe nice to just let yourself be guided. And to start us off, I have a
quote from Sharon Salzberg, and then we'll start the practice. Sharon says,
metta is the ability to embrace all parts of ourselves, as well as all parts of
the world. Practicing metta illuminates our inner integrity, because it
relieves us of the need to deny different aspects of ourselves. We can open
to everything with the healing force of love. And quote. So let's settle in and
open to everything with the healing force of love, like Sharon says. And it's
often very helpful to just tune into the body first, and tune into your posture,
how does the body feel right now in this posture. For most of us, that's probably
the sitting posture. You can make some adjustments to the posture if needed, so
that we're sitting in a way that is relaxed, also alert. And for the metta
practice, we don't have to like be in a super strict, like formal meditation
posture. Some relaxation can be helpful. We sit in a way that the body is not
experiencing too much discomfort. And sometimes that even means that laying
down might be the best option for us, for standing. Because it's hard to
generate this loving kindness if we're experiencing a lot of discomfort. So a
comfortable posture is very handy, useful. Tune into the rest of the body's
feeling like right now. Maybe there's some tension in the body, certain body
parts. And if any jump out to you, you can start the kindness then right here,
right now, for this body part. Maybe tell it it's okay. It's okay to be not so
comfortable. The body part can't really help it. It's just there doing its
thing.
You can look at different body parts that hold tension.
And tell all of them that it's okay.
Body parts that have some discomfort or pain, maybe.
Feel complete with that. Tune into the overall sense of the body, sitting here
or laying here. Maybe let the body know that you appreciate it. It's carrying you
around everywhere.
Some kindness for the body.
You can tune into the area of the heart, the heart center in the middle of the
chest. Be aware what it's like in the area right now. Maybe there's some openness
or warmth, radiance. Maybe it's not so open. Maybe it's more closed. Maybe it feels
a bit tight. Maybe you don't feel much at all in the area.
Whatever you experience there, you can also bring kindness to that experience.
So that is okay. Just the way it is. It doesn't have to change. It doesn't have to
be anything else. It's okay just as it is. From this heart area, we'll be sending
out wishes for certain beings. We'll use some phrases. We silently repeat who sent
out those wishes. We'll start with the being called the benefactor. The
benefactor can be someone who has supported us on our journey through life but
it's someone who is supporting us now or can be someone from decades ago. Someone
who really has our best interest in mind. We can really trust. It can be a teacher,
coach, encore-owned. It can even be a pet. If you have a being in mind, a
benefactor, then the direct cause for love and kindness to arise is to see the
good in the person or the being. So the picture is being tuned into the goodness,
the wholesomeness of this being. Maybe you can see the good qualities that this
being has, ways they've helped you or supported you, their kindness or
compassion. Now we can start with the phrases from this place of seeing the
goodness. The first phrase is may you be safe. From our heart area we can send this
phrase out to the benefactor. Maybe we see the benefactor in front of us. It's a
visual image. Maybe we use the name of the benefactor or felt sense of the
presence of the benefactor. Whatever works for you in sending this phrase may you be safe.
You can silently for yourself repeat the phrase may you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be at ease.
See if you can really connect to the meaning of the words. May you be at ease.
Send the switch from your heart towards the benefactor.
Let go of the benefactor. We can bring to mind a friend, a dear friend.
Also for this friend we can see their good qualities, their wholesomeness.
What do you particularly appreciate about this friend? The goodness in this person
being. Sometimes just thinking about the goodness of the being already opens our heart, makes
the meta flow out towards the being. It doesn't have to be like this, but it can
happen sometimes. From this place of seeing the goodness you can send the
phrases to the friend. May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be at ease.
May you be healthy.
May you be at ease.
If our wishes don't necessarily have to come true, what we're doing is cultivating our
own hearts, cultivating our capacity for kindness, making our heart bigger and stronger, opening
our hearts, but genuinely wishing for these beings to be healthy. For this friend in this
case, may you be at ease.
So we can let go of any results.
Now that it's about our intention to cultivate this kindness towards these beings, sometimes
we don't really feel that much kindness. Practice might feel a bit dry. It might even feel the
opposite of meta kindness coming up. When it is all part of the practice, meta will bring
up things that are not in line with it yet, that are still in the way so to speak. I could
say it's a purification practice. It will bring up things to be purified, which could
also be anger, resentment, jealousy, whatever it is.
In that case, we can switch to a different being that is easier for us, or we can do
some vipassana inside meditation for a little bit, until we feel we can proceed again. We'll
just observe whatever comes up for us for a little bit, give it some space. You can go
to a neutral person or being. Being for, oh, you don't really feel anything super positive,
either super negative. That's kind of neutral. Someone you don't really know as well. Maybe
it's someone you sometimes see in your neighborhood, or someone you see in the store sometimes.
It would be a little harder to see the goodness in this person or being, because we don't
know them. Maybe you've seen them smile, or you've seen them taking care of their dog
or their child. Maybe you've seen them taking care of customers or something else that showed
some good quality of this being. From this place of seeing the goodness, I can wish this
being a phrase. May you be safe.
Thank you.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May this neutral being be healthy.
May this neutral being be healthy.
May you be at ease.
May you be at ease.
May this neutral being be healthy.
There's no need to strain, no need to make anything happen.
There's not a practice B the way it is.
Whatever is present for you in this moment.
However much a little meta you feel in your heart.
Whatever you feel that might be opposite of meta.
It's okay.
It's okay just the way it is.
No need to strain, no need to make anything happen.
Bring to mind a being that we call a difficult being.
Now you should just to pick someone that's not too difficult.
But someone who kind of mildly maybe sometimes irritates you.
Or just mildly annoying person.
Not someone who is like your enemy.
Just a mildly annoying person.
Someone who is sometimes mildly annoying.
Then if you have someone in mind.
You could try to see if there's any goodness in this person that you can tell.
This person probably or this being probably has others who actually love them.
Who care for them.
I might have a pet who is happy when they come home.
Maybe you can see through their eyes the goodness in this being.
Then you can also wish this being a phrases.
May you be happy.
Sometimes the difficult person is a little difficult.
We don't feel that much.
Only that you can always go to where it is easy with the metapractice.
We don't have to go to the difficult person.
But if we do feel some metta, we can stay with the difficult person.
Then wish this difficult person the phrases.
May you be healthy.
May you be happy.
May you be at ease.
Let's then turn our attention to ourselves.
You can have an image of yourself in front of your mental screen.
Maybe you felt sense of sitting here.
Bring them to mind some good qualities that you have.
Sometimes it can be difficult for us to name our own good qualities.
If that's the case for you, then maybe think of what a friend would say.
One of your best friends, maybe the dear friend that you just used in the meditation.
What would they say about what your good qualities are?
Seeing yourself through the lens of this good quality or good qualities.
You can send yourself the wishes.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be at ease.
We are lost.
We can use all living beings everywhere.
We can connect to your heart area.
Say a phrase, may all beings be safe.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be healthy.
May all beings be at ease.
Now that we've come to the end of the categories and phrases and wishes,
we can take a moment to tune into our hearts.
This is like right there, right now.
Everything changed since we started the meditation.
Whatever is there for you right now, it's okay.
However the meditation unfolded,
we've all been cultivating this intention of kindness,
of warmth, and well wishes that we have had for all these beings and ourselves.
We can appreciate the wholesomeness of that.
But we took the time to cultivate this wholesomeness.
One of these beneficial energies that we've cultivated,
I can share with all beings everywhere,
so that it multiplies.
All beings everywhere benefit from the wholesome energies that are generated through our meditation.
May all beings be free.
Be free.
We can also go to the breakout groups.
We'll do some for about maybe 10 minutes or so.
You can discuss what it was like to use Schoen's Salzburg words
to open to everything with the healing force of love.
We set them up.
It should be about three to four people per group.
There you go. See you in a little bit.
Welcome back.
I've got a few more minutes to share reflections, maybe, comments, questions,
maybe something that came up in the breakout groups during the meditation today.
Did you notice?
Feel free to unmute yourself or put something in the chat.
I found it was very sticky for me to do the meditation for the most part until I sort of just gave up trying to do it right.
Something just came into my mind.
It was very interesting and useful.
It's like, oh, I guess that counts.
It's not the way it says in the script.
I'll take it.
Thanks.
Thanks for sharing, Kathleen.
Now, as you say, it's not in the script, but I'll take it.
That's a little bit what Metta is about.
It doesn't have to be in the script.
It's about a little bit in the meditation, but it's about where it's easy for us.
If that's something else, then it's in the script.
That is actually great.
Thanks for sharing there.
Complex.
Can I mute yourself?
Yes.
I shared that probably because I have a mediocre hearing age, I could make out just a fraction of what you were actually saying.
You're cadence and your tone of voice is just wonderful.
And thank you for having such a wonderful quality to the way you speak.
Yeah, thank you. Good to hear that was helpful.
Yeah, thanks for sharing.
Yeah, Susan.
Oh, you're so muted.
There we go.
In our group, we were really just celebrating, we enjoyed the meditation and celebrating the fruits of doing Metta practice and noticing the changes as a result of doing it more regularly.
Yeah, that's great.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
The more we do it, the more we can harvest the fruits of it.
Thank you for sharing.
Catherine.
Today being the solstice, there just was something I just felt like this warm stillness kind of.
Yeah, I don't know how to describe that any better but just this like steady presence of stillness and love. And it really was like grounded in this, in this practice, especially through connecting with my body and through my heart.
So, thank you and less than solstice.
Thank you so much for your time and beautiful. Thanks for sharing.
Thank you all. It's wonderful to be in this song again.
