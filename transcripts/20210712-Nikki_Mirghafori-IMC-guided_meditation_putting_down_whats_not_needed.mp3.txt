 Greetings, greetings, friends, wherever you are in the world. What a privilege it is to be able to practice together. I know what a marvel it is really. Is that we get to sit together, we get to practice together this global amazing Sangha. My name is Nikhil Margafuri and I'm delighted to be with you this week, practicing together and supporting you and supporting Gil while he's taking a vacation and backpacking in nature. So practice, the deliciousness of practice. So for today and for this week, I'd like to invite us to explore some ways to calm, settle, invite the mind to be more available, more available for calming, settling, for what's called Samadhi or translated as concentration. Of course, I'll say much more about it later, but the invitation for today for the theme of our practice is to put down, to put down what is not necessary, to put down what is not necessary. What is wind drag? And the image I would like you to consider is if you were riding a bicycle, can you imagine, for example, the professional bikers in Tour de France reducing wind drag, reducing wind drag is so important, putting down what is not necessary, what sticks out so that one can be in the flow, be in the flow of movement, in this case movement of the breath on the bhanasati, movement of this moment, the movement, putting down what's wind drag. And what's wind drag for us is whatever is not necessary. Ill will, judgment, I can't do this. I'm terrible at this wind drag, wind drag, put it down, put it down, not necessary. Putting down what is not needed, coming back with a sense of intention, resoluteness, just here, just this, just this. Thinking about plans, future, past, regrets in this moment, not necessary, wind drag, releasing, just sit, just be in this moment, giving our hearts, our hearts to this practice, being alive in this body in this moment, for the benefit of ourselves, others, and the world. So let's begin, let's begin with that frame. Let's begin adjusting our posture to whatever is called for in this moment, whatever is necessary. Listening to the body, what does the body need? Does it need to sit up a little more straight with integrity? Spine, aligned, vertebrae, right? Sense of alignment as if there was a vertical, a vertical point of reference internally. Sitting, nor lying down or standing with integrity. And then inviting the body to relax, all the soft tissue, all the soft tissue to relax, to soften. Setting the intention with wholeheartedness to give, to give ourselves, to give our hearts, our minds fully, completely to this simply sitting being here in this moment. And filling our hearts, our bodies, our minds, our minds with the goodness, this sacredness of renunciation of what is extra, what is when drag. And settling into the sit bones, letting our weight drop internally into the sit bones, held by the earth, letting go of the weight of the legs and feet offering it to the earth. Ah softening, relaxing, no need to hold on for it to be tight. Adviding the abdomen, the lower abdomen to release any tightness or holding for the chest to soften for the heart, the proverbial heart center, center of the chest, place of emotions, letting it be safe, feel safe for whatever is present right now. Softening your armpit, breathing your armpit to release your arms, your hands, inviting the neck and shoulders, the arms, the hands all those problems you're experiencing right now. to release the weight, their weight. Similarly for the forehead, for it to soften. The tightness and the holding in the forehead is wind drag, not made it. Vibing the eyes, their socket to rest. The jaw, the chin, all the muscles behind the face, they can relax. Vibing the eyes, their stomach to rest. Inviting the breath to breathe you just as it has been doing for all these minutes and years just naturally simply being aware intimately connecting with the flow of the flow and the abdomen the lower part of the body to settle and if judgments arise I can't do this my mind is distracted wind drag not needed put down the self-criticism I don't like this this is not good etc etc wind drag wind drag relinquishing relinquishing putting it down giving your heart to itself not to these strangers you any type of conflict with reality, etc. Thank you.
