Practice Note : Working with Failure

You can just be present for things , or you can focus on 
particular areas that might be interesting or helpful to 
focus on. What  I’d like to e ncourage you to do today is 
to bring some  extra attention to all the ways in which 
you fail at doing the practice. Some of you I’m sure  
probably have never failed in doing the practic e ever 
[laughter] . You sit down, close your eyes and say , “I’m 
going to stay on my breat h.” You stay on your breath to 
the end of the sitting and that’s great.  
 
But in their attempts to be in the present mom ent or 
focused on the breath , most people fail. Here I’m using 
the word “fail” in a colloquial  way. The mind wanders off 
and it gets lost. Then you notice that and you come 
back.  
 
This morning I’d like to encourage you to notice all the 
ways in which you don’t succeed. Study that and get 
interested in that. If you get interested in how you don’t 
succeed, don’t think about it  or analyze it . Just be really 
present and recognize it clearly. Then you are in the 
present moment in investigating  that.  
 There  is a lot to discover in your failures in practice. 
One is to discover your attitude about failure. It  might be 
that there is a lot of purification and cleaning up of the 
internal landscape that can happen if you just notice all 
the unhelpful ways in which  you relate to not 
succeeding. There might be some attitudes underlying 
forces in the mind that you can discover , which  prompt 
you to fai l or to get distracted. It’s very interesting to see 
what those are  and become wise about them.  
 
It also might be poss ible to discover a healthy or helpful 
attitude about the so -called failures , so that you don’t 
get discouraged or dismayed by them. But rather use 
your so-called failures as food for going further with the 
practice. In that way , there are no failures.  
 
I would encourage you this morning to be interested in 
how you don’t succeed in being mindful. My guess is if 
you pay careful attention to this you’ll end up being 
more mindful.  Thank you.
