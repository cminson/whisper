 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, to start today, whatever time it is where you are, please settle back into a comfortable meditation posture, balancing relaxation and alertness. If it's helpful to turn away from the camera or have the camera off during the meditation, please feel free to do so. And please feel free to take any of the primary postures the Buddha taught. Sitting, standing, lying down, even walking if that's most helpful for you. And start by tuning in, maybe, just noticing. Noticing the quality of your body in this moment, in this room. Sense of contact with the cushion or chair or surface. Sense of being held on the earth by gravity. Places of tension or relaxation. Warmth or cool. Tingling and vibration or ease and stillness. It can be helpful to start a period of formal meditation by setting an intention that awareness, mindful awareness, be at the forefront. Perhaps inquiring, am I aware? Noticing the non-verbal response. Embiding relaxation of the body. Through the head and neck, behind the eyes. The shoulders. Upper back and chest. Inviting the torso and all the viscera, all the organs deep within to soften. Noticing the movement of the diaphragm or belly or chest. The life-spreath of this body breathing. Inviting the muscles to hang from the skeleton, the spine, the bones. And allowing the uprightness of that internal structure, the spine, the bones to hold us. Softening around it. Allowing the hips and buttocks, thighs and calves to relax. Softening the hands and arms. Allowing any remaining tension to drain out the ankles and feet. Allowing awareness to fill the whole body like light fills the sky. And now, too, inviting the mind and heart to relax. Thank you. Noticing the attitude and relationship to experience. It's helpful to anchor, tether your tension to the body or breathing. The invitation is to feel free to do so. And if it's more useful to open to all of experience, flowing through, receptive, the invitation is to do that. Periodically, simply checking in. Beware of what once obvious. Thank you. Thank you.
