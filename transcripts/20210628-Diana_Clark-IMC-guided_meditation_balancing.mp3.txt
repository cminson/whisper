 Welcome, welcome. Good evening. Good morning, good afternoon. I'm happy that we're practicing together. So we'll begin with a guided meditation. We'll start by just coming into the body, realizing that we're here at this moment. And maybe in a global way, we'll just check in. How is the body? Maybe it's feeling a little bit tired or maybe a little bit restless or a little bit achy or a little bit spacious. Maybe you're not quite sure yet. However, it may be, it's all welcome and invited. Doesn't mean it matches our preferences, of course, but we don't need to exclude or push away our experiences. But to make room for them and allow them to be here as best we can. And feeling connected, grounded, feeling the pressure of the chair, the cushion, the bench, the couch, whatever you're sitting on, feeling the pressure against the body. And then checking in with the posture. Is there a sense of evenness, a sense of balance? Sometimes it's helpful to rock back and forth a bit, a little bit of an adjustment. We all know how uncomfortable it can be if we're not sitting just right. Then we find ourselves squirming or just simply getting up and abandoning it. But to feel the uprightness and the balance in the posture. And then to allow the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing. And feeling the inhales, feeling the exhales as the chest moves, the belly moves. And to every now and then just check in with the body in a global sense. Just noticing the posture. Are we leaning forward? Maybe we're slumping? Maybe our chin is up? Without making it a big project. But just feeling into the body, maybe the body as a whole. Seeing if there's a sense of balance. If you find that your shoulders are up or maybe you're leaning forward a little bit, we don't have to make it a problem. We just very simply bring our posture back into alignment, into balance. And if we notice that repeatedly we're leaning forward or our chin is up, we might just get a little curious. Is there a mental state that's associated with this physical expression, this physical movement? And some people, sometimes when their chin is up, they're doing planning. Maining forward with a little bit of striving. Feeling slumped, collapsed is maybe lost in fantasy or lost in some kind of thought. Maybe a feeling of dejection or disappointment, sadness. Being sensitive to our posture can be another way in which we can be aware of our experience, our inner experience, maybe the mental state, maybe our emotional state. We might not be aware of it until we notice the shift in our posture. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. We don't have to make it a big problem or make a big project out of it. Although in perhaps the mind follows and perhaps the mind is already there. But using the body and this idea of balance as a support for our practice. Help us not to be out of balance. So that we can take care of ourselves and take care of others in a way that's appropriate. Even this way our practice is for the benefit of all beings. Not just for ourselves. For those we come in contact with and whom they come in contact with and they come in contact with etcetera etcetera. But may all beings be free from suffering.
