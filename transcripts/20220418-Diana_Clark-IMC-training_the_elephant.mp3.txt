The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So again, I'll say a really warm welcome to everybody. So nice to practice
together. Makes a difference. So a few weeks ago, I gave a talk about some of
these poems that were inspiring. And I wanted to build on one of the poems
there that, I don't know, for some reason really touches me and I kind of
wanted to flesh it out a little bit and bring in some other teachings around
it. So I'll start with this poem. It's by Maddie Weingest, who was somebody who
was inspired by some of the poems in the early literature and then wrote his
own poems. So it goes like this. While walking along the river, after a long
day meditating on Vulture Peak, I watched an elephant splashing its way out of the
water and up the bank. Hello, my friend. A person waiting there said, scratching
the elephant behind its ear. Did you have a good bath? The elephant stretched out
its leg. The person climbed up and the two rode off like that together. Seeing what
had once been so wild, now a friend and companion to this good person. I took a
seat under the nearest tree and reached out a gentle hand to my own mind. Truly, I
thought this is why I came to the woods. I like this poem. It's very evocative, this
idea of this elephant and this person scratching behind the ears. Hello, did you
have a good bath? I don't know, it seems like very sweet and there's
certain intimacy there too. And then how, just seeing this, this perhaps, I don't
know how commonplace it was in ancient India, but maybe not extraordinary. This
little, just this, you know, mundane event inspires somebody. And partly why it
inspires this person is because there's this line, seeing what had once been so
wild. So the meditator, right, had this idea that in this case it's a woman, the
meditator, that her mind used to be so wild. Isn't this true, right? When we start
meditating, it seems like it's this wild thing, a little bit out of control, but
then this, this shift in this relationship in the poem, the person has
befriended the elephant and now the meditator realizes, oh yeah, befriending
the mind is the practice. Rather than somehow thinking that we have to get rid
of the thoughts, we have to make the mind can be completely different, we have to
be completely different. Instead, just this idea of befriending the experience
reaching out a hand, it's kind of just this gesture. So it says, maybe this person
has now kind of like, it's maybe a little bit more maturity and practice. I think
this, I suspect it's universal that when you first start meditating, you're like,
oh my goodness, I had no idea my mind was like that. But then our relationship, we
start to be more accepting, more allowing, more relaxing and just allowing
things to unfold. So at the time of the Buddha, there were questions about
training, just in the same way that maybe there are some ideas like, okay, well, how
did this elephant get from this wild elephant to something that steps out
its leg and allows the person to climb on board? Like, how does that happen, this
process? So there's a sutra that's from Mogulana, the accountant,
Ganaka Mogulana. And he's talking to the Buddha in the palace of Megara's
mother. Just because I'm a woman, I'll make this tiny little statement, right?
This is not so common that a place is named after a woman, but this is
Megara's mother's palace. Another sutra is we learn her name, but so this woman who
was a donor donated this palace. I'm sorry, Mogulana, the accountant, is
talking to the Buddha, so he's not a monk. And he asks, they're standing
there in the midst of this palace, which was donated to the Buddha and some of
his other monastics would be there and they were practicing together. And I can
imagine that it was recently completed in its construction, because Mogulana
asks, do his followers, do the Buddha's followers, have this progressive training?
Do they have training just like other people do? Just like other professions do?
We can imagine that at that time, the kind of the question was, like, are you
magical? Can you just zap people and they become awakened? Or do people have to
work at it? Because Mogulana, when he asks the question, he also is drawing
from his present moment experience exactly what he is seeing right then. And
he asks them, this is a quote from the sutra now, Master Gautama, that's how the
Buddha is addressed by somebody who is not a follower. Master Gautama, in this
palace of Magara's mother, we can see gradual or progressive gradual progress
down to the last step of the staircase, highlighting that when you're making a
staircase, you make them one step at a time, right? You can't, like, start at the
top and have the bottom, right? So you have to just do them sequentially. So
they're standing in this palace, he points to, you know, how there's these
steps. Is your training like that? And then he goes on and he says, among the
Brahman priests, we can see gradual progress in learning the scriptures.
Among archers, we see gradual progress in archery. Among us accountants, we see
gradual progress in mathematics. For when we get an apprentice, we first make
them count, one, one, two, two, three, threes, all the way up to a hundred. We make
them count. Is it possible to similarly describe a gradual training for you and
what you're teaching? So Ghanaka Mogulana just recognizes that there's a
natural way in which people learn and that there's a way in which there's also
different people and different professions also have the results of their
efforts, right? The people who are counting, they can become accountants.
People who are practicing archery can become archers. Brahman priests become
priests during their training. So in my mind, Mogulana is also looking around
and saying, okay, well, there's all these people sitting, but do they get
anything? Is there any purpose of this? So Mogulana asks, is it possible to
describe a gradual training, gradual progress, and gradual practice in your
teachings? And the Buddha says, yes, it is possible. And then he gives a little
simile. Suppose a horse trainer were to obtain a fine, thoroughbred horse. First,
the trainer would make it get used to wearing the bit. I don't know anything
about horses. So I'm just assuming that this is what happens. And then they would
train it further. So in the same way when the Tathagata, when the Buddha gets a
person for training, so that is when somebody ordains underneath him, first
he guides him in one way. And when they have learned that, he guides him further. So
first one way and then further. Maybe in some ways it feels really obvious to us.
But maybe in some ways when we think about our practice, it sometimes just
feels like a mumbo or a whole jumble of things. I know certainly for me in the
beginning it did. Partly because I would go to Dharma Talks and the Dharma
Talks, you know, that not always start at, you know, start here's the first
Dharma Talk you hear isn't where you should start. And then the second
Dharma Talk isn't the second one you start, right? It just takes, took me quite a
while to figure out that, oh, there's a progressive practice here. And it wasn't
until actually, you know, I heard Gil give a talk about a Sutta that I realized, oh,
that's like this happens before that and this and something like this. So you can
imagine that maybe this person, Mogulana, sees these people sitting around. He knows
how he was trained and he's heard some things and maybe he's a little bit
confused. So the Buddha does give him this progressive, this gradual training
I'm going to talk a little bit about that. But before I do, I also want to say
because Mogulana, he asks this other question. So when your followers are
instructed and advised like this by you, the Buddha, do all of them achieve the
ultimate goal, Nibbana, or do some of them not? Like what good are instructions if
nobody can follow them or achieve what you want to? I think this is a great
question. It's a legitimate question. It's a fair question. And then the Buddha
responds, well, some accomplish the ultimate goal, Nibbana, while others do
not. And then Mogulana, he asks the next, I think a great question. Why? Why do some
reach it and some don't? And then the Buddha responds and includes a simile in
his response. He says, well, Mogulana, suppose a person were to come along who
wanted to go to Rajagaha. He'd approach you and say, I wish to go to Rajagaha.
Rajagaha is a town not too far away. I wish to go to Rajagaha. Please point out
the road to Rajagaha. Then you'd say to him here, this road goes to Rajagaha. Go
along for a while and then you'll see a certain village. Go a little further and
then you'll see a town. And then go a little further and then you'll see Rajagaha
with the delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds. So you'll know when you
get there because it's really beautiful and you see these lotus ponds and these
lakes and things. And then the Buddha continues talking to this, Mogulana,
instructed that like this by you, they might still take the wrong road heading
west. But then a second person comes along with the same question. You give
the same example of the same instructions and instructed by you, they do
safely arrive at Rajagaha. And why is that? Because Rajagaha is present, the path
leading to Rajagaha is present, and you are there to give them the instructions.
And one person takes the wrong path and heads west while another arrives safely
at Rajagaha. And then Mogulana responds, well, what can I do about that? I'm the one
who just shows the way. I just give the instructions. He's not physically carrying
them there or something like this. Just gives them the instructions. And then of
course the Buddha says, in the same way. Although Nibbana is present and the path
leading to Nibbana is present, and I am present to encourage them, some of my
disciples instructed and advised like me, achieve the ultimate goal Nibbana
while some of them do not. And what can I do about that? The Tattakata is the one
who shows the way. Kind of highlighting his role as person, the Buddha's role is
to guide others. Can't make it happen for them. Can't make it happen for us. So what
is this path? What is this gradual training? Sometimes it's called or
progressive training. Many of you will be familiar with this maybe in the less
obvious ways or the more in a certain form. And it shows up in lots of
different forms. At the bird's eye view is Sela Samadhi Panya. At the
mental development and wisdom. Probably many of you have heard this and
certainly talk about the Eightfold Path this way. But the gradual training has
some other details in there that often we don't talk about in Dharma talks. So I
thought I would pull out a few of them and talk about them a little bit. But this
idea that it's progressive, in the West we don't necessarily teach
about ethics first. Get that down. And then when you're ready go on to the
next step. When you're ready go on to the next step. For some people that works
perfectly fine to have it not be progressive, not wait until you're
ready to receive the next instruction until you do. But for some other people
maybe it's helpful too. Especially if you're feeling stuck or things don't
quite make sense or you're feeling lost and confused or overwhelmed or some of
these things. One potential thing to do is to kind of go back to some of the
earlier steps. Okay so what are these steps?
The first one is Sela, ethical behavior, moral restraint, following the
five pre-substantial person, if you're monastic, to follow the Patamukha, the
Vinaya. I'm not going to talk about ethics today. But in this Suta, maybe I'll
back up and say the gradual training, this shows up, I don't know how many
times in this Suta's 20 or 30 different times. And each time it's a little bit
different. There aren't any that are exactly the same. So we might imagine
maybe with the Buddha was speaking to different people and had a sense that
this person maybe needed something a little bit different or I don't know
exactly why. And there are some scholars and some practitioners who love to do
this, who love to compare all the different versions of this and postulate
why they're a little bit different. So I'm going to focus on the three
supportive practices that are in here that often we don't hear about so much.
And I'm going to talk about them in terms of if-then statements. Because
they're presented not exactly that way, but often I find practices feels a little
more like an invitation, a little bit more like, okay, here's something you can do,
you can try, you can work with. As opposed to that you better do this, you know, we
don't-I think many of us don't respond so well. I know I don't, I don't like it
when people tell me what to do. Sometimes this gets me into trouble, but I think
there's also this, it comes in the in the flavor more of an invitation if it's an
if-then statement. So what do I mean by this? If you would like a particular
experience or outcome, then do a particular thing to help create the
conditions. If you're also interested in that outcome then there's no need to do
it. Okay, so if you don't want unhelpful states to overwhelm you, then guard the
sense doors. So if you don't want unhelpful states to overwhelm you, so what
what's being pointed to here is in here, and I'll read exactly how it is in the
sutta, but these unhelpful states, a kusala dharma, so maybe you may know this
word kusala, unhelpful, unskillful, unwholesome, the specific ones that are
being pointed to are greed and aversion. So often, right, this, this even subtle or
not so subtle, I want more, I want less, get that away from me. These are the first
of the hindrances, the first two hindrances, so these are things that
definitely get in the way of our settling down and having some peace and ease. And
a short, this also kind of greed and aversion is sometimes also a short hand
wave saying everything that's not equanimity, like any kind of like response
for having that isn't the equanimous. If you don't want unhelpful states to
overwhelm you, then guard the sense doors. Well, what does this mean to guard the
sense doors? Sense doors, of course, are the senses, taste, hearing, feeling, seeing.
There's probably one I'm missing, the mind is one, I don't know if I have them
all, but the six senses. And maybe I'll just say a classic example of not
guarding the sense doors is when you see somebody attractive and you just start
watching them. Or they're going like this and you're kind of going around to
look at this, right? This is a typical thing we see in the movies, right, how
somebody catches somebody's eye and they look at them and watch them and then
usually their partner is angry, right, or something like this in the movies. So
that's not guarding the sense doors. So guarding the sense doors is about, it's
not that we have to close down and always avert our gaze, but it's that we're not
like prolonging, if there's like a peak of interest, we're not grabbing onto and
like watching to have that experience of attraction, desire, just grow and grow
and grow. It might be, oh, yep, that's an attractive person. And just allow them to
come into view and out of view in the same way that you might be standing on
the sidewalk and there's cars that are going by, like, okay, there's thoughts
that are going by, there are sense, there are physical experiences, there's
visual stimulus going by. So you know they're going by, but and you also know
when it's safe to step out and when it's safe not to, but something like this is
guarding the sense doors. It's a way of taking stimuli as they are, without
pushing or pulling, but instead just allowing us to have experiences and
allowing the experience to arise and pass away. So it's not a shutting down,
it's not a shunning, it's not a locking oneself up into a cave or a closet. When
we're on retreat, we do we do kind of guard the sun stores and a little bit
more legitimate, not legitimate, a little bit more, I don't know what the word is
I'm looking for, but in a way that it's really exaggerated necessarily than how
we are in daily life, right, we have kind of are isolated from so many of these
things that might impinge our senses just as a support, but that's not the
expectation that we're doing that with our daily life. So here's how the sutra
goes, here's the quote, here's the instruction, here's the Buddha's words, guard
your sun stores. When you see a sight, for example, with your eyes, don't get
caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left
unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become
overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of sight
and achieve restraint over it, then it goes on with the other five senses. So
just this recognition that if it's unrestrained, the translator here is
saying desire and aversion would become overwhelming, maybe not overwhelming in
terms of uncomfortable, but overwhelming in terms of we would lose our
mindfulness, we would get lost in the desire and aversion. So then the next
step in this gradual training, I'll state it as an if then statement. If you want to
be healthy and live blamelessly and in comfort, then be moderate in eating.
Sometimes we don't talk about this so much about being moderate in eating, but
just pointing to consuming just enough to end our hunger and to eat enough
that's not starving, right? To the Buddha we know in his life story, he had both.
When he was younger in the palace, you're imagining that he was overeating, and
then when later as a practitioner, he was starving himself. So this recognition
that moderate in eating is part of taking care of ourselves, is part of
having a healthy body, as well as a healthy mind. Guarding the sin stores is
to help to protect the mind, and eating in a healthy way is to protect the body.
For me it's a little bit interesting to note that thousands of years ago, as well
as today, there is a lot of concern about food. And of course religious
traditions often have restrictions on eating. It's certainly monastics, for
example, and this tradition don't eat after them when the sun is up at
so 12 o'clock, or depending on daylight savings, whenever the
moon is, sorry, whenever the sun is straight overhead. So, and there's a way,
I mean today there are people, or of course they're identified by what they
eat and what they don't eat, and when we think about how much mental energy and
how much even like commerce and is concerned with food, like how many
websites, how many advertisements, how many apps, how many, you know, what people
talk about and stuff, is food. And there's nothing wrong with that, except that
when it's a way that you get a little distorted view, that it becomes not so
much about taking care of yourself, but somehow it becomes more about the
meaning of the food or what it means for you in such a way that's not
supportive for practice. I don't want to say that we shouldn't ever have, you know,
there's food that maybe is our family or our traditions have, but just this to
notice that this is such a rich place where we often don't even want to look
at it or consider it, how we might be using food in terms of stress or when
we're feeling a little bit out of sorts or boredom or something like this. This
is certainly a rich place for me to practice. I have this thing with cookies
that sometimes we know when I'm feeling stressed or out of sorts or something
that I don't know I like to have cookies. So reflecting on the role that food has
in our lives and allowing it to have a role that is supportive and this is not
easy because there is so much societal pressure about meaning the food or what
it should mean and what you shouldn't eat and something like this. So here's
how it's worded in the Sutta. Eat in moderation. Reflect properly on the food
that you eat, not for fun or indulgence or adornment or decoration, but to
sustain the body, to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice. And reflect
that in this way, so like eating, eating this way I shall put an end to old
discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and I will live healthy,
blameless, and at ease. So to put an end to the feeling of being hungry, but not
eating so much that then you feel sick from overeating. And then this way to
live healthy, blameless, and at ease. I appreciate very much right the Buddhas
encouraging us to have some comfort and ease. Sometimes when we think about these
practitioners, we are not thinking about comfort and ease. We're thinking about
striving and working really hard or really abstaining or restraining these
asceticism and hardships. But the Buddha is talking about eating moderation in a
way that supports you. So then having created favorable conditions to meditate,
one was behaving ethically, which I didn't go into any detail. The second was
to guard the sense door so that the mind is not flooded with desire and a
version and just chasing after them, taking care of the body that's getting
expressed in the way that in eating. So then the Buddha sources a talk about
meditation practice. And he talks about by first by having a commitment to
practice. So the way he stated is to be committed to wakefulness. And wakefulness
interestingly is used both ways that we might use it in English to be awake, that
is to not be asleep. And to be awake is also to be aware of what's happening. So
this, the Buddha had this emphasis, you know, to be committed to practice, to be
committed to wakefulness, it means that you're not sleeping your life away, you're
not sleeping your days away. And maybe we, I would consider or invite you to
consider like, well, what are there's ways in which we are maybe not literally
sleeping, but figuratively, they were kind of numbing ourselves and no longer
aware of what's happening around us and disconnected from ourselves and others. For
example, watching too much TV, there's a way right in which the mind just kind of
gets into a stupor or something. I know this, I mean, done this recently,
visiting someone who added TV and like watching TV and just noticing like how
just watching it, it just kind of, I don't want to say that old TV watching is
banned, but right, we're not going to become awakened if we're watching TV all
hours of the day. So here's how the Buddha expresses it. He expresses it in
terms of what to do with yourself in the evenings, be committed to wakefulness,
practice walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying your mind from
obstacles. We're to hear for obstacles or the hindrances again. So when the
hindrances arise, you know, work with them. In the evening, continue to practice
walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, lie down in the
lion's posture on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other,
mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. Of course, they
don't have alarm clocks. So this idea of setting the intention, okay, I'm going to
wake up at a certain time. And then in the last part of the night, get up and
continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying your mind from
obstacles. So this idea of before you sleep and when you first wake up to be
practicing with sitting and walking meditation. And then in this gradual
training goes on to a description of mindfulness and then concentration and
then some of the wisdom things. I just wanted to highlight these three
different practices that are in there that sometimes we don't hear about, but
that can be a real support. And I like the way that it's these if then
statements are about if you want to have some comfort, if you want to not be
overwhelmed, if you want to be healthy and take care of yourself. So it's not
only for meditation, but it's just to enable us to have our best lives so that
we can bring the best version of ourselves to our practice and allow
the wisdom and to arise and allow meditation to arise, creating the
conditions for that. So maybe these are some ways and I don't know how many
different steps there are to train an elephant to go from a wild one so that
they can then put their leg out and allow a person to step up on them. But I
imagine there's a lot and it takes time. Maybe some of them are mundane and not
so glamorous or even fun. But in the same way this practice too has these steps
and some that are maybe supportive that we might overlook or we might consider
if we haven't really engaged in them before as a support for our practice. And
the way to nabana, the Buddha says he's the one that shows the way and if we would
like to be able to follow the way that he is giving. So may our practice be a
support for finding more freedom, more ease, more comfort. It may be a support
for not only ourselves but for all beings everywhere. Thank you.
