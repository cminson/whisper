 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So just a couple of words about the practice. Something that's been on my mind for a while now is the idea of being available. And in my mind, as I've been thinking about this being available, I contrast it with asserting oneself. So if you assert yourself, then you're not available for something to happen. You have an agenda, you have an idea, this is what's supposed to happen. And then I contrast availability with allowing, sometimes in this practice we, that you just allow things to be, be present, be mindful, but allow them to be. That's closely related to this idea available. But for me, the concept of availability means like you're making room to, not just allow, but to let something happen that hasn't happened yet. You're kind of like something can arise, something can appear. There's a stance or an attitude of readiness, receptivity, inavailability that allowing might not have. So for me, I love the idea that when I'm sitting to meditate, I'm sitting available. Available to what? It might be a good question. I don't have an answer. I'm just available. And it just feels so good to be available. That sense of feeling of availability is where there's some deep satisfaction. What shows up in there, that's secondary to just living in the world that way. It's kind of like living in the world with an open hand. And open hand for what? It doesn't have to be a what, it's just so nice to have an open hand, the alternative, the clenched hand, to go around the world life that way. So the idea of just available. But it's also, it's maybe akin to allowing, it's making space for something to occur that I can't engineer. That arises or appears or comes into play, that as I become more settled, as I calm down. And this idea that availability is only possible if there's some calming going on. Because agitation is often in the world of assertion. And you know, wanting it to be a certain way, engineering things a certain way. And so this availability is not asserting yourself, is not being 100% sure what's supposed to happen. I know exactly what's supposed to be here, I'm not doing it right. We don't know what's supposed to happen, we're just available. And it makes room for something unexpected to happen. But you have to be calm or settled. So just a stance of availability for me calms me. Kind of as a settling that goes on. And that settling makes me more available in a nice way. So if that makes sense to you today, you might have kind of experimented this morning with this attitude of being available. And see how that shift things for you as you go through the practice. So I hope you enjoy your morning here.
