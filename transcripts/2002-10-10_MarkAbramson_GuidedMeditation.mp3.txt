 Tonight we're going to have a little bit of some direction to the sitting, but the directions are just suggestions. Listening to your own calling or your own way of connecting with yourself and your deepest nature is what's most appropriate. The first suggestion is that we focus on the quality of concentration and use the experience of our breathing as something to maintain direct awareness. And entering deeply into the eternal now that we exist in, that we live in. The flow of the rhythm of the breathing that you're feeling directly is in that eternal now that we're living in, so we enter into it as we concentrate on that experience of the process of breathing. Notice the method that you're using to bring your attention to your breathing. Notice the unfolding of this process, each in-breath. Give it as much time as it needs, as it wants. Each out-breath, patiently letting the body release. Obitually want to get somewhere, to get to the end of the breath. There's nothing to get to, you're already in the eternal now. There's just the opening to the experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Begin to focus your attention right at the edge of your nostril. And feel the air as it enters the very edge, the skin at the very edge of your nostrils. Thank you. You might feel almost a sense of tickling as the air brushes the skin, right on the surface. And begin to bring your attention to the experience inside the nose itself. You might feel the pressure of the air against the inner walls of the nose as you breathe out. And the vacuum, the kind of sucking sensation as you breathe in. Thank you. You might notice the sensation of the temperature of the air. The coolness of the air from the room and how the air has been warmed by your body. Warmth of the out breath. Then begin to focus your attention on the experience inside your face in the sinus areas. You might notice pressure changes in your face as you flow from in breath to out breath. Temperature changes. The feeling of the air moving through the sinuses. And begin to bring your attention to the back of your throat. Feel the air as it passes through your neck. Feel the air as it passes through your neck. Then begin to focus on the experience in your upper chest. As the air starts to go into the smaller passageways of the bronchial area. It begins to branch off. And feel the air deep into your lungs. Where the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide occurs. The oxygen you're breathing enters, taken and attached to the red blood cells and brought to every cell in your body. Where it enters the cells. And this is where true respiration occurs within every cell of your body. So begin to open up to the experience of your whole body, every cell. Allow yourself to become relaxed and open so that the blood flows as free as you can without resistance. And begin to open up to the experience of your whole body. And begin to open up to the experience of your whole body. And begin to open up to the experience of your whole body. And begin to open up to the experience of your whole body. And begin to open up to the experience of your whole body. And begin to open up to the experience of your whole body. And begin to open up to the experience of your whole body.
