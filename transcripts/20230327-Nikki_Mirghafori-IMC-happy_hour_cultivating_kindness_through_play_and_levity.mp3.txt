 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. So hello and welcome everyone. Lovely to be with you. Lovely to see you. That's one delightful aspect of happy hour because I actually get to see you or at 7am. I feel people's presence through YouTube. It's just on YouTube, not on Zoom, but anyway. Lovely to be with you. It delights me to see your faces, feel your presence. So the theme I'd like to invite us to explore in happy hour today is the theme of metta combined with sense of playfulness. Sense of playfulness. Actually this whole week with the 7am I'm bringing some playfulness and some improv. Improvising our life is the theme. So bringing in the theme, the sense of practicing metta for ourselves, for others, this sense of lightness, this playfulness with a sense of light touch. It's fun. Having fun with the practice, not as a grim duty of okay, I need to be kind. It's important to be kind. No. Oh, wow. Let's try this on for a second. It's kind of fun. It's like a game, like a play. What happens in this heart when we, it's like an instrument. It's like a musical instrument. Oh, what happens when we play the strings like this? Oh, wow. That's kind of fun. What if I do it like that? What happens? What sounds come out of these heartstrings if I play metta songs? Just sense of creativity, playfulness with the practice. So that's all I need to say to set up the stage and offer invitations during the guided meditation. So with that, let's begin. Let's arrive. Let's land in our seat in this moment in time. Let there be like this sense of ease, playfulness as you arrive, as you release, relax your body. As if this period of practice is a treat. It's a sweet treat, this fun, fun activity called meditation practice. How fun. We get to explore our minds, get to explore our heart. We get to play in this sandbox. It's not just the same old, same old. Every moment is new, fresh, this breath, and this body in this moment. Fresh like the spring. And imagining it, you are opening a window, a big window, the fresh air outside. Meeting this window to allow fresh air to come in. Fresh breeze, spring breeze. Meeting this moment, this breath. As if it's the fresh breeze, a fully opened window, fully opened window of your sense door. As if it's the fresh breeze, a fully opened window of your sense door.

At your current age, imagine yourself playing or talking or doing homework or riding your bikes, playing with your dolls, just having fun. A little silly, but why not? Drawing, playing with leggos. Imagine yourself as an adult playing with your friend. Laughing, being silly. Maybe the adult versions of you have... Have water guns squirting each other with delight. Or whatever else you like to imagine. It's joyous, ridiculous and fun. Let there be meta, lighter. Goodness, good will, laughter. Good will, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Goodness, good will, kindness in your play. Wherever your friends are, may they be well, wishing well for them, for yourself May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity, play May your heart be filled with laughter and joy, levity and play May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity and play May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity and play May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity and play May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity and play May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity and play May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity and play May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity and play May

play May their hearts be light, full of joy, levity and play So what we did, what I invited you to try on for size is this sense of, for many of us, maybe not for everyone, but maybe for many, the childhood there is a sense of curiosity and lightness and play So which we lose when we become adults, we become so serious, everything is so important and there's such a sense of gravity and it can also impact the way that we see everyone and see ourselves in the world can impact our practice as the grim duty, this heaviness of it So this was an invitation to try and whatever way that it worked for you to try on, the sense of lightness, so the invitation was to see yourself playing, just really feeling to touch into the sense of levity, play, that we knew as children And then to have these preposterous images of us playing as adults doing the same games and really just as an invitation to feel into the lightness and also metta can flow so easily out of that, that lightness, this goodwill for ourselves, for our friends So lightness, play as a bridge to kindness, you want your friends to be happy, you want to be happy, you want to play happily together, so that as a bridge And it was an invitation to try it on for size, may I work for some of you, not for some of you, it's okay, it's perfectly fine, it's not the only way, it's just one exploration So as we turn into practice, into small group practice, the invitation is to feel into the sense of lightness, levity, play And maybe if you wanted to share one aspect of how the practice worked for you or didn't, it's perfectly fine or you can offer your silence and just say pass And maybe something I'll offer as an example, so for me as I was guiding in many different things, but one thing was that as I was inviting you to imagine As an adult, I had this memory that when my cousins used to visit, and we were roughly the same age, maybe five or six of us, we would have this fake marching band We would just make a lot of noise going from room to room to room, like one after another And I just imagined us banging on pots and pans as adults and just walking from how ludicrous, there's a sense of play Oh yeah, we don't play, but I can imagine ourselves laughing as adults, how silly that would be if we actually did that, why not So I also wanted to invite you to respect each other's privacy, whatever is said in the sacred space of the small groups, stays in the sacred space of the small groups It's not repeated elsewhere, and the invitation is to take care of yourselves, take care of others, no questions, no questioning, no leading You just offer one reflection, one short reflection, then the next person can share reflection or say pass, and then the next person and then your turn comes So we'll just make the reflections really short, maybe just 30 seconds or a minute so that other people will have a chance and will come back to us and maybe we'll share something else Another story or something else, or another way that our hearts may be found its way into lightness, into a metta, into Yeah, there's more lightness about my body and my mind, my heart, I can have this child like this lightness about me as I go about my adult practice and adult ways of being So, and let's go in alphabetical order, and again you can always just say pass, and maybe the next time your turn comes you can use, offer something or not, it's perfectly fine So I'm creating the rooms and take care of yourselves, take care of each other and have fun, this is a sandbox, see it as a sandbox for play, for levity, don't all of a sudden get so serious with your practice mates, here we go Welcome back everyone, welcome back We have some time for reflections, for reports, how was the practice for you, however the groups you can either raise your hand and bring your voice in or you can type in chat, the chat is now open to everyone If you want to type to everyone you're welcome to, if you just want to send it to me, privately you're welcome to do that as well, and it will be an anonymous reflection So, what came up, what did you notice in this practice? Either for yourself, individually or in the group Person who is an iPhone, I don't see your name Su-Jang So, when we talk about, you know, when we try who, I always thought of one, friends, I visit their family and had a fun together but the thing is that in my life I'm very playful now I'm like, yes, I was like, and then I realized when I grew up in Korea, our family was more of a lot of like strict and I was not allowed to have a really fun as a kid You know, like, you know, when I wanted to have a really fun, my mom doesn't like it and it just all those things reminds me of how I have not have fallen so long And then I finally when I grew up now since 20 years ago, I came here from Korea and I learned so much of so much of fun in life Yeah, yeah, thank you for sharing that. So, what I'm hearing is that for you actually the bringing back the memories of childhood and friendship and fun actually that doesn't work so well And I bet there are others for whom I know for others actually another person, chat, send me a chat That it doesn't quite work because childhood wasn't a happy time or a playful time and and absolutely so that's not a very helpful way in these are just invitation And yet what I'm hearing for you, Sujang, as you've become an adult, you've reparented yourself in playfulness in the ways of having fun actually having a light heartedness So basically the point of these invitations was for us to find a way to bring light heartedness, a little bit of light heartedness and usually it's in it's in childhood for many, not for everyone And it's okay, but there are other case, you know, where do you find light heartedness? Where do you find lightness? Can you bring that? And it sounds like you found that in your adult life and so bringing a sense of that into your life and into your practice Otherwise it can become so heavy. As I said this morning, of course you guys may not have been there, really this is an invitation to see the fullness in emptiness Because it every, the emptiness is the mark of existence, nothing exists independent of other things So there is this sense of freedom, of emptiness, lightness of emptiness And yet there is this fullness, there is this joy, there is the joy of possibility So that's what I'm trying to invite us to not be fixed into, it's only this way and it's only this and it's very heavy and it's very tight But just open up, so that, and each of you might have your own way, it may not be in the childhood but it might be in other ways So thank you for bringing that in, really appreciate it Thanks Thank you Any other realizations, aha moments? Nio You're still, wait, let me try again There, okay Didn't work the first time Oh it didn't, okay So, this was like a lot of fun I thought, I mean it was sort of, it was playful I guess By the way, I did imagine myself as an adult playing with a little kid on a seesaw, it was hysterical, something right out of Looney Tunes One of the things I noticed was, when you think about little kids, it's hard not to wish them well You know, right, and you know, right, even the ones who were really difficult for me, right, it really made my life miserable It was obvious they were having a freaking hard time back then, you know, and they grow up into adults who maybe are still having a hard time And it was like, it really felt just warm and compassionate to, you know, people I probably would have been happier not knowing You know, it was nice Yeah, beautiful, thank you Nio Just, yeah, beautiful I couldn't say it better, but how can you not feel, you know, goodwill, wish well for these kids And you just, yeah, you put it so well That was the intention, that was the hope of the practice So, thank you for your practice report Yay, I'm glad it worked, yay Your practice report makes me happy That's lovely, thanks Nio I'm glad you're happy I'm happy, I'm happier It was really fun I got to play with my childhood friend And then it kind of transformed into my five-year-old and my ten-year-old parts of myself And the five-year-old is the parts that I see in myself today, the jovial, the playful, the brat, you know And it was really nice, it lifted my heart I love that word you use, was levity Oh, I could feel the levity in my heart connecting to those parts of myself And the ten-year-old was kind of like there was some sadness there And it was like comforting that part of myself, it was just amazing It was transformational for me, it was wonderful to get in touch and have so much fun It was really, really fun I've been in this place where serious decisions and it's like I got to get out and just play It was so fun, thank you, Nikki Thank you, Irma, that's just lovely And I'm so also moved to hear this movement of your heart Towards compassion and kindness for the ten-year-old, five-year-old, these different versions of your solids And also to get out of this fixation of seriousness that we get into as adults, habit patterns So beautiful, thanks so much for that report I'll go to a couple of chats here One person said, my group and I agreed we need to find a deck of cards or board games at home We use them, an accessible form of play, as long as we don't fall into feeling competitive, yes And Kitu says, publicly, lightness is okay, but the permission to be happy without expecting the other shoe to drop, not so That meditation made me realize my automatic thinking in that way Thank you so much for sharing that insight, Kitu Yeah, so interesting to see that Yeah, beautiful Ali Hi, Nikki, thank you for this And also, it dovetails, the beautiful talk in the morning, I was there, it's wonderful And then, oh, we did, I mean, what I did, and then we all did, four of us in the room It just brought into the present moment and started laughing, you know, in the ten minutes that we were together And just having a, creating a sandbox and just playing it, you know, within the limitations of the Zoom And it was wonderful, and it was interesting for me how ready I was to jump into that play mode Like back in, you know, back in the childhood, being in a sandbox and playing and all that kind of stuff I was just bursting for it to come up, and thank you Thank you, it just makes me happy to know and to get a whiff of how actually, in the small group In your group, also, you jumped into play together in real time There's a sense of laughter and levity and, oh, we lose that, we lose that And it's so important, not in our lives, and in our practice Practice is life, life is practice To bring that lightheartedness when we're so hard on ourselves Okay, concentrate, alright, oh, you missed a breath Oh, sweetheart, it's okay, it's alright You know, just being a little lighthearted, a little silly with ourselves So it's really an empowered way to practice Thank you, Ellie, thanks for bringing that in And thanks to all of you for your practice, for hanging in there, exploring this interesting and perhaps unusual invitation So we've come to, Sridheva, I do see your hand, but we've come to 6.59 unless it's really quick Okay, I saw your hand disappear So I'd like to thank you all, thank you for your practice May you be well, may you be happy, may you be safe, may you have levity, may we all be of service with a little lightness of heart Thanks everyone, take good care, be well
