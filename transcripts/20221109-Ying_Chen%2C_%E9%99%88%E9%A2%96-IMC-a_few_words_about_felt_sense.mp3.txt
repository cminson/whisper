 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Yeah, thank you. And so what I brought with me is this notion of a felt sense. And so practicing through felt sense of our experience. I think it may be easiest to simply drop into the meditation and offer a few words at the beginning in terms of what I mean by felt sense. And then we'll meditate with it and see how it goes. How does that sound? Okay, so let's begin. Take a few moments to allow the body to arrive here. And being generous to the process of arriving. If you need to move the bodies to allow yourself to settle in, don't hesitate to do that. And then at the beginning of the sit, just allow yourself to drop into the global sense of the body as you feel entering into an ancient temple. Just checking in the overall posture. How the body is sitting right now. And we take our seat, right in the temple of this body. Maybe you can imagine you're settling down on your seat. And the beginning of the meditation, maybe a few long deep breaths, will allow a deeper sense of arriving. As you breathe out, let yourself arrive more fully, arriving here and now. And begin to sense into this body through the felt sense of your experience. The felt sense evokes the sense of feeling and sensing into the body. Making ourselves available to feeling and sensing. Maybe sensing into the lower half of the body, making contact with the floor or the chairs. And sensing the contact by dropping out of the ideas, concepts. Just allow the sensing to do its own thing. As if the millings of the sensors in the body can sense without us doing anything. Maybe sensing into the pressure, weight, tingling. A kaleidoscope of sensations that we don't have even words for. But the sensing is happening. Maybe you're sensing the flow of the breath in this body. The torso expanding, contracting, movements. Your mindfulness of the body in the body, this body feels and senses. Without any sense of control, simply making ourselves available to the felt sense. The felt sense may have words, may not have words. It's very immediate. Right here. This body feels and senses as its own organ of a perception. And for the rest of the sit, see if you can simply allow yourself to be available to the felt sense of your experience. Right here and right now.
