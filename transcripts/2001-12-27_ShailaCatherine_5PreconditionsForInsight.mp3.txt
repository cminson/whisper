 for insight, the foundations for insight. I think many people when they begin a meditation practice they think it's going to be easy because big deal you sit down quietly with your eyes closed. It doesn't seem very complicated or difficult but after we do that and sit down quietly with our eyes closed we may find that it's the most challenging thing that we've ever done. It can actually be shocking to realize how unruly our minds can be and how incredibly disorganized and disorienting they may be. It's the wandering mind that troubles so many meditation practitioners. This talk is based on one particular sutra from the udana, a discourse that the Buddha gave and the end of this discourse is called the magiya sutra because the Buddha is speaking to a monk named magiya and the discourse ends with this lovely verse. He says trivial thoughts, subtle thoughts, mental jerkings that follow one along. Not understanding these mental thoughts one runs back and forth with wandering mind but having known these mental thoughts the ardent and mindful one restrains them. An awakened one has entirely abandoned them, these mental jerkings that follow one along. We don't usually call them mental jerkings but somehow I think that's sort of appropriate. Do you ever sometimes just feel that you've been jerked out of a meditation or out of one particular thing by being pulled along by different various thoughts. The setting of this magiya sutra takes place at a time and magiya was the Buddha's attendant. Some of you may think of Ananda as being the Buddha's attendant but Ananda was the Buddha's attendant for the latter years of his life. Earlier on one of his attendants was named magiya and they were staying just the two of them in a fairly remote area and magiya had gone into the village for alms round and on his way back to the grove where he was staying with the Buddha he took sort of a circuitous route along the river to take a little walk for exercise and enjoy the pleasant day and as he was out for his walk between alms round and returning to the Buddha he found a beautiful mango grove just at the edge of the river where another little stream came down and made a babbling brook and the sun came into the mango grove but the mangoes were big enough the trees were big enough to provide lovely shade and he saw that mango grove and magiya thought this would be a great place to practice meditation and so he thought okay I'm gonna go back and ask for permission to come and meditate in this mango grove so he did he went back to the Buddha and after the meal requested permission to go and practice in seclusion all alone in this mango grove and the Buddha said not now magiya not now and magiya asked a second time please please give me permission to go practice in seclusion it's a beautiful mango grove it's very suitable to meditation surely I will be I will have insights in such a conducive place for meditation and the Buddha again said not now magiya and a third time this venerable magiya asked the Buddha for permission and it's understood that if somebody asks the Buddha the same question three times he says okay do as you see fit so he said okay do as you see fit and magiya the next morning after going through the alms round returned to the mango grove and went there to practice meditation well by afternoon he was going out of his mind and he was just obsessed his mind was completely obsessed by thoughts of thoughts of ill will thoughts of anger thoughts of desire and lust thoughts of confusion and delusion he was just tripping out on the wandering mind and so by afternoon he went he don't he didn't even make it through the night by afternoon he went running back to the Buddha and saying I couldn't do it I couldn't do it even in such conducive practices I couldn't stay alone and meditate and the Buddha understood the problem and he said magiya there are five preconditions that are required that guide a mind that is immature towards one that is mature and so he gave magiya the teaching on the five preconditions those of good friends virtue or strength engaging in talk on the Dharma wise effort and wisdom these five conditions support each other and create a foundation that can support our practice I find this teaching on encouragement to be realistic in assessing our own approach to practice and to give the time and the sensitivity and the attention to laying a strong and supportive foundation for our own practice I spent a number of years in India and during one of those winters I was sitting a meditation retreat that Christopher Titmus a Vipassana teacher from England was teaching now Christopher in the 60s and 70s had been a monk in Thailand and had done quite a number of traditional practices and some of them were quite austere practices challenging practices and one of the things that he did was he had sat upright had taken a vow not to lay down I forgot for how many weeks let's say six weeks but I don't remember exactly how many weeks he did it for but it was a while it's not an easy thing to do have you ever gone for even two days without laying down it's a challenging practice and so but it was one that he had actually created the conditions to be able to do so it may not have been easy but it was certainly within the ability of what he could do it was not an outrageous thing for him to try and there were many you know if somebody spends a lot of time in a monastery and has really dedicated their time morning till nights every day to a meditation practice one often experiments with different kinds of practices and different vows just to play with it just to see if the mind gets stuck if there's any reactivity just to see where they lead and so Christopher had mentioned this practice in an example in one of his talks and there was another student on the retreat who picked up on that and thought okay I'll sit the whole rest of the week without laying down well now this particular student though was struggling simply to maintain the regular schedule of sitting and walking sitting and walking sitting and walking and sleeping at night so it was sort of ridiculous for him to think that just because somebody else could do it that he should be able to do it and sometimes we think that we should be able to do things just because we want to do them we desire to do them and this can instead of being conviction it can simply be over confidence and arrogance so we need to assess ourselves we're not not not in a harsh judgmental way but simply assess what is our capacity and what have we laid the foundation to be able to sustain not to get ahead of ourselves in an extreme way in practice nor to think that we can't do something that's difficult now if we take the time to lay the foundation so when we want to undertake something we consider have we sufficiently trained our minds and created the conditions that would support that endeavor it's not such a difficult question to ask but too often we just ask if I want to do it rather than have I created the conditions to support it so I want to take a few minutes to look at each one of these conditions systematically and the first one is considered good friends who we associate with influences how we think and how we act that's not a surprising concept is it how many people are parents here a few of you you know how the how the influence of of friends the effect of friends have on children who they associate with what their interests are every alcoholic knows the effect that friends have on either staying sober or drinking who we associate with influences how we think and how we act were influenced simply by the people that's we spend time with if we want to cultivate an ability whatever that is one of the first steps is simply to associate with other people who have already cultivated that ability whether it's a technical skill or an interest a philosophical interest of value whatever it may be one the very first simple step is association so that we associate them with people who share that interest but in the buddha dharma the term good friend kali on a mitra particularly means people who support our progress on the noble eightfold path they're the friends who support realization awakening and helps us stay in our inquiry into the truth of things a good friend helps us sustain our practice this doesn't necessarily mean their cheerleaders for us good friends can take many forms one time when I was practicing in Thailand I was staying at a monastery of Ajahn Dhamma Dora and it happened that there were very few people who spoke English at this monastery and I didn't speak much time and so what would happen is each evening a nun who spoke almost no English would still come and attempt to give me meditation instructions attempt to be my good friend and it was quite successful actually even without words she would use gestures and diagrams and then try to say something about the meditation practice and then we would simply meditate together so we'd sit facing each other knee to knee and we just sit together for an hour then she'd go off and the next day she'd come back and she'd she talk a little bit about the standing posture and then we would just stand face to face doing what standing meditation for an hour and she'd go off in the next evening she'd knock knock on my door again and she'd sort of describe and signal how to do walking meditation and then we would just walk back and forth together then she'd go off and the next day knock knock right at my door she would demonstrate reclining meditation which has become one of my favorite postures and and then we would simply do reclining meditation together for an hour so there wasn't a lot of conversation virtually none but I really felt as though that interaction embodied what a good friend is in the Dharma somebody who supports and sustains practice and isn't afraid of a little bit of social discomfort of not knowing what to say or not feeling like she could communicate well enough what she did was sustain my practice and encourage practice a good friend also can inspire us and correct our own negative thoughts our own reactions or our own wrong wrong thinking not just through their words but through their natural kindness and there's a story from the farmer's digest that tells this took place in the days when an ice cream sundae cost a lot less and it takes place with the story tells of a ten-year-old boy who entered a hotel coffee shop and sat down at a table a waitress came up and asked for his order and he asked the waitress how much is an ice cream sundae and the waitress said 50 cents so then the little boy put his hand in his pocket pulled at his coins and took a few minutes sort of counting his coins and then he asked the waitress how much is a plain ice cream and the waitress said 35 cents by this time she was getting kind of impatient some other customers had come to the door and were waiting for tables and here was this boy kind of counting his nickels and his pennies and so she was kind of curt to him a little bit brusque and so he said I'll take that plain ice cream please so she went and got the ice cream put it on the table with the bill and went to and attended to the other customers and didn't really come back to the table until after the boy had left the boy had finished his ice cream paid the cashier and left and so the the waitress came back and she actually began to cry as she wiped down the table because their place neatly beside the empty ice cream dish were two nickels and five pennies he couldn't have the ice cream sundae because he wanted to have enough left to leave her a tip now I like that story because very often we live guarded expecting the worst from people in a way not allowing people to be our good friends we protect ourselves from intimacy we protect ourselves from connection and we may even go so far as to treat our capacity to love as a weakness rather than finding strength through the vulnerability of our hearts when I was traveling in Asia I had a stopover in Korea one time and I had been in Asia for a number of years and over the years my heart had actually gotten quite hardened and when somebody would come up to me on the street to ask me a question or to offer help I would assume that they were going to take advantage of me and it was so shocking to be in South Korea because of the incredible hospitality that the cult that culture extended towards me they have a particular appreciation and gratitude towards Americans as well as a curiosity to somebody who who it looks so different and I was traveling in the southern part of South Korea and there were very few signs in ink there were almost no signs in English for anything and I didn't know Korean and I was traveling alone and so I would open up I'd you know I'd try and find a hotel and you know everything is written in that kind of script those characters so I'd be comparing the characters in the glossary that say hotel to the signs on the various buildings to try and figure out which one was a hotel so that I could go in and invariably if I stopped for a moment and opened my book somebody would come up and ask what I needed and if I was saying that I would look was looking for a hotel they would then help me find the hotel carry my bags and talk to the manager make sure I got a good price go into the room make sure it was clean and then leave me all safe in there and then trot off it was very strange at first I would just I just expected them to like you know ask for black sheesh or want to show me their cousin silk factory or I don't know what but they didn't they just offered I would go into noodle shops to eat a meal and have my meal ask the waitress for the bill and find that somebody had already paid for it and had left the restaurant sometime before just somebody else who was a customer would pay for mine when they paid for theirs and it was extraordinary didn't just happen once almost every day there was something that I just found oh this is extraordinary I go wait for a bus and a group of schoolgirls would come by and start to talk to me and practice their English and then they would figure out that I was waiting for a particular bus well it's hard to figure out the buses because again they're not in English and so they would wait for me one time this group of six girls waited 40 minutes before the next before the bus that I needed came they got me on the bus told the driver what I wanted where to let me off how much it was arranged the hopping and it just worked quite beautifully but I found that that experience not only it made me really appreciate the warmth of strangers the warmth of their kindness and how that can just soften a heart that may have grown hard over years of travel so our good friends can come in many forms they may be personal friends they may be friends of the world people that we may never have met and may never meet who simply inspire us inspire our ethics inspire our our commitments to awakening they may be people like the Dalai Lama or a poet that we may have never met but to the extent that they direct us towards freedom and truth I think they can be called our good friends so take a moment just to reflect who would you count as your dear friends as your good friends your Kali on a Mitra now this system of the five preconditions is quite progressive so it's expected that one who has the condition of good friends will develop virtue and restraint and this virtue and restraint is the area of attention to how is it that we operate in terms of our action our conduct in the world Suzuki Roshi was musing musing what how do you make a cow feel free and at ease and he thought you give her a fenced in pasture I think the need for structure is quite okay it's quite a valuable aspect for our lives and our practice and we can use the training precepts as part of the structure for our practice the precept to make a commitment to not take life to not steal to not cause harm with our sexuality through deceit rape or force of any kind to not lie or use abusive language and to not use substances that intoxicate the mind a commitment to these precepts creates a container of safety for our own minds as well as for those we associate with we're helping to sustain an environment of peace trust and ease and this environment both internally and externally then supports the steadiness and concentration of our minds and our meditation if we break the precepts if we cause harm through our actions it's very likely that we don't have much balance around the reactions of mind of wanting and not wanting desire and aversion it's very likely that we react very quickly to those impulses of seeing something pleasant and grabbing for it seeing something unpleasant and pushing it away so these precepts give us a little bit of space around the tendency to react that in that space there's a great opportunity for peace and for ease because we're not agitating the mind by causing harm we're not fostering worry regret guilt remorse or distrust by harming others sometimes that can be environmental social distrust sometimes it can simply be internal distrust the internal agitation of a mind that doesn't rest that doesn't trust itself so we use restraint and structure to protect ourselves from these tendencies so it's understood that in the sequence of the five preconditions one who has good friends and restraint will then devote their speech to talk on the Dharma so engaging in Dharma talk is engaging in talk that is useful inspiring and supportive of practice just reflect for a minute how often do you speak about the Dharma how often does it actually come up in your daily speech the Dharma may not just be what happens when you sit in meditation and feel the sensations of your breath but the Dharma is the is the Dharma of awakening the dissolution of suffering it includes ethic speech conduct as well as the subtle movements of mind why speech is to speak what is true and what is useful how much of what you speak is both true and useful an awful lot of contemporary speech is relatively useless probably the most extreme form of uselessness is to talk about the lives of TV characters and some people can do that quite a lot in gossip or in conversations at the office or here or there but a lot of talk just seems harmless and innocuous it just seems to be socially what one does to pass the time but is it just passing the time or is it on a more subtle level increasing distraction and confusion in the mind creating the conditions for distraction how do we use our speech our conversations or our reading or TV or the cassettes we listen to or the talk shows we listen to how do we use those and how do they affect us when speech is considered as a precondition it's not only considered we were asked to not only reflect upon speech that is harmful and ceased to do harmful speech you know like gossip and backbiting and false speech and rude speech but instead to develop an interest in actually speaking the Dharma to use the time in our conversations to find the dissolution of suffering there's a paragraph in the magia suta I just like to read because it sort of tells what a little bit more about this this speech furthermore magia the Buddha is speaking a biku met a monk obtains at will without no trouble or difficulty talk that is a facing a help in opening up the mind and which conduces to complete turning away dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and nirvana that is talk about fewness of wishes talk about contentment talk about seclusion talk about being non gregarious talk about putting forth energy talk about virtue talk about concentration talk about wisdom talk about deliverance talk about the knowledge and vision of deliverance when knowledge and deliverance is as yet in mature magia this is the third thing that leads to its maturity so when you meet a friend for dinner or for lunch do you ever talk about the Dharma I'd encourage you to try it if it's an interest if it's interesting enough you to spend a Thursday evening here it's certainly interesting enough to have a conversation over a salad or a pizza or whatever it is you're eating this doesn't mean that you need to be pretentious about it nor does it mean that you should associate only with Buddhists but I think it gives us the encouragement to cross the linguistic and the cultural divisions so that we learn how to communicate with people who are practicing in different religions different traditions in different ways so we can still find a conversation about liberation about freedom of mind about realization without getting entangled by the confusions of semantics or traditions last year when I was living here and teaching in this community I was really valued the opportunity I had to teach with a local priest in Palo Alto and we had that wonderful day-long event that was co-sponsored between this community and a Catholic community in Palo Alto and one of the things that I valued so much about that day was to me it represented an opportunity to cross the religious barriers so that we explored the Dharma together the Dharma of Buddha and the Dharma of Christ so with these preconditions it's expected that one who has good friends restraint and talk of the Dharma will endeavor to apply wise effort the effort to abandon the unwholesome and cultivate the wholesome the effort to abandon the unwholesome and cultivate the wholesome requires a commitment of energy a dedication to put ourselves forth to try to persevere it's can sometimes be like splitting wood we may want to split some firewood and so we strike the wood with an axe and we may strike it many times say we strike it 18 times and it isn't until the 19th time that the that it actually splits the wood those previous 18 strikes were not wasted they were an important part of the effort that finally created the possibility for that 19th strike to be successful so with these five preconditions it's expected that one who has the condition of good friends virtue talk on the Dharma and wise effort will that in in such a one wisdom concerning impermanence will grow so this is wisdom is the penetrative understanding of the arising and passing of phenomenon it's a deep insight into the truth of impermanence usually we miss this perception of impermanence because we're so familiar with change that we don't bother to notice it we relate to the conceptual level of experience the superficial level of perception thinking things are just the way that we see them without taking the time to look closer in almost through a microscope to see the changing nature of experience phenomenon is changing so rapidly but if we don't see this change the aspect of change the aspect of impermanence then we're very likely to try to hold on to grasp and to cling phenomenon to claim experience but the direct perception of change releases this undercurrent of clinging so it's important to create the preconditions and to take the time to develop them to honestly reflect upon our own lifestyle are we creating the conditions for a stable mind or are we can be creating the conditions for a distracted mind it doesn't work to just cram meditation practice or stress reduction techniques into our lives we need to take a moment and evaluate just reflect and consider what it is that our lifestyle is cultivating so I've spoken about these five preconditions good friends virtue restraint talk on the Dharma effort and wisdom concerning impermanence I'd like you to reflect for a moment and see are there any that are particularly strong already developed you know you're good at those and are there any that are kind of weak if you reflected honestly you'd say you know I need to give a little bit more attention to that one just reflect for yourself and consider if there's something that you can do to cultivate that precondition that may be weak and since this is the time of year for New Year's resolutions I'd like you to just take a moment just to turn to somebody near you maybe in pairs of two or if three people are nearby just to speak for a minute share a little bit of what it is you felt was weak and what it is that you might do to cultivate it sometimes an area is weak because we don't know how to cultivate it and chances are we all have different weak areas and maybe the person that you're speaking with might have a suggestion as to what you can do to cultivate it and we'll just just for a couple of minutes you know a minute each so maybe for three or four minutes we'll just share amongst yourself and then we'll come back to the whole group just turn to somebody introduce your name and share your weakness I know that was only a few minutes I hope most of you had a chance to share or reflect or if not at least listen is there anything that you would like to discuss or ask or share or bring on this topic of the these conditions I hope you're this is a very traditional teaching and when I found this sutra I was totally delighted because I thought you know this could have been written right now it doesn't seem archaic to me at all it seems very very practical very in a way obvious but but but very very practical and it's one of the things that I find so delightful in reading the sutras of the Buddha how incredible incredibly contemporary those teachings feel to me this doesn't feel like something that was only useful for monks 2600 years ago but it feels just as useful for my life and my practice so that's part of why I had wanted to share this sutra with you any comments discussion is there any particular kind of structure that you're looking for is there just a tendency for dispersing to the discipline a commitment to a daily sitting routine a very strong commitment to the precepts I mean the precepts and whatever area like to really choose a precept each week and take it very very consciously because those that the precepts to refine the precepts create the conditions for a very disciplined mind I'm not a restricted mind but disciplined mind and that that gives us a great deal of ability to then direct our minds and the directions that we want to go rather than directions that the tendencies pull us at the time for a disciplined meditation practice structure like coming to a sitting group once a week creates a community structure to hold the practice as well those three features of a weekly sitting practice a daily sitting practice and you define the times and the places for yourself but to make some commitment to that and a periodic retreat you know choose for yourself at whatever level of retreat practice you're at if you've never done a retreat practice you may say okay in the next six months I'm gonna do three day longs and you put them on your calendar and you find a way to do them if you've already done a bunch of day longs you might say okay in the next six months I'm gonna try and find an opportunity to sit one or two weekends if you've or you might say okay I know I love retreat practice but it's just hard to find the time to do it so you say okay I'm gonna take a week off from work schedule it into it so you structure in what it is you want to do and then you create the container for yourself which is nice because then the discipline comes from yourself you know you choose the time you choose the way it's not somebody telling you you have to do it it's you choose and then you create those disciplines and your structures for yourself you don't have to do it for the whole rest of your life if you want to experiment with different commitments you can say okay for the next so long I like structure myself I find it really valuable if I want to undertake a practice say I want to do met time I might say okay for the next year I'm gonna do met for you know 20 minutes every day or something it's not a lifetime forever commitment and it's something that I can manage then I see where that where that leads and then at the end of it choose well okay do I want to continue that or not other thoughts comments questions please okay yes yeah yeah oh no that's really really important to take the time to find what works and then to find a relationship to the structure that you've undertaken that is a skill for relationship because we don't it's not a skill for relationship to clean structure or to identify our identity as being the one who performs the structure so that then we have to perform the structure we have to find a skillful relationship to whatever structures we undertake so that they support our realization and support the possibility of living in a life of spiritual depth and non-harming and don't just become a ritual that we follow so yes that's important yeah and you can do it with an attitude of play too you can have some curiosity oh I've heard that a daily practice is something that some other people like maybe I should could try it I had a I have a student in New Mer in Albuquerque who just made a commitment to sit as she was kind of coming and going and doing this or that for quite a few years and she finally said okay for one month I'm gonna sit every day for 30 minutes and and I don't have to do this the whole rest of my life I'm just gonna do it for 30 days and just see if I like it and I didn't even suggest it to her she came at the end of the 30 days to a one-to-one meeting with me and said you know something I really like this I think I want to continue and she had tried it in the spirit of just wanting to see what it was other people valued because she's has a very a mind that goes here and there very like a she's a real planner and it was very interesting but it was the spirit of it it was the interest it was the curiosity and the sense that she undertook it herself and she knew she could do it I mean anybody can do that for 30 days and then she could choose herself whether or not to continue it yeah it's based on experience see this is important to actually assess the place that we're looking from are we making a decision based on actual knowledge or are we making a decision based on what if we haven't actually tried something some kind of self-doubt some kind of fear we may not be able to do it may look weird I don't know it's kind of cool in this now yeah well I want to come to the end as we're approaching 830 but it's very nice to be here with you and to be here at the end of this year and I hope I will see some of you on Saturday the fifth for a morning of yoga and meditation I'm quite looking forward to it myself so have a good evening and a very happy new year
