 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good day everyone. Dear Sangha from around the world, I'm delighted to be with you today supporting, our practice and Gil taking a vacation, a hiking vacation with his wife. So delighted to be here practicing with you today. Thank you for the warm welcomes. So, so another week, another week, another opportunity to cultivate our hearts and minds. So let us begin to practice together and I will introduce the theme for this week. Gently in the guidance and talk more about it during the Dharma. So, so let us begin. So let us begin. I invite you to settle in your seat, to land in your body. Arriving, arriving in this moment. Fully inhabiting, fully inhabiting. This moment with whatever is arising. Let's start by acknowledging whatever is here. Whether it's body aches, the mind that is calm or distracted or anxious or sadness in the heart or gladness in the heart, expectation, disappointment, joy. Whatever is arising in the heart and the mind and the body. Let's greet it first. Let's greet it with a smile. It's like this right now. And smilingly, smilingly bowing to everything that is present in this world internally, in this world externally. Bowing, appreciating what is, even if it's a crowd of sorrows. And inviting the thoughts, the heartache, whatever there might be to be here. They don't have to be pushed away, go away, but is it okay for them to just settle and allow yourself and allow you to give your heart to stillness and silence for just a few minutes? Taking, taking time, taking a moment of refuge. In this fathom long body, taking a moment of refuge, turning our gaze inward. Greeting simplicity, the feet simply touching the earth, the ground. Ah, feeling, feeling the simplicity, the joy, receiving. Receiving this groundedness. Receiving, receiving. Receiving, receiving sensations of your bottom on the cushion. Connecting, rooted, landed on the earth. Receiving the sensations of the hand. Touching each other and touching your lap. Coolness, warmness. The uncountably many contact points. For the next in breath, receiving ease with the breath, ah, with the out breath. Letting go, letting go of any tension, tightness, holding in the muscles in the body. And landing more deeply, connecting more to yourself in this moment in time, this morning, afternoon, evening. This precious moment in time that has never been and never will be again. Like this, the gift of this moment, like this, gift of this moment of our lives. Receiving, receiving, receiving the in breath. Magnificent, amazing to be alive. This body knowing how to breathe itself. Letting go, letting go of the out breath into this moment, into the unique wakefulness of this moment. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. This is the moment in time that has never been and never will be again. Can we receive what is offered just as it is offered? Can we receive the breath just as it is offered? Deep, shallow, whatever it is, with graciousness. Can we receive each gift, the entirety of each gift, the entirety of each breath, beginning, middle, and end. Of the in-breath, beginning, middle, and end of the out-breath. Can we receive this body, sensations of the body, whatever is presenting itself with an open heart, with an open heart, not picking and choosing, but with an open heart, wholeheartedness, opening the gates of our hearts. Just for this period, it's okay, you can close it later if it doesn't feel safe, but see if you can experiment. Just this period, see what it feels like to try on this attitude of openness and generosity of perspective for yourself. So, each breath, each sensation, each ache in the body was a gift. It was a gift to teach us something, to point something out, and if only we would open up our hearts, or generously receive, even if it's challenging conditions. This is my hope. Of course there can be joys, 10,000 joys, as well as the 10,000 sorrows. Can we receive? Can we receive? Can we receive, not go out and get for this moment, but train our hearts, our minds in just receiving. Releasing the body, relaxing and receiving. And imagine the next period of time is a gift to yourself, made a gift to yourself. Nothing needs to happen. You're not supposed to accomplish or do anything. You can do meditation. No. It's a gift. It's a gift of time. Just sit and receive. See how this shift in attitude can change your body, your breath and the ease of being here. Just relax and receive this gift. You're not supposed to accomplish or do anything. And if you notice the mind wandering, thinking, come back to your mind. Come back sweetie. Nothing to do right now. This is a gift of time to just relax in this body and be. Just receive being a gift of being. Releasing the body, relaxing and receiving. Thank you. Have a nice day. you you you you you Relaxing, receiving. The breath, the in-breath, letting go of the out-breath. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. Relaxing, receiving. What else are we receiving in this moment? Besides the breath. A chair or a cushion that's supporting us. For our head, likely. Some food that we have eaten that's giving us energy in this moment. So, so many things. Technology with which we can be together in sangha and practice. The works of uncountably many people who have contributed to our well-being to support us in this moment. We are receiving so much in this moment. Connected through this web of humanity. Not to be overwhelmed. Just to sit, just to sit in this web. In this web of receiving and giving. Relaxing into it. Just. Graciously. Smiling, we receive. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And trusting that there is goodness generated. From our coming together, showing up, showing up and practicing. That there's goodness generated. And to generously share that. As if sprinkling, as if sprinkling this goodness all over the world. May the goodness generated be shared with all beings, be a cause and condition. For their well-being in ways I cannot fathom. May this goodness be a cause and condition for my well-being, the well-being of all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free.
