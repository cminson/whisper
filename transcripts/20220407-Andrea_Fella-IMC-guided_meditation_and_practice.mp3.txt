 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It can be helpful to just kind of take stock, take kind of a sense of how you are in this moment. Just to begin with yourself as you are. How are you right now? And exploring the possibility of being with yourself as you are. Checking in, is there tension or ease right now? Is the mind agitated or calm? Is the body comfortable or uncomfortable? Just starting with yourself as you are. Connecting with ourselves with mindfulness, it can be a very kind thing to do for ourselves. Connecting with how we are. If a friend were to ask us this, how are you? I really mean it. We would be willing to sit there with us however we were. We would be felt as very connecting, would be felt as a deep kind of being seen. And sometimes that's something that we deeply wish for in our relationships, in our lives to be seen. And our mindfulness practice, being with ourselves in that way, would be a deep kind of being seen. Seen even more deeply than a dear friend can see us. So can you be with yourself? How are you right now? And how does it feel to connect with yourself like this? Starting with this kind of very open, friendly, allowing attitude towards ourselves, towards our experience. Perhaps we can also incline a little bit towards releasing any tension that might be there, if it's possible. Sometimes it's not. Perhaps being with ourselves can be a doorway or an avenue into allowing a little bit of relaxation. Maybe the body can relax. And maybe the mind can also soften, let go of any worries or concerns. And just explore being here with yourself right now, right here. As you explore being with yourself, what's the most obvious or easy thing to connect with in your experience? Maybe something simple like the breath. Or perhaps it's hearing right now as I'm speaking, the shifting between the sound of my voice and the moments of silence between the words. Sounds in your environment. Or maybe it's body sensation, pressure points, contact points of hands, feet, hips, touching the chair, whatever you're sitting on. Maybe a more general sense of the body as a whole, the overall feeling of the body sitting. It can sometimes happen that one of the, some particular experience such as the breath is kind of the main place where we land. And yet landing there doesn't have to exclude other experience. And so perhaps you may be connecting with some particular aspect of experience, but then also noticing other experience come and go. Maybe there's a gentle connection to the breath or hearing. But also the recognition that around that experience there are other sensations happening. We can have an approach of and with our mindfulness practice may connect with the breath, but notice also hearing is happening. And other body's sensations are happening and the breath. And the mind be relaxed and receive, allow. What wants to show up? What is showing up? What experiences are happening? Aware. We may also notice at times an emotion or mood flow through even as we may stay connected with a particular field of experience. And thoughts might go through. We can have thoughts happen and know they're happening. And that's the breathing and a thought. We may know that we are aware of a thought. Often when we're aware of thoughts, they don't tend to last very long and that's okay. We also don't have to push them away. We don't have to have some idea that thoughts are a problem in meditation. The breathing and the thought, body sensations and the thought. The relaxed, receptive quality of mind can support our capacity to recognize thinking. And there will be times when thinking carries us away, hooks us into its content and we lose mindfulness. At some point, mindfulness will return. In that moment, it can be useful first of all to really acknowledge that mindfulness is back. Oh, awareness is back. What have I become aware of? Often in that moment, it's thinking. And so noticing that, aware of thinking in that moment. Another useful thing to do in that moment is to check in. How are you now? Like we checked in at the beginning, how are you? In a broad way, after the mind has gone off into thought, when the mindfulness returns, it's a really useful time to just check in again. How am I right now? The mind was wandering. How am I right now? No judgment about how you are again. That dear friend just saying, how are you? I'll be here for a few moments. How are you now? How are you? And as you reconnect with how you are, remember what it means to be present with yourself, be with yourself. And as it's supportive, you can reconnect with whatever is obvious or useful to connect with. Maybe the breath, body sensations, hearing, or perhaps simply the flow of changing experience. For some, that can be more useful than picking some experience out of the field. And so that's more useful for you. Allowing that, just noticing the changing, dancing flow of this human life. In a way that is the full expression of the and practice. And this, and this too. And this, and this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
