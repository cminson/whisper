Good day from this Monday in March.
And so today we're beginning the fourth foundation for awareness,
for support, for developing a heightened sense of clarity, awareness,
that begins to move us into our potential for liberation and freedom.
And all along, this is out of the direction that the Satya Bhattana is.
Mindfulness practice is going.
It's going to greater clarity so that there's really clear mindfulness.
I like the expression lucid mindfulness, that it's not simply just a simple knowing and experience.
There's something about the knowing which has qualities of clarity, lucidity, stillness, freedom, non-reactivity, equanimity.
Something that's really special about the knowing, the awareness itself,
that comes from being settled, being concentrated, getting calm, and having a heightened capacity to be aware.
Almost like awareness and knowing is a muscle that gets stronger.
And also that comes from being less preoccupied in our attachments, less preoccupied with our concerns, our preoccupations.
And then the natural capacity for knowing, for awareness can shine, can be there.
And to have the naturalness of it, almost the spontaneity of it, or the simplicity of it,
just arising and being there without a lot of agency, is one of the stepping stones of developing mindfulness.
At first there's more agency, and then over time it's more a matter of the agency is more about getting out of the way and letting go.
And so then we come to the fourth foundation of mindfulness, and like the second and third,
there's a journey through this where at the beginning it talks about three different ways that the mind gets caught up,
gets attached, gets entangled with experience.
And then it talks about two ways in which the mind moves towards disentanglement, towards freedom.
And so there's a kind of a journey from being attached to becoming free.
And that journey goes first through what's called the five hindrances.
Then it goes through what's called the five aggregates.
Then the five fetters, the six fetters, the six ways that we get entangled or fettered,
knotted up in the experiences of the senses.
And then that's the ways we get caught up.
And then the freedom has to do with the seven factors of awakening and then the four noble truths.
And so there's a journey through this, and I love it that we start with the ways we get caught up and hung up.
Because we understand that. The idea is to become wise about this.
If you're feeling like you're supposed to quickly get to some beautiful state, wonderful state,
it might be that you're not going to take the time to really know yourself in a deep way
and know how you get entangled or know the entanglement itself,
so that in the future you're not going to get tricked by it.
If you know it well, you won't be tricked and be pulled into its orbit and make mistakes and all that.
So taking our time.
So this week is the five hindrances, and we'll do one day on each hindrance.
But today, a little bit of introduction for it.
In the teachings of the Buddha, the hindrances are often paired with the seven factors of awakening.
These are beautiful qualities of mind that arise as we practice.
The mindfulness itself, investigation, effort, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity.
Many texts the Buddha teaches, he puts these together where one is the problem, one is what we're overcoming,
and the other is what grows and develops as a result instead of that.
So these two have different impacts on us.
The hindrances cover over our wisdom, make wisdom difficult to have access to it.
They contract the mind, they limit the mind.
The seven factors of awakening allow for the functioning of wisdom, allow for an expansive mind, open mind, free mind.
And so one kind of pulls us down and one lifts us up in a certain way.
An image in the suttas is used for this covering-over effect of the hindrances is that of a tree growing in the forest,
but there's a larger tree that's covering it over.
So the small tree doesn't get any light, so it's stunted.
It doesn't really grow and develop.
And the hindrances are that stunting, that covering-over that keeps the light of awareness from operating clearly.
When the light of awareness is free, then the tree of bodhi, the tree of awakening, can grow within us.
And that tree, some people will call the sap of that tree, are the seven factors of awakening.
And so then the light of awareness really kind of lets it grow and develop.
And so the idea is to let go over, be free of these obscuring qualities of the hindrances
so that something beautiful can grow and develop instead in that space, in that clearing in the forest.
So the first hindrance is in the sattipattanasuta, essential desires.
In the teachings of the Buddha, sometimes it's an alternative thing.
It's called avariciousness, wanting things.
So the first one is the usual one, essential desire, wanting desires, pleasure, essential pleasures of all kinds.
And the alternative is wanting things, to acquire things, more and more stuff.
Both can be a big entanglement.
And sometimes people just call it desire, the first hindrance, to cover all those things.
But the problem with calling it desire is not all desires are problematic.
The desire to be free of the hindrances may be really healthy and appropriate.
But sensual desire and wanting things, wanting sensual pleasure and wanting things.
There are innocent versions of this kind of desire, it's innocent to want something.
I've run out of toothpaste so I'd like to have a new tube of toothpaste.
It's an innocent, maybe beautiful, ways of having desires for pleasure that are, you know, it's simple and easy.
And so you want to cook your broccoli just to the right tenderness, just to the right way so that when you eat it, there's pleasure in eating it.
It feels nourishing and delightful and fresh to eat it.
It can be innocent.
But then what is not innocent is desires that we're grabbed by, we're caught by, we're preoccupied by.
And there's a kind of a become sometimes a strong enough kind of biological force within us behind that.
Like sometimes it's strong enough to be like propellant fuel for a rocket.
It's so powerful, some forms of sensual desire that, you know, it's almost like it's hard not to kind of follow along the strength of it.
And for the purposes of Satipata, it's not like it's immoral or bad or wrong to have sensual desire.
It just happens to be that it makes it difficult for this clarity of awareness to grow.
This openness, expanded mind to grow.
This quiet still place of freedom to show itself.
And since that's what the direction we're going, we want to learn how to be mindful of sensual desire so it supports that direction.
It doesn't support freedom to go along with sensual desires, spend time in meditation thinking about sexual fantasies,
thinking about food, thinking about trying to make meditation as pleasant and enjoyable as you can.
Like to recapture past meditation experience where there was all kinds of wonderful, you know, bliss in meditation.
And the desire for that bliss again is just another desire for sensual pleasure.
And so what we do is rather than negating them or condemning them, it's just a very clear and purposeful and dedicated mindfulness.
This is sensual desire. Sensual desire is present.
And then getting to know it, feel it.
I find it very useful to feel it physically.
There's something about feeling the physicality of desire that for me very quickly shows me the downside of it
and the way in which the body is not really pleasant to be caught in the force of sensual desire.
Even sensual pleasure might be pleasant.
The force of this drive for it is not.
It's kind of a loss, a kind of alienation for myself in having it there.
And then know when it's absent.
There are times that meditation deepens that there's no sensual desire at all.
And this is actually very important to register that, to take that in and get to know what that's like, to know the benefits the way there's clarity and freedom or ease.
You can breathe more easily or you're not being pushed by some kind of inner force.
So the instructions are know when it's present and know when it's absent.
As we know the absence of it, that gives us a new possibility.
And this is really getting down to the heart of what the insight of the whole purpose of Satvatana.
And that is to see, be present enough and still enough or clear enough to see how any phenomenon at all, any experience at all, see it arise, see it appear.
And nothing is there all the time.
When anything that qualifies as an experience is in perception for a while, it appears and then it disappears.
And when the mind is quiet enough and not involved in thoughts, you can start seeing this arising of sensual desire and you might see it's passing.
And seeing their arising, it's easier to have a very different, freer, more disentangled relationship with sensual desire when you see it first arise than if it's already there full blown.
And so to be right there and see it there or there it is, then it's easier to just leave it alone.
And it's easier to abandon it, to let go of it.
And this exercising of our capacity to let go, let go of the clinging, the wanting, the reaching for, is a wonderful thing to cultivate and develop.
And so the way that Buddha describes working with sensual desires, one knows sensual desire is present when it's present.
One knows it's absent when it's absent.
One knows that it's arising when it arises.
And one knows the abandoning of it, letting go of it when it's let go of.
And then if that's thorough enough and deep enough, then it leads, can lead to a deep freedom where we realize that the sensual desire is no longer there and is not going to arise again,
maybe at least in that meditation session.
There's such a clarity of fullness, of such full clarity, such peacefulness, such subtleness, such something that it's like, wow, this is so good.
Sensual desire is not going to arise in this context because it just feels so free.
The freedom is so good.
So to become wise about the hindrances, to become wise about how the hindrances obscure wisdom.
And the Buddha said, fools who know their fools to that extent are wise.
So to use that, practitioners who know they've lost their wisdom are starting to become wise.
And so for the next 24 hours until we meet again, I'd encourage you to notice sensual desire, desire for sensual pleasures, desires for comfort that might exist for you.
And there's lots of them through the day for most people.
And see if you can notice when it's present, when it's absent, in particular, see what's the opportunity, what happens for you when you see it, when it just arises, or there it is.
That's a fascinating place.
So hopefully you'll get wiser over these next hours around sensual desire, and then we'll continue tomorrow.
Thank you.
