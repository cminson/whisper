 Allowing a relaxation of body. Allowing that relaxation is a supportive condition for awareness. So allowing the body to relax. Maybe areas just scanning through the body and seeing if there are areas where you're holding tension and if possible allowing a relaxation consciously softening those areas. Maybe particularly around the face. The jaw, the neck, the shoulders. So much kind of unconscious tension can be held in that area softening the face, jaw, the neck, shoulders. Seeing too if the arms and hands can relax, torso, all of those muscles around the rib cage. Sometimes I find as I orient to that area around the rib cage and just attune to a relaxing of that area, very naturally a deeper breath comes in. So you could try seeing if a deeper breath might support a relaxation of that area. Relaxing the stomach and abdomen, the lower back and hips, the legs and the feet. And maybe too it's possible that there can be a relaxation more deeply inside the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. All of this exploration of relaxation of the body can support our mind to be able to relax a little bit. Seeing if there can be a softening of any mental tension that might be happening. Maybe thinking about as Gil sometimes suggests as if the brain were a muscle. Maybe the brain can relax. Meditation of body and mind can make it more easeful, natural to just be here, be present with what's happening in the present moment. Sometimes being aware, aware of this body sitting, aware of breathing. Can this awareness simply be receiving sensations and breath in a relaxed way? Settling back as awareness becomes natural can happen with this relaxation as a foundation. We can find that we don't have to work or aim or focus in order for awareness to be here. Very naturally, awareness is receiving some aspects of our experience, so what is awareness aware of right now? Maybe the body with its temperatures and sensations, pressure, coolness, heat, contact of body against chair, cushion, or bench. Maybe some energetic sensations, vibration, tingling, pulsing. Just receiving what's obvious with the body and maybe it's a broader sense of being aware of body, the body sitting. Maybe there's a recognition of hearing the sound of my voice, any sounds in your room, wherever you are, ambient noise, distant sounds, subtle sounds, obvious sounds. And again, the ear will naturally just receive sound. You can settle back and see what sounds are coming to us. You don't have to work to hear. And then bring relaxation as a support for receiving just what is obvious. Maybe thoughts or moods are obvious or present. This broader settling back and simply receiving what is obvious. This is one way awareness can function. You don't need to be directing the attention in order to be aware. And this can be a very relaxed form of practice, can be. For some, it may feel more easeful to choose a particular area or experience to settle with such as the breath or maybe body sensation. If that is more easeful for you and your practice, exploring the possibility of while attending to that, while being with that experience, maybe exploring that, being with the breath or being with the body. Perhaps the attention is landing on a narrower field of sensations there, but maybe still that experience can be received. Receiving the breath instead of trying to focus on it is naturally available to be already known about the breath. Relax and receive. Relax, relax. Relax. And of course, the mind will wander. It will pick up on some thought or some trajectory of a sensation leading to a thought. And it will just wander out of the present moment and get hooked into a world of thinking. While that's happening, there's not much to do about it. And yet there will be a moment when the mind remembers mindfulness. Maybe a moment, hopefully will be a moment. Oh, aware again. In that moment of remembering awareness again. People to notice what's here and if there has been some tension that has crept in during the wandering. It can be really useful to just allow the body to relax again. Just take some time to remember relaxation of body and mind will support awareness. Support mindfulness. There's nothing we need to rush back to to focus on. Form that relaxation of body and mind to support an awareness that receives. Perhaps receiving just whatever is obvious. Or maybe for some of you receiving the breath, the body sensations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
