So warm greetings to you all. 
And for this week I'd like to take the theme of the Dharma, the Dharma that the Buddha taught. 
And there is an ancient teaching about this Dharma that the Buddha taught that describes how someone understands the Dharma when they have a confirmed confidence in the Dharma, in the Buddha, in the practice that we're doing. 
And this idea of confirmed confidence means that we know something, we've experienced something for ourselves, that we know what the Dharma is about. 
We know something in the Dharma that there's a confidence, a deep sense of maybe faith, maybe trust. 
But the most common way to talk about this is confidence, which is peaceful, a peaceful confidence. 
And this, and so to practice to come to enough to have one's own personal experience, that from that experience one feels, oh this Dharma, this teachings of the Buddha, this world of practice is something I know for myself that well enough that I have confidence in it. 
And one of the kind of tests for this confidence is if someone comes along, and like for example I came along and came down, sat down one of these 7 am sittings, and I said, well you know something? I was completely wrong that all the Dharma stuff that we've been teaching and doing, you know it's not really, you know, right? And you know there's probably better things to do with your life, and you know I recommend you to kind of give it up. 
And when one has a confirmed confidence, because one has experienced the benefits and the transformations and the freedom from this practice, that it doesn't matter what I say, because you would know, you know, well I'm sorry for you Gild, you might say, but I know for myself how much I benefited. 
I know for myself the value of the Dharma, this practice that I do, and I'll continue, and because I know for myself. 
And so this idea of this really knowing it, and having this confidence, so how does one come to that kind of confidence? And so there's a five-part description of what this well-proclaimed Dharma, the well-proclaimed, we could say teachings of the Buddha, but the Dharma is not a teaching in the abstract, like a set of creed, or a set of propositions. 
The Dharma is part of our lived experience, things that we discover in our lived experience that shows us a way to live wise and good life. 
So what is it about Dharma that provides that? What do we see? What's going on here? And so there's a five-part description of what we have confidence in, and what we know, and it's possible in a sense to do kind of reverse engineering, to understand these five parts, and this will tell us what the Dharma is, in some kind of deeper way, as opposed to just some abstract teachings of the Buddha, or some kind of vague, I don't know, principles, or natural forces that we connect to, it's, you know, we really discover it for ourselves. 
And these five qualities of the Dharma, five characteristics, are frequently chanted by, and people do it in our Tera-Van tradition, they chant, and the English goes like this, the Dharma is well-proclaimed by the Buddha, by the Blessed One. 
It is visible here and now, immediate, inviting inspection, onward leading, and to be personally experienced by the wise. 
So I'll take each of these days, we'll take one of those, and look at it more deeply. 
So the first one is that, it's called San Diti Ko in Pali, and it has, it refers to the fact that it's directly visible. 
The Diti here means to see what you can be seen. 
And often we say in English for this phrase, visible here and now, the here and now is not in the word, just like the word is to be, it's seen, it's known. 
And seeing always happens in the here and now. 
And so by adding here and now, it's really emphasizing the immediacy of the experience, and the immediacy of the knowing of it. 
And it doesn't have to be only with the eyes, it says, the word is visible, but it's visible with the mind's eye, with all the different capacities we have for direct attention. 
We can sense, we can hear, we can feel, we can know in the mind directly what's happening. 
And so this is, so the Dharma, they're well-proclaimed by the Buddha, is not something that you have to believe or find in a book. 
It's something that we can see for ourselves. 
And in fact, sometimes it's said that everything you need to know in Buddhism can be discovered by your own powers of observation. 
But you have to look carefully, and maybe what the teachings do and the instructions do, is to point us to how to see in the present moment, so that the Dharma really comes alive for us. 
But so for today, that is the value of our direct experience, and to see it clearly. 
When the Buddha wanted to explain a little bit further what this means, San Diti ko, that the Dharma is directly visible here and now, he referred to our psychological states, that we can feel, we can know, we can see, experience directly, that there is kind of unhealthy states of mind present. 
There might be greed or hatred and delusion, there might be jealousy or envy, or there might be avariciousness, there might be lust, there might be anger, there might be resentment, all kinds of things might be in the mind. 
Conceit, one can know it directly. 
That is present. 
And there's two things that can happen with that direct seeing this, that in the clear seeing, we, if the seeing is clear enough, strong enough, that we are not then identified with those states. 
We're not involved in participating in those states. 
It's almost like we can take a step back and observe what's happening, rather than being in the middle of the fray. 
And this is a powerful thing to do for all the kind of difficult states of mind, activities and forces that exist within a human being, to not be enmeshed in it, not be caught by it, not be reactive to it, not be struggling with it, but to step back, step back in a sense, open up, open up in a sense. 
So there's an overview of it with mindfulness, with awareness. 
There's a clear sense, this is happening in the present moment, this is here, and this is what it feels like. 
And this is what it's like to know it. 
This is what it's like to step back far enough, or step, get the overview high enough. 
So, oh, this is what it's like. 
And then we're not caught in it and involved in it. 
And if we're not caught or involved, if we really discover how to see it that kind of way, then these unhealthy states of mind have much less or maybe no power over us. 
And to see that, to see the presence of unhealthy states of mind, clinging and grasping and resistance and hating, to see it there, and then see ourselves being unattached to it, unentangled with it, to see that we can clearly know it without believing it or being pushed around by it, or this is a phenomenal thing to discover. 
Even more phenomenal is to see that these unhealthy states of mind can disappear. 
For some people, certain kind of chronically unhealthy states of mind can be so deeply ingrained with, we don't even know we have it, or we don't assume that it's always this way. 
This is part, the universe was built this way to have these states of mind. 
But to have these drop away, to have the experience of life without them, can be life changing for some people, to know that there's another way. 
Wow! You mean I don't have to always be afraid, I don't have to always be aversive, I don't have to always be critical, or always kind of fighting for what I want. 
It's possible to find some peace in a different way. 
So that's how the Buddha kind of elaborated on this idea that the Dharma is visible here and now. 
And so what it means is that we want to be able to see clearly what is happening for us here and now. 
And what can be quite marvelous, wonderful, and wondrous is we discover our capacity to see unhealthy states of mind within us and not to believe in them or react to them or to use them as a basis for criticizing ourselves. 
All we're asked to do is to know it directly for what it is. 
And then we can start seeing the freedom from it, the ways in which we can kind of know it so clearly we're not caught by it. 
So to see that over and over and over again, to see that, to develop this capacity to be here and now, that's kind of the direction that's going. 
So we're cultivating and developing our capacity to be in our lived experience, the experience of here, the experience of now. 
And the stronger that capacity can be, the more we're interested in this, the more we decrease the drive, some of the unhealthy, often unhealthy drive, that pulls us into the world of the past, pulls us into the world of the future, pulls us into the world of fantasy and and rumination. 
And as we do this, we get to appreciate the richness and the texture and the and then all the different heightened opportunities, potential, that is available here in the present moment now. 
I think of the being fully present here and now as like a opening a door into a multi-dimensional experience of life that is not available if we spend our days in our thoughts, past, future, fantasies, desires, whatever they might be. 
So the Dharma that the Buddha taught is something that's directly visible here and now. 
And I'd encourage you for this day of practice, that stay that you have before we meet again tomorrow, that maybe you can begin, not begin, but kind of make it a make it a task, make it a real activity of the day to really be present in a relaxed, calm way with what can be experienced directly here and now. 
The Dharma is visible here and now. 
Thank you.
