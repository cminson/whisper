Hello everyone and welcome to Friday morning here in California.
And we come to the end of this five-part series on the Gladness Pentade.
And if you take a moment to imagine a circumstance, maybe a time when things are going well for you,
a time when you have no real concerns,
and that you can settle into your meditation first with gladness,
just a glad, delighted appreciative of the chance to sit in a place where your senses are open,
your body is present, where just being alive is enough when being alive is to be present in your senses,
with your eyes, your ears, your body, with the mind here, now, maybe not the highest quality,
but it's just nice to be here, content, kind of glad.
And then you remember that you're here to practice, practice being attentive,
practice gently, lovingly, quieting your mind,
letting your mind quiet because you can reassure, you can reassure your mind that you're thinking mind
that don't have to do all this thinking, don't have to fix anything or solve anything,
it's okay just to quiet and let the mind, attention, be available for the simplicity of being alive now with the breathing.
And there's a joy in this simplicity of presence with the breathing.
And even if the mind wanders off, there's a joy in recognizing that and beginning again with the breathing.
With the breathing being kind of the representative, representation of being centered and at home, here in this life, in this body,
we're just being alive is enough, just breathing is enough.
We're being present for the breathing, the joy of it is partly riding on the breath, like a bird soaring on the updraft.
Awareness rides up and down on the breathing and the updrafts and the waves.
And this joy of the practice of being present, practice of keep showing up here, feeling, sensing the body, the breathing.
It makes room for tension in the body to relax.
There's a softening, relaxing in the body.
Tensions of the face, soften.
Tensions of the belly.
Small adjustment in the positions of your hands and arms to release any tension that's held there.
Maybe there's even little tension in the thighs that can be released.
And maybe there's some tension or pressure in the thinking mind, some agitation.
And just being aware of it is enough, the joy of having an awareness practice that knows and sees without making anything a problem.
But then the mind has a chance to relax also.
And just being alive is enough, sitting here breathing, being aware, attending to breathing.
Another level of contentment or happiness, physical satisfaction maybe.
That comes from a place that's deeper than places where the body aches or hurts or the heart aches, hurts.
A deep place inside that maybe feels peaceful and quiet.
And there there's a kind of well-being.
And there the breathing gently arises and passes, comes and goes, wave after wave.
As the companion of an inner feeling of well-being, calm, tranquility.
Where there's an inner place of stillness and calm, maybe in the breathing.
That is a center of gravity for all things where the weight of the body gathers around this place.
The weight of awareness settles.
The weight of your emotions, your moods, the atmospheres of your mind.
The gentle pull of that center gathers everything together here, now.
In the sense that your whole being becomes centered on breathing, centered on the stillness or the peace,
which the breathing moves through or arises out of.
Even your thinking, the weight of thinking settles into the center and the thinking quiets, settles.
And perhaps a sense that Samadhi is an immersion in experience, immersion into this practice.
An immersion at all of you together, centered, centering, gathered here, now, breathing.
Surrendering to the pull of the gravity of the center of your being.
Surrendering everything to that center so it all gathers together.
It's all working together here and now.
Surrendering to the pull of the gravity of the center of your being.
Surrendering to the pull of the gravity of the center of your being.
Surrendering to the pull of the gravity of the center of your being.
Surrendering to the pull of the gravity of the center of your being.
Surrendering to the pull of the gravity of the center of your being.
Imagining at the center of your being.
There's a sign, a loving sign that says welcome.
Maybe it says all of you is welcomed here.
Give yourself over to this welcome at the center of it all.
Breathing in and out through that center of gravity for all things.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
However far your thoughts take you away from yourself, away from your center,
when you notice it, let it all return, return back to that center.
In a sense bring your thoughts with you so that they can relax and compost
back at the center of all things.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And then taking a gentle breath deep into your being.
Maybe taking a long exhale and pausing at the end of the exhale
is relaxing into your heart
and letting there be whatever kind of sense, awareness,
gazing upon the world around you, remembering it, imagining it.
Imagining that your goodwill, your kindness, your heart's deepest welcoming of everyone
who comes to the world and you look upon it kindly.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
The deepest way that you welcome yourself to yourself.
Extend out to a welcome to all beings.
Welcome.
Letting them come well into your goodwill.
