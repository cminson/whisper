 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, we come to the second talk on mindfulness of thinking, where the emphasis is the power of recognition. And the art of mindfulness of thinking is not to thereby think more, but it is to be able to recognize more clearly what's happening as we think. And there's lots to notice as we're thinking. But before we talk about what we can notice in thinking, it is how we know, how we notice, the way in which recognition happens, which is, as I said earlier, is the art of mindfulness meditation. It's kind of one of the central features of it. And that is, recognition is the way in which we know what is happening as it's happening. And not know it in complicated ways, like know a story, why it's here. But just the simplest knowledge, recognition of what it is, the thing, what's happening, what's occurring. So, if I'm breathing, to recognizing just breathing is happening. Not to connect it to other breathing, and just breathing is happening. If there's a sound, just a sound, just hearing is happening. And as we settle in meditation, it is to be as simple as possible. So, we're not caught or reactive to or judging what's happening, just the recognition. It's not an easy skill to learn, but it's a powerful one because it helps us be free in the midst of whatever's happening. To stand in the middle of a complicated life, and to be able to just take it in and recognize what's happening, but not be swayed by it, or reactive to it. Just see it and clearly. Then we have access to our wisdom inside, our clarity about what to do, in a way that we don't if we're caught up in the, enmeshed in the drama of it all. So, learning this ability to how we recognize radical simplicity. And meditation is a wonderful laboratory to discover how simple it is we can, we'd be in recognizing. And in that simplicity, find some peace, find some freedom from what it is we're recognizing. So, it could be that we're tremendously depressed, and it's difficult to be that. It's very sticky to be depressed. But as we, as mindfulness gets stronger, it's possible to recognize, oh, this is depression. And somehow, for that moment, maybe just the moment of recognizing this is depression, there's a little bit of like lightbulb goes off, or a little bit clearer, the fog clears or something, just for that little moment. And sometimes you have to kind of say the note a few times until we really are standing in the note, not standing in the depression. Depression, depression, anger, anger, whatever it might be. And slowly, slowly, that this crack opens up, and we begin identifying more with the recognition than the state, emotional state we might be in. Oh, there is sadness, sadness. And then sadness is not diminished, the sadness is not disrespected, but it's clearly known. So we're not influenced by it or caught in it. It's an amazing capacity. As we do this, we also start seeing more clearly what's happening as we're thinking. And that also gives some freedom. And so one of the things that's useful in meditation is to distinguish different kinds of thinking so that both, there's more clarity in what we're recognizing, but also to recognize what kind of thinking is useful for meditation and what is not. So for example, maybe somewhat a little bit, going from a coarsest, most least helpful to maybe going closer and closer to what's most helpful. There could just be a dream like fantasies. Just that have nothing to do with the present moment. There's maybe images that are involved and we're caught up in a fantasy world of the future, what's going to happen tomorrow. And we're kind of entered into the realm through the imagination of tomorrow or of the fantasy. And so those kind of thinking is just recognized as fantasy. And it's recognized that it's really a disconnection from reality. We're not really present for what's immediately here for ourselves. Another kind of thinking is discursive thought. And that's when the mind is having a conversation. Either we're talking to ourselves or we're having a conversation with someone else. We're repeating a conversation with yesterday to try to come up with a better response or something. And reviewing it and reviewing it. And it's kind of like having a discourse, discursive thoughts, a discussion in the mind. And that also is not about the directness of mindfulness. It's kind of removed into kind of abstraction. And so to recognize what discursive thinking is happening, discursive thinking. Then there's a simpler kind of thinking, which is getting closer now to thinking that recognizes what's happening. It could be still a sentence. It could be, I've sat down to meditate. It's true. We've sat down to meditate and it's kind of recognizing what's happening a certain way. I'm feeling hungry. I wonder what I should have for lunch. And then as we begin thinking about what to have for lunch, there might be an entity that becomes a discursive thought or a fantasy. But the simple thought, I'm hungry and I'm thinking about lunch. That's a kind of recognition of what's happening here and now. And then it's simpler. And then it might also be very simple thoughts in the mind in meditation that are directing the meditation. I'm thinking about lunch because I'm hungry. Maybe I'll bring my attention to my stomach where I'm hungry and just feel that. And so that's kind of like very simple thought telling you, let's go pay attention there or let's go back to the breathing. It was nice to be with the breathing. I don't have to think about lunch. Let's go back to the breathing and feel the breath. So that kind of thinking, it might not necessary to have this clear recognition. That's just kind of guiding you, pointing you to the present moment. You might have the thought, I think I should practice the recognition now. And you know, you could have an infinite regress if you say, well, let me recognize that I'm thinking about recognizing I'm thinking. And it's kind of crazy making very quickly. So it could be really simple. So some very simple instructional kind of thinking in meditation can be very supportive, provided the instructions is very relaxed and at ease and not demanding, not stern or something. And then we get even simpler thoughts, which is this thing that's closely related to mental notes. It's one word. It's rather than I'm hungry, what's for lunch? It's hunger. Or there might be tightness, a pang in the belly, hearing. There might be warmth. Not I'm sitting in a warm room, but just feeling a warmth. Because sitting, when your eyes close, sitting in a warm room is kind of an abstraction. But with eyes closed, what directly direct experience is just warmth, coldness, coolness. As meditation gets quieter and quieter, the more relevant it becomes to keep it that simple. Warmth, coolness, hearing, in breath, out breath, pressure, release of pressure, expansion, contraction. It's not a job, it's not like work that you're supposed to kind of, but it's supposed to be, it's getting closer and closer to having the mind be very clear, clearly aware of what's happening in the present moment as it's happening. So with thinking, which is so easy to get pulled into, so easy to get trapped by or caught by, this is where mental noting sometimes is very effective. It's a way of kind of stepping out of the, you know, if you're stuck in the mud, in the quagmire, and you're stuck in the mud and you can't get out, like quicksand, you have to have, helpful to have one foot on dry land to be able to pull yourself out. The classic example is, if two people are in the quicksand, and one person tries to pull the other one out, the one pulling sinks deeper. So the first one, then the other one tries to pull the ones going deeper and pull it out, and that person sinks in deeper. And they just kind of progressively make themselves go deeper. But if one of them is up on dry land, then that person can pull the other person out. So with thinking, the simple recognition is meant to be standing on dry ground, being on the train looking out the window, not involved with what you see, but clearly recognizing it. So clearly recognizing thinking, thinking, remembering, remembering. One of the nice things about these mental notes is that you can pay attention to the tone of the voice that's making the note. And if it's harsh or afraid or irritated or something, you can feel that in the tone. And the idea is a tone to be very relaxed, easy, and untroubled by what we're noticing. That's where we start feeling the freedom of recognition. And so, maybe not easy to discover, but once we get the hang of, get the, how a simple moment of recognition is a kind of freedom, a kind of peace, it kind of cracks the universe open and it starts feeling much more space and start feeling more peace. And also kind of delight. I just find it delight sometimes. Oh, I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about, I need to get my oil changed in my car. I'm thinking. Oh, that's what I'm thinking about. And I kind of like, oh, it's kind of like I'm no longer in the thought and I'm kind of delighted or kind of amazed. You know, wow, this mind thinks. It's not quite something. And it's easier to be amazed or to be kind of just delighted or just free if we step back up on dry land and just really recognize the thinking, thinking. Now it's possible to get busy with all this recognition. And then hopefully you recognize, now I'm getting busy, I'm working too hard at it and doing too much of it. It is just enough to support you. And some people will not do the active recognition, the noting, when they're resting with the breath, being with the breath in and out. But as I've said, they definitely use it when they find themselves in thinking. Because with some practice it becomes a really clear way, easy way even to step away from thoughts, not being meshed in it. We kind of turn the light of attention onto the fact we're thinking. Thinking, thinking. Over time as mindfulness gets stronger, it's an interesting skill to learn to be thinking about things, allow yourself to think because you need to think about them, but also to be aware of what it's like to be thinking. And to adjust the how. So the thinking is not so fast, not so forceful, not so addicted, not so harsh, whatever it might be, and find a supportive and a pleasant enjoyable way to think. Thinking can be a wonderful thing. And meditation is not supposed to be a critique of thinking at all costs, you're not supposed to think or something. Thinking is bad. But we are trying to restore thinking to a way that is harmonious and peaceful and supportive for our lives. And the path to that in meditation is to step away from thinking. And in meditation it's the one place where you barely need to think at all. Certainly don't need to discursive thoughts, don't need to think about things that are not present. The only thing to think about is what is present here and now, but without analysis and asking why and keeping very simple, just simple thoughts about it. Let me see if I can hold that in awareness. Let me meet that with kindness. Can I feel that in my body? And then as we settle in, oh, just pressure, warmth, tightness, simpler and simpler. So I hope that that makes some sense. And if what I'm saying seems not quite right for you or understandable at this point, just kind of file it away. And now there'll come a time, I think, where you'll recognize where it's valuable to do what I've been talking about today. And so then we'll continue tomorrow with mindfulness of thinking. Thank you.
