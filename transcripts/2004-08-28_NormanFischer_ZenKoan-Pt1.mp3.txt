Thanks for coming. It's nice to be down here again.
I think last time I did an event with Sati Center was before you had this location, I think.
It was somewhere else we did it, I think.
Anyway, it is a pleasure to be down here, and it's very cool in here.
Even though it's going to be hot outside, I bet it's...
Is the stay cool in here all day?
More or less? Air-conditioned.
Excellent.
I want to tell you a little sketch I made for what we would do today.
Carolyn explained to me how the day usually goes, so I thought we'd begin with sitting, about a half an hour of sitting.
And during the sitting, maybe I could give a little bit of instructions and give you a co-on to sit with during the first sitting.
And then after that, we could just stretch for a moment, and then I will...
I have some talks prepared for the day.
And I thought after the first sitting, and you're having at least a little bit of experience in sitting with a co-on,
I would then speak about co-on study and practice a little bit practically, but also historically,
where how co-ons began and so forth and so on.
And then give you my talk, and then questions and answers.
And then mid-morning break, and then we'd come back after the break for a brief sitting.
And then I thought during the rest of the day, I would actually give some talks, sort of semi-traditional talks,
on a couple of Zen co-on that I've chosen for the day.
So there would be two... I'd present two co-on, and we could have discussion after the talks.
Take a break for lunch, of course, and have a half an hour of sitting after lunch before we resume.
So sitting, talking, discussion, break.
Brief sitting, talking, discussion, lunch.
Half-hour sitting, talking, discussion, break.
And then one more talk and discussion to end the day, end about 4.30, 4.45.
So that was what I was thinking of, and we should have fun.
Why not?
Relax a little bit today.
So why don't we begin with half an hour of sitting?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So I was in... I was in sitting.
It's based on a foundation of awareness, a fairly intense awareness of posture and breathing.
So in the beginning of a period of Zazen, you bring the awareness to the body.
You feel your butt on the cushion or chair.
Arch the small of your back slightly inward, lengthen the spine, press the back part of the top of the head toward the ceiling,
your shoulders back, and you become aware of the whole back and spine.
Tuck the chin in.
So in the beginning of every period, you tend to the posture of the body, bring awareness to the body,
bring calmness and awakeness to the body, and then soon you bring the attention to the breathing in the belly.
Let the breath sink down into the lower abdomen and pay attention to it there as the belly rises and falls naturally and gently with each inhaling and exhaling.
You feel the breath and you try to stay clearly with every breath in and out.
And you find that you can alternately focus on the breath and the posture of the body or, in fact, simultaneously in a more open field of awareness.
You can be aware of the breathing in of the body, the posture.
And whatever distractions arise, whether they're in the form of physical sensations or thoughts and emotions, without calling them distractions or trying to eliminate them,
you just gently come back to the breathing in the posture and you keep making the effort to come back.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Now as you're listening to sound with the listening, you can breathe with the question, Who hears this sound?
Or simply, Who?
Completely mixing the question with the immediate experience of the sound, with the immediate experience of the body and the breath into one experience.
And posture.
Here's the sound.
Here's the sound.
Usually when we ask a question like this, automatically we think of the answer.
Our mind thinks, Well, who is hearing this sound?
Maybe we review our knowledge of Buddhist doctrine.
We think about anatta.
Or who knows what we think about.
But this is not that sort of exercise.
Whatever comes into the mind in response to this question is not the answer.
So things may come into the mind, but you don't follow them.
You just let them go and return to the immediate experience of breathing, listening, and questioning.
So that the question is almost a concrete object, the way the breath becomes an object, or the posture becomes an object.
You try not to get caught in the words, but keep the pure spirit of inquiry and make it more clear and more intense as you continue sitting.
Who, with each sound, who hears?
Questioning passionately as if your life depended on it.
Really and truly asking.
Really and truly wanting to know.
But not intellectually, wanting to know with the whole body and spirit.
And at the same time calm, willing to continue asking until the planet burns up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Listening to sound with the whole body immediately present with sound, with breath, with posture.
With a field of awareness wide enough to notice other sensations and thoughts, but just calmly let them fall away and returning to the immediacy of being sitting here breathing, listening to sound.
Who hears this sound?
Who? Who?
Who?
Who?
Who?
Don't relax, don't get peaceful, but don't stress, don't strain.
Just be present, be awake, be alert, be alive.
Who is hearing this sound?
How can you know how to live if you don't know who is hearing this sound?

So maybe we can all get up and just for a moment or two have a stretch and people who are in the back room maybe come forward. There's lots of seats, lots of chairs, lots of cushions.
So maybe we can all get up and just for a moment or two.

So that's a little taste of how the practice goes.
And you could see where it would take a while to develop that particular kind of focus.
Not only in terms of number of years of working on it, but also in a given retreat, in one retreat to spend day after day, you might develop this kind of focus and concentration.
Certainly the koan practice comes out of an environment in which there's lots of retreats and daily life is permeated by sitting practice in this kind of focus.
And usually life is simple enough so that you could even maintain this questioning all day long while you were sweeping or washing dishes or doing simple tasks with lots of silence.
And now I'd like to talk a little bit about where this practice comes from and how it developed and how it's used today and how it could be used other ways we could use it other than traditional ways or ways we can adapt the tradition to suit our circumstances.
