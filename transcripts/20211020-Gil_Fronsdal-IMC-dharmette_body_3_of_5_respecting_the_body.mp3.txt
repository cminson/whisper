 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, continuing today with discussing mindfulness of the body as part of the overall practice of mindfulness. And today it's respect, so respecting the body. Many years ago I saw an article in, I think it was Mother Jones magazine, and it was, the title struck me. The title was The Body, Friend, Foe, or Total Stranger. And so we have complicated relationships to our body. And some of it's been acculturated into us by the way that our culture relates to the body. And some of it has to do with life experiences, maybe what individuals have told us about our body and our features. And a tremendous amount of suffering goes on in our society that's related to our bodies. And to name just one, there's attitudes our culture, many cultures have towards skin color, body size, height, all kinds of things that goes on. And so we live under the, many of us can live under the weight of thoughts, preoccupations about our bodies. You know, my nose is too big, too little. When I was young I was very concerned about having too high a forehead and worried I was going to lose my hair in seventh and eighth grade. And I would spend an ordinary amount of time in class measuring the distance from my nose to my scalp. I would take my finger like this and kind of feel the distance to make sure that I wasn't losing hair. I could probably also write maybe a somewhat interesting autobiography all from the perspective of my hair, my hair length, what I've done with my hair over these decades of my life from crew cuts when I was a little kid to long hair, you know, halfway down to my belly button later in my life and then a shaved head when I was a monk and on and on. And so, you know, what was that going on? What was the associations, the beliefs, the attitudes going on? So all this idea of our bodies. And so there's often an overlay on top of the body of our judgments and ideas of preoccupations. And one of the things that's possible, maybe discovered in the exercise of the hand that I gave in this last guided meditation, is to experience a difference between the hand's experience of itself and our ideas of the hand. So the idea is my fingers are too long, too short, my fingernails are this or that, or my hand is chubby or whatever it might be. It can be kind of debilitating and depressing even some of these ideas and thoughts. But the hand itself doesn't have those thoughts and ideas. The hand itself just feels itself what it is, has no judgments about what it is. And it's tremendously respectful for the hand to leave it alone, to free it from our judgments, ideas, associations. And to experience the hand, whatever part of the body, whatever is going on in our body, independent of the acculturation, independent of the life experiences even and the judgments, the ideas and how we've been treated. And part of mindfulness practice is to give ourselves the gift, give our body the gift of allowing it to experience itself, independent of all this other comparisons we make, comparisons with other kinds of hands, what it should be and not be. And there are, if I might feel, because I'm hanging out with a certain group of people, I might feel bad about myself for being too short. And just, oh, I'm too short and this is unfortunate and there are people looking down at me all the time and I have to look up high. And it just happens to be them hanging out with the National Basketball Association, basketball players. And so in comparison, I'm short, but in comparison to many people in our culture, our society, I'm a little bit tall. But I kind of make a story and get caught up in it. These differences and comparisons cause a lot of suffering and I don't want to dismiss the suffering and the challenges that all this makes. We need to address it wisely. But in meditation, we can give ourselves the gift of experiencing the body in and of itself free of all that. If you really want to respect the body, we want to somehow be able to distinguish between the judgments, the stories, the commentary, the associations that we pile on top of the body from the body's experience of itself, which is often very simple. And that can also be relevant when there's pain, discomfort in the body, that we have predictions that, oh, if this continues, you know, I'll have to, my knee pain, I'll have to amputate my leg and it'll be the end somehow. And certainly there are dangers with the body being uncomfortable in pain, but sometimes there's not. One of the great things that can happen through the heightened sensitivity, the respect of the body by really paying attention to it in meditation is we can tell the difference between pain that is a danger signal and pain which is not. And if it's a danger signal, then change your posture. By all means, don't live with the danger. If you're in doubt of what it is, change your posture. Don't stay with pain that way. But if there's no danger signal, I like to think of the pain as a signal, as a message. And part of that message is not that something needs to be changed, that we have to do something, but rather the message is that we can offer it the medicine of awareness, to hold it in awareness. And then so part of this respecting awareness that we did in that last meditation is that the awareness with which we hold discomfort and pain needs to be simple, needs to not be piled on with these judgments, associations, fears, ideas of self that kind of make it so much more complicated. Very simple awareness. So for example, if someone goes around with a clenched hand because they're afraid or angry or something, you could come with maybe a crowbar or something and kind of try to open up the fingers. You get one open and then when you start the other one, the first one closes up again. And you're kind of like directly trying to fight the clenchedness. Another way to do it is to come along with a loving, soft, caring hand and hold the person's hand and support it. And just let it out, just tell them, here, rest in my hand, feel your weight and let it kind of rest and settle into my hand. And then slowly people's hands will begin to open because they feel the support and the care. So the same way we can do for ourselves that as we bring our awareness to the area of tension or pain, perhaps what we're doing is allowing something to thaw, something to relax and open. We're maybe making space for the body's ability to heal itself. Just like if the tight clenched fist is kind of the, I don't know what to call it, but this metaphor, the illness, then we're holding it so that it can, so that's the medicine, so it can release and relax itself. And perhaps it's not always relaxation, maybe, it's just simply that bringing a lot of attention to an area brings more blood to it or the micro tensions around it relax. Or we begin seeing that the experience of discomfort in and of itself is different, very different experience. If we just feel it in and of itself, then if we see it through the filter of our ideas, even the idea that it's pain is kind of an abstraction, oddly enough. And when you really feel it directly, it's not, you know, realize that pain is an abstraction. What's really happening is there are sensations of heat or stabbing or pulling or tightness or pressure or strong contraction and all these kinds of particular sensations that are intense, but they are all kinds of different sensations. And we start feeling the particularity of it, then we're not overlaying an idea like pain, which comes along with a lot of baggage, a lot of other ideas about what pain means. Some people experience associate pain with failure, I'm doing something wrong, and that's a little bit debilitating to have that idea. And so just to feel it and be with it. And then as we feel more deeply into discomfort, for example, there might be a message there. And that message might be that maybe there's some embodied emotion in that place, stored up from a long time ago, that maybe needs to be released. And maybe it gets released with tears, maybe it gets released with heat or something else. But I think it's nice in this respect of the body, respecting the body, to think that there's a very huge difference between the corporal body that we have when we're a corpse and the animated body and the body that has sensations in it. And the sensate body is, I like to think of it as a messenger system. It's always there to inform us about something. So inform us, simple as it's hot outside or cold, take off your sweater, put on your sweater. Everything is a message. And how do we read that message? And with mindfulness meditation, it isn't so much that we're actively reading it, but we're allowing this respectful, careful, simple awareness to hold the experience, to be with the experience, so that we get to know it better and something begins to happen. The self-healing functions of the body can operate. The message system of the body can reveal something to us more deeply. And maybe what we're learning is not necessarily about the discomfort or the pleasure that we might feel, but rather we're learning that the message is you're not free in relationship to it. You're caught up in it. You're somewhat attached to it or aversive to it. And your awareness is not free. Your awareness is not in that place of freedom and simplicity. And that's where the work is. That's what the message is that comes back to us. So to respect the body, and so in the instructions that we have here at IMC, is to stay with your breathing. That's the default. That's where we develop some concentration. But at a moment's notice, if some experience of the body is more predominant, more compelling, which means that there's a tension set up between trying to stay with the breathing and this other sensation of the body calling attention to itself, you can just let go of the breathing and then see if you can bring calmly, deliberately, a clear, simple awareness to hang out for a while, to hold for a while this compelling sensation, whether it's pleasant or unpleasant. And when it's no longer compelling, you can either continue to be aware of it if it feels like the right thing, or you can come back to your breathing. So respecting your body, it's definitely worth it. And friend, foe, or total stranger, a wonderful thing that can happen as we do this practice is our body becomes our friend, and we become its friend. So may that friendship last for a long time. Thank you.
