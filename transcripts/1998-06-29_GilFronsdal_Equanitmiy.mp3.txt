 My notes for this talk and it didn't seem to be there unless I gave them to you with everything else. You know, look, maybe put them... but it's the... but the talk was on... is... is... on equanimity. So, salaam-vi. We'll just kind of go ahead. Maybe they're out there, but if they're not, then we'll just... Can you tell us who the teachers are this July month? Oh, thank you. The... next week it's Don Flaxman, who spoke, I think, here in April. And he's a very senior Vipassana student and now being trained to be a community Dharma leader who lives in Los Altos and was the president of Spirit Rock Board for many, many years. And then the following week it is a Zen priest, a teacher named Mary Mosin, who is now the director of the San Francisco Zen Center and one of the teachers up there. And then the following week it is Mary Orr, who is the Vipassana teacher in Santa Cruz. And then the last week of July is not set yet, but I'm trying to get Yussil Ananda to come and give a talk. And Yussil Ananda is this wonderful Burmese meditation teacher in Half Moon Bay, who's really precious. He speaks excellent English and is very deeply connected to the Burmese tradition of Buddhism that was partly where... very much where I was trained in Vipassana, was his tradition. And you get it... from him you get a purer version. So you can find out how it should be done. So that's what's in store. So, equanimity showed up. And part of the... I've been wanting to talk about equanimity for a long time, partly because over the last year I've been trying to... I haven't told you this, I don't think. I've been trying to cover the seven factors of awakening. Seven factors of awakening are very important mental qualities or mental virtues or mental states that come into play when people do mindfulness meditation. And the strong development of these factors of mindfulness, of investigation, of effort, of concentration, of tranquility or calm, of concentration and equanimity, characterizes a very strong state of mindfulness. When mindfulness becomes quite developed and stabilized for a person, these other qualities also become quite strong. And it's very important to recognize the appearance of these because the recognition of them feeds them, helps support them and helps stabilize them even more. So that's part of the reason. And the other reason is that equanimity by itself is a very important virtue in Buddhism at large. We could say that one of the... the Buddhism itself is an antidote to all forms of grasping, all forms of kind of real clinging. Sometimes the word attachment is used, but all forms of grasping, which in the Buddhist analysis is the source of stress and the source of suffering. And rather than saying non-grasping or non-attachment is being the opposite of grasping, we could perhaps more appropriately perhaps say that equanimity is the conventional opposite of grasping, this state of equanimity. So it's a very important quality in Buddhist religious life, and so it's well warrant some discussion. And the other reason, maybe particularly for today, is that I was... or this time in my life, is I live with someone who doesn't seem to have any equanimity. Our five month baby. And he just all over the place, you know. Goes through all these cycles and ups and downs. After he's fed and after he's slept, he's just totally delighted and cheerful and upbeat and self-sufficient for a while. And then he's not self-sufficient, then he needs someone there with him in order to be happy and upbeat. And then he needs someone who's there who's really kind of there with him in a playful way to stay kind of happy. And after a while, you know, it's hopeless to be even happier. And so then it goes through the whole day like that. So he's very much in the moment, but not exactly with equanimity. He reacts to everything very strongly. The definition of equanimity is an evenness of mind or a balance of mind, or a non-reactivity of mind. The mind that can be fully present to experience life, to really experience what's going on inside of us and around us, but doesn't then react to it, either they're grasping or aversion of any types. So sometimes it's defined as a soft spaciousness of mind that can contain anything that arises without the mind latching on. So maybe this talk is since the little guy can't have equanimity, it's supposed to be the parents who provide it. So maybe this is to inspire me with equanimity. And I reflected on that today about how, perhaps, maybe this is a little bit simplistic, but perhaps as we age from being children and adolescents and young adults and so forth, that looking back at kind of the stage earlier in our life and the preoccupations we had, there's sometimes a kind of equanimity that we have now about those kind of issues. And sometimes, you know, so I could see my child, you know, be upset and be happy, and there's hopefully a certain kind of equanimity that I kind of there present and offer my presence there, but I'm not caught up in the same drama that he is. I'm there to offer help and support, but not to start yelling and screaming when his teeth start coming out. You know, it's okay, I have some understanding about what that's supposed to be like. You know, and then we think about teenagers and some of the issues that teenagers go through, and most of us have certain modicum of equanimity around some of those same issues now. I think we do. And so it goes. Sometimes in Zen Buddhism, the mind of equanimity is likened to the mind of a grandmother, called a grandmother's mind. And I like it a little bit because it's at least, you know, this kind of archetypical idea of a grandmother. The grandmother is quite loving to the grandchildren. There's kind of love and compassion there and warmth that's really there. And there can be equanimity there sometimes in the grandparents that's absent in the parents. You know, they've kind of seen it all, they've been through it all, they know what, you know, they understand, you know, whereas the parents, the new parents especially, you know, like me. Oh my God. So I like this because sometimes the word equanimity conjures up some aversion in people's minds. The idea of equanimity, kind of people associated with kind of being dull or indifferent or plain or, you know, even minded in a way that's kind of just kind of dull and flat. And that's not what's meant in Buddhism at all. It's actually a quite vibrant state. And so the grandmotherly state, this way I'm talking about perhaps is a close way of understanding it. So it's a kind of a balance of mind. It's often defined that way. And in thinking about this, I thought about using the analogy of a person carrying a large pole or large plank of wood. And if it's really large, say you're carrying a 20 foot plank of wood or whatever, and in order to carry it easily, you need to have it balanced so that the pivot point, the balance point of it is just resting on your shoulder. And then you have to deal with the weight of it, but if the weight is evenly balanced back and front, you can carry it with some kind of ease perhaps. But if you start, if you move it forward so that rather than being, if it's a 20 foot long plank of wood, and you have it resting on your shoulder at a 10 foot mark, then it's balanced. But if you have it resting at the 5 foot mark and you have 15 feet spread in front of you, there's a lot of weight that you have to kind of counter with your muscles. You have to kind of hold it up or hold it down or whatever. A tremendous amount of effort has to be gone in order to keep it straight then because of the weight pulling it down in the front. So we all know the principles of balance like that, right? So we have to bring it back into the 10 foot mark to keep the balance. Well, the mind is kind of the same way. You can imagine that the extremes of the mind, the extreme ends of the plank of the mind are desire or grasping. And when the mind picks up one of these extremes, when it moves down the plank towards desire, so it's at the 5 foot mark of desire maybe or in that direction, kind of puts more weight in one end of the plank, the mind's plank in the other. Then it gets heavy. In order to kind of try to live a balanced life with that or kind of cope with that, there's a tremendous amount of stress and effort that has to be present. I mean, most of you understand that if you live a life, you spend a day being really angry, end of the day you'll be exhausted. You might have a headache. There's a lot of strain that goes on. And the same in the other direction. If you go in the extreme of aversion, and that's the direction in which you lean and it can become imbalanced, that also has to be kind of a counter force or kind of a tension that has to kind of be in place in order for that to happen. And that also creates a tremendous amount of work and effort. That wouldn't be necessary if we rest the mind in that middle point, the balance point of a balanced mind. So I said, you know, there's these two contrasts of desire on one side and aversion on the other. You know, that kind of we lean too much in one direction, it gets heavy in that direction. Too much in the other direction, it gets heavy there. And there's a lot of contrast, actually, besides that, that we experience in our lives that can lead to imbalance. In the Buddhist tradition, sometimes they talk a lot about success and failure, or loss and gain, or pleasure and pain, or the rise and fall of things. These are all kind of things that happen, contrasts that happen regularly. But if we get fixated on them and attached to them, then we end up putting more weight on one side of the mind. And with that comes a certain amount of stress. In one of the discourses of the Buddha gave on equanimity, he talked specifically about one of the definitions of equanimity, or one of the ways it manifests itself, is no concern with praise or blame, or no concern with success or failure, in the kind of usual ways. So if someone praises you, fine. Someone criticizes you, fine. But your center of your being, your well-being, your sense of security about who you are, is not conditioned by getting the praise or the blame of someone. Or the success and failures, we go through life and there's constant success and failures throughout the day and throughout the months and years. And to take one of them and have it really weigh down heavily, this particular failure, is to create stress. Or to get too high on this particular success is to create this kind of imbalance, which creates stress and suffering. It isn't that we're not supposed to have some kind of happiness with our successes, but we can get imbalanced when we grab onto this success and hold onto it. So many times our life is a flip-flop, back and forth, and success and failure and praise and blame. If we're preoccupied with these things, if these things create a kind of foundation for our well-being, which for some people is the case, they only feel good about themselves if they have a certain level of success all the time, or a certain level of praise all the time. And if they don't have that, then they feel kind of depressed or bad. So one of the functions of equanimity is to keep us from getting involved with extremes, the extremes of these imbalances of desire or aversion or depression or kind of false, illusory, or isolation that comes from expectation and holding on and clinging to something that's propping up our identity. So why would you like to stay in the middle? And maybe this is where the analogy of being in the middle of the pole maybe lends itself to an undesirable image for you. But one of the things that happens if you carry a pole in the middle, a plank of wood in the middle, in a balanced way, all this effort that has to be mustered up in order to carry it when it's imbalanced is no longer needed. And not only energy but also attention. So when you carry the wood in a balanced way, it trees up a lot of our attention and a lot of our energy before taking care of other things or doing other things. Looking around, paying attention, for being loving or being compassionate, being friendly to the people we meet. But if we're kind of always carrying a pole of anger or aversion to something or always carrying a pole of desire or clinging, there's not much attention and effort left over to pay attention to simple things. So to find that balance point of the mind where the mind doesn't react to what's happening, pushing away or pulling, actually frees up a tremendous amount of the mind, of the heart, for a whole other range of things to be done, the grandmotherly mind, the grandmotherly heart. Now maybe to head off, a little bit of concern that some of you might have when I talk about non-reaction of the mind. It isn't that the mind is to stop making evaluations. It isn't that the mind is supposed to stop preferring necessarily one thing from another. But rather the attention or the awareness or our inner life doesn't get stressed by our preferences. It doesn't get stressed by those evaluations. So the reaction we're talking about is a stressful reaction of grasping onto something or pushing something away. Awareness itself, mindfulness itself, doesn't have to latch onto anything. There can be a tremendous number of evaluations and judgments about what should be happening and what's appropriate and not appropriate, and acting on that. But at the same time, the awareness itself doesn't have to become constricted or narrowed or lost. There can remain a kind of spaciousness of awareness, kind of an openness or kind of balance in the midst of that. So the difference here I'm trying to point to is the difference between stressing oneself, grasping or clasping down at what's happening in a reactive way. That's why I'm talking about reaction versus making wise decisions with open-handed or open-minded kind of way of being. Maybe another word for equanimity is open-mindedness. A mind which is not equanimous is one that's closed, constricted, reactive. So equanimity, upekka, there's a lot of discussion in Buddhist texts about different kinds of equanimity because it's so important. But in kind of distilling some of these things maybe, there are three ways, I'm thinking today, from which we develop equanimity, which does develop and support and strengthen equanimity. One is investigation. Investigation is one of the factors of awakening, the second one. And investigation is a very, very important support for equanimity. Equanimity is not easy to have, a balanced and open mind all the time. But when we get into situations where there is reaction, where there is stress, then it's a function of investigation to go in there and explore that stress, explore that tightening down or that constriction or that kind of fixation or preoccupation of the mind that's come into play. To explore it and investigate it, to understand it better, what's really going on here. The mind which investigates is a really key one for mindfulness practice. To be curious, and just the fact of investigating itself brings some equanimity to the situation. To actually be interested to understand what's going on when we're depressed or when we're upset or when we're scared. To be interested when we're acting this way brings a different part of our being to bear in the situation which is not caught up in it. It's very freeing to be curious and interested. So we investigate our reactivity. And one of the things that some people will notice is how many of us have absorbed the message that we're supposed to be having pleasant experiences all the time. That if we're not having pleasant experiences, then something's wrong. That somehow we haven't succeeded in the American dream. The Buddhist analysis of life is that there's pleasant and unpleasant experiences which are built into being a human being and built into living a life of this kind of world we live in. And to be constantly demanding and expecting only pleasant experiences is to live an unrealistic life and is to set up false expectations. And also if we try to rush after that, to try to insist on that, it sets up a level of stress which is actually counter to the very desire to be pleasantness or pleasure. So in the Buddhist sense, the exploration or the investigation of our desire or our insistence or our values we have around pleasantness is very important. And I think that it's a very fruitful investigation because what I see is a tremendous number of messages in our society that we enforce the idea that things are only right if things are pleasant. And pleasant in wonderful ways. Pleasant cars and pleasant televisions and pleasant houses and pleasant recreational opportunities and pleasant this and pleasant that. And we're supposed to have all these things. And that constant chasing after those things does in lend itself to equanimity. Then the challenge becomes, is equanimity more desirable than pleasure? What do you think? Is equanimity more desirable than pleasure? What? Of course. I don't think it's... Some people, some of you might say of course, but I think my guess is a lot of you kind of wave or say, well sometimes. But I know about these kinds of pleasures that are... However, equanimity itself is very pleasant. But the kind of equanimity that can be developed in a mature mindful mind is something which I found to be one of the greatest pleasures that I've had. And certainly much more pleasing than the kind of pleasures that many of us pursue. Essential pleasures is what Buddhism calls it, but whatever it might be. That list of things I gave. So equanimity is partly learning to surf. Learning to kind of ride the waves of change. Sometimes things are pleasant, sometimes they're not. Sometimes they're foggy and sometimes they're not. Unless you live in Skyline. Sometimes when you're living down here and down here, you should look up into the hills and send some metta in my direction. I hope he has some equanimity up there. It's monsoon season outside my house. Because we have this huge, huge tree and the fog condenses on it and it just pours and pours. And when I take my care of my son outside for walks, I have to cover him because it's just huge drops falling. And then we get outside of the tree line and it's dry. So equanimity comes from investigation. And this leads to another support, another source of equanimity, and that is acceptance. And maybe acceptance equanimity or maybe synonyms. Acceptance again doesn't mean condoning things, but this is non-reactive activity of the mind. It's allowing things to be as they are. Letting be mind. Letting things be. I heard on the radio today the Beadle song, Let It Be. I think it's a great song. Let It Be. Because it doesn't mean let it go. It doesn't mean let's get rid of it. It doesn't mean let's hold on to it. It doesn't mean whatever. You don't have to react to anything. Just let it be as it is. And very much part of the training of sitting in meditation and the training of mindfulness is learning to let things be. Which is another way of saying acceptance. And one of the great questions to be used in the midst of your mindfulness practice is the question, what needs to be accepted right now? Especially if you find yourself very frustrated or find some kind of tension or some kind of struggle going on in your practice. You feel something doesn't seem right and you're kind of struggling. Ask yourself the question, what is it that I'm not accepting right now that needs some acceptance? And then something might pop up that you hadn't noticed yet. But to bring a desire to find a kind of letting beness to our experience. And this again is part of the challenge of mindfulness. It goes against many of the messages where things always have to be pleasant. They always have to be right. They always have to be a certain way. Mindfulness practice is not a practice about getting things to be a certain way. But it's really about learning how to surf. How to let things be as they are. To find that equanimity. To find that acceptance. To find that sense of well-being as things change for us. As they go up and down. And then equanimity comes from understanding. From insight. From understanding. And there's many kinds of understanding that comes as we age. Sometimes I call Buddhist practice accelerated aging. Because I see a lot of people as they get older develop just experience. Just experience of life. There's a lot of wisdom that comes with getting older. And a lot of this equanimity I talked about earlier as we get older is going to look back at earlier stages. We have all this equanimity towards the earlier stages. Easier when you can look back. As opposed to in the middle of it. But Buddhist practice in that sense is accelerated aging. You develop this wonderful equanimity. Acceptance. Or understanding about life. That allows you to surf. Allows you to be present for the ups and downs in a more balanced way. Or to keep that balanced open mind regardless of what happens. So understanding. One of them is there's an equanimity that arises when we understand we can't control the uncontrollable. So if I'm trying to control the fog up there in the skyline. I'm not going to be too equinanimous. But I realize it's out of my control. But also the seasons and tides of our inner life. Of our emotions. I don't really always know why I feel the way I do. I don't always feel great. Upbeat and cherry. Sometimes I am. I don't understand why sometimes. Sometimes I feel kind of a little bit blue or low energy or whatever. I don't know why always. Sometimes I have some sense and sometimes I don't. But so it just you know. I kind of I don't feel like I can always control these things. But what I can do is bring mindfulness and acceptance and understanding to this. You see this on retreats. It's a long enough retreat. I think I've mentioned this often enough. But bear with me if you have heard this before. But. In longer retreats people go through all these ups and downs. The first day of the retreat it's really great to be there maybe. Wow. This is great. I'm a Buddhist retreat. I've been wanting to do this for years. This is exciting. All these great people around me. These are great teachers. Oh boy. And then the next day you get so exhausted and your legs hurt and your back hurts and they're not serving very much protein. And oh my God what have I got myself into. This is terrible and I can't stand it. And then the next day you feel more calm and more at ease. And wow. This meditation is really good. You know I feel really calm and it's really nice. It's so nice. I haven't had to feel calm in years and I feel so calm and so great. I'm going to stay this way forever now. I got it. And then the next day some memory from your earlier life come bubbling up and you're filled with rage about something someone did 20 years ago. And then it spills over to everyone. Who are these people I'm sitting with. You know there's such a bunch of slobs. No one knows how to sit. And these teachers don't know what they're talking about. Oh why am I here. And then the next day that kind of passes and then there's this peace that settles in. Oh peace. I'm the greatest meditator ever lived. This piece really proves it. And the next day sadness and the next day you know. So what happens after a while if you do it long enough after a while you catch on. Hey wait a minute. It seems to go up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down. Maybe it's okay. Maybe it'll it'll change. It's not going to stay this way. You know you're not you know it's going to be the perfect meditator now for the rest of your life. You're not going to be depressed the rest of your life. These things will change like the Sufi ring. This is a teacher went to a Sufi student went to a Sufi teacher and said can you inscribe something on my ring. Some deep spiritual truth that will help me in my life. And the teacher inscribed this tool pass. That brings equanimity. Oh it's here now. So I'll be present for it. I'm not going to hold off from it or keep distant from it. But I'm not going to be caught up by it either. It'll pass. This tool pass. The wonderful mantra that the great American Joseph Goldstein teaches to his students. He likes teaching mantras to students. It's a Buddhist practice that mantras. And his mantra is it's okay. You kind of carry that with you. It's okay. Whatever happens. It's okay. It's okay. And what's remarkable about doing a formal meditation practice is that almost everything that happens to you as you're sitting in for meditation doesn't require you to make a decision doesn't require you to make any to react. So it's a wonderful place to learn to have the mantra. It's okay. And then you kind of learn that kind of how to be equinatoms how to be nonreactive here in the sitting place. Then you can start bringing it into your normal life or explore your normal life from that point of view. It can bring certain kind of understanding or wisdom to further exploration because normal life is more difficult. But it's okay. This tool pass. The Buddhist tradition teaches that if you want to develop equanimity in regard to other people, then it's helpful to have an understanding of karma, it says. And actually, you know, when you do loving kindness practice, you do phrases. May you be happy. May you be safe. May you be free of suffering or whatever. You can do an equanimity practice where you use a phrase also. And the phrase for equanimity goes something like this. Everyone is the air of their own karma. The other person is responsible for their own happiness and unhappiness. You kind of repeat yourself and over and over again that develops equanimity in regard to other people. Now, how I understand this is that the deepest form of happiness or unhappiness of each person is the cause of that is in the person themselves. That the source of the fundamental forms of suffering, psychological forms of suffering that Buddhism is an antidote towards, arise from the mind. And that arises because there's some kind of grasping within us. It doesn't mean that there's an unpleasant kind of things going on happening to us. But our contribution to the suffering is our grasping. And our contribution to our fundamental happiness, the core level, is the release of that grasping. And no one else can do that for you. No one else can kind of release that fundamental grasping for you. So, and the cause of the grasping has to do with sometimes ancient habit formations that we've created within ourselves. If we constantly do the same activity over and over again, are constantly getting angry every chance we get, then we're strengthening that grasping movement of aversion. And we're reinforcing that to happen over and over again. And the seeds of that lies within us. And if I see someone who's constantly angry, it brings a certain amount of equanimity. If I recognize I'm not responsible for that person's happiness or unhappiness at the fundamental level, that it's their grasping and their release of grasping, which is really where the responsibility of the lies. So this is partly why Buddhism puts so much stress on investigation, because, and acceptance also. You don't have to judge yourselves for what we do. We don't have to be critical. We accept ourselves as we are. But there's an investigation of who we are, and very deep try to understand who we are, because it's only through understanding and a deep penetration that we can really see the seat of where our responsibility lies for grasping and the release of grasping. Buddhism really is a teaching that the responsibility for your spiritual life resides with you, fundamentally. And that understanding can lead to a kind of equanimity, where we don't have to take responsibility for everybody's happiness or unhappiness, which I think is often the case. We often take too much responsibility. It doesn't mean that we stay aloof and don't help people and don't try to make them happy. It's okay to make people try and want to. To some degree, we can succeed sometimes, a little bit. You can get somebody to smile a little bit if you do something nice for them and they feel better. We should do that, of course, like a grandmother. But fundamentally, we can't fundamentally do it for the other person. So then we say beings, everyone is the heir of their own karma. They are responsible for their own fundamental suffering and happiness. And that also lends itself to a sense of equanimity. Sharon Salzberg in her book on loving kindness, she has a chapter in equanimity. And in there she likens equanimity to a state of honor. It's an honorable state to be in. In America so much, we don't talk about honor so much anymore. I met someone recently from another culture who told me, this is the honorable thing to do. When's the last time you said that to someone? Someone that said that to you? And he had a certain kind of, I don't want to use the word, pride. He had a certain kind of pride, a very healthy kind of pride, or a healthy kind of self regard, or a healthy kind of self respect, maybe is the word. A healthy self respect that came from a sense of he was going to do the honorable thing. And he was a Sharon Salzberg says, equanimity is an honorable state of honor because wherever you go, you go without an agenda. You go with a simplicity of being that's not going to get cut up in reaction of wanting things to be different. You can go into a situation and let it be, and then letting it be, you're not kind of trying to manipulate the situation or trying to make it more pleasant automatically, or trying to kind of, you know, enter with honor. You come into a room and there's people, and you come in with equanimity means you're not going to go looking for the pleasant people to sit with and avoid the unpleasant people. To enter with honor is to go enter the room and meet each one, each person as honorable people. And you're not going to kind of, you know, play the preference game. Just whoever you happen to meet first, maybe you go and talk to. With grandmotherly, broad minded, non reactive, loving, compassionate, accepting equanimity. And we don't usually have all that. So then we have a little bit of equanimity, equanimity and acceptance about not getting it right. Isn't that good? So we can't do it right. That's okay. Let it be. We do our best. And I'll end with this quote. This is kind of a description, perhaps of equanimity. Develop a state of mind like the earth. For the earth, for on the earth, people throw clean and unclean things, dung and urine, spittle, pus, blood, and the earth does not trouble, is not troubled or repelled or disgusted. And as you grow like the earth, no contacts with pleasant or unpleasant will lay hold of your mind or stick to it. I like that. In mind like the earth. In Zen they talk about the big mind, the big mind that holds it all. Equanimity is not lack of feeling or indifference. I think equanimity actually frees us up, frees up attention. So we actually feel things more profoundly. But we're like the earth, the big mind receives it all. Should we take one or two questions or comments? Yes. In the world there is sometimes circumstances that require non-acceptance, like social or political injustice or something, and they sort of require a passionate response. And I was wondering how that fits into your equanimity concept. A couple of things, perhaps. I don't know if equanimity is the state that we're always supposed to be in. But it's a very powerful state that can be much more common for us if we practice. And as mindfulness gets stronger, it becomes a more and more prevalent and common phenomena for us. And as situations change, our emotional response will change according to the situation. But one of the powerful things that a formal meditation practice teaches us is how to rest in a non-reactive state and become familiar and comfortable in that. To be in a place that knows you can be comfortable in a place that doesn't have to automatically react and respond to things. That carries over into our normal life so that we don't respond to situations around us on automatic pilot. We don't automatically react. There are situations that require passionate responses. But we know we have this place in the universe that doesn't have to go on automatic pilot and just kind of react habitually. And so we actually can see the situation much more wisely. And then seeing it more clearly because we haven't just jumped in right away, then our response can be more informed. There's that. The other thing is the acceptance I'm talking about is not the same thing as condoning things or letting things out in the world be necessarily as they are. What it means is that the mind doesn't lose its open-mindedness or the mind doesn't lose its balance. The awareness itself doesn't get contracted or constricted. The heart doesn't get closed. So awareness itself stays spacious and soft. So you go into a situation that something is wrong and something needs to happen in response. But it's possible to do that softly. Like a famous story of something like this of a Ripasa student who was in India in the early 70s, maybe late 60s. I think there was someone tried to assault her on the streets. And so she hit him with her umbrella. And so he left her alone. So she went to her Ripasa teacher and confessed. I did this terrible thing. I hit someone with my umbrella. I took his precepts not to harm anyone. Here I'm hitting someone who is trying to assault me. And the teacher said, Oh, what you should have done is taken that umbrella and with all the loving kindness you could have mustered, hit him over the head. So acceptance doesn't mean we don't try to change things out in the world if that's appropriate. But we have this balance of mind that we enter that situation with, hopefully. Yes, Pasha? So when I'm dealing with a person who is obnoxious, this is my reaction, and I have great aversion, I want to just get away. In acceptance, I would notice that aversion. Yes, except that... So I'm either as I walk away. Yeah, that's better than walking away unconsciously. I think that if you find yourself having tremendous aversion to someone, I think it's naive and kind of misunderstanding to start by trying to force yourself to accept the person. Kind of overriding, you know, I've heard that acceptance is good, and I have all this aversion, so I'm going to repress this aversion so I can kind of accept this person. I think that's dangerous. The acceptance starts with what's closest at hand. And what's closest at hand is your aversion. So, okay, I'm going to accept this as opposed to, uh-oh, I have aversion, I better not show this to anyone because... Or I'm embarrassed, or I'm justified, or we have all these reactions to it. Let me just let the aversion be there. And one of the powerful things we can learn is it's possible to have very strong aversion, very strong fear, very strong desire, and it doesn't run us. And we can accept it in a sense and accept our aversion. And because we're not buying into it automatically or kind of letting it have take control, you can go into a situation with the aversion and not run away from the person. You don't have to tell the person you're aversive to them, you know, maybe it's not necessarily appropriate, but you don't have to be caught by it. And you know you have aversion, you respect the fact that you have aversion, and you're not going to buy into it. You're not going to let that change what you do. That's one option. You have a lot of options when you bring mindfulness to a situation, when you bring mindfulness and acceptance to something, it opens the number of options you have for how to respond. If you don't have acceptance, you have fewer options. Another option you have is to further your investigation of the aversion. And maybe you take some time out, you go sit someplace or whatever, you kind of explore, why is this aversion here? And then you realize, oh, wait a minute, this person reminds me of that 9th grade boyfriend of mine, who stood me up and was terrible, and you know, oh, you know, am I still playing out 9th grade? You know, whatever, you realize some of the dynamics that are built into it, and if you realize some of the dynamics, then maybe you have a different relationship to it. You might, for example, find out that the core of that aversion is that there is something unpleasant. There can be unpleasant people. I mean, people can be pleasant and unpleasant. I mean, that's just kind of like part of life. Sometimes I'm unpleasant. Sometimes I'm pleasant. I hope I'm more often pleasant than unpleasant, but I know I have both of them, so it's normal, right? I expect that each of you, each of you are pleasant, pleasant sometimes, each of you is unpleasant sometimes. But at the core of the aversion, there might be not so much an aversion to the person, but to experience inside the person. It's unpleasant, you know, it's kind of, feels kind of bad in here. I don't have to make a story out of it. And then you go and you talk to the person, you know, you're aware that it's unpleasant, you feel unpleasant talking to them. It's okay to be unpleasant. You don't have to always have pleasant things, situations when you talk to someone. So, in one option you have is to investigate it. And the other option is if you have enough mindfulness to realize that you're simply not coping very well with the situation, then maybe mindfully you want to run away. So, thank you all for listening, so much equanimity. And I'll come to this coming Thursday, I'll be there Thursday evening. And then I'll mostly be gone in the month of July. I wish you a wonderful July. And I'll see you again.
