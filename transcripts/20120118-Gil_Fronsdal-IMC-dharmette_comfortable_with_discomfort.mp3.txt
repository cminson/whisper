Dharmette: Comfortable with 
Discomfort  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on January 18, 2012  
 
 
In the earlier talk  today  I encouraged the inclusion of 
enjoyment or pleasure as part of mindfulness practice. If 
you can enjoy or feel some pleasure, some sense of 
well-being  in your personal experience with meditation, 
that can make it easier to want to be present, to be 
here.  In this talk now , I will balance that with the other 
side. An important part of this whole enterprise of 
becoming free, of using mindfulness to become freer, 
and not be ing caught by things , is learning to become 
comfortable with discomfort.  
 
There are time s when the task of mindfulness practice 
is to notice how we’re uncomfortable, not avoid ing it, but 
going right into it . Then,  find out how to be comfortable 
with it, how to be at ease with it, how to have equanimity 
with it, how not to be caught by the dis comfort. The task 
of becoming comfortable with discomfort is a process of 
self-learning . One of  the first things to  learn when you’re 
uncomfortable is :  
• What your relationship is to the discomfort?  
• What’s your attitude toward it?  • What happens to you when you’re uncomfortable?  
 
I use the word s discomfort or uncomfortable  as a 
placeholder for just about everything that is not 
comfortable: whether it’s physical , psychological , social , 
or interpersonal  – the whole gamut of things. Do you 
have a default? Do you have a common approach, 
strategy, or response to being uncomfortable?  
 
A common response  people  can have when  they feel 
uncomfortable is that something is wrong , and it has to 
be fixed. Someone better fix it , or I’d better fix it , or 
they’d better fix it. Another common strategy is that if 
discomfort means something is wrong, then I’ve failed . 
I’m a complete fai lure as a human being. This idea of 
personal failure can get built in . If I’m uncomfortable, 
I’ve personally messed up. But if I were  spiritually 
mature , wise, and capable, then everything would just 
be comfortable. I’d float like a cloud through e verything . 
The freeway traffic would part for me , and there would 
be no smog , and no horns . Everything would just float.  
So if it’s not like this, then I’ve done something wrong.  
That’s a strategy some people have.  
 
Another strategy that some people ha ve when ther e’s 
discomfort is  blame. Someone has to take responsibility 
for this . Someone  has messed up. Then there can be 
an attacking mode. We attack ourselves , or we attack 
other people. The attack mode , or being angry with other people  can be  a response.  
 
And sometimes it’s giving up in discouragement. It’s too 
much, I can’t handle this, I’m uncomfortable. I’ve been 
uncomfortable too many times, and even though this is 
a small thing, it’s just too much already. I’m exhausted.  
 
Part of the pro cess of engaging mindfully with 
discomfort is to learn what your common reactions, 
strategies, and responses are. Then you can begin 
questioning those responses: Are they necess ary? Are 
they appropriate? From  what authority do they come? 
Why do we  invest  them with so much power and 
significance?  
 
Start questioning, wondering: Where is this coming 
from? Is this true? Is this really the nature of the 
universe that if I feel uncomfortable , it means I’ve failed 
spiritually or personally ? Begin questioning  as a way  to 
loosen the grip of some of these beliefs around 
discomfort. Then you may be willing to enter into them, 
to look more  carefully  at them , and begin to explore 
other wiser, more useful ways  of relating to them.   
 
The very effort to do this exploration  – to be curious and 
intere sted, and study the situation  – can be the 
beginning of a radical change in business as usual in 
the mind. This is because now you’re using the wisdom 
factor in the mind  – that part of the mind that is not  caught or reactive  – in order to look  at and study  the 
part of the mind that  is reactive.  In a sense , you put a 
wedge in the reactivity  – some  distance or freedom in 
the midst of reactivity. The strength of that investigation 
is directly connected to the strength of how free you are 
from what you’re investigating.  
 
As you begin investigatin g, getting curious, and putting 
more  effort  into investi gating, you might find yourself 
becoming  freer from what you’re caught in . Don’t 
underestimate the power of investigat ion, of looking 
more carefully. Then you can begin exploring some 
more useful ways of relating to discomfort.  
 
One useful way of relating to dis comfort is to investigate 
how you  react to it , and then learn how not to get caught 
by the reactions of anger , frustration , despair, or 
aversion that may  come into play. W hat do I have to let 
go of? What can I let go of?  
 
Another way is to reframe the situation, to understand 
the uncomfortable situation in a different way. Some 
people reframe the situation as, “This is  a great practice 
opportunity! L ucky me!” That works for some people.   
Some people might see the discomfort  as a character -
building  situation. “I have to learn patience here, I have 
to learn something.”  Seeing what is  positive, see ing the 
good side  can be helpful.  
 Another approach is just to see discomfort as an area to 
learn to be mindful, to strengthen  mindfulness . In 
learning to be mindful,  we discover a way of being 
present for s omething that’s uncomfortable, where we’re 
at ease with it, we have equanimity about it, and we’re 
not for or against it. I thi nk the most radical thing in 
mindfulness practice is actually learn ing to be present 
for something, clearly and fully, and be ing okay with it . 
It’s a certain kind of “okayness,”  a certain comfort level 
with being unc omfortable, a certain ability  not to be for 
or against. It’s  the ability not to need to fix it, not to need 
to run away from it, not to need to relate it to my identity, 
not to take it personally, not to need to blame it on 
someone else .  
 
It’s just having  this full presence : “Here I am and I’m 
uncomfortable .” There might be some situations in your 
life where that is the wisest, most  beneficial thing you 
can do. Y ou can’t fix the situation , and so fixing is not 
really called for. I t doesn’t make sense to blame 
someone els e, or get angry with someone else. I t 
doesn’t make sense to run away , or to close down . 
What is required of you is to stay present, open, 
relaxed , and available  in a situation that’s quite 
uncomfortable , and t hen find your way through that.  
 
An example of parenting  come s to mind. There have  
been some  quite uncomfortable  situations . A strong -
willed four -year old in the store  wants , and insists , on getting his way  with every possible strategy of his voice.  
It was very uncomfortable  for me ! This is a situation  
where I think that the best thing to do is to start off by 
being comfortable with the discomfort . Then  I don’t buy 
into the demands or the reactivity of the child. Let me 
just be with it, be present . Then because I can be 
comfortable with discomfort , I can just be there  and feel 
it. This opens up the space for a wise response, and  the 
task is  to figure out the best thing to do.  
 
Learning to be comfortable with the discomfort doesn’t 
mean always being  passive and just sitting there , but it’s 
a starting point. It’s  a great vantage point from which to 
see and understand what needs to be done. If we don’t 
have the ability to be comforta ble with discomfort, then 
we’re reactive, agitated, restless, and  spinning . Then 
how we see things will be colored , and we won’t be ab le 
to see accurately. The practice of learning to be 
comfortable with th e discomfort is wonderful in its own 
right, but I think it’s  really a wise stepping -stone  to 
knowing how  to respond to t he world when we have to .  
 
These are the two sides today. One s ide emphasized  
the role and importance of feeling pleasure and 
enjoyment in your practice . The other side is when that 
doesn’t work , and you’re thoroughly uncomfortable , then 
the practice involves learning to be co mfortable with the 
discomfort , and learnin g how  to practice with it.   
 One of those two mi ght be relevant someday. I don’t 
know which  will come first for you.
