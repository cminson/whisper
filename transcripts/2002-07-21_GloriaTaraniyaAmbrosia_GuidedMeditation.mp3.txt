 So establishing yourself in the sitting practice. Just taking a moment to scan the physical form. Make sure that you're comfortable and alert. Just noticing if there's any areas of holding. See that the posture is such that the body feels supported on its own. That, you know, there's not some tightening or contracting or straining to hold the body in any way. It's quite possible to sit in an alert and erect posture without there being any strain or stress in the physical form. Check the belly, check the shoulders, check the jaw. And just loosen up. And you'll find from that relaxed posture that the breathing is a lot easier. The channels are open. Now noticing what's happening with the thinking, the mental patterns. There's a lot of activity carrying the things of the morning, the things of our lives into this period. Let's see if you can get this sense of relaxing that as well. Where it's not a condemning or a judging or criticizing. The mind does this, it thinks. But it's just a case of not wanting to have such a whole kind of a grasp on it, tightening around the thinking patterns. Just to loosen up there as well. Kind of fluff it up a little bit. Put some more space in the mind. And then pulling the energy down so that you're really aware of the buttocks sitting on the chair or the cushion or the bench. And establishing yourself in that firmness, that firm, earthy, grounded feeling. And then from this relaxed and settled posture, just beginning to notice the various experiences. Whether it's the breathing, sounds, thoughts. But doing this from a very still and detached vantage point. Just noticing that within your experience right now there is a gentle knowing, there's an awareness of everything that's happening. But to sustain that, to sort of rest in that awareness requires a sustained stillness. So that's what we're trying to cultivate this morning. Getting a sense of being with experience from this vantage point. Still relaxed, yet quite alert. And then anytime that one notices that we're not with it from there, that we've grabbed hold of something or caught up in it, we're just coming back. This is the training, Bhavana, the training of the mind. To rest in a pure place, a place that isn't caught up with what arises, but just aware of what arises. And then noticing over time the distinct difference between these two ways of being. So that that alert awareness, that restful posture becomes more and more attractive. And the coming back becomes easier. From this vantage point there aren't any problems. There's only what is. And then there's the knowing of that. So this is what we're cultivating in this practice period.
