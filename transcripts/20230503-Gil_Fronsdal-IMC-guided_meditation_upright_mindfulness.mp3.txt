 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. And as we begin, get ready for meditation. I would like to mention yesterday, I talked about openness, being open to whatever is happening in such a way that there's like lots of room for experience. It can just experiences, thoughts, feelings, sounds, occurrences around us when we meditate. We don't have to stick anywhere. We don't have to pick them up. We don't have to start thinking about them. We don't have to react. There can be kind of an openness, like an open window, just allow things to pass through. And this related to other kinds of teachings from meditation, of meditation being a radical acceptance of the present moment, being kind of thoroughly receptive to experience. And in that class, that category or kind of side of meditation, as important as it is, it's good to have it balanced with another side. And that is, and they too can go together, they don't have to be separate, as a way of talking. And that is the side of being upright, the side of not collapsing. We don't, metaphorically, we're sitting upright. We're sitting uncollapsed. We're not finding difficult things that we're experiencing, thinking about, remembering, feeling, and just kind of bending over and putting our hand on our forehead and feeling sorry for ourselves. Or we're not giving up on ourselves, or giving up our ability to be grounded, firm, stable by the moment. So on one hand, we're quite open to our experience, which might seem a little bit like we're just available to be victims of challenges. But the other side of it is we're not, we're being undefeated. We are not cowering. We're not giving up. We're not collapsing. We're not giving in to the inner forces that might be pushing us, driving us to run away, or give up, or collapse, or feel sorry for ourselves, or get involved in angry thoughts of revenge. We're not giving up our presence and stability here because of some fantastically wonderful, pleasurable fantasy that we get pulled into. So this ability to be grounded and upright, grounded and just here, in a strong way, goes together with this openness. And the uprightness gives a kind of strength and grounding and kind of a freedom that adds to the freedom of just being open and unaffected by what happens. Everything just passes right through in a certain way. And that combination then is certainly a preparation for what might come, the healthy things that might come. And one of those healthy things is our capacity for compassion and for love. So this is not an aloofness or pulling away. The uprightness means we're right here for experience. There's no question that we're really here. We're not avoiding anything. So to assume a meditation posture and closing the eyes. And if you are going to call on your inner strength to assume a posture that's upright, literally or metaphorically, that feels like a strong stance of being really here. A strength that gives emphasis on, yes, here I am. So it might be some way that the chest is not collapsed, pulled in. It might be some way that the head, the position of the head and the neck where the back of the head gets pulled up towards the ceiling. Or there's a little bit of space formed between the last vertebrae of the spine and the skull. And then you might sway back and forth a bit, partly to feel the shifting pressure or weight of your legs, your feet, your bottom, and whatever is holding you up. And then bring that sway to stillness and feel definitively the way that the weight of your body is supported, received by the chair, your cushion, the floor, the bed. And finding within some place where personal strength resides. Maybe it's a small little marble-sized place somewhere in the torso or in the hands or the feet. Anywhere where some, okay, and with reference to that strength, that place of strength, taking some gently deeper breaths, almost as an expression of your inner strength. Exhaling, relaxing, as a definitive way of settling into here, taking your place, this is your place to be. Letting your breathing return to normal. And scanning through your body, both to relax where there might be tension and release any place where we're contracted. Breathing in and breathing out as you breathe in, as your lungs fill and your diaphragm pushes down. Let that be a clear establishment of stability, uprightness, strength. Each inhale is an expression of taking your place here. Each exhale is a relaxing and softening, opening, and non-resistance in the exhale. And gently as you breathe, without resisting anything and without collapsing or giving up or giving in, really here now in the present, breathing, finding in the breath, in each breath, strength, definitive clarity of being here just now. Breathing in and breathing out as you breathe in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Staying open to your present moment experience with the support of inner steadiness, stability, a strength of upright embodiment of attention. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. So then as we come to the end of this sitting, to gently, maybe even lovingly, feel yourself rooted here and now in your body. Rising out of whatever supports the weight of your body. Feeling some inner stability, inner strength. And maybe for a couple of minutes here, embodying that by sitting a little bit straighter, a little bit more, a posture of definitively being here. And when you are here in a strong, full way, upright, imagine that your love, your kindness, your compassion is supported by that strength, supported by that uprightness, maybe like an antenna which is well positioned to send out a signal far and wide where you send out your care for the world, your care of others, whatever goodwill, well-wishing, love that you have. For the circles of people around you, those who are close in, that you know the best, friends, neighbors, outward in circles into your community and communities, out into the world, may our inner strength, may our ability to be upright, not collapse, not give up, not give in, but to really be here fully present, may it be a means through which our care and love for the world can flow. May we be a antenna that broadcasts well and far kindness and friendliness, respect for others, care for others, appreciation of others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free of suffering. And may we, with our inner strength and stability, be a caring companion for others moving through this life. May all beings be happy. Thank you.
