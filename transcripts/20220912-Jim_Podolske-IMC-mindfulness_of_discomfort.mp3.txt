 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Test this out. Good evening, everyone. Welcome. Several weeks ago, Diana Clark asked me if I would give a talk tonight. She's away. And at the time that she asked me, I was working in South Korea and hadn't been attending IMC since, I think, early July. And I was somewhat at a loss of what to talk about. So I decided that I would talk about sort of how I spent my summer vacation. I worked for NASA, and in that capacity, I have an instrument that flies on high altitude aircraft for measuring atmospheric gases. And so for the last several years, I've been preparing to get that ready to go to on this aircraft and into Korea. And it required that I go to Houston, Texas in late June and early July of this year. And I knew that it would be hot and humid, but it was record breaking hot and humid. They had more days over 100 than they'd ever had before. And so I had to deal with just the discomfort of being in hot, humid, uncomfortable environment for, generally speaking, short periods of time, just between the building that I was working in and my car, or between my car and a restaurant, or the hotel and the car. And I realized I didn't think about it too much, but mostly my way of working with that discomfort was sort of a stoic endurance of it. You know, just kind of not kind of tuning it out in a certain way, or hardening myself in a way to that experience. And I was really looking forward to leaving it and going to South Korea, which I thought would be much more pleasant. And so I was working at a Osan air base outside of Seoul, and I couldn't have been more wrong. Seoul had the hottest temperatures that it had ever. In addition to having floods and a typhoon and all sorts of other challenging conditions. And on this base, I didn't have a car. There were taxis all over that, kind of hard to get hold of at certain times. So it required walking through the heat for, it was about a mile from where I was, the lodge that I was in, to the flight line where I was working. And all of the places to get food were about, almost the same distance, they were about three quarters of a mile from the flight line. So in some ways I was forced to walk in hot, humid conditions, bright sun, absolutely no wind. And I found that I started out with that same sort of stoic endurance strategy. And it turned out it just was miserable. It just didn't work. And then it dawned on me, oh, I know how to work with this. I'll do mindfulness meditation. This is something that I've been doing now for multiple decades. But for some reason it hadn't really occurred to me to apply it in this situation. So I made a kind of a modified version of walking meditation. And I'm curious, how many of you have had some kind of training in walking meditation? Some of you have. And so you know that it's mostly paying attention to the sensations in your feet or in your lower legs as you lift one foot, move it, place it, lift the other foot, move it and place it. And I decided I would try. I wonder if this will really work under this kind of extreme condition. At least it was extreme for me. I'm sure that there are people who have lived in even more challenging conditions than that. But for me it was not a common experience for me. So in the TheravƒÅda and Buddhist tradition, there's a teaching about how to do mindfulness meditation formally, which is based on the four foundations of mindfulness. So these four foundations of mindfulness, the first foundation is mindfulness of the body. And that's perhaps straightforward to think about. It's like paying attention to the sensations that occur in the body moment to moment. So in addition to paying attention to the feet and paying attention to the legs, I could pay attention to the entire body, in particular the skin and all of the perspiration that was coming up from the heat and the humidity. The sensation from the clothing that was rapidly getting very wet from sweating. I was walking about three to five miles a day, which is more than I typically do. And so I was noticing the sensations of soreness of the muscles. I was carrying about a 30 pound computer bag, so there was the sensations in the shoulder and the arm. I was having some back issues, so there were sensations in the back. All of those kinds of sensations are included in the category of mindfulness of the body. And so what made it somewhat easier to do was that those sensations were pretty predominant. They weren't subtle at all. So I didn't have to really try hard to notice what was going on with the body. The second foundation of mindfulness is mindfulness of feeling tone, sometimes called Vedana. It's like, is the sensation that you're experiencing, is it pleasant? Is it unpleasant? Or is it neither pleasant nor unpleasant? Is it kind of a neutral, have a neutral feeling tone to it? And again, that can be a very important thing to pay attention to because often we're unconsciously driven to seek out that which is pleasant and to try to avoid or push away that which is unpleasant and kind of ignore what's neutral, what's neither pleasant or unpleasant. We just don't pay attention to it. So Vedana, the feeling tone, is the second foundation. The third foundation of mindfulness practice is mindfulness of mind states. What is the state of the mind? Is it open or is it contracted? Is it sort of friendly or is it hostile? Is it curious or is it contracted? There's some formal names for the different mind states, but I kind of make them up for myself, kind of noticing what states of mind do I tend to experience? And there's a differentiation between mind states, the third foundation of mindfulness, and mind objects or mental formations, thoughts. In that the mind states tend to be things that last longer. If a certain mind state is developed, it may be around for a while. Whereas mental formations, thoughts tend to just kind of come and go fairly rapidly. So there's the paying attention to mind states. And then the fourth foundation is mindfulness of mind objects or mental formations, thoughts, you could say. What kind of things are going on in the mind? What kind of stories, what kind of opinions, what kind of beliefs? All of those things that can occur. So those are the four foundations of mindfulness. So for this particular situation where I decided I was really going, instead of trying to mentally avoid paying attention to the discomfort, this uncomfortable experience of walking in the heat, I decided that I would really let it be an opportunity for me to just practice developing mindfulness, the muscle of mindfulness, the muscle of being able to be actively aware of what's going on. And see what happens. Does that help in some way or not? And so, as I was saying earlier, the mindfulness of the body was pretty obvious. That I'd pay attention not only to the heat and to the sweating and to the soreness, but there were some sensations that were more subtle, like just the feeling of the feet on the ground. And some that were even mildly pleasant, given that I would often be kind of soaked in sweat, any little breeze, any little air motion, any little walking into the shade temporarily, had a pleasant feeling tone to it. It was noticeable. I could feel, oh yeah, that was good. Occasionally on the way back to my lodging, I would stop at this mall, this food court, which was air conditioned. Walking into the air conditioning was really noticeable, and it was really, really pleasant, at least at the beginning. And so over time, so mindfulness of the body was a very, I'll say, easy practice. Not that I liked it, but that it didn't require a lot of energy or effort to be aware of the body. Similarly with feeling tone, similarly with the pleasant, the unpleasant, and the neutral. For many of the experiences that I was having, many of the physical sensations and also mental activity, I could notice, I think I tended to notice most predominantly what was unpleasant. That was really stood out. And then the third foundation, mindfulness of mind states, I could tell those times when there was strong aversion, and that it was a very aversive mind. It was often set by the conditions that I had experienced that day. Did I get enough sleep? Was I rested or was I tired? Was I hungry or was I pretty well fed? Had I had a lot of success that day or not? Had the instrument worked well? Had we solved some problems or had we found new problems? So success and failure would often influence what the state of mind was that I was experiencing. Was I thirsty? I have to say I was very tuned into the fact that being out in the heat had a certain danger to it. That it is possible to get dehydrated, to have heat exhaustion or heat stroke. In fact, there was a chemistry professor from Berkeley that I knew who had died of heat exhaustion while taking a short walk in Utah just a few weeks before I went to South Korea. So I realized that these things can sneak up on you. So I was very aware of drinking at least two to three liters of water a day. So I didn't often get anywhere near dehydrated, but I would get, I'd certainly get tired. I would certainly get hungry. There were other times when I'd just get frustrated. So I'd see what was the state of my mind as I was walking. And then finally, the fourth foundation is mindfulness of, I'll say, thoughts, mental processes, mental formations. When it first occurred to me to do mindfulness as a way of meeting the discomfort that I was feeling, I had a lot of strong thoughts. I hated this experience. I just really hated it. I had thoughts that this shouldn't be happening. It shouldn't be happening to me. Somebody needs to take care of me. Somebody needs to be chauffeuring me around so that I don't have to experience this. I have self-judgment about why am I suffering and all these other people are just walking around as though everything's fine. And so it really was those thoughts of hatred that caught my attention and made me think, I must find a better way to deal with the discomfort of the heat than just some kind of stoically enduring it. And it occurred to me that in the teachings of the Buddha, there's a story about the Buddha asking one of his monks. He's, I'll paraphrase the story, but he asked the monk, if you get hit by an arrow, somebody shoots an arrow and it sticks into you, does that hurt? And the monk said, yes, Buddha, that would hurt. And he said, and if somebody were to shoot a second arrow into you, would that hurt even more? And he said, oh yeah, that second arrow would, that would also hurt. And so the point of the story is that there are some things that happen to us. Being in hot, uncomfortable conditions is like the first arrow. That part's unavoidable. The second arrow is everything that we add to our experience. All of the thoughts about it, all of the either wanting it or clinging to it or trying to push it away or ignore it. All of the ways that we relate to that first arrow are really the second arrow. And so I could see that, well, there was no avoiding the first arrow of the heat. I could avoid the second and third and fourth arrows that were my responsibility, that I was choosing in a certain way by choosing by not paying attention. And so I found that over time, as I started to do this mindfulness, as I would walk out in the midday heat, that it was better. I certainly, I never reached the point that I liked it, that I found it an enjoyable experience, but I wasn't hating it. I wasn't pushing it away. I wasn't fighting with it. There was a certain level of acceptance that I was accepting. This is how, this is what this moment is like. And that was quite a change. And that was just about the time that Diane asked me if I would give a talk. And so I decided that I would look into this a little bit more. And about the week before I left Korea, I saw that Eugene Cash was giving a talk up in San Francisco, at San Francisco Insight. And his talk was about loving the present moment, loving whatever experience you're having, even if you don't like it. And it was an inspiring talk. I didn't really think that that, that I would get to the point of loving the experience. And that sort of a, can often be a loaded word. But there were other things that I could do. I could find a level of acceptance. This is what my present moment experience is like. By turning my attention to rather than away from the discomfort, there came to be a certain intimacy with the experience. That it wasn't, it wasn't, you know, kind of like looking aside and wondering, is it going away yet? But really just welcoming it in a certain way. And so it was helpful then to hear Eugene talking about the, just how precious the present moment is, whatever it is. You know, whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable, joyous or sad. Connected or lonely. There aren't any moments that we have to reject, that we have to push away, that we have to turn from, that we can have this intimacy with our experience. And that was, you know, that was part of the lesson for me in being in Korea. When I got back, I listened to a talk yesterday morning by a Tibetan teacher, Anam Tubten, up in Point Richmond. And he was speaking about a very similar principle in Tibetan Buddhism about cultivating within yourself a place of luminous awareness. A place, I'll say a place, it's, it's, well, who knows, maybe it is a place inside that can be aware of what's going on and unperturbed by what the content of the present moment is. So it can be aware of discomfort, it can be aware of longing, it can be aware of joy, it can be aware of brightness, you know, energetic brightness, it can be aware of dullness. And that place of luminous awareness is sort, it's up to us to create in a certain way or maybe find or strengthen. So I think this mindfulness of, mindfulness of heat meditation that I was doing for, I think it was about a month in Korea, got me on that path, got me more motivated to see, is it possible for me to reside more often in this place of luminous awareness and not so much in the reaction to my experience or the thoughts about or the opinions about. So I felt very, I felt grateful in a way that, first of all, that I've been exposed to this practice for so many years that it's kind of sinking in. And towards the end of my time in Korea, the temperatures actually cooled down a bit, even below 80 at times. And so I thought, well, this is a valuable lesson, I'll put this one in the can and I'll bring it out when I need it again. And of course, I got back to California last Wednesday in the midst of a record heat wave here and so I realized, okay, well, I guess this isn't just something that's now occurred and it's a great story and I can tell it, but it was like, okay, you're not beyond discomfort. Discomfort's going to always be present no matter where you are geographically. And it isn't a practice that's just about being hot or just the discomfort of the kind of the conditions we've all have been experiencing in the last week or two. I'm sure in a few months I'll be, I could probably give a talk about cold meditation. I think it's going to get cold this winter. It always has. And if it's not that, there's all of the aches and pains that come with getting old. So working with discomfort is a pretty important part of life, you know, letting the discomfort be a teacher rather than just something that needs to be avoided or pushed away is an important lesson for me. Yeah, so that's what I have to offer tonight. And we have a fair amount of time left if there's anyone that has any questions or comments or would like to talk about experience they've had either dealing with heat or dealing with any other kind of discomfort or anything else. So, thank you. Oh, and if you do have a question, I think there's a microphone so that people online can hear. I just wanted to say thank you for the part where you said let the discomfort be the teacher because I do often want to avoid discomfort and I'm currently experiencing discomfort to the point where I'm like, can I handle this for an entire school year? I don't know, but instead of just thinking, well, I mean, I'm going to be with these kids. Let me learn from them and let me not just because boy, it's a hard class. And there are times I just don't know what to do. And but as you said, just I've been resisting it a lot. And I just just thank you. I maybe treat it as a let me learn from them, you know, because I was often very like the self judgment thinking, why should I have to deal with this? What I'm above this or I've been doing this for almost a decade now I can I can deal with it. Or why does it have to be this hard again after the pandemic? But no, there's going to be discomfort at every point in life. And I need to be or I'm just being that having that luminous mindfulness within at least what I'm trying to cultivate is something that I'm trying to strive for every day. So thanks. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, one thing that it didn't say that in addition to just being aware of strength and awareness that I found that over time there was a certain compassion that arose in me compassion for myself caring about the experience and wanting to do something. So it isn't just a practice about observing. But there's also can be a much wiser response, the way we respond to our experience can be wiser if we're more connected with it. So hopefully you'll find some wise ways to work with your pain. Thank you. I don't know the other side. Yeah, something that when you were just speaking now about stoicism makes me curious about myself because that's often my experience to adversity. I'm not sure. But what you also said I think following that was like being maybe I'll paraphrase but like the you can respond with some wisdom really being present to whatever is there also feels true like the story system is kind of a coping mechanism but it's not is accurate. It feels like something for me to sit with more. I face adversity. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's when I when I say kind of stoic and endurance it's more like kind of white knuckling. Yeah, you know, it's like, you know, just bearing down and and you know, trying to, you know, kind of use the force of will to get through the experience rather than really allowing and I suspect that there's probably more years than I'd like to think of where I've sat on a cushion in pain thinking that somehow if I if I experience enough pain, I'm going to have some transformational experience. But the pain alone didn't really do it. It's really how one relates to it. And how one is relating to it. That's perhaps the more important part. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Well, I think that we can end at this point. I'll be around for a few minutes if anyone has a specific question they want to bring to me personally. So thank you all for coming. And may you be skillfully uncomfortable.
