 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at adiodarma.org. Hello everyone from this beginning of the week. And just a minute here. So hello again and warm greetings on this beginning of the week. And we're continuing with the Satipitana Sutta, the core Buddhist, Buddha's teachings on mindfulness, mindfulness practice. And this practice aims at developing a great clarity of awareness, a clarity of awareness, a kind of a lucid awareness, that's very stable and very simple and allows somehow in that clarity and simplicity it sees things clearly in such a way that liberation is within reach. And so it's a state of mind that's settled, some would say concentrated, composed, very present and very clear, very attentive to the flow of experience in the present moment. And the text is all about the different exercises you can do to build up to that quality of clear attention in the present moment. And many of us here in the West have learned certain aspects of this text, especially the ones that emphasize simple mindfulness, non-reactive mindfulness and simple recognition of what's happening as it's happening in the present moment. And sometimes we get the impression that's all we're allowed to do. But in this text there's other practices to be done or can be done that contribute to developing the mind overall so the mind can have the stability and strength to remain in the present moment and see clearly. And surprisingly, one of those things we develop is our capacity for imagination. Or the word that we're talking about right now, pacha-vekati, vekati, can also mean to review, with the word view implying a kind of a seeing. So whether that reviewing is more mental consideration, thoughtful, brings something to mind, or whether it's evoking the imagination to visualize something, that depends on the individual practitioner. But in a variety of ways and situations, the Buddha kind of relies on or calls on very simple acts of imagination. He does that when he evokes metaphors for practice. And we'll see now in this next exercise, I like a beautiful metaphor. And somehow the evoking that happens with it, when we imagine a metaphor that speaks to something about what the meditation is going to be about, it kind of evokes those parts in our body, in our mind, in our hearts perhaps. So it comes a little bit of surprise that imagination has a role, partly because other places the Buddha clearly is critical of how we get caught in fantasy and false imaginations. But he uses a different word for that. And he has a couple of words he uses that are more positive, that probably mean closer to visualize than simply imagination. And so this next exercise uses this. And so as a way of introducing it for the meditation today, I'd like us to engage in a simple act of imagination to support the meditation practice. So it's not to imagine anything that's not present. So you don't have to worry about being taken off on some journey someplace with imagination. But it is evoking the imagination to support being here. So taking a meditation posture, lowering the gaze, relaxing the eyes, relaxing the gaze. If it's comfortable, closing the eyes. And in a way that is comfortable for you, taking some deeper breaths, maybe three quarters full. Exhaling no longer than you normally would, but not so long that it's a strain. A delightful exhale. Letting the breathing return to normal. And hang out for a bit with the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out. And if it's easy, relaxing the body as you exhale. And then imagine yourself sitting in meditation. Maybe if you have an easy ability to visualize, visualize yourself sitting in meditation. It doesn't have to be exactly as you are, but in some way the imagination, the visualization, the reflection, has some nice feeling to it, nice quality. Maybe you might also imagine in your mind's eye with your eyes closed the place where you're sitting. Letting your mind gently roam around left and right, up and down. Imagineing, visualizing the location where you are. And then again, within your place, imagine yourself in your meditation posture. Imagine that your body is beginning to relax. Whether it actually relaxes or not is secondary to simply imagine. Maybe you remember a time when the body relaxed deeply and you imagine that that's how you are now. Imagine the relaxed way that you're safe here and now, surrounded by these few minutes with safety. Imagine what it would be like for your body to feel itself in a safe place. What would relax in the body? And imagine what it would be like if in this imaginary meditation session you felt content at ease. Imagine the breathing. What it would feel like to breathe and sit here, very contented, at ease with all things. Maybe visualizing yourself meditating this way. Imagining a feeling of contentment, spreading through the body. Whether your content or not is secondary to the imagination that you are. A gentle imagination. For people who have a hard time visualizing or imagining, imagine that you're visualizing. Imagine that you're imagining. So it's a very light touch. Imagining you're sitting here in your meditation posture, breathing in a content way. Imagining what that would feel like. And now having spent some time imagining, let go of the imagination and let your awareness enter into your body as it actually is. Becoming aware of your embodied experience. As you exhale, calming the mind, calming the thinking. Inhale. Centering your awareness on how your body experiences breathing. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. And as we come to the end of this sitting, notice if there's any ways that you are calmer, calmer, more peaceful, more settled from this meditation. Or if you're not, do you have more clarity about how you actually are? A simple recognition or a deep recognition. One way or the other, sitting quietly in your meditation posture, not moving, notice how you are. And to whatever degree there's a sense of stability or stillness or non-reactivity to the world around you. Imagine yourself being stable, non-reactive, not closing down. Imagining that the people of your life are coming into your view. That you bring to mind those people you might encounter today, whether they're strangers or acquaintances or friends or family, neighbors. And see if you can have them be present in the mind's eye while you are non-reactive, while you are stable and steady, maybe peaceful. Imagining that you offer a stable attention, sense of presence, non-reactive presence. And from this place, this way, do you have access to any thoughts or imaginations, how good it would be if these people could be happy, safe, content, peaceful, free. Imagine that's possible and wish that to them. May they be happy. May they be safe. May they be peaceful. May they be free. And may this good will, well-wishing for the world, spread out into the world through the day. And may each of us live for the benefit of this world. May all beings be happy. Thank you.
