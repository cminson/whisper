 Oh well that's just the one. Because listen to it. Yeah. They're both beautiful. So ring the bell to start. No. No. No. Often a good way to start in meditation is just to take a few moments just in a general way to just connect in with the body. It's just a way of just settling in and getting here. We often come to practice, especially coming at the end of a day carrying just the busyness of the day. And there can be a lot of things rattling around in our bodies and our minds. So just to connect into, just either a general sense of the body or to touch in and see if there's any particular strong sensations. Tension or just anything with fatigue or whatever we might be feeling. And not to do anything about it. We're not trying to get rid of it, but just as it's more of an acknowledging. Making ourselves just more aware of it. Take the first few moments now. Especially if you're new to practice. This is a good exercise. It's a good exercise. It's a good exercise. And I think that's a good exercise. Especially if you're new to practice, this is a good exercise. It's to just take the first few moments to listen to sound. And just to hear whatever sounds arise in the room. Traffic noise or any sounds from inside the room. And these sounds from inside the room. And in particular, I invite you to notice that you don't have to struggle or work very hard to hear sound. Just by turning your attention towards hearing. Sounds arise and pass away. Just quite easily and naturally on their own. You don't have to do anything. And it's similar for any experience. Any experience can be known or can be experienced quite naturally and easily just by turning our attention in that direction. So now to bring the awareness back into the body. And just to connect in with your breathing. And in particular, just finding the place in the body where you feel the sound of the breathing. And in particular, just finding the place in the body where you feel the sound of the breathing. And in particular, where you can experience the physical sensations of the breathing just the clearest and the easiest. It's a very simple instruction. And just rest your attention there. Sometimes people will use the expression to watch the breath. But it's actually, it's watching, but it's actually connecting with experiencing the breath. And to find the place where you can feel the breath the easiest. And the clearest. So for some people it may be the coolness of the air entering and leaving at the nose. The sensation of the air. For others it may be the rising and falling of the air. For others it may be the rising and falling of the abdomen of the belly. It could even be in the throat or the chest. It doesn't really matter. Everyone's different. It's finding your place. And if you don't know, you can experiment a little. But at some point we'll want to settle into one place and work there. . And for the time being, as much as possible if other experiences or sensations arise, either in the body, emotions or sounds, let everything else stay in the background for now. As much as possible, just work with the breath and let the breath stay in the foreground of your awareness. As the practice develops, we open the field of awareness to include all experiences. But in the beginning it can be quite helpful to focus the awareness and continue working just with watching the breath. . And then we often will give another technique you can use, which is a mental note or mental labeling technique, if it's useful. And it's just another aid to help keep the mind directed to the breathing. So that if you find it helpful with each breath, you can make a soft mental note of either in, out, if you're experiencing the breath at the nose, or rising, falling, if you're at the abdomen. Most of the awareness stays with the breath itself, and the mental note is just, it's just kind of an extra, it just helps direct the mind. And if it's not useful, if it's awkward or clumsy, just forget about it and just stay with the breath. . And the last piece of instruction that I'll add in tonight is, you probably noticed that the mind has a tendency to wander off, get lost in thought, planning, daydreaming. It's actually not a problem when the mind wanders off. When you've wandered off in thought, you don't even know you're gone anyway. So when you're gone, just be gone. But it's in that moment of waking up when you realize you've been lost, just returning back to the breath then, and starting over. And this is the place where, just as when we were listening to sound, it's good to incorporate this idea of not struggling. It's important not to, you can put effort into your practice, and you can work hard, but we don't want to get into a struggle. Just be with the breath when you're with it, be gone when you're gone, when you wake up, come back. . If any of you were having a particularly difficult sitting, sometimes when we meditate, it can be quite pleasant and calm and whatever peaceful, or we're in some deep meditative state, and then other times, it can be quite difficult. We might be sleepy, or our body is hurting, we're restless and can barely sit still, and we feel like, when is that bell going to ring? And it's interesting to notice when that happens, that I found when I've been in that state, just trying to get through to the bell rings, and then the bell will ring, and I'll just feel this relief. And you notice in those times, I haven't moved yet, nothing's changed. All that happened, I was sitting, I was in hell, and then, I'm in heaven. Nothing else changed except this sound. It's just good to notice that that experience of the suffering, what I'm calling the heaven or hell, or suffering or difficulty, was really created in the mind. You just totally created it, right? In that example I'm giving. So it's just good to notice how much of our experience we create in our own mind is just a real simple example. Of course, we do this all the time. Actually, that's the whole kind of getting to the heart of what the Buddha was talking about around the nature of suffering. He was making a separation between pain and suffering. We might talk about that a little more tonight, but I just wanted to point that out, if you happen to have that experience. I've certainly had that happen to me. So I do have plenty of things we might talk about, but I wanted to ask if anyone had any questions about, it could be Dharma questions, or meditation, in particular, meditation practice questions. So I don't know how that was for you. You don't have to get into it. I'm not necessarily trying to extract questions, but since you had some mindfulness practice, I just want to add in that there's many ways that Vipassana practice is taught, and many techniques that are given. There's actually a whole range of practices. We tend to teach a particular style that comes out from Mahasi-saita, Burmese style. It's also taught in other places. And this working with the breath is foundational, but it actually is a lot more to just be aware of. Although it is said that just the breath really, and I think it tends to be true, really contains probably most or everything that we need, and our practice can really be found even in the breath. But there's ways also just to incorporate all other experiences, because obviously when we see it there's a lot else going on. There's things that can come up in the body, you know, our bodies can hurt or be ache or whatever, or be pleasant experiences and thoughts and sounds and emotions. And so we're really not pushing any of it away. It's actually an inclusive practice, but we tend to start with the breathing just to gain a certain amount of concentration and to build up the mindfulness that's going to allow us to not get so lost in the rest of the experiences. So as we do open to them, we've got a stability of mind that's there to really be present. That's kind of the idea, but just give a little instructions. Tonight we usually start just with some breathing practice. I actually had a couple of things on my mind, and we'll see how we go with it. One thing that came up for me is I was recently talking with a friend who I think was going through, who does not practice in this community, but in another Dharma community, and I think she was having some kind of difficulty with either the teacher or the community, and she was kind of in a huff, and she came to me and said, well, you know, we come to these meditation groups, and we all sit out there, and somebody sits up in front and tells us all how it is, and she went on and on. She's a long-time practitioner, and I think she was just having, I don't know what was going on there, but we talked about it. I thought that was actually an interesting comment, though, because you know, in this practice, we don't really tend to have these gurus we don't think of like that, that sits up in the front like some, and we're just all, you know, this is not like that. But, I mean, hopefully if someone is leading a practice or is, you know, in the teacher role, they have some, they've learned something. But I think what was interesting when I reflected on it, because it's very clear to me that, you know, really we all know our own truth, and we don't need anybody to tell us how it is. We know how it is. Right? Matter of fact, nobody knows how it is for you, except for you, right? Nobody should be sitting up to tell anybody how it is. That's the whole practice, because it already is how it is. As we open to our truth ourselves, one of the questions that we're being asked is, is that we can really just be present for our truth. See, one of the things that happens in the practice is that we tend to, because we're gaining a certain amount of concentration, which most people don't do in their lives, you know, we're just caught in life and we're just running around, and we don't really train our minds. And then you see when you sit to meditate that our minds are just quite out of control for most of us, probably all of us to some degree, right? So we just sit and try to quiet down and just to get to come present with our experience. We're actually in a conscious way trying to generate a certain amount of concentration and a certain amount of mindfulness, ability to be present and ability to know what's real and true. And then we go in sort of an inner exploration. So it shouldn't be a surprise to us then by doing that that all sorts of things are going to be revealed. Sometimes this practice is called a purification practice. It's one way to think about it. I don't know that we would necessarily think that the purpose is purification. The purpose is more finding a freedom and a way of being present with our lives and awakening to our lives and really kind of a way of not being at the effect of everything so much, but finding a freedom in the midst of everything as it is. But there is a purification aspect that happens because as we start to deepen, the image that's often used is one of peeling the onion is used quite often. And as you peel away layers, you see more. And we're going to see everything so we're going to see the, I don't know if this is the best way to say it, but we're going to see the beautiful. Well, see, the not so beautiful. Everything will be revealed and we've all got both. Just a mix of everything. And everybody I think would want purification, right? We just don't want to go through the purification process to get there. It's like we all want to understand the nature of suffering, but how do you understand something? The nature of something. You experience it, right? That's how you come to know something. So if we want to understand the nature of suffering, we have to come face to face with our suffering. And then we start to look at, well, what's really that cause there of that suffering in our lives? So we're going to be confronted with it. We're going to open to it. We're not going to automatically run away or try to mask over, you know, if there's something unpleasant all the time. Of course, we'll do that to some degree. We all do that, right? None of us want, you know, to want suffering. We all want to have more pleasant in our lives. Isn't that true? Everybody does. I mean, I was thinking about it. These ringing these bells, I was kind of kidding around when I first came here because it's both bells. And I said, oh, I want to check out and see some of you came in late. But I said, oh, I want to see which one I want to ring because here's this nice big, big one. And you know, it's got this beautiful sound. I just love the sound of that bell. So let me test them out and see which one. And then there's this one. Well, that one's pretty too, but I like the big one. I'm going to ring the big one, really. I wanted to max. I mean, it's kind of a silly example, but I'm trying to get the most pleasant. I really like to ring this bell. I don't get to sit up here and do that. I really do. I'm kind of making a joke about it, but I'm really not joking. You know, I love to ring this bell. It's just beautiful. This one's good too, but I just don't get quite as much pleasure. It's good too. I think that's really kind of for myself. It's kind of a metaphor, really, of how I live my whole life. Right? I want to get the most, not necessarily pleasure, but pleasant. And I don't want to get less of the unpleasant. So that's what we're all doing, but in this practice, we're kind of being asked to maybe work on a different way of being, which isn't just at the effect of what's going on in my body, in my mind, and in my life, and can I, if I don't like it, get rid of it or get distracted. And if I do like it, try to hold on to more of it, but more of finding a way of being kind of more, maybe stability might be a word, a resting place just in the midst of it all. That's that inner freedom, so that the happiness is not, some of you have heard me say this, I say this almost every time we give a talk, but it really is getting to the heart of it. It's like that the happiness is not so much dependent on having or creating some particular kind of experience, but more coming to terms with or finding a way of being with whatever the experience is that we're actually having. And so it's kind of a freedom that's not dependent on these changing causes and conditions. That's kind of the idea. And another thing that came up for me when this friend of mine was talking was, it made me reflect back on, well, what have I learned in my meditation for myself? And we could all reflect on that. Because one of the things I've heard said, I think this might come from the Dalai Lama, but that if you're going to judge your meditation practice, and that's a whole other question of whether we should be getting into that whole judging anyway, but let's be honest, right? We're going to judge it. Until we're free from judging, we're going to do that, right? It's just part of the way the mind tends to work. So if we're going to get caught in that, a better way to judge it is not looking back over one meditation practice or one week or one month or even one year, but you need to look at it in five-year or ten-year increments and then look back and see if there's been an effect or what's been gained or what's been learned. And I really find that very inspiring. I've looked back up and meditating a lot of years, and it has been a shift. I can really say that. It really has been, I can say that the practice really does have a deep effect, and really it seems that many people have found that it's just utterly transformative when you really give it what it needs to, like anything, if you want to get the result, it requires a certain amount, which isn't always easy to do, given how our lives are busy, so we need to acknowledge that. It's not always an easy thing. And I'm reminded of this wonderful image from the Buddha when someone once asked the Buddha what the difference was between an ordinary person and an enlightened person. And the Buddha said, well, both the ordinary person and the enlightened person just experienced the whole range of life, all the pleasant and the joy and the happiness, but also all the difficulty and the pain and the suffering. And the image he used is with the pain and the suffering, he says both the enlightened person and the ordinary person experience the difficulty, it's like they've been shot with a, he says a dart, but he means like an arrow. And he said, but the enlightened person isn't making a problem about it. The ordinary person makes a problem, so on top of the pain and suffering itself, then the ordinary person just gets in a version and creates this whole problem. It's like they shoot themselves a second time with the second arrow. It's called the, I think it's the sutra or the image or the parable simile of the two darts. If you're interested, someone's writing, and I can tell you where it's from if you want later. But that's a wonderful image, isn't it? It's just like the talking about earlier about ringing the bell, if you're having a difficult sit. And you may be sitting in, say, pain, say you have knee pain, right? So there's the knee pain, it's unpleasant. It's actually possible, I know many people here who've been sitting a long time, I'm sure, have experienced where it can be unpleasant, but you can actually be quite equanimous with it. And it's not really a problem, you can actually just be present with it and know it's unpleasant experiencing. Then it's a whole other level of suffering if we add on top of that our struggle with it, trying to get rid of it, oh my God, I'm not going to make it through the sitting, and all the stuff we create in our mind. And you get to experience that when that bell rings and the mind has that ah experience, even before you've moved so the knee pain itself is still there. You get to experience in that moment, a moment of liberation, it's a moment of actual direct experience where we still have the first dart we've been stabbed with, so to speak, which is that pain. But we don't shoot ourselves with the second arrow. You get to feel, what a difference in the quality of being. So I think the idea isn't so much that we're going to reach this transcendent space of bliss and harmony and nothing unpleasant is ever experienced. But there's a deeper freedom in relationship to it all that we can find. The Buddhist saying there's actually a way of being in relationship to our own lives exactly as we found them, just as it is with all the difficulty. Where we can start to become more in harmony with our lives as it is. So I don't know what the ultimate experience, you know if you could be a Buddha, what that might be like. But as I've reflected back on my own practice, I can say that compared to maybe how it used to be plenty of times in my life, I don't shoot myself with that second arrow nearly as often as I used to. Not nearly as often. That's a real fruit of the practice. Or, often times, when I am about to shoot myself, at least I know I'm about to shoot it, you know, I know, okay I'm picking it up, I'm about to shoot, okay I'm going to shoot, yep I shot myself, at least I have more awareness about what I'm doing. And of course there's the times when we're just caught. And that's part of it too. And that's the part where we have to bring in just the compassion for ourselves. The wisdom is that part of knowing and becoming more aware and free, and the compassion piece that goes right along with it is the part that just says, yeah, you know, sometimes it does hurt. And sometimes we're not wise and we're not free, and you know, we're not on top of it, it's got us. And just to acknowledge that. And that, what I find is by bringing those two pieces together, the mindful awareness coupled with the compassion, when those come together, that I've found for myself, and you can see whether or not that's true for you in your own life as you work with it, most experiences I'm able to be present for a lot more, if I can remember, if I can be awake enough to know, to bring those two, that there's that big container of the compassion. And then within that, it kind of gives me that softness and that acceptance and that space to then meet, experience whatever it is with the mindful awareness. And they kind of both have to be there in the right balance. And then I found that I really can be there present for my life for more and more of the time as the practices unfold. That's what I found to be true. So I invite each of us to look and see if it's true in our own, in each person's, in your own life. One way to think about it is that I think the practice allows us, I found it's true in my own practice, is to trust our own experience more, to trust our own lives. You know, we so often are in, what I like to call it, say we're in an adversarial relationship with ourselves, with our own being, with our own lives. It's like there's a war going on there. We don't like it. I have a little quote here I was reminded of. Let me see if I can find it. I have discovered that all of man's unhappiness derives from only one source, not being able to sit quietly in a room. I think that's exactly what's being pointed to here. That we project, we're projecting all our troubles out there. And that's not to say that that isn't real, right? Because there are plenty of troubles out there. We don't want to diminish that. We don't want to say that that's not real. We want to acknowledge that. But we also want to take responsibility for the part that we bring, that we bring. And that's what we bring. That's what we bring. That we overlay on top of experience. There's a certain amount of the difficulty in life that, let's just face it, it's there. It's just part of life. Life just has that aspect to it. So I think really, Vipassana practice is not so much trying to create some meditative state. Although if we practice long enough, or for those of you who have, you know, you're not going to have to do that. So I think that's a very important aspect. I mean, they're great. In fact, I was talking with a Dharma teacher, one of the Spirit Rock teachers just last week, and we were just chatting about this, and we were both saying, I don't know if I'm supposed to really say this to you guys, but I'm going to say what we've done. We've done a lot of work on this. We've done a lot of work on this. We've done a lot of work on this. And we were both saying, I don't know if I'm supposed to really say this to you guys, but I'm going to say what we just said, let's be honest. We all want those meditative states. And it's true. They're great. But what's also true about them is that they don't last. They come and they go. Just like the difficult meditations come and go. And it's just like life. The pleasant and the beautiful and the parts we love comes and it goes, and the difficulties come and go. It's just a chain. Why spend a lot of time trying to create some special experience? It isn't going to last anyway. Much better to find that freedom that's not dependent on any of the experiences. So when the highs come, we experience them. Matter of fact, we probably experience them more than maybe we ever have because we're more awake and more present for them. We actually get to enjoy them more, but we're not clinging on to them. When it's there, we can be there. And when it passes, we can let go. So it doesn't jerk us around so much, but it doesn't mean we become numb and we don't feel it. And likewise, when the difficulties come, they don't jerk us around as much. We feel them. This is the downside. We also feel them more deeply because we're more awake. We're going to experience everything more deeply. But our ability to be free and present and awake with those experiences also deepening right along with them. So when they talk about opening to the richness of life, it's the richness of the beauty, but it's the richness of the pain too. So that's what is just the natural fruit in the opening of this practice. But it can seem confusing sometimes because we often say, I'm just sitting here talking and using words like opening to, accepting, being with. We're not trying to create any special states. But wait a minute. We're also talking about developing mindfulness, developing concentration. Well, that's part of the meditation instructions. We say that also, right? That's a different flavor. That's actually talking about, that is developing something because if I don't have any concentration, I am trying to create something that wasn't there or increase or gain something, create special states. Concentration, mindfulness are special states. They can be increased. They can decrease. How do those two come together? Ultimately, when the Buddha was asked if he could express his teaching in one sentence, he could, and he said it really comes down to not clinging. Not clinging. He said the whole dharma, the whole teaching could be summarized as nothing should be clung to, basically. It was a paraphrase of the quote. And he's pointing to what we've been talking about tonight, about finding that freedom not in the flow of experience, but a deeper place in which we're kind of in harmony with the flow of life. But if I say to you, okay, don't cling, you can't do it. You can't do it, right? I mean, you can do it in a moment. We can all do it in a moment. And we've all had plenty of moments. Everybody in this room, even if you don't think this applies to you, it does. Everyone in this room has had moments of the taste of liberation and freedom, moments in which we were not caught in a lot of aversion, not caught in a lot of grasping and clinging. It might have been kind of just kind of open and happy and free in the flow of life. Maybe the sense of self-awareness wasn't even that strong. We may not have noticed those moments even. We're just kind of in the flow. Everyone's had that. But the problem is that the seeds, the conditioning is there, so when the circumstances come together just right, it's like when people say, you know, getting your buttons pushed, when the right things come together, they can hook us back in. Those seeds have not been uprooted. They just bring it all back together in a solid way and we're caught again. So in this practice, we are kind of working on loosening that conditioning a little bit, right? So then it just comes down to what's the wise and skillful means towards more freedom and the ability to not be grasping and clinging so much. In the, I think most of you, some of you may not be aware, but most of you have heard of the Buddha talks about his Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. I don't want to really go into that much, but just to say that the Buddha laid out this path called the Eightfold Path and it's eight pieces. It's not really steps because they're not linear. We practice them all together. But eight pieces of practice about having what's usually called right view or right understanding, I'll just say them real quickly, that's one, right thought or right intention. That's the wisdom part. And then the next three are kind of the morality part or how we live our lives, which is called right speech, right action and right livelihood. So living and acting in a way that leads to more happiness and freedom for ourselves and for others. And then the last piece, the meditation piece, is right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. So if you don't remember all that, don't worry. But just to know that there's this Eightfold Path and all these things we talk about fall within this Eightfold Path. Well, the reason I bring this up is because that word right, notice each of the eight pieces start with the word right. It kind of got translated. I don't know that way. And so that seems to be what has stuck and what you'll hear most of the time. It's actually not a good translation. The word it was preserved in this language called Pali. You don't have to know the Pali. But in case you're interested, the word is summa. It's S A M M A and it's short a. So it's an a sound summa. And if you look up in the Pali English dictionary, sort of the etymology of the word is it actually means to be connected in one with. Which I just think is beautiful. Because I think our Western minds when we hear right, that means well, there's also a wrong. It's that judgment. So if you don't do it this way, this is the right way. And if I do it over here, it's wrong. But that's not the meaning of it all. There's no right or wrong. It's just can we act and be in a way that's connected in one with. Beautiful. Because no judgment. The more we are acting and being and living and practicing in a way that's connected in one with with ourselves, with others, with life, with all things. It leads to more happiness and more freedom. In the times when we do get caught, which is going to happen to us all. There's not a judgment. It's just we have to have that compassion and to understand, OK, we got caught. It just weren't a time of acting in that way. And it does lead to more. And we can just see for ourselves, just look into our experience. And when we act in the way that that creates more unhappiness. Right. So when we really if we were going to pick a single translation, I think a better one would be wise and skillful rather than right. So what is action? What is meditation? What is an understanding, a way of being that's wise and skillful? There is no one answer to that for each of us are different. And even as individuals were different times or different places, you know, in our lives. So getting back to that question I asked about this idea of cultivating certain qualities versus just allowing and being. The Buddha taught. He wasn't interested in trying to propagate some fixed doctrine. He wanted to get people free. So how he taught varied depending on what was needed in the moment. So it gets more less into the. The science and more the art of this practice, which is knowing the ability and this is something that we as we tune in, we learn to know what is most needed in the moment. Sometimes what's needed is. This sense of. Allowing of being of opening to not trying to gain anything or get anywhere and just opening to being in relationship to our experience as it is kind of the way I was talking more towards the beginning. And that's the sense of it. Right. Not being in a struggle with life as it is. And that's probably maybe the best. What's most useful. However. If that's out of balance, we can get in this thing. Well, I don't have to try. I don't have to do anything. This is just me. I don't want to. And what might be needed then is more of this idea of cultivating certain qualities and we tend to work harder and well, I need to get more concentration and more. Mindfulness, for example, why I want to develop maybe I want to develop a more loving heart than I have now. So we want to cultivate that. That may be what's more needed in that time. So we'll lean more towards the style of practice that's more of gaining or cultivating or doing. But if we get too out of balance in that. We might get too much striving or struggling or suffering, you know, and it gets more into. You know, how I am is not okay and I've got to get like this and we can be out of balance and then we may want to go back over to the style. It's more just allowing and being and accepting and not clinging and letting go. So you can see both flavors kind of have a place and all of us will have times when we're going to be able to get to the style of being. When we find ourselves wanting to or needing to or just naturally practicing in one style. Or we'll be more of the other style in relationship to life, right? There's sometimes when there's we want to sort of get rid of certain qualities and we want to gain others and other times we just want to open to life as it is and finding the way where those two kind of can work together. Does that make sense? So I think that's all I wanted to say. And we have some time if there are either any questions or if you have any comments, we can just open it up. I don't know if there's something I've been clinging to for a long time. It's been under a few years. I'm aware that this clinging is causing the problem. But I don't know what to do about it. Well, so I don't know if you don't have to get into the details and I don't know if it's appropriate or not. Well, maybe I'll just make a general comment since I don't know the specifics. It's true that in general all of us have things that we're clinging to. And the first part is to wake up to know that we are clinging to it. So that's the first part. If we haven't done that, there's no freedom of choice and so much of the meditation practice and mindfulness is about being able to wake up enough to have choice because when we're not awake or just lost in it, there is no choice. So you've done that piece. The next thing then is sometimes even in the face of that, we either can't or we're not ready or whatever to let it go. And even we see that it might be causing us suffering. And so the image that I sometimes think of is like you're holding a hot potato in your hand and it's like it's, ouch, ouch, it's burning, it's burning, ouch, ouch, it's burning, it's burning. And really, you know, we just want to, we need to turn our hands over and let go. And it's a big relief. Right? But sometimes, maybe we're not ready to let go of that potato and I don't mean this, I hope it doesn't sound in a disrespectful way. But you may, it may be that you might have to go through some more suffering about it seriously until you've realized that the suffering is more painful than whatever it is you're getting by clinging onto it. And I think what happens here is that a natural letting go tends to happen. It's kind of like they're saying, you know, you can't force the bud to flower, but when it's ready it opens. And I think just by being engaged in that, willing to, and just, I think it takes a lot of courage to confront that head on. And if you don't want to confront it head on, that's okay too, because sometimes it's too much and, you know, we need a break and we don't want to just get into it. But to the extent you can and be engaged in it. And in its time, you know, when you've suffered enough, the letting go will happen. And then you can kind of, I don't know, is that useful? Okay. I don't have a magic, you know, without getting into it. I mean, you know, maybe someone might talk to you sometime if they knew the details, there might be some other things to it. But that would be my general answer. Right. I think that brings up something sort of that there's a question for me, is it seems that when I see those things that I might be clinging to, and I find I compound that with an aversion to the clinging, not just a clinging to the thing, not an aversion to clinging to the thing. Yeah. So, I don't know if it's in what you're saying exactly, but I think I see that I, somebody would compound with all of it more. Absolutely. And there's no question that that can happen. You know, we can be in the clinging and then we think I shouldn't be clinging, and then the version of the clinging kicks. You know, this is just how the mind gets going. You know, we all do that. So, once again, it's that mindful awareness and compassion, meeting it with mindful awareness and compassion. And sometimes just by seeing what you're doing and being aware of it, just the fact that's a lot of awareness that you're talking about. So, the fact that you see it, do you, let me ask you, do you find that sometimes when you're able to see that, you're able to go, oh, and some letting go can happen sometimes? Yeah. So, a lot of it is just having enough awareness to realize because it can get subtler and subtler levels of that. For me, sometimes I can't let go because I don't see it clearly and not to know what it is I need to let go of. So, I have to go for a long time. Yeah. Definitely. One question I had is like, I have an experience that when I meditate able and I'm not practicing, I find myself having a lot of imaginary conversations. And it's like, oh, if she says this or if she says that, I'll say this and I'm going to go and I'll catch myself and I'll see it. And then the next step is I'm explaining this conversation to someone else. Right. And then you're saying, wow, isn't that amazing? I'm after all these internal conversations. And then I find myself just, I'm inventing another. And it just goes on and on. And it seems like I can see it over and over until it reaches a point where I just say, wow. And then I can kind of let it go. Yeah. But then it comes back again. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if that was a, just a comment or a question. Okay. Well, I would say a couple of things. I mean, I certainly, it just reminds me, I can think of times in my life where there was some situation going on. And then I'm projecting out into my mind. I go through this whole scenario and conversation. And I'm actually all angry about something that hasn't even happened. I completely made up in my mind the whole thing. And I've had all these emotions coming up and I'm really pissed off. And, you know, I just, so I mean, other people were nodding their heads. So I think, you know, just human beings can certainly tend, can do that sometimes. So in general, once again, there's, I have a couple of just things to throw out. One is once again, it just comes to the awareness of it and can see. And then you may or may not have choice about fueling that. Right. You may want to just let it go. But sometimes also, if you find that it is, it's kind of a compulsive fit, not compulsive, but, you know, it just won't stop. It's got a lot of energy behind it. Oftentimes there's something underneath it that's driving it. So sometimes, for example, I can find that maybe, you know, I'm sitting meditating my mind's because it's kind of going, going around and going around. And I want it to slow down. And then I need to stop and think, well, let them look. Is there something underneath that a little bit? And when I might look, I might notice, I'm just making an example. I might notice, oh yeah. I had that difficult interaction this morning and so and so said something and that still kind of feels in my stomach, just kind of, oh, you know, in my stomach. And I still feel kind of yucky from that. And that's fueling it. And then when I can bring some awareness to that, it can start to let go a little, maybe oftentimes just something fueling underneath. Any other? You have a pleasant experience and then you're going, it's over and you got going back to it and think about it. Is that clinging to like, you know, place after after and you're still there? It just sounds like it's some clinging to me. I mean, I'm not putting a judgment on it, right? But I don't know. I don't know that it's necessarily have to make a big problem about it. Sometimes it's a pleasant experience and it's pleasant. And we think back on it. And I'm just thinking for myself when I think back, this may not be exactly what you happen to do, but when I think back, it kind of brings that pleasantness up again. Right? And you're still kind of reliving that experience. You feel that same joy of when... On the other hand, you're teaching us to be present in this moment. So if you are kind of living in the past or future, it's not the... That's true. But what's actually going on, that's going on. And we want to be a little careful here because there's a couple of levels. It's true. Being in the present is connecting with our experience, the actual experience in our moment. But when we are reliving the past, what's actually going on in the present isn't, oh, I shouldn't be doing that. What's going on in the present is thinking about the past. So first you can wake up to just what's going on. Before we decide to do anything about it, we can just know, oh, reliving the past. That actually is being in the present. And can know that that's happening. And then we may want to let it go and say, oh, yeah, or we may not. But at least we have some freedom and choice there. Can you mind if we choose to get lost in pleasure's memory? Yeah. Right? I mean, we say get lost in it, I know, but certainly... I mean, I can just give you an example of an experiment you can try. I happen to like chocolate a lot. Or you could pick whatever your favorite thing. I really like chocolate personally. So I can, you know, I'm going to get the chocolate. I'm anticipating the chocolate. I'm thinking about this whole thing before. And then I'm getting it and I'm eating it. I'm just lost in it. And it's great. And that's one level of experience. There's another way of being where instead of being just merged into it, lost into it, still go through the whole thing, but just be awake. So I can see that the anticipation and being aware of it. I'm not telling me I shouldn't have it, but I'm being aware of it. And then, you know, I'm eating the chocolate and still having the experience, tasting it, but just awake rather than lost in it. Just be aware of it. And try that experience. It's a completely different experience. I think you can save a lot of money because if you are in this moment you will eat it more slowly. So you can eat more. And I've actually found that when I did that experiment that what I found is that the chocolate still was pleasant. It was good. But, you know, it's like it really, it kind of cut a lot of the energy out of it. It was just kind of more just seeing it, that pleasant experiences were arising. You know, wasn't that big of a deal, just pleasant experiences? It was there. Notice that. Take some of the most pleasant experiences that we generally associate with, right? And take some of those experiences and try the experiment and see what the quality is in those, the most peak ecstatic moments of the chocolate or whatever that pleasant experience is. And see what it is when I'm awake and when I'm just lost in it. Just experiment. I'm not saying which one you should choose, but it's just worth looking. Do we suffer because we're intelligent? Do we suffer because we're intelligent? Well, that's an interesting question. Did you all hear that? The question was, do we suffer because we're intelligent, right? And you said also, do we have to do this practice because we're intelligent? If we weren't intelligent there wouldn't be a need, right? Well, certainly, we're getting kind of off into a philosophical discussion, but which I love, philosophical discussions personally. Let's just say this. If we weren't intelligent, I guess the way I would like to answer it is this, and I don't know if this will be satisfying for you. If we weren't intelligent, we wouldn't have a choice, right? In other words, if you were like your cat or your dog, and I don't want to get into the discussion of, well, how do we know what a cat, but just so, but anyway, I'm just trying to make a point here. I'm just assuming that your cat or your dog doesn't have that much choice. And I'm not trying to get into the question of how much a cat or a dog suffers or doesn't suffer, right? About creating that extra level of problem. It's an interesting discussion. But I will say this. What I do know is here we are as human beings. However it got to be that way, whether it should or what we'd do if we're different, I don't know that. But the truth is you are intelligent. Here you are. Life is what it is. Now what? So we don't have to practice, first of all, at all, right? Just live our lives. How will we want to live our lives? There's no have to. But it's worth looking to see how well that strategy works for us. I'm proposing that, and I think most or maybe all of us know that or you wouldn't have even shown up here for even if it was just out of mild curiosity to check out, oh, I heard there was some meditation center in Redwood City. I'll go check it out. Even if that's all it is, at least you had a little spark of something that knows that if our happiness is dependent upon having to get certain experiences in life. In other words, having life look a certain way, whether it's the way our bodies are or our minds or how we feel or whatever. And if our happiness is dependent upon not having other experiences about how our bodies are or our minds or our world, it's not a problem as long as we get what we want and we don't get what we don't want. And the problem is living like that we're at the effect of circumstances. We all know we spend a lot of our lives at the effect of circumstances. It's part of sort of the package of life as a human being. The Buddha was teaching us, not just the Buddha, but many traditions teach that there's this idea of liberation that we keep getting back to is that in other words, the question is, can we find a way of being in the midst of this, of this thing we call life? You know, there's the John Kabat-Zinn book. I love the title called Full Catastrophe Living. This is the whole idea. It's a great title. In the midst of the full catastrophe. It doesn't mean it's all a catastrophe, you know, but this is you understand what he's saying. In the midst of it all, as it is, is there any hope of finding a way of being free in the midst of that? So the fact that we are intelligent and we find ourselves in a certain situation, what are we going to do? Are we just going to get up and go to work and try to get a better job and more money or a better relationship or a bigger house? Maybe we will keep doing those things, right? That's okay. That's only going to go so far for us. There is some happiness about that, right? A good job is better than a crummy job, right? More money is better than no money. No question about it. But there's also a deeper level of freedom. Not so dependent on all that. And when you start to get a taste of it, that taste of freedom is really, I mean it sounds like a cliche or a platitude, but it's sweeter than any of those experiences that we might cling to. It is. The freedom is sweeter than trying to get it from the experience. So rather than somebody sitting up in front telling you how it is, actually this came around nicely as a way to close. The invitation is to find for yourself, is that possible? Is that really true? Not that somebody said it or you heard it, but now in your own life is it possible. And to the extent we can notice when we're suffering, almost any time we're suffering I would propose there's some kind of grasping or clinging or aversion, really. So to the extent that we can be awake with it, and then after that to the extent that we can let go, we'll suffer less. And to the extent we can, we can't. We can just do what we can do. That's the great adventure of this Dharma practice. So anyway, we have to stop. So for those who, people who have been around know this, but for those who are new, it's traditional to end with a different kind of practice, which is called metta. It's M-E-T-T-A, metta, which is the polyword of means loving kindness. And we'll just take literally less than five minutes to end with that. The Buddha taught many kinds of practices of the sort that we were just talking about, what we call wisdom practices or liberation practices, coming to more wakefulness, insight practices, vipassana is what vipassana is. He also taught a whole other class or category of practices that fell into this category is called the Brahma viharas. The Brahma viharas, the Brahma is sort of the heavens or the, it's actually of the gods or divine. And the viharas is the dwelling place. So these practices are called the dwelling places of the gods or the divine abodes. Meaning that these are qualities that by developing them, it elevates us to the gods, it's kind of the image. And just like the Buddha emphasized these wisdom practices, he also really emphasized the importance of developing these qualities. And I'll just tell you what they are quickly. There's metta, which is loving kindness. Karuna, which is compassion. Mudita, you don't have to remember the Pali, but Mudita, sympathetic joy, which is actually finding happiness in the happiness of others, which is just so beautiful, that idea. And then the fourth is upekka, which is equanimity. And it's often taught that that's increasing levels of difficulty. So the first one we would work on is the metta, the loving kindness. It's also important to say with metta practice that when you do the practice, it doesn't matter whether or not you actually feel loving kindness when you do this. You may or you may not. It's a practice. We're developing these qualities. So we start where we're at. And oftentimes people, when they, not often, I shouldn't say that, but definitely sometimes people will do the metta. And actually there could be some anger or resentment that comes up as we start to dig in. So just to be aware that it starts with a lot of acceptance with whatever the experience actually is. And then it's just about the power of cultivating the mind over time and what is possible to develop. So we don't want to start judging ourselves, is what I'm getting at. So please find some posture to be comfortable for this practice. You don't have to sit in any fancy posture and you want to be as comfortable as you can. And just letting your awareness connect back in now, back into the body. Just notice whatever the experience is. Connecting into the heart, any emotional states, into the mind. Just to notice what we find and can we hold ourselves with a lot of acceptance just as we find ourselves, just as we find our experience. This is a practice of deep. It's a radical self-acceptance practice. And if you find that it's difficult to have that self-acceptance, then bring some compassion to that. And then from within that cocoon or surrounded by that blanket of self-acceptance, start to send some metta, loving kindness to yourself. And one of the ways that we often do it is by, there's just some traditional phrases that are very, very simple but powerful phrases that we can repeat silently to ourselves over and over. They can just help direct the mind. So I will say the just simple but powerful traditional phrases, you can use one or more of these or make up your own phrases. The traditional phrases are, may I be happy? May I be peaceful? May I be free from inner and outer harm? May I be free from suffering? May I be free from suffering? And just repeating one or more of those over and over. And in your own practice you could continue that as long as you wanted. But for now let's turn our attention now out to all the other people here in this room. And sending that same metta to everyone else here. Just as I wish to be happy, may everyone here be happy. And just as I wish to be free, may everyone here be free. And then finally, sending your awareness out beyond this room and out into the community, into the world. And radiating out this metta to all beings everywhere in all directions. Traditionally there's a long list of directions we send the metta. We send it to those beings near to us and far away. Those beings seen and unseen, known to us and unknown, born and yet to be born in all directions. The idea being that no beings are left out. Just as I wish to be happy, may all beings everywhere be happy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free from suffering. And then to end with this prayer is the words of the Buddha on loving kindness. Let none deceive another or despise any being in any state. Let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another. Even as a mother protects with her life her child, her only child, so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings. Good night.
