 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So this last talk on the week of Mindfulness of the Body focuses on release. And release is one of my favorite words for liberation or freedom because it has this idea of setting something free. It gets released. And it has this kind of dual thing where freedom maybe has the idea of you can go do whatever you want. And letting go has a little bit more kind of the weight of what's been let go of. But for me release is in between that where clearly something has become free, free of something. But there's also the feeling of this kind of opening up to just openness and a kind of freedom. And anyway, so we have release. And each step along the way of this week, we have these five different areas of mindfulness. We have the relaxation, recognition, respect, restoration, and now release. But each of the first four have within them something we're releasing. So relaxation maybe is the most obvious where we're releasing tension, holding, maybe stress. Something is letting go when we relax. And some people don't maybe focus so much on what's let go of, but rather the goodness, the nice feelings of the relaxation, the comfort of it. Then the recognition involves a kind of release as well, letting go as well. And that recognition is very simple. It's just recognizing just how things are in the moment without the complications of history, without the complications of projections into the future, without the complications of a complicated world and complications of me, myself, and mine. But just allowing something to be itself, allowing an itch to be an itch. Just recognize the itch. It can be hard to let go of all the reactivity to it, but that's the goal. It's just an itch and itch. A warmth, just a warmth. A twisting, just a twisting. A heat, just heat. When I was in Japan studying Zen, one of the teachings I got there was something like, when it's hot, just be hot. When the weather is hot and when it's cold, just be cold. So whether that's exactly why you should live your life, I'm not saying, but it's the idea that in the recognition, we're letting go of a lot of the complications. And just letting things be in their simplicity, their pristine simplicity of each moment. So there's a lot of letting go. The respect, we're letting go of disrespect. But disrespect here might mean having an agenda around things. Being in charge, bossing our life around like it has to be this way or that way. I have to get rid of this. I have to get this happen. It shouldn't be this experience. It should be some other way. But the respect is to just give permission for each thing to just be itself. And so the respect to see again. So there's a letting go that allows us to have this seeing again, just allowing ourselves to really be there in the simplicity of things. And then the restoration to allow things to restore. There has to be, we're letting go of again, ways in which we restrict ourselves, the ways in which we limit ourselves or hold back or resist ourselves or box things in or contain things. And there has to be space for things to restore. Like if you have too many plants growing in a flower bed, then the seedling that you want for it to grow will not grow in a healthy way. To allow it to grow well, you have to kind of make a clearing so it has some light that comes through. And then today it's release. And I think it's a profound topic and it's easy to talk about it simplistically or easy to talk about it as if it's an easy thing to do. But generally in almost any circumstance we find ourselves, there's something we can let go of, something we can release. Maybe not what we want to release, but maybe we let go of the wanting to release. Maybe that's where the beginning of freedom can happen. And then we practice relaxation, recognition, respect, maybe restoration, instead of letting go of what's difficult to let go of. And so one of the things we're releasing is the body from our ideas of the body. And the tremendous amount of suffering in our culture around ideas of body, body image. And to be body conscious, sometimes just to be frozen and caught up with how we're supposed to look, or how we don't look. And our societies around us support us in this kind of very painful way in which the body gets this kind of, this whole agenda, ideas of what it shouldn't be. And so it's one of the great gifts for our body to do something like meditation and let go of all the ideas we have about the body. Let it be itself. So the other day we did that exercise of mindfulness of the hand, where we're just feeling the sensations of the hand. And some people who do that exercise will see the difference between the ideas they have about their hand, and their fingers are too much this, or too much little that, their hand is too this, too that, their fingernails are just not quite right, or just all these things about the hand, that the mind has ideas about. And it can be kind of debilitating and preoccupying. But if we let go of all those ideas and just feel the hand for itself, the hand itself doesn't have a problem being whatever it is, it's just a hand. And to free the hand to feel itself without the burden of all these ideas. So to learn to release the body from the ideas we have on top of it. Part of the release of the body is to release the tension that's in the body. And generally, most tension that we feel in the body, tightness, and most stress we feel in the body, is a byproduct of tension and stress in the mind. And so the poor body has to kind of deal with all the stress and tension. And sometimes it becomes chronic and can be quite debilitating. And so to release the body from the hold of the mind, so that we again can allow the body to restore itself or heal itself even. And so to begin to appreciate how much we can release the body, let go, not of the body, but let go with the body. Let the body participate in this deep process of letting go of all this unnecessary and maybe pain-producing, suffering-producing activities that the mind does. And meditation is one of the great laboratories to discover how this works and how to discover greater and greater release and relaxation and depth. There was apparently a debate in Buddhism at some point down through the centuries whether enlightenment happens in the mind or happens in the body. And probably it's not a tremendously wise debate because it probably happens in both places simultaneously. But the fact that some people would really identify the body as a locus for liberation, I find quite inspiring. It's also inspiring they found it in the mind. Maybe wherever it's found, whatever the doorway into liberation is great. But many people don't consider that the body is kind of the location where freedom occurs. And maybe part of this debate arises because in the ancient teachings of the Buddha he emphasized repeatedly that there is no liberation without mindfulness of the body. And he has all these synonyms for liberation. And some of them are quite lofty like there is no attainment of the deathless without mindfulness of the body. There is no experience of the unconditioned without mindfulness of the body. That somehow this mindfulness of the body and navigating through it and discovering freedom through the body is such a huge part of this tradition. So I think as I began this week I want to end with the idea that maybe sometimes we should think of sati, usually translated as mindfulness, we should think of it as bodyfulness. And that how to live in a full body, the fullness of our body and take time to do that. When I teach retreats, I sometimes meditation retreats, I sometimes give the instructions to walk around, do the activities of the retreat at the speed of mindfulness. Because often we do the speed of the mind and you get caught in the mind, the activity of the mind. Some people kind of zip around kind of fast and do things quickly. But the speed by which we can stay present for our body, present in our experience, present for our bodyfulness. So to do things at the speed of bodyfulness, the speed of staying connected to your body, know what's happening in your body, don't get disconnected to your body. This is a great exercise. And you might, if you'd like, spend this weekend before, next week we're going to do mindfulness of emotions. And it turns out that the more you're mindful of your body, the easier it is to be mindful of emotions. So you might want to spend this weekend kind of reviewing, looking over or practicing bodyfulness, seeing what it's like whenever it's appropriate in your weekend to operate at the speed, operate at the speed of bodyfulness, mindfulness of the body. Thank you very much, and I'm looking forward to being back here on Monday.
