 So, good morning. We are settling in to the retreat now. I hope you're starting to feel more comfortable in your room, your jobs, this place. We'll continue on today with the cultivation of mindful awareness, settling further into this practice of insight, seeing within. Today we'll begin including any sensations that there are throughout the body. The breath, of course, is experienced in the body. But there are also many other bodily sensations that we can attend to. The body is a wonderful realm of practice, one reason being that it's always in the present moment. So when we're connected to some bodily sensation, we can be confident that that is happening here and now. The body has many sensations, it has varied sensations, it's a rich field for awareness. And we'll see in the guided meditation how the body is a support for clear and honest engagement with our experience, sincere engagement with our experience. Sometimes it can take time to really sense the body clearly. So however you can connect with it today is fine. It's not a matter of doing it right or wrong or whether you can do it enough. Or if you've worked with the body for a bit longer or if it feels very natural for you to be aware of the body, then you might come to see it as a whole world unto itself. So let's sit, settling into your meditation posture, if you haven't already. Closing the eyes, if that's comfortable for you. And feeling first the base where you're sitting. Or if you're lying down, what you're lying on. Sensing the stability of what is supporting you. Sometimes at the beginning of a meditation it's nice to just gently rock a little bit from side to side and forward and back just to find that center point where it takes the least amount of effort to be upright. Closing into whatever degree of ease is present in the body right now. So just allowing your awareness to encompass the general sense of the body sitting or lying down or standing. So we have this stable base that we're sitting on and then there's a sense that the body rises up from this base. Perhaps the way a sea plant rises off the sea floor, anchored from below and floating upward. We can have a sense of the arms at ease, the way the fronds of a plant float. That is simply placed above the shoulders, floating a bit. Can also be helpful at the beginning of a sit to just move the attention through the body in order to soften into the posture. So perhaps softening the muscles of the face, the muscles in the forehead, around the mouth, lengthening the jaw, letting the eyes be soft in the eye sockets, down through the throat into the shoulder area, softening the shoulders in a way that the shoulder blades can slide down the back. Down through the arms and the hands, into the chest area, sensing the front, the back, the sides of the rib cage, letting those muscles encircling the chest release, letting the belly be round and soft, the muscles of the low back, perhaps letting the belly drop down a little bit further into the abdomen, down softening the hips, sinking a little further into the base, down into the legs, releasing any bracing, softening the knees, down through the achilles, the ankle joints, all the way into the feet, just inviting ease. If there are parts that don't feel at ease or that couldn't easily be felt, that's fine. The body is fine as it is right now. So returning the attention to a whole body awareness, perhaps with a sense of being tranquil and alert. Bringing in with the quality of our awareness, inviting a receptive kind of attention, simple, receptive, even effortless awareness of the body, takes very little effort to receive a sensation. As we sit connected with the body in this way, you can notice the changing sensations due to breathing in and breathing out, just letting your attention rest with the sensations of breathing wherever you feel them most clearly, perhaps at the nose or the belly or the chest or the body as a whole. Just noticing where it's easy to feel the sensations of the breath. As you sit with awareness of the sensations of breathing from time to time, you will notice that your attention gets drawn to some other sensations arising in the body. You may notice an itch or pressure on your knee or warmth. And when some other sensation like this draws the attention, you can shift to awareness of that sensation, moving the attention from the breath to this other bodily sensation in a simple way. And then resting with that sensation as it arises or changes, feeling it in a very simple way. There's no need to change any of these sensations that we feel, like emphasizing them or trying to make them go away. You just let the sensations of the body be as they are. Sometimes, it can be helpful. To make a soft mental note that labels just what it is that you're feeling directly, such as tingling, pulsing, vibration, warmth, tightness, melting. Just these simple elemental experiences. The purpose of that is to be able to connect with the sensation. It's not important to get the exact right word. So we just go with the first one. And it's meant to be done very lightly and only if you find it useful for connecting to your experience. And as you rest with a bodily sensation, perhaps a sense of vibration. We might be saying vibration. Stay with it as long as it's predominant, as long as it naturally draws the attention, which might just be a few seconds or it might be longer. And when the sensation fades or goes away, then just naturally return the attention to the sensations of breathing. Just no particular sensation draws the attention, just continuing with the sensations of breathing. websites, links, auditing to the body, appearing right here. It's also quite normal that the mind will get drawn into thinking or some other involvement. When you notice that this has happened, you've actually already returned to the present moment in that noticing. So don't worry, this is natural. And you can just pick up again with the sensations of the breath, sensations of the body, continuing on in this way.................................................................................................................................................................................................
