So, we haven't figured it out already. 
I'm Diana Clark. 
I'm one of the co-teachers this morning, and Susie Keely, I'll be teaching with my friend, it's Susie. 
Susie will introduce herself, say, a little bit more about her background, but I'll say briefly that she's a student of Rob Berbeas, and a lot of the teaching that we'll be doing today is inspired by Rob and who just died just recently, kind of. 
So, I don't know, in some kind of way, Susie, you and I didn't talk about this, but I kind of want to, I don't know, the memory of his beautiful offerings support us, or may this benefit him in some way, and I don't know. 
I don't know what to say exactly. 
No, this topic and exploring our relationship to our emotional life, that was very important to him, something that he emphasized in this very deep Dharma context. 
So, yeah, it's beautiful. 
I'm sorry, who was it? What was the name that you mentioned? Rob Berbea, so he was a teacher at Gaia House, a very prolific teacher, and he has a book called Seeing the Freeze. 
So, yeah, that's who I trained with and studied with. 
Can you later on just put it in the chat, the name of the book and the name of the author, if you don't mind? Yeah, thank you. 
That's a great idea. 
It is. 
Put that in there. 
So, a little bit about what we're going to do today is it'll be a combination of some talks, short talks, we're not going to go on for hours and hours, some real practicing, you know, some guided meditation, we'll explore some ways to work with emotions and to just explore, investigate and be with emotions. 
And there'll be some small group discussions too. 
For those of you who have been to happy or know that it can be really powerful and meaningful to discuss your experience and to say, and to explore your own understanding and your own experience, interpretations, findings with others. 
So, it'll be a combination of these different elements and we'll try to have some, not try, we will have some generous breaks recognizing that, you know, spending hours and hours on Zoom is not anybody's idea of a fantastic time. 
So, this won't be, hopefully it's not an endurance test or a way to torture you or something like this. 
So, maybe we'll just take a minute to, again, I've said hello to most of you, not all of you, some of you that arrived a little bit later, I didn't. 
But I'm going to just say your name, I will say your name. 
And then, and I'm going to be going in alphabetical order. 
And just a chance for you to say your name and say where you're from, just to kind of help us all get our names here in the, in the, into the community here. 
And then Susie will have an opportunity to say a little bit more. 
But to begin with Abawali, I see you're not in your, in front of your camera right now. 
But so maybe this doesn't make sense for you. 
If you wanted to say your name and where you're from. 
Okay, maybe we'll come back. 
So Abraham, if you'd like to unmute yourself and please. 
Hi Abraham, hello Alto, happy to be here. 
And if I go off this picture, it's because my connection is weak. 
Thank you. 
Okay, great. 
Thank you, Abraham. 
Casey. 
Say, where is Casey? I've unmuted you. 
Can you hear me now? Yes. 
Oh, okay, cool, cool, cool. 
Okay. 
So I'm Casey. 
It's good to see all of you guys. 
And thank you Diana and Susie is the other teacher, right? Yes. 
Yeah, appreciate this. 
And I'm calling from Cupertino, California. 
I hope it's okay. 
I think there's some parts where I might have to kind of log off to take care of something. 
So hopefully it's not too big of a deal. 
No, no, there will be some breaks, as I said, and there'll be some natural places that you might feel like, Oh, this is a good time for me to go or something like that. 
So now we totally get it that we love lives in addition to being Dharma practitioners. 
Great. 
Thank you, Casey. 
Thanks. 
So now I kind of lost my place here. 
So, David.

I see. 
You can, you can just click on the little three dots in your frame and you can rename it. 
Okay, Akshay. 
Welcome. 
Okay, so warm welcome to everybody. 
And now I'll turn it over to Susie, who started us off on our journey this morning. 
Hello, everyone. 
Welcome. 
Yeah, I'm Susie Keely. 
I live in Los Angeles. 
I teach meditation and dharma here. 
I'm an artist. 
Yeah, that's me. 
And I'm going to offer to start us off kind of a broad sketch, a little bit of where we're going to be traveling, where we're going to be exploring and a little bit of about why or what can come to us from practicing with our emotions and bringing that into our meditative practice. 
I love teaching this topic and practicing with emotions has been a very central, rich part of my own practice. 
You know, everybody here has at least a passing interest in meditation, if not a strong devotion. 
So one thing that I think will be possible for everyone who engages with this practice of attending to our emotions and becoming sensitive to our emotions. 
It can really support and kind of deepen and elevate our capacities as meditators. 
And emotional life is such a, it's a subtle and broad and rich thing to notice, even, you know, noticing how our emotions show up in our body. 
It's true, they're not always subtle. 
Sometimes they kind of, you know, hit us like, like a Mac truck, but there's a wide range and how the emotional experience manifests. 
That can, an object like that can really help to develop our clarity and our, the, our capacity to be attentive and the stability of our mind. 
So that'll just generally be something that comes to us as meditators from this practice. 
Now our emotional experience is so close to us. 
It's so related to how we view our experience, how we are able to know and see and kind of receive it. 
It's, it's very much filtered through, through this part of, of who we are. 
That makes it a very powerful and kind of potent object of contemplation for us in terms of our insight practice. 
You know, we're looking at something that's very close to how we sense ourselves to be, you know, and the world people. 
This is, this is, this is how our emotional experience is always present informs our relationships, informs how we're able to relate to ourselves to other people. 
So what we can do in our practice is going to very directly impact how we can show up in our lives. 
So those are kind of some general thoughts about, you know, why practice this way. 
Something that, that came up for Diana and I very clearly and very early on is really having a sense that people will have different reasons for showing up today. 
There will be different things that we seek to discover or shift or transform in relationship to our emotions. 
You know, what, what we may want may be very different and what I may want today may be very different than what I'm going to need later in my practice, you know, based on circumstances. 
You know, what, what, what, what the time that we're living in the situations that we're finding ourselves in. 
So we're going to kind of open up some different directions and we're going to offer some different types of practices, taking kind of different approaches to serve that to serve that that diversity that that I'm sure is here. 
If I think of a few possibilities in terms of what one might seek from practicing with emotions. 
A few things come to mind. 
One is more skill, more capacity, more ability to navigate challenging emotional states. 
That is certainly something that is on offer when we engage with our emotional experience within our meditative practice, more, more equanimity, more distance, more clarity. 
So we will definitely be exploring practices that support that. 
I came to Dharma practice, because it was clear to me that that something needed to shift in the way that I related to my own emotional experience. 
It felt to me I was very much kind of ruled by it, you know, it's that was something that I didn't have a lot of skill and freedom with. 
So I'm grateful, grateful for that for bringing me to the Dharma. 
And certainly I found a lot was possible in terms of transformation, much more than I would have suspected. 
So that might be one reason is wanting to have more skill. 
A second possible intention, let's say for practicing with one's emotions might be to actually become closer to them, to become more intimate with them, to have more clarity for ourselves about what is showing up in my emotional experience now, to kind of have at our fingertips a sense of how I'm feeling. 
It's it's pretty common in our culture to kind of live above the neck, you know, to find ourselves, maybe mostly identified or often identified with the thinking mind, the mind is worrying and not so comfortable just hanging out with our emotional experience. 
So practice can kind of open up in that direction to when we're working with our emotions, gaining sensitivity, gaining a clarity, sort of having a more fluency with my emotional experience, having a sense of how emotions manifest for me in particular, and what's kind of my emotional map. 
When we have that really serves us as meditators, there's a close relationship between kind of knowing where we're at on this subtle level, how we sense it in the body, and what we're able to sense in terms of things like, you know, subtle clinging and grasping a version. 
There's a real closeness there. 
And then as people, it's like if I know how I feel in the moment, even in challenging situations, that's some very good information to have can help me kind of take a step back before needing to act or have a little more wisdom, a little more space. 
So that's, that's something, another possible direction to cultivate. 
The third one that I'll just throw out, and this is not an exhaustive list, but a third one would be something like having more confidence with our emotional experience. 
That's kind of one way to phrase it. 
I might phrase it's also something like being in alignment with our emotional experience, or finding a way to free it, you know, to know it, to enjoy it, to be nourished by this very human capacity we have to connect to our experience and other people through our emotional life. 
So I think that's something else that comes from intentionally hanging out with our emotional experience, and developing some capacity to befriend it, all of that will offer some practices that present a couple of different options for how we might relate to our emotional experience in ways that might support this kind of this confidence, this ability to be nourished by and in alignment with our emotional experience. 
Maybe one thing that I'll just open up now in relationship to this idea of confidence, or relationship to having our emotional experience support us and nourish us and open up fully in a beautiful way. 
There will be something about also bringing in an energy of questioning into this space today, the possibility of bringing that energy into our practice. 
So we'll be talking a lot about meditative practice and we'll be spending time doing guided practices, and that will kind of give us some information from one direction, you know, really knowing what is happening, having clarity there. 
So we need to go a long way in sort of setting aside limiting habits of our minds limiting habits that kind of lock us in to certain patterns and opening things up. 
It's also very possible to kind of look at what limiting beliefs or assumptions might I think be kind of taking on from outside of myself. 
Not so much in a with the intention to kind of like figure out what my deal is or what the problem is with X or Y, but more to begin to make space, you know, this questioning can support us in noticing where we're blocked. 
And that noticing and questioning, then kind of freeze up what is more this kind of organic intuitive process of accumulating more wisdom cultivating wisdom. 
And so, so just in the context of emotions, some of the areas we could look and we could question or we could think about would be things like certainly our family of origin, you know, where we came from. 
How did the people who raised us regard certain emotions on one end or another of the emotional spectrum, you know what was okay, what was permissible, what was not. 
There may be sort of ways that our emotional life is kind of impinged or not able to to have as much freedom. 
Our culture, you know, or the many cultures we may find ourselves within may have something to say about what's okay in terms of our how we manifest emotionally what's okay to feel. 
What's okay. 
Is there a certain kind of range of emotions that is acceptable or desirable for a woman to have or someone who identifies as female, someone who identifies as male, maybe has other kind of constraints. 
There may be other messages that we carry. 
You know, the culture, so many different ways. 
It's not just how we limit ourselves. 
It's also how maybe we are afraid to be seen due to, you know, how we know other people are viewing us. 
You know, there's a lot that comes in. 
In our spiritual community, our spiritual context to the Buddha, you know, I'm practicing and teaching within the Buddhist tradition. 
Many of you likely are practicing within that too. 
In different traditions and different communities, whether it's implicit or explicit, there's often a kind of sense of like what's the emotional appearance of a spiritual practitioner. 
Like how does that look, how might we act, even how might we speak, you know. 
So are there some ideas hanging around there that may be limiting to us? What does an awakened person look like and what range of emotions can they feel. 
So just bringing in these questions, you know, can help kind of open things up. 
I noticed for myself and just doing this kind of thinking that I kind of had a, I was judging my own practice based on the emotions that I experienced in a way. 
Like feeling like, okay, if they're not lining up with my idea exactly of how this is going to go, am I really moving in the direction of freedom? This is a very different, for holding up an idea of how things are supposed to be versus really practicing with the intention to bring more openness and freedom and ease. 
You know, those are two different things and the one that kind of holding onto the idea is not so helpful. 
Yeah, I think that's enough for me for now. 
I just have one note. 
What about anger? What about anger? You know, how does that fit in? What about passion? What about commitment? You know, those kinds of things in looking in these, this context of what's okay in the communities we practice. 
Yeah, I think that's all, that's what I, what I'd like to share for now. 
And Diana is going to introduce, move us into a time to share together and discuss together in small groups. 
Thank you, Susie. 
Yeah, so I appreciate this very much, this whole investigation. 
What do we want from our emotional life? Do we want some familiarity with it just to know what we're feeling? Or maybe we want to have some confidence in our, that we can work with and deal with whatever arises. 
Think how your life might unfold if there weren't any emotions that felt like we're difficult or taboo or something like this. 
Or maybe we want to be able to just simply feel untangled or not so, not in knots with our emotions. 
We want to be able to feel like we have a toolkit in which if we do find ourselves, we can untangle them. 
Susie, are there some other things that people might consider if they're thinking about what they might want from their emotional life? I mean, I think that's pretty good. 
It's the kind of a little bit more mastery, a little bit more stability on one hand or a little bit more intimacy, you know, a little stronger relationship with our emotions. 
Those are kind of two different, yeah. 
And you mentioned the idea of the confidence. 
Great, great. 
I like these words mastery, intimacy, and maybe just confidence. 
So we're going to break you up into small groups. 
And this is an opportunity for you to explore and share. 
You don't have to say your deep dark secrets. 
And this isn't so much about storytelling, as it is about an opportunity for you to, we're just kind of creating a framework in which you can have these discussions for yourself. 
So it's more for your benefit. 
To do these as small groups, it's not so much about giving advice to one another. 
It's not so much about one person doing a monologue for a long time or anything like that. 
It's more just an opportunity for you to explore for yourself. 
What relationship would you like to have with your emotional life? What do you want from your emotions? All of us have our own way that we are with us. 
And maybe it's a mixture. 
Maybe it's very clear. 
Maybe it's not clear, whatever it might be. 
So you'll be in groups of three or four. 
And the person whose screen name starts closest to the beginning of the alphabet. 
So we'll go alphabetical order by screen name. 
Don't worry. 
We'll mix it up. 
We'll use different things for these small groups. 
So if your name starts with an A, you won't always be first. 
And then, as I said, it's not just a long monologue, but maybe just share a little bit and then you hear from the second person, the third person, the fourth person. 
Then when it comes back around to you, maybe you've been reminded of something and you have something new to say. 
There'll be a little countdown timer. 
So you can see how many minutes are remaining. 
And then there'll be 30 seconds before you, whether you like it or not, you get kicked back here to the main room. 
And lastly, I'll say there was a chat question about the schedule for the day. 
I'll put something in the chat box for when you come back so you can see when our planned breaks are so that you can maybe join us at particular times. 
Okay, so have fun. 
Hi. 
Hi, Wendy. 
Hi, Diana. 
We just went into small groups, and we're talking about what we would like from our emotional life. 
So you heard that. 
Okay, I'll put you into a room. 
Okay, thank you. 
Hello. 
I think we're all back here. 
Suzy, if you want to kick us off. 
Sure. 
Hi, everybody. 
We're just going to take a few minutes. 
Diana and I would be really happy to hear from anyone. 
Probably we're just going to take a couple few people in the interest of time but who would like to share something about that experience or share something that came, you know, alive for you was interesting to you that came out of that process. 
And I will look at the screen for people who raise their hands but also if you know how to use the raise hand function in zoom it's really helpful when there's more than one screen for people so if just so you know if you don't already if you mouse over the zoom window and you'll see at the bottom there's a participants button if you click on it a window opens on the right. 
The options you will have you should see is raise hand. 
No, I see name. 
I see names. 
You see names. 
Okay. 
At the bottom kumi below all the names. 
Oh yeah. 
Raise hand. 
I see it now. 
Now that you're unmuted kumi, why don't you just go for it. 
Oh, okay. 
So I wanted to know what the difference between feeling and emotion. 
I'm going to unmute. 
I mean, you are unmuted. 
No, I'm going to mute. 
I see. 
Susie, do you want to unpack that? I think it's a great question. 
Yeah. 
Sure. 
So part of it is just it's it's almost like they can be the same thing depending on how you're using the language. 
I'm I'll just kind of say from a meditative context and a Buddhist context kind of the way I tend to use the words and I hear them use most often feelings within the text you know within like the let's say the Satipa Tama Sutta. 
You know, feeling is pointing most closely to something called Vedana. 
So, you know, how we sense how we kind of know an experience to be pleasant unpleasant neutral emotions. 
The like the concept of emotions, you can't exactly find it within the Satipa Tama Sutta in the way that we as Western people, or modern people tend to use it has a little just kind of broader. 
It's almost like a psychological context a little bit. 
There in the Buddhist teachings, there's this idea of Vedana and then there's also this idea of the state of the mind, but this emotion, you know, for me, it's sort of a, it's a way to kind of bridge how we relate to our own inner experience and a way that we can practice with it. 
I don't know if that's helpful or if you have something you want to add Diana. 
I think that this is such a great question and the fact that there is a question is not worthy. 
It's not so clear. 
That is kind of what we're going to be talking about today, how feeling that is like kind of, you know, the felt sense and emotion that we use sometimes we use the same word. 
And sometimes we also use Oh, that feels bad. 
It feels good. 
I think that's exactly what we're going to be kind of working with today is maybe right there in some of that confusion of why there's this conflation of feeling and emotion. 
Thank you for me. 
That was a good question. 
Anyone else who has something maybe to bring from the what was touched on in the breakout group or Diana. 
Yes, I just want to talk to you just one minute later. 
Okay. 
Yeah, before the break. 
Yeah, or after the break or before. 
Yeah. 
Before during adapter. 
Susie, before we forget and because community brought up the break, can you put in the chat box or schedule for today. 
So people know. 
And for those of you don't know at the bottom of your screen, if you're on a computer, there might be like a number of little one that just showed up in the chat box. 
And so if you need to leave, or be wanted or went to join us, or how long the breaks are something like that. 
It's there in the chat box. 
And then Abraham, do you have a comment. 
Thanks. 
I just wanted to say that in our breakout group I was just so moved at how people shared openly above their emotional lives. 
The challenges already a nice sense of intimacy and I really appreciated it. 
Thank you Abraham. 
Yeah, make a big difference in the way our gatherings go if there is that sense of intimacy. 
I see Jenny. 
Hello. 
So in the group I was, I was sharing an experience of crying. 
And I was saying how internally it feels like a, the way I described it was like a kaleidoscopic fountain like it. 
And then when I cry, when it comes out, it's like, and it like doesn't express itself the way that it feels internally. 
And then it's confusing for the person that I'm, because I was crying yesterday with somebody and I think it's confusing for the person that I'm with. 
So just, I was just, I mean, it's not a specific question or anything. 
I'm just kind of contemplating like how do I deal with that internal feeling and then the way it expresses it itself externally. 
And then also, you know, I was thinking, well, I can just cry by myself, but like crying doesn't happen as easily by myself as it does with people. 
And so then that adds a whole other like complicated thing of like, it helps me to be with other people to process, but then it's really hard for them and for me because I don't know how to navigate that like relationship. 
So yeah, I just wanted to share that experience. 
Thank you, Jen. 
Yeah, somehow sometimes our internal experience doesn't match what how other people are interpreting what's happening for us. 
And how it's being expressed. 
Thank you, Jen. 
So maybe we'll go into a guide meditation. 
Kathleen, I see that your hand is up, but maybe we'll come back at the break or maybe after guide or before the break or maybe after the guided, you won't have a question anymore. 
We'll see. 
So, let's take, I'll just say a few words. 
You know what, I'm going to stop the recording here and start a new one. 
So the question was, will this be an audio Dharma? Yes, it will be no video, no video, but as some audio. 
So if you miss something, you want to come back, you'll be able to find it.
