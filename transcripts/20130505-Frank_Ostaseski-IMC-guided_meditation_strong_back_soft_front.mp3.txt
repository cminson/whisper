I was teaching just not long ago with my good friend, Joan Halifax, who runs a place called the Upaya Center in New Mexico. 
And we were teaching about compassionate care of the dying. 
And she offered a very beautiful instruction that I want to share with you. 
To meet the difficulty of our life, and also sometimes to meet the expansiveness of our life, it seems we need two things. 
First, we need a strong back. 
It's not easy, really, to be in this world. 
So we need a strong back. 
We need a capacity to stay present for what is difficult, and to stay present for that which is difficult with equanimity. 
But that won't be enough, that strength. 
We also need a soft front. 
Strong back, soft front. 
And to be receptive and responsive, compassionate, loving. 
And we usually have it the other way around. 
We have a very protected shell around our chests and hearts, trying to keep the difficulty of the world out, and we sometimes collapse in our backs under the weight of things. 
So this morning I wanted us to practice with a strong back, soft front. 
It enabled us to really meet the beauty and difficulty of our lives. 
So I'll just guide you for a first few minutes, and then we'll come into the silent practice. 
However you're accustomed to sitting with your eyes open or closed. 
Then let's not be in a rush to meditate. 
Let's take our time. 
And it's very gradually, very gradually, coming into the body. 
Suzuki Roshi used to say, the posture is the meditation. 
Often when we even use the word posture, we start doing. 
We start trying to make it happen. 
So I'd like to encourage us to relax first. 
And we'll see that our awareness happens all by itself without too much effort. 
Or maybe first drawing your attention to something really simple like listening. 
You can hear the sound of my voice. 
You don't have to work hard at that. 
And as you attend to that sense door, the sense of listening, hear the other sounds in the room, maybe the sounds outside the building. 
It's coming up, aren't they, and showing themselves and changing or fading away. 
Now let your attention become just a little more subtle. 
Not pushing, just noticing. 
And maybe you might become aware of the silence that's also here. 
The sounds rise up out of the silence, they're known, and then they return to the silence. 
The silence itself is really undisturbed. 
Let yourself just come to rest in that silence for a moment. 
And see what qualities you notice about it. 
Is it open, receptive? Does it have any edges, boundaries? And in that same openness, just as sounds emerge and are known, all the sensations of the body also arise and are known. 
First the large gross sensations, feeling of your feet against the floor, your body against the chair or cushion. 
And then again, attending a little more subtly, you begin to sense the experiences that seem internal to the body. 
Your heart beating, maybe tingling or pulsing. 
Again, not working so hard, it is natural awareness, recognizing this activity. 
And again in that openness, you become aware of the breath. 
Not the thought of the breath, but the direct experience. 
Various sensations of the inhale and those of the exhale. 
And see what shows itself in the gap at the end of the exhale. 
And some of you may be very accustomed to watching the breath or sensing the breath at a particular location. 
The way it dances there at the tip of the nostrils or in the rising and expanding of the ribs. 
Or perhaps at the diaphragm. 
Or for some of us, we feel the whole body breathing, arms and legs breathing. 
Aliveness of the whole body. 
And you can just check briefly to see what's the quality of your mind and heart right now. 
What's the relationship to what's occurring? What's the attitude in your mind? Calm, quiet, agitated, bored. 
Nothing's left out. 
And now I want to just draw your attention to the back, the full length of your spine. 
And again, not trying to make anything happen there. 
Just noticing the spine, how it holds you up. 
The skin and muscles are kind of draped over the bones. 
And just feel the support of your back. 
Strong back, stable, supportive, balanced. 
And you can feel that capacity to meet anything really almost physically in your back. 
Strong back. 
And because we have that support, because we have that balance and that stability, we can open. 
And so we have soft front. 
And you can feel the front side of your body. 
And its capacity to open and receive. 
Receptivity is really a facet of love. 
It doesn't exclude anything. 
Nothing left out. 
A sort of vulnerability, transparency, open, receptive, caring. 
Strong back, soft front. 
Strong back, soft front. 
It's hard to open without that support. 
Without the openness, we just become rigid. 
So we need both. 
Strong back, soft front. 
Strong back. 
Strong back. 
Strong back. 
Strong back. 
Strong back. 
Strong back. 
Strong back. 
Now if you should find yourself doing something, just relax. 
Trust the awareness. 
Strong back. 
Equanimity, support, stability. 
Naturally arising. 
Soft front. 
Open, receptive, caring. 
Naturally arising. 
Soft front. 
Open, receptive, caring.
