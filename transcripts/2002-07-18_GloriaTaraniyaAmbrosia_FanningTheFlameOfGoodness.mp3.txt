 We've been focusing for these few weeks on really opening to and recognizing and opening to our own karma, looking at this whole issue of karma, both as it relates, a little bit as it relates to action, you know, where what we do brings results, but also the what's really looked at as the results of past actions, which is kind of the stuff that comes up in the mind all the time. The things that are the patterns and habits that we operate out of the way that we are really, you know, the dominant states of mind, dominant reactive patterns, even to a great extent, our physical appearance, the way that we carry ourselves, all of that is according to the Buddhist teaching sort of an outcome, a fruit of past actions. So I didn't want to just deal, but what happens with this theme is that, you know, usually what happens is people start to look at all of the things that they don't like about themselves. You know, we always think of karma in terms of bad karma, you know, unwholesome karma, the unskillful behaviors that are so highly conditioned in us. And that's important. I mean, I don't want to make too light of it because it's important to see that and to work with that. And a lot of meditation practice is just that. It's seeing this constant outpouring of past actions. You know, literally it could be the busyness of the day, the lack, the heedlessness throughout the day. And then you go and sit and it, you know, it's like a truck that's come crashing to a stop, you know, and all the things that are on the back of the truck just come pouring out into your lap, you know? And so that's what you sit with in your meditation practice. But it's very important also to look at the good and the wholesome and the skillful. And I think this can get missed mostly, really mostly because we're so hard on ourselves, you know, we're just, whether we like it or not, we tend to be very self-critical and can even have a great deal of self-loathing. Don't like the way that we are. So it's how you're going to soften around all of that, how you're going to open your heart and get a little soft and cushy, because that's what it takes really to be able to receive, to be able to open to our experience completely. So I wanted to invite us tonight to kind of look at this side of practice, which is really contemplating our goodness and fanning the flame of our goodness even. You know, in the same way that one tunes into difficulty, we also have to tune into those moments when we're very happy, when things are going well, when things feel good. And so that, because that's very much a part of the conditioning as well. It's like, if it feels right, and we're not paying attention to that, then we're not learning from it. It's like the heart needs to learn to incline towards wholesome and skillful actions. That's part of it. It's not just receding away from doing harm. It's also a movement towards what it is that is skillful and appropriate. Can you feel that? It's very, very important, and very much a part of our meditation practice. So, you know, just to override any tendencies is you might have to think that this is like conceited or self-absorbed or something like that. Like, I'm going to look at my kindnesses. That it's a very good and helpful thing to do. So, one might say, well, yeah, I do this meditation practice and I'm trying to be good, but I'm not always able to be that way. Or we might have the sense that we come to this meditation practice and one wants to feel good about the fact that you have enough wisdom to know to do this. That's huge right there. That you have enough wisdom and staying power to come, you know, to spend your Thursday night like this instead of some other way, basically saying, I want to wake up, and this seems to be something that's going to help me to wake up. So, you know, you might look at that and think, well, yeah, but, you know, I do a lot of other things that aren't very skillful. And so the effort is to just kind of recognize that there's a whole mixed mesh of reasons that one might come to this practice and come to events like this, but to really acknowledge that within that mix, because it's always a mix, within that mix, there is a lot of wisdom and there is a lot of goodness already. And start there and begin by fanning the flame of that. And the reason that I point this out, as I said, is that I think there's just so many, so much strong conditioning to berate ourselves, you know, and we want to begin a process or at least add to a process of turning this kind of thing around. It's just not helpful. It's just not useful. Have you ever really changed for the better by beating up on yourself, you know? So trying to break that habit just a little bit. So one thing, just to reflect, and I was noticing this the other morning as I was putting some thoughts together, that when I woke up, there was, the first feeling that I had that morning was kind of like a heaviness, kind of like a thought. I don't know if you ever greet the day like that. It was like, you know, you wake up, and I was like, oh, you know, I have this to do and that to do and this place to go, or you think about something that happened, and you can wake up with this sort of heavy, dreaded, dreading energy. And just as I lay there, then I heard a bird singing, and my heart just turned and my attention went to that bird, and the singing created this lightness, this kind of happy feeling in the heart. And I had the wherewithal actually to just notice that. Well, wow, did you see that? That notice how quickly it can change, that was one thing that was interesting. But the important thing, the thing that impressed me was what a different feeling there was in my being, from to, ah, you know, amazing transition, amazing openness and receptivity, just from focusing for an instant on gladness. This is very, very important. This is a very, very important quality to have, to tune into. Buddha talked a lot about the significance of joy and happiness and practice. And, you know, I think we need to really tune in to those moments when it's actually there, when it actually arises of its own accord, and let that make a mental impression in the heart, in the mind. This is what that experience feels like. So that this process of beginning to move towards it can take place. Can you feel that? It's like it's all part of learning. It's a, you know, waking up is self-taught, you know. It comes out of experiencing the pain of harm, and experiencing the happiness and the lightness of harmlessness and kindness and goodness. And then the heart, we move towards that. We actually gravitate towards that. So can you feel it? Both of these are very, very important. So it's like this. We turn the minds to the wholesome and the happy. One of the suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya, in one of the Buddha says, whatever a person frequently thinks upon and ponders upon, that becomes the inclination of the mind. And that's what we're talking about. How is the mind inclining? So one way that I like to talk about this is, most of you are familiar with the five precepts, where we take certain precepts for, just to kind of guidelines for our conduct, for our behavior. And these are phrased in a way that says, you know, I resolve to refrain from taking the life of any living creature. I resolve to refrain from taking things that don't belong to me. I resolve to refrain from sexual misconduct. I resolve to refrain from incorrect speech on kind, or hateful or frivolous speech. I resolve to refrain from intoxicants that lead to carelessness. And this is very important. It's part of the, you know, in a way it's like a framework for living, that we not only contemplate, but that Buddhists actually commit themselves to, you know, living in this way. And I think it's very important. But I wanted to look, I like to look at this in terms of the flip side of that. So there's this sort of, I resolve to refrain kind of language, but there is a flip side of that, which means that I was, you know, I am interested in, I wish to cultivate the positive aspect of what it is that I'm also, with that I'm also wishing to refrain from. So that the way that this would play out with each of these is really worth contemplating. Like the first precept, which says resolving to refrain from doing harm through body, speech, or mind. So what does that look like in terms of cultivation? You know, the effort here is to cultivate, to actively nourish, nurture moments and opportunities for a certain harmlessness. You know, to notice that, and especially to notice those times when we're already being harmless. I think this is very, very important in our meditation practice. So that, you know, you might notice that inclination, for example, to do harm in some way, you know, through body, speech, or mind, and then have the wherewithal to abort that. That moment right there is very, very important, where you tune in to a fact that something made us change our mind. Something made us turn from an impulse to behave unkindly and turn it around, and to at least cut that off, if not actually turn it completely in another direction. These, we do, we have this happen a lot throughout the course of the day. And the effort here then is to just to begin to tune in to moments like this. Or just moments where there is a very harmless, loving quality in the heart. You know, one time when I was up at the Barry Center for Buddhist Studies, where I also teach, there's a lot of deer around there, and a lot of chipmunks. And we were all in class one day, and somebody was standing up because her legs hurt, and while she was standing, she noticed that there were a couple of deer in the field. And everybody just jumped up out of the seats and went over, you know, and we're like, oh, you know, hi, little deer, you know. And just kind of pouring out this beautiful, loving sentiment towards these wild animals that we encountered, you know. And I thought, oh, that is beautiful. I mean, just to hold moments like that, where, you know, they're timid, they're scared, they're frightened, and one is wishing them well. One is, you know, ensuring that there'll be no harm done here. You know, and you see this especially, like with the chipmunks, who have to be the most nervous creatures on the face of the planet, they're just all over the place. And if you try to do walking meditation there, and, you know, the chipmunks are a major distraction, but you can watch, like even in the process of doing the walking meditation, how, you know, when I see them, I would watch myself go, like something like, oh, you know, oh, be careful, okay, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you, I'm not gonna hurt you, you know. You're in safe here, you know, you're in a very comfortable territory, and wish that, that, you know, that there was some way that one could ease their attention, you know, ease their anxiety. But these are the kinds of moments I'm talking about, just noticing those, letting yourself see that that came from me. You know, that harmlessness, that kindness, that came from me. I have to see that, feel that. Now that can be a lot easier to do with animals than with humans, you know, put humans into the picture, and get a whole nother story going on here. But I found that, while it's often true, that when I have an impulse to think ill of somebody, to do harm in any way, it's not always as easy to offset that, you know, there's a lot more going on in human interactions. But what I began to notice as I would look at this, is just to try to get a sense of when there is difficulty in relationship, why am I even seeing it that way? You know, what is the rub? You know, and the rub I began to see is coming from a place that sort of knows, already knows in my heart, that this isn't necessary, that we can get along better, that we can learn to relate to each other from kindness. And that, even if I can't always do it, the fact that I can understand that, and the fact that it is my wish that goodness or kindness be the standard in my relationships, that's good enough. You know, if we can at least capture that impulse, that's good enough. Let's see that in our own hearts. So that's the, just looking a little bit at the flip side of the first precept. The second one has to do with resolving to refrain from taking things that don't belong to us. So, you know, obviously it's pointing at sort of, piggy and self-absorbed behaviors, you know, greedy, always looking for one's own gratification. You know, that it's an effort to notice that impulse in the heart and the mind, and you just feel what that feels like. It doesn't feel very good. And gradually over time, we begin to soften by noticing this contraction around having things and getting things. But now the flip side of this is sort of cultivating or noticing when there is a contentment, when things as they are are fine, it's good enough, you know. And that will happen a lot throughout the course of the day. You know, if you can notice it, then that automatically begins to fan the flame of it. One way that we see this a lot is like I mentioned the retreat on Saturday. People experience this a lot on retreat where you go away for a few days, a day, a few days, a week. And amazingly, you know, you find out that you can do with a lot less than you think you have to have, you know. One time my teacher, you know, invited us to contemplate, what does it take to be a human being, you know? What does it actually take, you know? It doesn't take much. Buddha talked about the requisites, the four requisites, food, clothing, shelter, and medicine, you know, and invited us to contemplate that. And so when you go on retreat or go away and live in a more simple environment, you know, one of the common experiences that people will report on is that they, they were so, it was so easy just to do, to survive, to get along with so little. They really created a happiness in their heart. I remember one woman at the end of her retreat saying that, you know, she just, she didn't know this about herself. She thought she needed all this stuff, you know, and to find out that she didn't, that was a great, that was news to her. And it was a, it was really, it made a very big impression. You know, like the wrong thing to do would be to go out and then start trying to get rid of things, you know, out of some idea of living more simply or trying to be more contented. That's not what I'm pointing to. It's more just noticing moments when it's okay. It's good enough, you know, you're petting the dog or sitting and having a glass of iced tea on the patio. And there's not a lot of movement in the mind towards something other, something else. You know, like there's always, there's always other, but there will be moments when that's not happening. And so the effort here is to really tune into that, begin to become aware that sometimes we, we actually are experiencing contentment and simplicity, you know, it's good enough. And this kind of noticing makes these impulses to be piggy and greedy and always gratifying self diminish. Can you feel that? Because that's a, you begin to experience more consciously and more directly what it feels like to just be simple and content. And that's one of the best teachers that we have. So we can incline towards it. So by noticing these times when the heart doesn't contract, you know, when it lets go, we're actually teaching our heart through direct experience. What is the more desirable state? Yeah. Waking up is, like I said, it's self-taught. It's all in the noticing. It's all in the bringing moments like these conscious. The third precept has to do with sexual misconduct, which is really not engaging in activities that are due harm to oneself or to another person or to a third person. That's the general way that it's translated. But I like to look, take a much broader brushstroke on this, especially when we look at it in this way of cultivating. Basically, to cultivate relationships, all relationships in our lives that are founded on mutual respect. That there isn't this sense of what's in it, what can you do for me? Mutual gratification. That always looking to each other for some kind of, just kind of either a moment of gratification or sort of an ongoing thing. I know when I started to look at this precept myself in my own practice, I began to realize that I wasn't, I was hard pressed to think of how many of the relationships in my life at that time were, just didn't have some sense of this. It was sort of like that thing that you do that makes me feel good, keep doing it. That kind of feeling. Like there's something in this relationship that makes me feel good. And that's really what it's about. I went, wow. Really taking a hard look at that and trying to override that or find another basis for relating to people. Recently I had the opportunity to interview a number of monks and there was a number of us and we were asking them questions about their life and what it is about their life that is so conducive and so helpful. And one of the things that came up obviously was celibacy. And so we were asking one of these senior monks about his experience living a celibate life for, at this time it was like 30 years. He said, well, at the beginning it was very easy. And then it became very hard. And then it became easy again. But that took a long number of years. And the main thing that he noticed was that when the energy, this sort of sexual energy, which is really put in a broader context, this self gratifying energy was, when his relationships with people was not focused on what was in it for him or what way that he could become gratified through the relationship, then what he found was what began to replace it was what Buddha called the beautiful states, the heavenly abodes, that when it wasn't me and what's in it for me, it became you. Compassion and how can I serve you? And what can I do for you? And how can I be kind to you? It began to, clearly he noticed it was like the computer screen shifted, where the background became foreground and the foreground became background. And he said he actually began to feel the energy shifting from sort of a bodily focus, gratifying the body focus to a heart focus. Even in his abdomen, it would move up. The energy was completely coming from a different place. So just noticing what that felt like in terms of relating to people versus this other more self-absorbed perspective. I liked that. When I talk to the monks and nuns or examine or observe, learn from their lifestyle, I mean, there's a lot of things in their lifestyle that I'm not gonna adopt. We're householders, we're laypeople, we're not going to live the celibate life perhaps, but there was something in this sans the celibacy that was very, very important. How can I relate to people in a way that is not so self-absorbed, so body-based? So the fourth one has to do with resolving to speak the truth, to speak honestly, and making the effort to refrain from speech that is not honest, that is harmful or malicious. And this is a big one for most people. A lot of people have said they've practiced this in their lives, even if they just take it for a short period of time. It's very revealing. It's how much of our speech is filled with just sort of jabs and digs or it's just frivolous and totally unnecessary. Or it's out and out, not true, out and out dishonest. So the effort here, I think, looking at the flip side of that is to pick up those hesitations again where we don't do that. And you can notice these many times throughout the day. I might start a sentence one way, literally, and notice it's like a railroad track getting shifted so that the train can go in another direction. And it's like the impulse is up. Speech is actually beginning to come out of my mouth and something shifts. And it's about to be something harmful or useless. And it will just shift. It will just begin to write itself. And I've noticed that that's happening just as a result of tuning in to what it feels like to speak well. Certainly, I've seen in my own mind incredible tendency. Basically from family dynamics and what have you, just always jabbing each other. Always saying something critical or just these subtle little jabs. They come out all the time. And what does it feel like to not do that? What does it feel like? And getting it from the experience of that. It's huge. So I also look at this as sort of beginning to speak the truth about what I see in myself. That kind of dovetails on what I was just saying. Where, you know, what are the mind states that I see arise in me? Which ones are dominant? Good and bad. But definitely tuning in to the ones that are less than desirable. And finding a way in my own heart to be honest about that. And I've found that by doing that, that kind of honesty is actually the energy of cultivating an impartiality and an equanimity. An openness that allows for all of what's going on. Good and bad. That's honest. And the energy of that is fabulous. It's like from that place, then one ceases to take exception to what is. Over time, you gradually stop that impulse to always be wanting something to be some other way. Even when it comes down to me, my own karma, my own patterns and habits of speech and action. Can I find a way to be okay with that? That has to be at the basis of any kind of change that's gonna happen through this kind of practice. Can you feel that? It's like if we're hating it, even if we hate it just a little bit, if we're resisting it or not being honest about what we're seeing, that's the one thing that will guarantee that it'll be back. That we'll keep behaving that way. So just noticing this kind of critical honesty about ourselves in a positive way. Noticing the good too. And noticing that it's not always difficult. It's not always bad. It's like this hot, this cold. There's an inhale, there's an exhale. You know, it's like this one whole aspect of ourselves we push out. Can we let that in and can that be okay? This is honest, accepting, receiving speech. And I think you'll find that there's just, what gets cultivated over time is like a natural ease. So I'm not less and less surprised by what I see in myself certainly, but in other people too. It's fine. We're not awake. We're doing the best we can. And can we find some peace around the things that we see? And this last one has to do with refraining from indulging or overindulging in toxicants or drugs or difficulty. Things that cause us to be heedless or not to be able to attend to what's going on. And the broad brush stroke on this one is really to, I think to tune in more to any kind of behavior. And I put solidly in this precept, compulsive behaviors, where we just get locked into a compulsive pattern of behavior and can't seem to snap out of it. You know, so that the behaviors like this, you're not, we're not really greeting each moment new, greeting each moment fresh. But also to look at things like, you know, computer games or television or things like this, where when we are caught up too much in it, that we can't be heedful. You know, we're just, it's like the mind gets on into a dull groove, into an inattentive groove. And this kind of behavior will condition that. And, you know, there's no hope of being alert or awake or seeing what's going on. And actually, I've actually included in this more and more now too, just tuning into the experience of not doing that, but also what are the things that make me alert? What are the things that conduce to my being alert and awake? You know, it's amazing that it took meditation to help me to realize that I needed to get a good night's sleep. That I needed to eat moderately, you know, things like this, that certain foods would really dull my mind. Certainly eating in excess would dull it. Amazing, but it's like as an idea, one gets that. But as a direct experience, it's very different to actually after, you know, in a moment after you've refrained from eating five more bites, because you've had a sense that you're actually full to really tune into that moment. You go, oh, this feels really good. You know, it feels great not to overeat. That's wonderful. It feels great not to be forcing myself to stay up at night because I just don't want to go to bed. You know, it feels great to get up in the morning, even though it would be nice to linger there. It actually feels better to get up because my mind is much more alert and awake than if I kind of linger in dull and dreamy stays. It's like, I have to learn that. You know, you have to learn it by actually seeing the experience of it. So it's kind of looking at these kinds of things, tuning into those moments when we're happy, when there's kindness, when there's goodness, when there's harmlessness, when there's generosity. All of this, just really getting a sense of it for ourselves. There's this wonderful suta I'd like to close with where the Buddha is talking to his son, Rahula, and there's a number of sutas where he's talking to his son. And I particularly love these because, you know, when you think about it, it's like he's giving his son his inheritance, you know. And he has special little advice for him in these sutas. So this is one where he's giving his son the meditation, instructions in the meditation practice. And teaching him how to refine his intention. So he says, he tells him in essence, you know, to use his actions as a mirror for reflecting qualities within his mind. So he says that each time before he acted, he was to reflect on the result that he expected from the action. And to ask himself, is this going to lead to harm from myself or others or not? And if it wasn't going to lead to harm, then he could do it. But if it was harmful, then he shouldn't do it. Just cut it off right there. If it wasn't, he could go ahead. But that's not where he leaves it. Then he says, you know, he cautions him actually. Don't leave it at that. He said, while you're in the process of acting on that behavior, then ask yourself if there were any unexpected bad consequences of that behavior. And if there were, then he should stop. And if not, then he could carry on. But then again, he doesn't leave it there. He says, now, having completed the action, to look and see, you know, now that it's done, were there any bad unexpected consequences? Was there any harm that came? Can you feel the thoroughness of the looking? It's beautiful. And if there is harm, then to hold that in the mind, to reflect on that for a moment, because that moment was going to be what was going to help him not do it again in the future. To really just linger with that. And if there wasn't any harm, if it was, then he should take, this is important, he should take great joy in being on the right path. And he should continue in his training. Would you love that? It's beautiful. And take great joy in the fact that you didn't do harm. Didn't hurt anybody. Yeah. So I hope these thoughts are helpful for tonight. I think it's important to reflect on goodness and how to fan the flame of it in our practice. So we have a few minutes. Do you have some thoughts of your own or perhaps some questions? Yes. Just a question I have sometimes goes through what you're saying about how it trains itself. It's really like using the same pain and pleasure program that's caused so much suffering, and really just giving it an intervention. So the same program just doesn't have enough information. Right. And so you would do it? Exactly. Using pain and pleasure to wake up. Yeah, that's a very good point. Thank you. I see the meditation practice really as turning that in the interest of freedom and really recognizing that it's actually this experience of pleasure and pain, which Buddha talked to us. He talked about this as why the human birth is so fortunate, because we have this mix and we can use it to wake up so that literally you tune into your own behaviors, to the conditions of your mind, to speech and experience for ourself what is painful and what is pleasant. That's why I say the Buddha is the ultimate pleasure seeker. If you tune in, the experience of harmlessness, kindness, generosity, respect, non-intoxicating, non-indulging, it all feels very good. And that's what you're using just as you're describing. Yes. Can that goodness and love, as a philosophy, become a part of our society or nature, to continue to be generous in the meaning of it? Yes. Can it be the case that you're overdoing it, sort of? But it's natural to be in the right. Yeah. Yes, I think that's a good point, to keep tuning in. It's interesting, because one of the things I've witnessed a lot is going to the monasteries, which are all based in Thai culture, where there's a lot of emphasis on the link between generosity and attaining merit, which is sort of like a bank account. The more that you do, the bigger your bank account gets, so that when you die, you have a happy rebirth. This is the way this particular aspect of the teachings is taught there. It's a little off. It's right in one sense, but the way that it's taught in this culture actually breeds a certain excessive generosity, if that's possible, to the point where I've seen people who give everything away and then don't take care of their family's needs. So that ends up, if you examine that, you can actually be very attached to the idea of generosity, but not actually tuning in very well to the experience of it, because if you were tuning in in those instances, you would see the harm that would be being done. So it's important to discern. I think that's kind of what you're pointing to, isn't it? Yeah. One doesn't want to do it to the point where there is harm. If there's harm, then it's not the quality that we're looking for. There's this one little Thai woman I worked with all the time at the monastery. She was like that, but she was not really taking care of herself. She would spend always... On the one hand, it was like, lovely. You learn a lot from observing that kind of behavior and being around it. She was so devoted, and she would just do anything. She spent all of her evenings preparing things to bring to the monastery. They would come up on these double-decker buses with the buses loaded with gifts and offerings, which is all very beautiful. But one has to take care that it's not... She would do it to the point where she wasn't putting food on her own table. That's not good. I find that there's a large part of my mind which greatly resists examining my behavior by my own esthetic equation before I do it in the world of Indian. So anything you could say about that would be useful. Yes, examining behavior before, during, and after. I think that the message that comes through in the sutra makes it sound like it's something that's very deliberate and conscious, and there's a lot of effort in it. I'm with you. When I start to feel that, I get... I contract. But I think that actually what it's pointing to is something much more subtle. That if you tune in, there is already a reflective awareness that's there. There's a way that without thinking about it, without making ourselves do it, we already know. And I think it's a lot more about tuning into that. It's very soft. It's very subtle. It's kind of like fanning the flame of that sense of presence, a certain presence with our experience. And if you're connected with it, you don't have to think about it. You don't have to do anything. It's there. You know it. Do you know what I mean? It's much softer that way. Yeah, I find like... I was talking the other day about practice. I experience it very much like a dance. And it's sort of like connecting with what our experience is and just kind of moving with it, flowing with it, and being as attentive as you can to what it is it actually is. It's like noticing this dance partner, you know, behaves this way, this dance partner behaves that way. And it's much softer that way, you know. It's about connecting. It's about feeling experience. And that's quite subtle. And it takes a stillness. So, you know, work with it that way. That's the effort.
