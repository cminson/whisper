Sati (2 of 5) Recognition  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

This morning I’ll continue with the discussion s of the 
faculty of mindfulness  (sati), the third of the Five 
Faculties. I could probably talk about mindfulness for a 
very long time . But at the same time, I don’t quite know 
what mindfulness is. I’ve been doing it for forty years , 
so I have a sense of the practice of it, but I haven’t 
found it particularly useful to narrow mindfulness down 
to a pa rticular thing. In these coming days, however, we 
will get to my understanding of the essence , or the full 
potential of mindfulness .  
 
As I said yesterday, I want to make a distinction 
between the faculty of mindfulness and the practice of 
mindfulness. For  example, the distinction could be that 
someone might tell you that they run. That doesn’t tell 
you much. But if they tell you that they are doing a 
training program for running, then you have the idea 
that it’s not just running , but also involves 
strength ening, speed exercises, a whole training 
program. In the same way, mindfulness training, 
mindfulness practice, involves more than just 
mindfulness. But the function of training in mindfulness is to strengthen mindfulness  – to strengthen the 
capacity of min dfulness so that it becomes strongly 
established.  
 
It used to be that the Four Foundations of Mindfulness 
were called just that. Now the tendency is to call them  
the Four Establishments of Mindfulness  – or my 
preferred translation is the Four Ways of Esta blishing 
Sati. We have practices that really begin to establish 
and strengthen our capacity to be aware and attentive 
in a clear way in the present moment.  
 
One key element to help with this establishment (which 
is sometimes equated with mindfulness itself) is 
recognition  – the mind’s capacity to comprehend what 
is happening, to know what is happening. If I am 
breathing, I can know I am breathing. I can go through 
much of the day and not really pay attentio n to my 
breath  – I know I’m breathing , but I don’t really clearly  
know , “Oh, that is breathing going on.”  
 
I can hear a sound and just kind of know it in passing , 
and hardly pay any attention to it. Or, I c an know, 
“That’s a sound.” I c an really know  it as a sound. And I 
could recognize and clearly comprehend that  it’s traffic 
sound.  
 
This is the ability to clearly recognize what something 
is. There are two slightly different ways that this is said by the Buddha. One is sampajañña , a Pali word  usually 
translate d as “clear comprehension. ” Then there is 
pajānāti, which is “to know. ” Those two are the key 
elements of the practice of mindfulness. As we cultivate 
the clear recognition of what is here, then our capacity 
for awareness begins to grow, as does our capacity to 
stay in the present moment with awaren ess of what is 
happening.  It creates momentum . It grounds or 
connects us in a stronger way.  
 
The capacity to understand what is happening is not a 
complicated, analytical thing, like knowing all the 
causes and conditions of what is going on. It’s really the 
simple act of recognition  – recognizing the specificity of 
what is happening in the moment. There is clarity . 
Things begin to stand out clearly so that we can make 
distinctions.  
 
I don’t want to make this too analytical,  but I will offer an 
example. If someone says to you that they are having a 
bad day, that is a very broad judgment of the day. It’s 
such a broad judgment , that in a certain way, if that is 
how they are seeing the day , it’s a self -fulfilling 
prophecy. It’s bad because t hose are  the eyes through 
which it is seen. But that is a broad, abstract concept. 
What part of the day is bad?  
 
You are talking together, walking down the street on a 
sunny  day, with a blue sky, a peac eful setting. You look around and say, “Is this the bad part of the day?” They 
say, “No, no, this isn’t the bad part of the day.” “What is 
the bad part of the day?” “Oh, the bad part of the day is 
that I’m having a lot of trouble at work with my boss.” 
“Oh, does that boss come with you when you go home 
in the evening?” “No, no, but the thoughts of them do.” 
By simple questions, we can begin to separate out what 
is actually happening , and we get clearer moment by 
moment . And we don’t tend to generalize with big 
statements like , “It’s a bad day .” As practice gets 
strong, the direct experience in the moment might be : 
Here, my mind is having the thought , “This is a bad 
day.”  
And we see clearly and recognize, “Oh, that’s a thought 
of a bad day.” That puts it in a different context. That 
thought is one of the many features of the present 
moment.  
 
There are body sensations. There is what we see 
physically around us. There are em otions, and other 
thoughts going on. To see each thing in its specificity  – 
and not in a generalization  of the mind  – begins to 
make us wiser about what is going on . We don’t 
generalize, or get caught up with judgments. This also 
starts to highlight more a nd more the value of staying 
clearly present – really seeing the details of the moment 
as they arise and appear. As we do that, awareness, 
mindfulness gets established. We become clearer and 
clearer. Sometimes the concept of clarity – to see or know clearl y – is almost synonymous with the idea of 
being mindful.  
 
In mindfulness training, one thing we are doing is 
training ourselves to begin to recognize the specificity of 
the moment. Not to dig in underneath , like an 
archeological dig , to see what’s going on  – but just to 
begin seeing what is happening in the moment. It could 
be as simple as looking around where you are and just 
identifying individual things. I’m seeing a chair over 
there. A shelf over there. A door . A light switch.  
 
Even though that may seem mundane or not very 
spiritual  – for some states of mind , to look around, see, 
and identify  is phenomenally useful. In fact, some 
therapists do that exercise with people who are caught 
in fear and anxiety. They ask them to look around and 
name what they see in the room. It is grounding, 
settling. It begins creating the mind’s capacity to start  
being clear about what is going on.  
 
It might seem silly to do that, but when we close our 
eyes  in meditation, we are doing the same thing. We 
are not sitting here thinking , “I’m having a bad 
meditation, ” or “I’m having a good meditation ,” or 
whatever we might say. These generalizations actually 
keep us removed from our direct experience and 
interfe re with our ability to establish mindfulness, 
awareness of the present moment.   
We can start recognizing the details of the moment in a 
relaxed, open way, without searching or striving  – just 
noticing  the simplicity of the in -breath and the out -
breath. If we say,  “I’m having a bad breath . I’m 
breathing in a bad way, ” that is abstract . But we can 
say, “O h, the inhalation is like this ; the exhalation is like 
this. The weight of my bottom on the cushion is like this. 
The sound of the traffic is like this. ”  
 
It’s is optional , but there is a long tradition  for this . One 
way this is done is using mental notes or little labels. 
This is a be autiful art to learn . It takes a while  and is 
awkward at first. Some people protest too quickly , 
saying it just makes the ir mind busy. But it’s like riding a 
bicycle. At first it’s wobbly and you fall off. It’s awkward. 
It takes a lot of energy . But once y ou learn to ride the 
bike it goes really smoothly, and you can lift your hands 
off the handlebars.  
 
If we give ourselves time to learn the art of mental 
noting , and know how it works best for us, then it’s a 
very simple thing of , “In-breath, out-breath, hearing, 
pressure, thinking, warmth, contentment, really quiet. ” I 
don’t always do it. But sometimes I find it phenomenally 
helpful and useful. I kind of love doing it.  
 
One way I like to do mental noting to make it a really 
light touch . I will imagine  I am doing mental noting . And if I imagine I’m doing it, rather than it being whispering 
in the mind, then it’s almost like there’s no energy 
involved.  It floats through like a vision. But it keeps me 
connected.  
 
We don’t have to use mental notin g, but it is a way of 
getting a hang of the clarity and specificity of connecting 
to the direct experience , as opposed to the abstract 
concepts of the experience. As practice settles down, 
it’s natural as the mind becomes clearer , and begin s 
seeing more an d more details of phenomena.  
 
It’s like when you’ve had a really good nap in the 
afternoon , and you wake up really clear. Everything 
seems precise and pristine because of the state of the 
mind. As we cultivate the ability to clearly recognize the 
moment  – this, this, this – then awareness and 
mindfulness grow, and the ability to stay clear moment 
by moment becomes stronger and stronger.  
 
Some people see recognition as the same as 
mindfulness. I am treating it a little differently from 
mindfulness, but it is a partner to mindfulness, an 
integral part of mindfulness training. It’s an important 
part of this whole faculty of mindfulness that we are 
growing and developing.  
 
We have three more days on the faculty of mindfulness , 
and I’m very much looking forward to sharing these ideas with you. I want to thank you. I hope that you are 
well.
