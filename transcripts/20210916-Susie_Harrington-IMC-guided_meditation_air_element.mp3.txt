 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning. And this is the first couple days I hadn't figured out outside my range how to see the chat that people are sharing that are on the YouTube stream. And I have to say that I can see it. I can't read it all while I'm talking, but I can see it. And it's quite lovely. It's really I can feel the sangha, this spread all over and quite beautiful. And I realize there's many of you that have this as your regular practice, that you're committed to being here every day. I just want to celebrate that with you, that this has been made possible. And sort of one of the gifts that's come out of these very difficult recent times. So beginning today with air. We talked about earth and water and fire and now moving on to include air. And this last year has been particularly poignant, the year and a half, really, around air. We've seen sort of this and we've gained so much understanding about how connected we are. And it's come through our awareness of breath. So there's, you know, I really last summer and with George Floyd, the I can't breathe. And how deeply we were all affected by that and rightly so. And how that phrase, like, got us right where we where we live and where we die. And raised consciousness in a huge way, in a way that was really good. And in the midst of that, we have COVID, which is has made us so aware of how connected we all are by breath. That this thing, this virus that is carried on the breath has traveled the entire world. We it's sort of a terrible and yet clarifying unfolding of how clearly our breath is intimately connected. Everyone. You can't be left out of this. And then again, in another way with the smoke and, you know, when the smoke from the California fires reaches all the way to the east coast and it's like, oh, right. The air we breathe, it moves everywhere. So there's something so intimate about this. And sometimes challenging. I want to acknowledge that part, too. But the breath, we start our practice with our breath. That's where we begin. And there's so much in that there's so much potency available if we start to connect with this universal breath that we all share. So we'll begin our practice. I'll offer a poem to start and I'll offer a few different ways to connect with this element of air. Beginning with a poem as you're settling into your meditation spot, finding your ground. This is from Dana Falls. Walk slowly. It only takes a reminder to breathe a moment to be still. And just like that, something in me settles, softens, makes space for imperfection. The harsh voice of judgment drops to a whisper. And I remember again that life isn't a relay race, that we will all cross the finish line. That waking up to life is what we were born for. As many times as I forget, catch myself charging forward without even knowing where I'm going. That many times I can make the choice to stop, to breathe and be and walk slowly into the mystery. So as you settle into your posture, feeling your connection with the ground. Feel the pressure of your buttocks on the chair, the cushion. Feel your feet in contact with the ground. Allow yourself to feel the spine rising up and then the muscles softening, responding to the pull of gravity. Feeling in the shoulders, letting the eyes soften. And allow yourself to tune in a little bit to the place where you are, recognizing that even if you're in a building, just outside, there's trees, there's plants, there's other beings. And allow yourself to feel how these other beings, just acknowledging perhaps conceptually and then just sensing it a little, that these other beings are breathing. That the trees are breathing. They breathe out carbon dioxide and breathe in oxygen. The algae of the ocean are breathing in great quantities. The deep forests, the tropical forests, the boreal forests, all breathing. And as we breathe in, we breathe with them. And the breath is carried on the wind through the air, spreading everywhere. And as you breathe, feel this breath as it comes into your body, through this open door of the throat. And this breath in the area of the diaphragm, the solar plexus, as it comes in and fills you here. As you breathe in. As you breathe in, let the breath be felt in the lower belly. Sense it from the inside. The world coming in through the throat, all this breathing coming right into your lower belly. Just notice you don't need to change the breath to feel it there. Just notice that you can feel it. Let yourself feel the breath all the way to the base of the body. In the perineum, into the joints of the hips, it'll become subtler there, but it's still affected. We can still sense the breath here. Perhaps noticing that you can feel it even along the back, along the lower lumbar and the sacrum. Notice if you can have even some sense that the breath flows down your legs. The slight ripple of movement. We know that in fact the breath, the oxygen, is being transported through our blood down to every cell. But can you sense it? Just the subtle, energetic movement of breath flowing down into your legs? Perhaps you can tell partway down your legs or fully, whatever you can feel. Or sense. The nourishment of breath. Perhaps noticing the whole body from the waist down, that it's breathing. It's being breathed. No effort required. Letting yourself sense up into the chest area. You can feel it most clearly to the front, but notice that you can feel the breath also along the back. The ribs expanding just a little. The breath along the sides of the ribs. And then feeling the breath in the upper chest, both in the front and the back, under the whole region of the collar girdle, shoulder girdle. Feel the breath in the right shoulder. See if you can notice this sensation of breath traveling and including your right arm. Breath nourishment. The molecules of the Amazon in the ocean, algae, breathing in, blowing down your arm. And the left shoulder. Sometimes the shoulders, the body has to soften some to allow more this sense of air to be filled. The breath is being nourished. The body from the neck down, one full breathing body. The blessing of breath coming in and flowing to every corner, every cell. And letting this sense of the breath fill your head as well. The neck filling all the way through all your sinuses, filling your brain breath nourishing deep inside the skull. Feeling the whole body breathing, being breathed, aliveness. Notice this air element may have some aspect of vibration or lightness. We can't see this air. We can see its effect. We can feel it move in the body. You might notice the thoughts when they come are much like this element of air. They have this air quality. They appear ephemeral, cannot really be touched directly. And then they just drift away, disappear right back in to the empty space they came from. Allow your thoughts to come and go like the air. Drifting in and out like rustling leaves. And as you breathe, you don't need to exclude anything. Sound comes through the air. Sensations arise. Thoughts come and go. All to be breathed in and allowed to breathe out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Feeling the whole body breathing. And in those moments where we start to latch onto a thought, where we cling to something that's arisen, just notice that there's a way, the breath, there's a constriction, a contraction. We lose contact with the fullness of the breath. And then we remember that we're being breathed and we can rest in this breath. And the relaxation, the fullness is available again. Let yourself notice any coming and going. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Every cell in your body being awoken alive with the breath of the world, this thin layer of air covering the surface, this living, alive breath that we share. You are part of it. You too are breathing, breathing with the whole world. No inside, no outside, simply breath coming and going. Breath profading your whole body, the space around you, inside each living being. Rest and allow yourself to be held in this great sacred breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
