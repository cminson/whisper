 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Greetings, everyone. I'm delighted to be continuing to share these important teachings on why speech is part of the eightfold path, the third path factor. So why speech, appropriate speech, not only important in the way that we impact the world, not just with our speech, but with our writing, our text, our tweets, with our phenomenal speed and reach, but also how it shapes and forms who we are. So taking it on not just as a set of moral rules that I should not lie, I should not speak what's not beneficial, but really as an internal scaffold of who we are to form our own karma. The person we are, the person we are becoming is sublime training. One way that an author, James Clear, the author of the book Atomic Habits, a great book, puts it in a secular way, but really it's about how we build our karma, is about our actions. But that in Buddhism, actions aren't just physical actions. They are mental actions when you think that's considered a mental action. Speech is an action of speaking and, of course, physical action. So actions really takes everything into consideration. So with this quote, consider action in all these ways, including speech. So from James Clear, every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. So I love the way they're thinking about every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. So I want to be more ethical. I want to not speak idly and just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So with this now, this being the fourth day we've been covering, we've been discussing this. I want to remind us of what we've discussed so far. So the first was, is it true? What I'm about to say, is it true? And factual, there are some nuances of factual. It's not just our perception or our emotions, but also is it factual supported by fact? So is it true and factual was the first one we discussed on Monday. And then the second day we discussed, is it divisive? Is it divisive or does it create harmony? And we added some nuance to both of those. And then yesterday we discussed, is it harsh and abusive or is it gentle? Is my speech uttered in anger or both internally and externally, of course, or is it gentle, soothing to the ear, agreeable as the Buddha directs us to speak? So today we're going to add two more and tomorrow the last one. So is it idle chatter or is it beneficial? So these are from two different teachings, as I mentioned the first day, but just to remind you, the Buddha gives in one list, there are four definitions of what is why speech and in another teaching, he gives another five and they kind of map, but not quite. And if you put them together, you end up getting six. So in fact, let me be more specific. So the, so the, so maybe I'll share that on the last day. I'll just give them their remaining time. I'll talk about these two. Okay. I'm just going to move on. So, so is it, is it idle chatter? So idle chatter is considered unwise speech or wrong speech, inappropriate speech and idle chatter, any talk that's not associated with liberation and freedom and the Dharma for monks is considered idle chatter. And the word actually idle chatter in Pali is an onomatopoeia is a word that sounds like what it is. It's some papalapa, some papalapa and the first P has an H after it. So some papalapa is like some papalapa, you know, just the sense of idle chatter, some papalapa, some papalapa, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right? It's you get the sense. So, so any speech that's not associated with liberation for monks, so they have a higher standard is considered some papalapa. We're lay people. We have a different standard. We do engage with, with others in a social way with our coworkers, with our friends, family. We have a way to bond as a way to, to make relationships and not every conversation will be about liberation. And yet to consider, is it, is it idle chatter? Are we just opening our mouths to just fill the space, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah? Are we feeling uncomfortable with, with silence and just rushing to fill it in? How are we feeling, how, how are we feeding our mind with what we say and also what we consume? Are we consuming some papalapa? Just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, just like idle chatter, social media, idle chatter, Lila, some, yeah, somebody went on a vacation. Okay, great. I'm happy for them. But some papal, is it all some papalapa? What are we consuming? What are we, what are we putting in? How are we engaging? Are we indulging because we are trying to get the self, our self sense, are we getting riled up? So, so all of these, all of these questions about why, why am I speaking? In fact, there is a great acronym from the teacher Jonathan Faust and the acronym is WAIT, W-A-I-T. And it stands for why am I talking? I love that. Why am I talking? So internally, why am I talking? Why am I talking in this moment? Why am I talking? And having a little bit of humor with that can be helpful. Why am I talking? Is it yeah, why am I talking? What is my intention right now? Why is, what is my intention? And again, it goes back to the intention. Why am I talking? Am I just filling space or is it beneficial? Is it beneficial for my own benefit for others benefit and benefit? You know, greed, hate or delusion, but is it connected? Benefit is defined as the goal of the path. So whatever is connected to the goal of the path is, is considered beneficial for my benefit. Other people's wellbeing benefit in this way. Why am I talking? Why am I talking? So the Buddha instructs us to abandon, abandoning idol chatter. One abstains from idol chatter. One speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma and the Vinaya. Vinaya is the rules for the monks. So this part, it was for the monks. And then one speaks, I love this. One speaks, words worth treasuring. One speaks, words worth treasuring. Seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal. Words worth treasuring. So that is one question to ask ourselves. Is it idol chatter when I'm engaging with there or is it beneficial? So bringing those together. And then the other question, the other directive that the Buddha gives us, I want to cover that in the time remaining, is, am I speaking with a mind of loving kindness? Am I speaking with a mind of loving kindness? And in shorthand, this guideline is often expressed as, is it kind? What am I, what I'm saying, is it kind? And I like the shorthand. Is it kind because it's short? And yet I don't love the shorthand and I'll tell you why, because is it kind? Is cutting ourselves short of the goal of how actually Buddha speaks it, the directive in the sutta is given. Am I speaking with a mind of loving kindness? Yes, it's a mouthful, it's long, but it's different from just being kind. You can say something that's kind, but may not be completely spoken with a mind of loving kindness, right? Just be, try to be kind. Yeah, great. It's a great start. Please say things that are kind. Wonderful. It's a great start. But imbuing, speaking with a mind of the heart of loving kindness is a more wholesome, is a more complete aspiration for training ourselves. Am I speaking with a mind of loving kindness? And yes, of course, whatever comes from that mind of loving kindness spoken with that, then it is spoken with kindness. And it's going to be kind, but that is the invitation. And imbuing our hearts with a mind of goodwill for ourselves, for others, 360 degrees. So not just speaking for their benefit and to our own detriment or other way around, but really kindness 360 degrees. And in fact, in another teaching, Buddha says that one doesn't say something that's to one's own detriment. So this, the mind of loving kindness covers, covers it all. It's not just other focused. It's really internal and externally focused because you are part of the all beings. This being is part of the all beings. So for benefit of all beings, no one left out. And imbuing our hearts, our minds with loving kindness before we speak can support us to minimize the agitation of remorse and regret later. So a lot of beautiful teachings, grateful to the Buddha, all these beautiful things. And then tomorrow we will turn to the last one, which is, is it timely? Is it the right time? And as all these things that we have discussed so far, if they are satisfied, yes, yes, yes, but it's not the right time. It's not, it's still not, it's not wise speech. And the Buddha gives some beautiful teachings about is it the right time? And there's a sutta that I'd love to share with you tomorrow. So, so thank you so much, everyone, for your practice today, for your showing up. And for, for today's practice day, I'd like to invite you to, to become sensitive to your speech in regards to these two things. One is, is it idle chatter? What I'm consuming and what I'm speaking, is it idle chatter or is it beneficial? And bring in this acronym, WAIT. Why am I talking? Why am I talking in this moment? Is it better to be silent? And then also, am I speaking with a mind with a heart of loving kindness? What am I bringing in here? Am I speaking with a heart of loving kindness? And if you feel like it's, it's juggling too many balls, just pause. Come back to your body. It's okay to have silence. It's okay to be silent for a moment. Get your bearings, get your, get it reconnected with your body, heart and mind and, and engage again. So thank you all. Be lighted to be practicing together. Thank you for your practice. May you be well. May you be free. See you tomorrow.
