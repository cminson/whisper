Oh, I think that one of the themes this week, because of the different programs
we're doing, is calm or tranquility. And to really be pervaded by tranquility or calm
is a greater pleasure than any joy you can experience. It's really something to
experience. It's kind of like dripping in tranquility or suffused with it or the
whole atmosphere. There's a kind of clarity and it's wonderful. It's very
alive. There's a vitality there. So it's not to be confused with the dullness or
lethargy or just kind of giving up. My association with dynamic tranquility is
sitting really straight, not kind of collapsing in the couch and just being
kind of when I was in college, I had a friend who, a roommate, a housemate, who
would come home from day of school and he would collapse on the couch and just
lay out flat on the couch in a very relaxed, happy way. And I used to look
at him and I kind of a little bit admire him and said, oh look, he knows how to be
relaxed. You know, why don't I do that? You know, maybe something
wrong with me that I can't do that. And then at some point I realized that he
did it as a compensation for being really tense, really stressed in what he was
doing. He's like collapsed and he kind of like needed to recover and that I didn't
have the same need. And so I didn't have to compensate for having been as
stressed as he was. So I thought he was calm. I thought he was relaxed and I
was like, what's wrong with me, Gil? For him, the pendulum was
swinging kind of. He was so stressed that he had to kind of recover from it. So
which is good. I'm glad he could do that. But you know, just kind of building up
on this, building on this idea that this tranquility that we're looking for in
Buddhism is not in that pendulum in the swing of calm from stress
to de-stressing or something. It's its own thing, its own vitality and
dynamism of sorts. I love this story that I maybe told a few times of this, the
emperor feels a little bit stressed. And so once a picture, once a painting made,
that's very peaceful. And he wants to, he wants to change a contest of who can
paint the most beautiful, most inspiring, most moving painting that's tranquil and
calm and peaceful. So it's a, and there's a big reward, big prize. A lot of people
apply their paintings and their art. And he's not happy with any of it. They keep
to this. The court ministers go all around the country trying, anybody who
could paint and trying to please the emperor, nothing works. Finally, someone
says, well, there's this very poor farmer high, deep in the mountains in the
northwest who is supposed to be a good painter, but no one has ever seen anything.
So they go get this person and bring him to the emperor and the person says, okay,
yeah, I'll make you a painting. And he spends a few months painting it in the
emperor, of course, is impatient, but waiting for this to come. And finally,
there's gonna be an unveiling. It turns out to be a very big painting. And they
pull off the cloth in front of the painting and everyone goes gasps. There's
nothing tranquil about the painting. It's a roaring waterfall cascading down,
just like the most violent thing you can imagine through the waterfall. And if
they turn to the painter, what's this about? You know, this is supposed to be a
painting tranquil pastoral scene or something. And so the painter goes, come
here. Come look. He brings the emperor close. In the middle of the waterfall,
there's a little parting of the water. And there's a little rock ledge.
And in the middle of that rock ledge, there's a bird's nest. And little bird
is sitting there very peacefully and calm. And he says, look. So then he won the
prize. And so it's a painting of vast chaos and activity and something that's
not very tranquil. But in the middle of it, there's a place of tranquility. So
what is a tranquility? Can you find a tranquil place in the middle of the
chaos of life? Do you have to have a tranquil world for you to be tranquil, or
can there be a chaotic world and you know how to be tranquil in the middle of
it? Can you be agitated but know that within you there's a home, a place of
tranquility that you can take refuge in as you navigate the world, as you
navigate yourself in your life? What do you know about a tranquil place, quiet,
peaceful place within? As we meditate, that's one of the things we can begin
feeling, knowing, recognizing inside of ourselves that in fact there is a quiet
place inside, a quietude, a peacefulness, a calm, that can be a reference point for
how we go through our life. And we can also learn how easy it is to change the
reference point, to pop back up, be pulled into the seduction of the agitated
mind, the agitative feelings and ideas we have, the stories we're telling
ourselves, the desires we're chasing after, and how easy it is to go into
another world that's much more agitated. And if both of those are inside of
ourselves, are we making a choice, is it an unconscious choice
to prioritize the place of agitation? What would happen if you prioritize the
place of calm? Not as a rejection of the agitated place, maybe what the
agitated place is concerned with is important. But how about being with it
from the calm place? More often than not we'll think more creatively, we'll
think more intelligently if we're calm rather than caught in the swirl and
whirl of our agitations. And this art of allowing for both, not assuming it's all
or nothing, I have to be calm and kind of hold myself quiet and calm, but rather
to have a calm that allows you to gaze upon the agitation you have, to be
able to look at your preoccupations, your concerns, without being preoccupied
with them, and maybe in that way to become wiser. There's a Buddhist saying
that if you want to be wise, be tranquil first. But maybe it doesn't have to be an
all-encompassing tranquility, maybe it's just a little spot inside, maybe it's in
your chest, in your heart, maybe in your belly, maybe it's in your hands or in
your feet. Oh, there's a little bit of calm, tranquility, some stability, a place
of stability, maybe. Touch into it. Let that be a reference. And if that is the
reference for your life, you probably respond to life very different if the
primary reference is your agitation. It's whatever agitated world you live in,
the spinning world, thoughts, ideas.
So those are my thoughts today. Thank you.
