 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org....box. And just a warm welcome to our meditation here together this morning. Happy to see you here. The invitation is just to settle in, settle into a posture that, you know, is comfortable and alert. Set up your space so that you feel like you're going to be able to drop into meditation. Maybe turn off any alerts, cell phones, that kind of thing. If it's helpful to turn off your camera, feel free. I will keep mine on for now. And... Starting by going inward. Just checking in to how things are for you in this moment. Noticing how your body is in your room. Your cushion or chair or however it's situated. Noticing how your mind and heart are in your body. It can be helpful to start with a couple of deeper, more intentional breaths. Allowing any excess tension to release on the exhale. And then allowing the body's breathing, your life's breath, to be natural. Noticing, am I aware? It's most obvious in this moment. And if there's any tension or subtle agitation, perhaps just dropping in the invitation, maybe the body relax. Inviting, allowing softness. And dropping in the invitation. May the mind and heart relax. Noticing the effect of the intention. If it's helpful to rest the attention on a primary anchor of attention, to stabilize it, please do what works for you, whether that's breathing, or body sensation, or sound. Inviting, inviting whatever this is into awareness. And if it's more hospitable for you, to simply rest in awareness itself, awareness at the moment, receptively allowing everything to flow through, that too is invited. Relaxing, receiving, aware. Thank you. Thank you. And time to time refreshing the attention. And now, we are aware, turning through awareness with as much kindness and graciousness as possible. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In the final moments of this meditation, taking a moment to tune in, to tune to the quality of your heart and mind in this moment. Is it contracted and distracted? Or spacious? And settled? Is it complex or simple? What is the quality of awareness right now? And whatever the answer is to that question, taking a moment to appreciate the time spent here in this practice, in this moment, trusting the Dharma, trusting cultivation. Thank you. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice. Now, as is the custom when I teach here, the invitation is to take just a moment or two still and quiet and meditative space and just send a little pulse of goodwill, kindness, friendliness to your fellow practitioners, the ones here in the Zoom room, perhaps the ones practicing elsewhere right now or to this recording. And as you send those good wishes, trusting that you're receiving them from the other people here near and far. Thank you. So today, I'm just going to offer a few informal reflections on why is it you? I'm teaching a series this week on the Saranīya Dhamma, which is a collection of the Buddha's teachings on interpersonal harmony, really, mostly. And it turns out that all of those qualities conducive to interpersonal harmony are also really conducive to deepening meditation. And the foremost among these qualities, the Saranīya Dhamma, often translated as principles of cordiality, wise view is actually the most important quality by far. I'll just name the others so you know the context. The Buddha talks about loving kindness for ourselves and others, especially others in thought, speech and action. And then he speaks of the wisdom of importance of unblemished virtue and showing up consistently with virtue, ethical behavior and sharing non-instinctiveness and then the last wise view. So it turns out wise views are really important quality, not just for the path, which I'll talk about mostly today, but also for getting along with others. So I'll just talk about it as far as it plays out in relationship for a couple of minutes first, because this comes up many, many times in the ancient Buddhist teachings, these indicators of a person with wise view. They show up with those other qualities I just mentioned, and there is a quality of a non-obsession around them. They're aware of rather than obsessed with the hindrances of sensual desire and ill will and all the others doubt, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse. There's awareness of those things happening in the mind versus being caught in them, obsessed by them, led by them. And more than anything else, they are not obsessed about speculative views about this world or the way Bhukkhobodi translates it, the other world, or one might say the hereafter. Rather than being obsessed about that, they're more oriented to this, what's here, what's now. And this absence of being focused, obsessed on opinions or speculation means they're also not thrown to being drawn into quarrels with other people, especially the more sort of philosophical quarrels. Instead, a mature practitioner who cultivates wise or right to view the words in Pali are samaditi. They have this perspective that's kind of orthogonal to opinions. It's more of a process perspective. What's arising now? What's arising that leads to something else? What's ceasing that leads to something else? And this kind of wise view the Buddha says, I'm quoting here, slants, slopes and inclines towards nibbana. Slant, slants, slopes and inclines towards freedom. Isn't that beautiful? So I'm going to offer just a few perspectives on the perspective of wise view, wise understanding. The first I've mentioned is that it includes a process perspective. And what I mean by a process perspective is conditionality really. But the most simple and perhaps important form of conditionality that the Buddha taught was the Four Noble Truths. Dukkha or suffering, the arising, recognizing the arising of suffering in the moment, recognizing the ceasing of suffering in the moment, and understanding the path that leads to the ceasing of Dukkha. So this is in one perspective the beginning of the path. Wise view is the very beginning of the Noble Eightfold Path. And it wraps around being the very end because there's different levels of it. There's mundane wise or right view, which is sort of the more intellectual level understanding of this that helps inspire, oh, cultivation works, meditation works, or can work. And then there is the deep understanding that happens for a Mator practitioner at some level of awakening, penetration of awakening. That's one perspective. The second perspective is wise view can be a view, understanding, action, or karma. Karma. And I'm going to quote here, this is from the Suta Nipata. And the Buddha is talking here about looking for the title, so those of you who are interested in what makes a true Brahman. This is the Vaseta Suta, Suta Nipata. And the Buddha was very smart, right? In ancient India the Brahmins were the most revered caste, the top caste. And what he did in his teachings, what he did with many words, is he kind of retold the term Brahmin to mean a noble one, not necessarily by birth, but through understanding. So here he's talking about a person who has a deep understanding. One is not a Brahmin by birth, nor by birth a non-Brahmin. Instead by action one becomes a Brahmin, and by action one becomes a non-Brahmin. One becomes a farmer by action, a craftsman, a merchant, and a servant. All of those different roles are defined by action, and many more. A thief by action, a soldier by action, a priest by action, and even a king or queen is a king or queen because of their actions. And then he goes on to say, so that is how the truly wise see action as it really is. Seers of dependent arising, skilled in action and its results. Because action makes the world go round. By action the population turns. Sentient beings are fastened by kamma, action, like the linchpin of a moving chariot. So we can quibble with the ancient language or with like action is not the sole reason the person becomes anything, maybe in terms of status in society. But the Buddha is making the point that our actions define us, kamma defines us. And what is often taught as karma is the results of action, but it's actually all kind of one process. Kamma, action, and vipaka, fruit of action. And that is what we inherit, and that is how we become who we are. It's all these repeated tiny micro actions of thought, language, body. And that's also where the beauty of right view comes in because if actions begin to form the processes of who we are, actions even of mind, meditation for example, also begin to shift. It means that practice begins to shift us to work, to open us, to free us. So that's a second perspective on wise view. The third perspective is one that is classically taught, especially on retreat or in monastic circles or in southeast Asia. And this is insight into what are called the three characteristics, or what I like to call the three characteristics of subjective experience. Anicca in constancy, dukkha, suffering, and anatta, non-self. So these three, each of them could be a Dharma talk or a series all on their own. So I'll just briefly note that there are three different doorways into the levels of awakening. Three different doorways and one does not have to enter all three, one is sufficient. So anicca or inconstancy is the doorway that's taught most often here in the Theravada insight meditation lineage tradition. And the notion basically there is that seeing the inconstancy, penetrating that knowledge very very deeply, helps one understand among other things that nothing is to be clung to. Nothing can be clung to because it's constantly and always changing. So anatta, non-self, is also taught, emptiness is another word used. I like to think of this as less, it's not a view, remember we're talking about wise view here, as it is an experience, an understanding. And not-self is kind of the self as a process. That's one way of looking at it or the emptiness, the compounded phenomena, all of the different influences, we just talked about action and karma right, that form this person, this being, this personality, talking or listening in this moment, knitting or walking, whatever it is, all of this forms through process. It's another way of talking about conditionality. But one of my favorite ways of talking about it, I ran across this in Thailand, in one of the first monasteries I ever stayed at, there was this big sign and all it said was, don't be selfish, don't be selfish, kind of boils down to that. So non-self-centered myth. The third doorway is dukkha. Many of you have heard the translations of dukkha, pain, suffering, dissatisfaction, dis-ease. I love the atma-dapia in dukkha. It comes from the Pali for a wheel out of true, a clunky wheel, clunk, clunk, you can imagine riding on a cart where wheel is clunking, dukkha, that's dukkha on these like rutted dirt roads right. So it's that sense, something's off and it can range from subtle to very painful. The insight into dukkha is often considered to be tantamount to being an insight into the Four Noble Truths themselves, the arising of dukkha, the ceasing of dukkha and the path to the ceasing of dukkha. And it's a very deep insight. This comes from the Samyutta Nikaya. A practitioner has no perplexity or doubt that what arises is only dukkha arising and that what ceases is only dukkha ceasing. Their knowledge of this is independent of others. So that, that knowledge is a direct penetration of the Four Noble Truths, so a deepening, a cycling along the path. And it's in a sense a very deep insight. Now it sounds like a buzzkill or a joykill, but it can actually be so freeing because if dukkha is arising then it's also ceasing, it's also going away. And it's like oh it's just stupid, dukkha, and there's just something that can set the heart free rather than we in our human way constantly trying to fix change, negotiate with, recapitulate, defend against. It's the piece I've seen many times in the hospital, the piece of someone who is ready to die, who's ready and doesn't feel clinging anymore. That piece is deep, it's palpable. So insight into dukkha is a direct penetration into the Four Noble Truths and Bhikkhu Bodhi also notes that this kind of direct penetration of the Four Noble Truths happens by way of touching or realizing nirvana. In a sense it could be considered tantamount to touching nirvana. Let's see here. So all of what I've been saying here is basically to say that samadity, wise view, right view, complete view, has multiple facets to it and multiple levels to it. One more level or perspective is on greed, hatred, and delusion and their absence. So most of us, the way we navigate the world most of the time, is that there's some little strand of wanting or not wanting, hostility, aversion, whatever, or delusion operating in the mind most of the time. There's a perspective on this in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. It's actually a practice to notice this or to and to notice the absence. The Buddha speaks, how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mind as mind? A practitioner understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and unaffected by lust as unaffected. A mind affected by hate as so affected and a mind affected by delusion as so affected. A practitioner knows a mind unaffected by greed, by hatred, and by delusion. So I was paraphrasing just a little bit there to shorten it but you get the idea and those absences, that unaffected mind, those are moments of freedom, liberated mind. They're to be appreciated, to be noticed, and they can be very prosaic or they can feel very sort of exalted and big and amazing depending on the circumstances, in part depending on the amount of concentration. But the point here is that knowing, the Buddha doesn't say beat ourselves up because there's greed, hatred, or delusion floating through, a little snippet to thought. Instead it's know them and know their absence. That's all. That is awareness. That's wisdom. That's wisdom. I don't have it in front of me but there's this beautiful poem by a Chinese nun, Ben Ming. I may have read it at one point in this group before. She was considered to be awakened, very highly thought of, and she writes something like, don't you know that the five poisons, five hindrances, greed, hatred, and delusion, don't you know that properly seen they're nothing more than wisdom? Don't you know that the five poisons are nothing more than wisdom? Don't worry about a thing. Don't worry about a thing. That's a bit of her awakening song. To be able to see, metabolize anything moving through the mind as wisdom. Nutriment towards freedom. So those are my kind of informal thoughts today. That's kind of what I have in me today. So the invitation is any of you, if you have your own perspectives on how wise you have shown up for you or understandings of it that you've heard that I didn't include because there is a lot on this. And I just touched on some of it. I'd love to hear any thoughts. Yes, Kate, hi. Two things that come to mind for me when you were talking about you know just recognizing this is Dukkah and that yes there is a great, often a great freedom, a great ability to lighten with that acknowledgement. I don't I don't feel that as much with this is impermanent. I mean you know like it doesn't quite, it's like another kind of an insight but it doesn't feel, I mean probably it's that it that that insight would probably come often with Dukkah. So maybe the this is Dukkah and it's impermanent. And the other thing was when you said the thing about the sign that said don't be selfish and then you use self-centered it's like wow it was so difficult for me to look at the the not self idea because it always felt like when I caught myself holding onto self it was like you're being selfish. You're being you know those words those in the west anyway those words have such judgment and the difference the way I work with the sense of self now of like whoa hold them onto a big sense of self there honey or you know like like the feeling of the of the grasping onto self heals so much more divorced from the judgment of being selfish or self-centered. So it was just a reminder about the potency of those words you know and the the confusion with it you know. Yeah yeah that's that's important thank you and to just say too that the tone of voice of don't be selfish can be like don't be selfish. It can be so light and we in the west really layer a lot of that judgment and self-criticism on. There was something about seeing the sign in Asia that worked for me that would not have worked if I saw it here right like just a different cultural reference and it did not appear to it didn't feel judgmental it just felt kind of almost playful in a way. So thank you for that it's a good reminder anyone else please. Yes June. Yes hi Don thank you for the teaching. So recently I just feel like lots of aversion resistance and discontent sometimes I watch them and I feel powerless and I guess sometimes maybe I'm trying too hard to stop them so I wonder if you can give any advice. That's a beautiful question thank you. Yeah it can be really intense to see the amount that's going on in there sometimes can't it? You said it was particularly for you aversion you were noticing a lot of. Right yeah. So a couple of notions that you might play with one is simply the knowledge that it's kind of standard it's installed with the software so to speak of being human that these things will arise initially without a lot of cultivation so it's really helpful and this is much easier stuff than done not to have aversion to one's own aversion. So if you're noticing a lot of it and feeling the powerlessness it's probably more helpful to look at the feeling of powerlessness or to look at the aversion to the aversion with compassion than it is to keep looking at the aversion itself. Does that make any sense at all? Yeah so that what that does is it backs off the awareness level from being entangled in a meshed in whatever we're averse about and more into the observing mind so it's always okay to take a step back it's like okay there's aversion to the aversion there's powerlessness oh there's aversion to the powerlessness and notice that and just be with in a gentle way as spaciously as possible to notice it it's also helpful to flip so basically what I'm saying is notice the attitude in the mind in the heart when you're when you're seeing it and if there's a way to hold that with love it can really really help or at least not get involved like equanimity or non-involvement can be a form of love in this case so you're welcome yeah thank you yeah I think also also Kate mentioned about seeing the suffering of the aversion and then bring compassion yeah that that helps yeah that actually I need to do more I'll do more of that yeah great yes so the the four noble truths Kate talked about it I mentioned it in the talk as well right this is suffering that begins to educate the system and to notice if it eases oh it's not there right now maybe a foot of humor comes in instead oh suffering ceased in that moment at least and that begins to educate our heart educate our minds to um to a different way yeah so excellent any other comments that have come up for you or or ideas based on that conversation no okay anybody else thoughts yeah hi Kate hi um I wondered um if you could just say a little bit more about um seeing and being aware of um delusion um I know you know there are times in my life when I'm you know really obsessing about something and I I have an awareness at some level that that that that there is uh that there is uh delusion in the mix but it's it's you know it's quite hard to do you know if you are diluted to actually um be be aware of it yes that is an astute observation yes it's very true delusion by its nature kind of hides itself right so um um I think the answer to your question is a little bit embedded in your question then knowing that the delusion is there is key right and um to have a sense that there's delusion it's then very skillful to hold it lightly it's like oh the mind has spun up this the mind has spun up this fantasy or this interpretation or or this concoction so it can be helpful to kind of turn towards and like are you sure really are you sure and you hear the tone right it's it's playful so that can be really really helpful just to notice delusion as delusion and then again like I like June and I were talking about the process of delusion making is also a process of mind that's you know in Buddhist terms it's a very old habit it's a human habit it comes with being human until we begin to cultivate our mind quite a bit so to have some grace for ourselves and for other people about this because it's so easy to get pulled in and then the last thing I'll say is at some point it's helpful to notice any sense of disenchantment that you have about the delusion that's weaving itself and this can be many many layers of it it can just be oh I've had this fantasy 17 times today it's just not that interesting anymore or and that can be a positive fantasy or a negative one right or it can be you know is this necessary right now like to your own mind and just to begin to appreciate the quiet thesis that happened when the delusion is not forming so those are a few ideas it is the most difficult to work with okay like it's the one that reveals itself and the fact that you are seeing it is an indication of wisdom thank you that's very helpful thank you you're welcome okay any other thoughts comments or just questions about your practice that have come up hi Dom this is Padma welcome thank you um so I have a question um it's a lot of times even when I'm practicing or during the day you know going about things I kind of like replay what has you know like just normal conversation nothing like nothing like she said he said kind of it's just like oh okay you know we weren't there you know what I mean just I keep replaying in my head and I'm like why do I replay this you know and then I notice it but I was just wondering is that I don't know is that like normal is there a sign or something that I'm going that not at all it's a sign of mindfulness so um what you're noticing what it sounds like you're noticing because I'm not in your head with you it's the process natural process of memory formation so our mind and we may have never noticed this if like until mindfulness gets strong enough in daily life to start to notice oh my mind keeps repeating this thing just like when we were little kids and we had to repeat the abc's or you know the multiplication tables or whatever that's how our minds tend to encode memory I mean there are other ways they can do it too but it's actually the memory formation process itself and so to just you know I find it helpful to be a little bit amused with it or to just note gently in your mind oh memory formation or remembering so definitely not going crazy okay um and I have another question too it might be slightly more on the loving kindness side um so um you know I love doing it but I think a lot of the phrases I'm just saying it because you know that's a process kind of a thing but I don't know like how it's going to come from the heart or is it because I need to do forgiveness in hand in hand with loving kindness especially for the most difficult people right yeah so that's two great questions kind of folded in so I'm going to take the second one first so loving kindness for the most difficult person can take a long time to cultivate and it can be incredibly helpful to do forgiveness practice first before you even try even just having the intention or the will to forgive is the meaning of that process so that's just kind of the first level there the other thing is that for the purpose of loving kindness practice it's really helpful not to pick the most difficult person you've ever encountered or the person who's bugging you absolutely the most or has done you the most injury that's kind of like walking into the gym untrained and picking up a hundred pound barbell right we want to start with like 10 pounds 15 pounds 20 pounds and gradually work our way up so classically often the wisdom is pick someone moderately irritating right not not your worst enemy to begin with and that's not to say we can't get to the worst enemy it's a beautiful aspiration or to the person who's most harmful but just to get grounded in the practice first okay so um and then the last piece around the phrases so the phrases are one technique and they're the one that's taught the most often in the vipassana scene they come from the commentaries and they can be very helpful they're not necessarily the most helpful for everyone so a couple of ideas i'm actually teaching an introduction to loving kindness course in march if anyone's interested i will be unpacking this in great detail there but just briefly here um it can be helpful to craft your own phrases you can use the classic ones right those might work really well for you or you can make up your own that have the same spirit that friendliness good will in them so that's one way and then as far as feeling it in the body maybe all of you all of us who feel like it can do this right now if you breathe in just notice the sensations in the center of your chest and your core notice that you're receiving the air and then breathing out and almost imagine breathing out through your heart or that the breath the out breath is an offering an act of generosity breathing in receiving what is breathing out offering and you can use something like that to link it to an embodied experience some people visualize white light other people imagine like actually a gesture of offering but to it's it's not just okay it's actually encouraged to use your imagination in that practice and it can be with words or without them doesn't have to have words so you can just experiment for yourself and see thank you thank you so much and so i'm assuming the march series will be posted right uh it will be it is it's through a different organization i'm going to put their website in the chat so it's um sakti center which is a sister organization to IMC and um at the moment the registration page is pretty well hidden but i think if you go to calendar you can find it and they're experimenting with charging but if you click on the registration page there's also a way to sign up for no fee at all okay so cost is not a barrier to anyone who if you want to take it okay thank you so much don thank you thank you yes maryanne hi hi there i have a two part question padma brought it up the repeating of conversations and finding myself in the i should have said it differently mode the judgment mode do you have some tips on lightening up with that one oh gracious yeah we've all been there right yes so there's this simple memory formation and then what you're describing which is also good mindfulness right is a should have said that should have done that shouldn't have said this shouldn't have done that noticing it is a really good first step right so kind of like what padma and i were talking about just um noticing and then maybe just noting oh judgment judgment is arising self-criticism that in itself maybe isn't lightening on it but it starts to pry the mind out of doing it and get it into the mode get our mind into mode of knowing that we're doing it and the knowing is really helpful it starts to create a little bit of space there and then another one kate brought up which i think is really lovely watch the internal tone of voice oh sweet you're judging again look at that oh like that can be really helpful too and it brings in that loving aspect because some part of you knows it's not good for you and we you have started we do this right so but just to bring in really intentionally if you need to and then finally the last piece is um kind of more to padma's questions cultivating intentionally cultivating loving-kindness when that kind of stuff happens especially for yourself can be helpful so um my inner voice over the years similar to kate's has gotten kinder over the years and sometimes it'll catch like i'll catch some little flip of this going on and then the natural response is oh i love you right and that just cuts it like so to um to bring it in intentionally a little bit if you can and i don't does that feel like it would be accessible to you oh yes that's very very helpful my second part question was you were talking about forgiveness and the forgiveness process of being willing to forgive are there more steps that you can recommend in a relatively short period yeah so i'll be really candid this is not an area of expertise for me so my understanding is that forgiveness practice was brought into very wisely into buddhist practice probably by steven and andrea lavine um who are um who were i think they both passed away now sadly but were these beautiful um jewish buddhist jubus who worked in hospice for many years that was one of their main practices in addition to being buddhist teachers and um the jewish faith has a formal forgiveness practice so um it's been kind of adapted and morphed over the years and some if you wanted to use phrases you could um it is things like may i accept what has happened may i be willing to be with what has happened as it is may i have the understanding that their unskillful actions or your unskillful actions if you're aiming at it the person came from your own suffering so those are a few but you may just um being or search google um steven andrea lavine forgiveness practice because i'm pretty confident that they have unpacked it in ways that are more fully fledged than what i'm able to describe here very helpful thank you anybody else want to chime in okay coming once going twice all right so i'm going to dedicate the merit and stop the recording and if anyone wants to stay around for a little bit of informal chat afterwards i'll leave the zoom room open and stay here for a few minutes if you would like to do that okay meanwhile may the practice that we have done here together be of benefit through our own hearts and minds may this practice be supportive of freedom and be supportive of us benefiting all of the lives we touch now the lives that we touch benefiting all the lives they touch and so on may all beings everywhere be happy may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be free
