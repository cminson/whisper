The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

We're in the fourth foundation of mindfulness, looking at the mindfulness of the five,
usually called five aggregates of clinging or the five groups of clinging,
the five divisions of how we take our whole experience as human beings and cling.
So the Buddha divides clinging when we cling to almost anything.
We're actually clinging to these five areas.
And it's not quite just who we are, but it also has to do with anything at all.
They can kind of fit into these categories.
The refrain of the Satipatana Sutta that we talked about many weeks ago,
which is the direction in which the mindfulness practice is going,
comes to a place where we see the inconstant nature of our experience,
the flow of experience, the appearing and disappearing of experience.
And this repetition of this emphasis over and over again, the rising and passing experience,
is an alternative to being stuck,
an alternative to being caught up in some thought or idea or concept or feeling or anything.
It's an alternative to clinging.
So if the river is flowing and you want to stop the river,
grab it or you put up your hand to block it, it doesn't work.
The river keeps flowing.
But the stress of trying to hold the river back remains in our hands as we start to block it.
But if we can appreciate that what the river does is it flows,
then we might allow ourselves to be carried, if it's a nice river, safe river,
to be floated along in the current of the river.
And we can go far and we can eventually make it to the great peaceful ocean.
And so the same thing with our experience is much more fluid and changeable
than our concepts tell us.
Concepts, ideas, when we cling to them, hold on to them or we are obsessed by them,
it gives a sense of continuity, a kind of constancy to what we think is there,
what we think is going on, so that we think we can cling.
It works to cling.
But when we see that these concepts, these ideas, are part of the river of change,
then we can learn to float on them, which means we don't reject the concepts,
but we see their fluid in constant nature.
So in this, the five aggregates, the five heaps, five groups, groupings,
is there is, the third one is sanny훮, s-a-n-n-a,
and it's usually translated in English as perception.
But I don't think that's an appropriate translation.
I think perception seems to imply too much non-conceptual perception,
seeing, hearing, tasting, that we perceive at these different sense stores.
The word sanny훮 has a meaning of to mark something, to label it.
And so it's the simple concept we have of things.
There are things that we might see that we don't have any concept for.
We might not even have a word for them.
We say it's something, just something.
And some of these concepts are very fluid and changeable.
I have here this wonderful bowl to bell, and we call it a bell,
but if I didn't have any bowls to eat my breakfast with,
this would make a perfect bowl, rather than using it as a bell,
then it becomes a bowl, and becomes my breakfast bowl,
or my soup bowl or something.
Or it might be that I don't need the bell anymore,
but I have a lot of pens, and it becomes a pen holder,
and they stick in there, or it becomes some other holder.
What this object is, is changeable.
And it can be a flower pot, and we label it by its function often.
And so the concept we have, some things are functional,
and the function can change, and so the label changes.
And this points to the idea that the concepts are fluid and changeable,
and they're not absolute.
They are relative and provisional and situational.
And the same thing with our ideas of safety,
the ideas of well-being and happiness and suffering.
These ideas, as they appear as ideas as concepts, are simple concepts,
that then we get caught in and we get involved in associations
and complicated stories and ideas about them.
To be mindful of sanny훮, of these simple concepts,
I prefer to translate sanny훮 as concepts,
these simple concepts gives us the vantage point
to be wise about how we get swept away
in the more complicated ideas we have.
And so as practice deepens,
we start seeing that all the concepts we have,
in as concepts, as ideas, as the recognizing function of the mind,
is there very, very briefly.
And then it appears again and again.
So, like even if I say make up the sentence,
I am speaking words, then those words,
each of those is a concept.
I am speaking words.
Just like we can speed read,
and that all kind of blurs together into one large concept,
or one, you know, we understand the meaning overall.
But if we step back and see or feel or recognize
that each individuality of each of those words,
before we string them together
and make it into a larger meaning,
I am speaking words.
And there can't go around in ordinary life
paying attention to this kind of detail of concepts all the time.
It's just not efficient.
It's efficient to kind of string words together in a sentence
and just get the meaning right away.
But as meditation quiets and we become stiller and in meditation,
then there are times when we see the exquisite appearance of a concept.
Like sometimes at the end of meditation,
when I open my eyes,
before I have a concept, there's a seeing,
but there isn't quite the recognition.
There's a shape, a color, there's something.
Kind of briefly, and then I can feel or see or recognize
that my mind then makes a concept.
Without that, like right now, I'm looking at my laptop.
A laptop.
And that little gap between what I would call perception,
just kind of taking in the data, the sense data,
the sight objects without the concept,
and then recognizing the overlay of the concept on top of it.
So I might see a bell like this,
and as I pointed out, this doesn't have to be a bell,
it could be a bowl, it could be a pen holder,
it could be all kinds of things, flower pot.
And so because all those things are not inherent in the object,
it's possible to see the object without the label,
and then see the label arise.
And in the mind, the thought arise, bell.
And it can be exquisite to see that,
rather than just having it on an automatic pilot,
and see the brilliance of the mind that makes these concepts,
and see it arise without any clinging or holding on,
or grasping, or any kind of extra baggage,
just bell, bowl.
And so in deep meditation, in quiet, still meditation,
then this is where the exquisiteness gets more and more special,
where so many, we're down at the kind of primary,
primal kind of level of experience,
and we kind of see the arising, the beginning,
of this complicated world we live in,
but we're not seduced by the complicated world.
We're able to kind of see it as just the arising of a concept
that gives birth to other concepts and ideas,
and we can just stay there watching it appear,
and dissolve, and come, and go.
And it can be a little bit like, as delightful as,
sitting on the riverbank, watching the river go by,
maybe spending many long periods of time
just watching the flow of the current, little waves, the flow,
and it's just something very relaxing and nice to see that.
So the same thing is possible to see that current,
the river of concepts as they appear.
And in mindfulness practice, we're using a little bit
these concepts to help us stay present.
And that's the idea of a mental label.
We repeat the concept, maybe the original concept
is almost subconscious as it appears,
but then we use a mental note to recognize river,
if we're looking at the river, in as we're breathing in,
out as we're breathing out.
Warm, if we feel warm.
Restless, if we feel restness.
And it's a way of kind of using that little bit more
emphatic note, it's a little bit more intentional note.
It's a way of staying in the flow of the present moment,
being right there, being right there,
being right there with it,
letting it just flow and move through as it does.
So, and as we do so, we begin letting go of clinging.
And as we let go of clinging in a deeper and deeper way,
then at some point this flow of experience
doesn't get limited by the particular groupings
of the five aggregates, but rather it becomes,
because that itself is a concept.
Each of these five aggregates are concepts
that the mind has produced, which is what the Buddha says,
and that those concepts begin to dissolve
because they're secondary concepts,
they're more abstract concepts.
And they dissolve, and then at some point
the awareness doesn't become so selective,
one aspect of our experience, but it becomes more panoramic,
where awareness is just here and present in a panoramic way,
and we're just in the flow of experience
without grouping them into these five groups.
So, you might today, as you go about your day,
maybe see if you can notice the arising of concepts
and the provisional nature of them,
the fluid nature of them,
and what would sometimes say the empty nature of them,
or notice the opposite.
Notice how they seem as the concepts are so solid
and real and important, and it has to be this way,
what we add to it,
that to the simplicity of just these simple concepts
that appear in the mind.
So, thank you very much, and continue tomorrow.
