So continuing the exploration around feeling tone that we've been looking at the last week or so. 
This is continuing the exploration of the Buddha's instructions on mindfulness. 
This teaching, this discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness or the four establishments of mindfulness is probably the place where the most collected meditation instructions are offered in the suttas. 
So it's worth looking at and exploring. 
This is where the Buddha is kind of teaching us how do we attend to experience? How can we be present with what's happening? And how are we present with what's happening? Not just being aware of what's happening, but kind of the attitude in the mind. 
The instructions in the Satipa Tanasuta encourage us to be present in a way that is not reacting to what's happening, but it's just aware. 
Just aware of what's happening. 
So in the section on feeling, this exploration of feeling tone of that aspect of experience, not emotion per se, but a subtler and simpler aspect of experience, just whether experience is pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant. 
Every moment of experience, whether it's a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch or something happening in our minds, has this aspect of experience that's happening along with the sight, the sound, the smell, the taste, the touch or the emotion or the thought. 
There's associated with it is a feeling tone. 
It's pleasant, it's unpleasant, it's neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 
And usually, kind of based on habitual tendencies, habitual conditioning, we tend to like what is pleasant, want more of it, we lean into it. 
There's a kind of agreed that follows from pleasant. 
With unpleasant experience, we tend to not like it, we want to get rid of it, push it away, resist it, get frustrated, irritated, angry, a whole host of reactions that are in the aversive side of things could also be fear. 
So this is a very habitual way of responding to experience. 
And yet the teachings of the Buddha point to the possibility of just being able to be aware of the pleasant, unpleasant or neutral aspect of experience. 
And this instruction, this kind of curiosity about experience from this perspective of the pleasant, unpleasant neutral aspect is something that Buddha talked about a lot. 
It's all over the suttas in many different ways, many different places as a key way to help us to understand this patterning of reactivity, this patterning of why aversion and greed arise in the mind and how that keeps cycling us through struggle, suffering, stress. 
So it's a key, it's like a key in that cycle of reactivity. 
And the Buddha encourages us to notice like where does this whole cycle spring from? It springs from the pleasant, unpleasant or neutral aspect of experience. 
And yet this springing from the pleasant, unpleasant neutral aspect of experience is not the only way this is taught or explored because not only does reactivity spring from pleasant, unpleasant, neutral experience, then reactivity in turn tends to shape whether we then experience pleasant, unpleasant or neutral experience. 
So it becomes a cycle. 
So with reactivity, we, the texts talk about something called underlying tendencies. 
We could call that habitual patterns, the conditioned habits and patterns, something like that, that the underlying tendency towards aversion tends to underlie unpleasant experience, the underlying tendency. 
So the habit, the habit of aversion tends to underlie unpleasant experience. 
The habit of greed tends to underlie pleasant experience, tends to take us towards pleasant experience, tends to orient the mind towards finding pleasant experience. 
And so then the pattern continues. 
And so in the Satipa Tana Sutta, the instructions are really simple. 
They encourage us to come back to a very simple exploration of this area of experience, the feeling tone. 
And the text, I think I read this last time, but I'll just restate it, reread it. 
How does one abide observing feelings as feelings? When feeling a pleasant feeling, one understands, I feel a pleasant feeling. 
When feeling an unpleasant feeling, one understands, I feel an unpleasant feeling. 
When feeling a neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling when understands I feel I feel a neither pleasant nor unpleasant feeling. 
That's the first part of the instructions on this foundation this establishment of mindfulness of feeling So it encourages us to just recognize. 
Oh, this is a pleasant feeling. 
This is an unpleasant feeling with that That's the how the how to pay attention Not oh, there's a pleasant feeling. 
I need to hold on to it. 
Oh, there's an unpleasant feeling I need to get rid of it. 
But oh, this is a pleasant feeling One can be aware of that. 
This is an unpleasant feeling one can be aware of that and then one may also see a kind of a patterning that follows from that That often is what happens is we first start paying attention to pleasant unpleasant neutral We see that kind of leaning towards pleasant the resisting of unpleasant, but it also may Take us to the place where we see Oh, this is pleasant or this is unpleasant and we we can simply recognize the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the experience without the subsequent reactivity That's a very powerful realization. 
It's a powerful recognition How much of our suffering is not from the pleasant unpleasant neutral experience, but from the reactions to it? So the key or the key thing I'd like to speak about today is the conditioned nature of feeling Last week the question came up about talking about feelings and thoughts and how You know thoughts seem to really have a key Role in shaping what we feel That that idea about something being a certain thing really shaping whether we like it or not The idea about the idea and all of the whole history we have about something shaping whether it's we experience it as pleasant or unpleasant So um So feeling tone is conditioned in in multiple ways. 
I mean often we might think just to start just to start the the teachings point to how feeling tone is conditioned based on Kind of contact with our senses If we're not having if there's not a contact with the senses, so if our eyes are closed We may be seeing like like the colors and shapes behind the eye, but we're not seeing the objects in the room And so we're not having sight impinge on the eye So there's there's not the pleasant unpleasant neutral happening with respect to the seeing So so the pleasant unpleasant neutral is conditioned based on that contact based on the contact of of You know with our body with our eyes, you know the there's the eye there's sight and then there's these the contact there And there's a teaching that says the meeting of the three is contact and with contact one feels With contact is a conditioned feeling happens And so the the feeling arises Independence on contact. 
So there's a conditioned nature of feeling in that way That without the impingement, we're not going to have the feeling but we are continually, you know contacted by experience And with every contact there's a feeling tone So that's a way in which Feeling tones conditioned But the as I said a few minutes ago the there's this kind of underlying tendency or habitual pattern towards Habitual reactions to these feeling tones when it's pleasant we tend to like it lean into it want more of it Want to hold on to it that tends to condition us towards thinking that getting something that we want You know when we get that thing if we are leaning towards something pleasant We don't have it, but we're leaning towards it. 
Then we get it when we get that thing There tends to be a little hit of oh, I've got it in the mind, there's this sense of almost a kind of a sense of Of control sometimes that oh, I've got that thing. 
I figured out how to live my life I can I can get what I want and so with that comes a pleasant kind of experience and and it reinforces this notion that Getting what I want Is how I can feel okay How I can feel good So that patterning or likewise getting rid of what I don't want a very similar kind of control can happen A feeling of happiness can happen when we get rid of something we don't like So there's that That kind of sense of of control of I can figure I can figure this out. 
I've got it. 
I've That tends to feel pleasant With that pleasantness then comes the idea of that is how I can feel good This has been shaped so much in our experience this Pattern of get what I want. 
I feel good That means then I need to do more getting what I want in order to feel okay Get rid of what I don't want that makes me feel good. 
So I need to do more of that That tends to to lead us to looking for things to want looking for things to get rid of So that we can get that hit of oh, I feel good. 
I'm in control So this is a very deeply conditioned pattern in our in our experience and the um, the uh, I think in our prior to meeting the The buddhist teachings at least for me I thought that that was the way to happiness I can control my life if I can shape it if I can, you know, get rid of things I don't want get things that I want that is happiness that is as good as it gets Now I could see that it was kind of always falling apart in some ways And then continually needing to work to shape it to get those things get rid of those things But that was what my mind thought. 
Well, that's what that's what happiness is That that message is reinforced for us too. 
The the message of that's how happiness comes that message is reinforced in our culture and our conditioning But then we might meet the teachings of the buddha. 
We all have met these teachings of the buddha where he points to there's actually a deeper kind of happiness More sense of well-being that comes When we are not trying to Get what we want get rid of what we don't want in fact He says that that movement towards getting and getting rid of if we look at that if we look at that right there Look at that experience of leaning towards or pushing away from We don't usually look at that because we are so focused on the getting or the getting rid of And so focused on the future possibility that I'll be with that thing or without that thing that we are not touching into the experience of the wanting or the resistance itself The wanting and the resistance Are both unpleasant They both have an unpleasant quality when we actually start to look at them And so this this is also a way in which this cycle is reinforced because When we get something that we well, let's let's talk about getting rid of something we don't like. 
So there's the unpleasant thing there's the The unpleasantness of the of the aversion and then when we if we actually succeed in getting rid of that thing we end up with the With the The release from the unpleasantness of the aversion along with the release from the unpleasantness of the Of the being with the unpleasant thing that we were trying to get rid of And so that kind of reinforces again, this is the way to happiness With pleasant experience if we're going for pleasant experience Again, they release from the wanting. 
You know, we get the thing. 
There's some measure of happiness in the getting but in my own exploration of Of wanting one thing I've discovered is that When the wanting let's go, you know being curious about the wanting itself the release from the wanting is very pleasant It is it's like being released from a vice grip and it's a different kind of pleasantness so the the The the movement of wanting and getting when we get something We get not only the the pleasantness of the having but we also get the pleasantness that the wanting has gone away for a little while And in my in my practice, I've found that that release that release from the wanting is actually The bigger part of what we go for It's it's it's the it's the the stronger pleasantness actually the release from that wanting and what we end up getting trapped into is Looking for something to want in order to be released from the wanting It sounds like craziness The Buddha pointed to from his experience He looked at his mind and saw this pattern and and you know began to be curious about it And began to realize that in order to have that release from the wanting. 
It's not necessary to get the thing The wanting can release without our getting that thing and that's where he said the deeper that was the kind of the the Direction the direction towards happiness that he really began to explore And so this patterning of this cycle It's described in a couple of different ways. 
It's described in the teaching of dependent origination which I've just described in a kind of this Very general way that pattern Something something impinges our senses There's The feeling of it then there's the movement of liking of not liking There's the perhaps the getting the sense of I've got it the control that would be the kind of sense of I figured it out that feels good, but then because of the nature of of the The impermanent nature of experience that whole thing tends to fall apart and then we're back in a place of looking for well How did I feel good last time? It was when I got something I wanted or got rid of something that I didn't want and so the cycle starts again another place that this is talked about is a teaching called the honey ball sutta where It's kind of a description of how In a very detailed level um We respond to experience so, um I'll Read a little section of this This teaching goes through, um Each of the six senses Sight sound smell taste touch and the mind and describes the same pattern With respect to all of these six senses, but we'll just look at it with respect to the eye right now to seeing Based on the eye and forms so the eye and Stuff in the world and the the light That's available based on the eye and forms Eye consciousness arises The meaning of the three of eye forms eye consciousness Is contact? That's that okay. 
That's that kind of impingement on a sense the meaning of the three is contact With contact as conditioned there is feeling so there's an impingement on the eye and there is the um um Experience of it being pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant or unpleasant What one feels That one perceives So we we have and those those are said to arise together seeing and or the feeling and the perception Come together so we both get a sense of its pleasant unpleasant or neutral and we perceive it In some fashion we perceive it There's there's many layers of perception at first it might just be the perception of form and color and then it might kind of um Our minds do this very quickly from form and color into some object a couch a wall a light And then um, you know, so there's that perception. 
There's a perception of what it is What one perceives That one thinks about And so we we perceive something we recognize it this this process again. 
This is a natural process This isn't something we have to do. 
This is something our human system does Because we've been in the world there's been this conditioning we've Been in communities. 
We've been in cultures. 
We've learned that that thing is a couch that that thing is a light We've learned we've learned this This learning process is not something we do. 
It's a natural unfolding and so there's this perception With feeling there's perception What one perceives that one thinks about so? Oh, that's a that's a lamp What kind of a lamp is it or you know? Oh, that's an animal. 
What kind of an animal is it? Oh, it's a cat Oh, I like cats. 
We start thinking about what we perceive. 
So this is coming into that that part of the That cycle of conditioning that I was talking about that loops back on itself so we we start thinking about Whatever we perceive What one thinks about the next piece of this That one mentally proliferates now this this piece is um is a Kind of like maybe where our minds start to go a little crazy That one way we think about this is like a proliferation of thought around something But it also can be simpler. 
It can be just kind of like a reification Like that is a thing separate from me that proliferation or that Pappancha is the term here Pappancha can be thought of as a proliferation of lots of thought about a thing But kind of the foundational piece of that proliferation of thought is a separation between me and The thing that I'm perceiving That there's that separation a sense of me and that thing So based on this this and again this happens very Naturally this happens very it's very conditioned in us for this to happen What one with what one has mentally proliferated as the source now this sentence is complicated But I'll unpack it with what one has mentally proliferated as the source Perceptions and notions born of mental proliferation beset one with respect to past present and future forms cognizable by the eye And to me what that essentially means is because we proliferate Because we like take Take something and so let's take something like a pain in the knee, you know, there's a pain in the knee and there's the kind of the recognition of Unpleasantness and me and then there's thinking about it. 
That's my knee. 
That is The knee that I use to walk with and oh dear, this is a problem Um, you know, what's happened to my knee and am I going to be able to walk and oh, maybe there's something wrong with my knee? And maybe I need to go to the doctor So the mind can really in a very short time the mind can pick that up and proliferate with it Then what this teaching says is based on that Based on that mental proliferation What we Um, what we see what we hear what we sense what we cognize Is shaped by that So if you have that this so this is essentially another way of describing that reactivity kind of arising So based on all of those thoughts a a reactivity could arise like fear or anxiety And based on that fear or anxiety we tend to then Meet our world through that lens of fear and anxiety It tends to shape future experience of pleasant unpleasant or neutral in this case when we are caught in a A cycle of anxiety or anger our minds tend to Orient to Kind of fixing controlling And potentially could orient to unpleasant That anxiety itself is unpleasant and that tends to shape the feeling of Of other things being unpleasant. 
I've definitely experienced this that when my mind is kind of agitated in anxiety, it's like it it It's kind of like looking for things to To figure out how do I fix this? How do I change this? How do I how do I navigate this? So it tends to orient to what's wrong to what is perceived as unpleasant So this is one way that the thought cycle Tends to shape our It shapes our emotions and that tends to also shape our Our feeling tone So this pattern this patterning can happen Now another maybe less Emotional version of this kind of Of shaping a feeling tone can happen Through views And this may be more where the question was coming from Last week You know what our views are about things? So there's a teaching This is not a suit to base teaching, but it's in the The commentaries and the abhidhamma actually it's in the section of the abhidhamma The section of the abhidhamma, which isn't this isn't understood to be the teaching of the buddha, but is later And the abhidhamma points to with respect to feeling tone that The um of the five physical sense senses touch sight smell taste and hearing So of those five physical senses That the touch sense is very attuned to pleasant unpleasant And in fact, I think that the abhidhamma says That the the physical touch sense will either be pleasant or unpleasant It may be a subtle version of that, but there's the pleasant unpleasant is is at the physical, you know the contact of the skin That will be pleasant or unpleasant However, for the other four senses sight smell taste and hearing The abhidhamma says that the very first moment of contact Just that sound The sound wave hitting the ear Just the Light waves striking the eye Just the um flavor The flavor impacting the tongue The the the pointing to kind of the bare experience of that with sight Form and color is what the eye sees pitch and tone is what the ear hears Bitter salty sweet sour is what the tongue tastes And in in of itself the abhidhamma says The first contact point With those four physical senses is neutral And that any sense of a sight being pleasant or unpleasant Is actually the result of a mental construction It is based on The formation of it so there's the perception there also right so there's the perception of what it is um So there's the the first kind of the bare Contact is just going to be form and color The process of recognizing what it is is mental So that I recognize that it's a lamp that lamp is actually in the mind You know the my experience of lamp is in the mind and my um my relationship to lamp my relationship to particular You know appreciation of certain you know Shapes of lamps or how much light they give off whatever whatever various things I might have I might look at one lamp and say that one's a pleasant lamp And I might look at another one and say no that one's not pleasant Maybe I like the color of one. 
Maybe I prefer earth tones and In my in my environment and if like somebody brought in a bright, you know, orange and purple lamp I might think that was unpleasant But that pleasant or unpleasant the abhidhamma says is based on ideas It's based on views. 
It's based on thoughts essentially and so um, you know, there can be there can be with the The physical sense that you know, like if we cut ourselves with a knife, for instance Our our physical sense is designed to like warn us that's dangerous That's harmful to the body take care of it. 
And so there's an unpleasantness with that You know, there's an actual unpleasant feeling with that but with respect to these other senses The abhidhamma at least says that that that is the first impingement is neutral and that any sense of pleasant or unpleasant is A mental pleasant or unpleasant experience not a physical pleasant or unpleasant feeling It's based on the thought or the view or the idea the pleasant or unpleasant not the The thing itself So this is another way that feeling tone is shaped And how sometimes we might experience something as pleasant some sensation as pleasant In one context And how we might experience it as unpleasant in another context Last week I talked about that study of of um Using shocks To test pleasant unpleasant and the um, you know the the kind of Shocking people with a kind of a moderate shock or no shock people responded that the The the moderate shock was unpleasant, but then if there was a another situation where there was a moderate shock Or a very strong shock And they were told beforehand which shock they were getting when they were told the moderate shock was coming and they experienced the moderate shock They experienced it as pleasant not only based on their reports, but based on their brain activity They experienced it as pleasant So based on context in the condition of either getting a moderate shock or or a strong shock If those are your two options the moderate shock was experienced as pleasant So this is this is again, so this is view. 
This is idea. 
This is understanding. 
This is this is context So a thought the thought that this is moderate This is going to be a moderate shock. 
This is going to be a painful shock that thought shaped How the feeling was experienced So this happens a lot now that may not seem like a lot of emotional reaction, right? I mean it's more it's more just view It's like oh, this one's going to be stronger. 
This one's going to be weaker That kind of belief or view. 
This is this is pappancha doing this too. 
This is this is the The proliferation of mind the the mind kind of picking up context picking up picking up views and ideas and overlaying them on our experience So this is a this is a big way that Feeling tone is shaped and in my own experience. 
I find one very useful exploration is to kind of be curious about What is the feeling tone when there is reactivity? You know, so so we may notice that there's reactivity before we actually notice what the feeling tone is We may notice there's reactivity and think we know what we're reacting to You know, we may we may say we know that That lamp is what I'm reacting to or you know, whatever but What can be interesting is to kind of be curious about okay, there's a reaction here. 
There's not liking here What is actually the unpleasant thing the unpleasantness that this mind is responding to? Very very often That response to unpleasant sometimes it can be the the actual unpleasantness of the physical sensation for instance But very very often the reaction is not to the physical sight sounds, mouth tastes touch, but is to what our mind has made of it It is to The ideas connected with it the views the beliefs the history that's connected to it For myself. 
I found it very useful to notice that One time I was I think I told this story last time doing some walking meditation and Somebody came up next to me and pretty close in the hall. 
The hall was pretty full The walking hall was pretty full and somebody kind of squeezed in and everybody kind of adjusted and felt like we were pretty close together and aversion arose And I didn't quite understand what the aversion was about You know where what the unpleasantness was that the aversion was reacting to So I went through all the senses The person didn't particularly look unpleasant The they weren't touching me. 
So it wasn't physical unpleasant. 
There was no smell. 
It wasn't smell So I went through all the physical senses and didn't see any Unpleasantness and and I thought well, there must be something in the mind I thought well, there must be something in the mind. 
There must be some idea in the mind that this Unpleasantness is connected to and I continued walking and finally I saw this thought come up That person is weird That person is weird and my justification for that I saw was that that that they were they had bare feet and it was December it was freezing cold And this whole kind of aversion to this person was based on a thought in my mind And what I saw them at that point was like my goodness this whole aversive reaction is a construct in the mind The mind isn't reacting to any actual experience what it's reacting to is a thought and an idea and in seeing that And seeing that the reaction was constructed out of an idea That whole pattern fell apart And in the next moments there was meta for the person There was no Unpleasant experience. 
There was no aversion. 
I definitely saw that that thought that person is weird was unpleasant That was where the unpleasantness was coming from that was the reaction And so in terms of looking at Feeling tone, this is a really useful exploration Is it what we think what we think we're reacting to what we think of as pleasant or unpleasant? It might not be that actually that we're reacting to Very often it's the thoughts the ideas in the mind So That's questions Let me see if I have everybody allowing to unmute themselves so if anybody wants to Yeah, Olga So a couple of things um So basically, I mean Bayden is created in the mind It is a mental experience as well, right? I mean that's right even the mind is advocating that correct Yes, I mean that's always that has been my understanding yes, um and that clearly The pleasant unpleasant neutral is not Intrinsic into any object. 
Yes, and and those fabrications arise out of Our own conditioning. 
Yes and I I wanted to clarify something you said which was The way I understood it was that You said when unpleasant is in the mind and we think When unpleasant is in the mind We will the mind will Create objects to be unpleasant When a version when a version is present in the mind. 
Okay, so it has to take the unpleasant Into the aversion. 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Yeah, it makes sense. 
Yeah, so when there's aversion present present in the mind That will tend to take us towards Just kind of taking towards unpleasant, right? I might have said it. 
I might have said it incorrectly. 
I could I possible I said no, I don't think you did I I when you said it it was like, huh so it's like if If I if I'm walking around with some maybe unseen aversion In my house say and I'm doing something and then I turn towards something and All of a sudden I'm feeling that aversion. 
I'm aware of the aversion. 
I'm Realizing that there's a lot of unpleasantness It may have nothing to do with the object. 
I'm making contact with at that moment. 
Exactly. 
Okay. 
Yes Yes, and that's that's why it's so useful to go back to what is the actual right? Oh, I've noticed that. 
Yeah. 
I mean, it's like even having aversion and then turning to relate to somebody and realizing That you're feeling sort of nasty You know, and it's like wait this person has not Done anything to generate this nastiness So what is the nastiness? about Okay, so I understand that and the latin the other thing was you were talking about a eye consciousness and contact and you were talking about with our closed eyes We really reduce the eye contact when we're meditating I happen to be a person who does a lot of visualizing And when papancha arises especially if I'm if I fall into a a hole with papancha and I'm You know unaware There's frequently a lot of There's a movie, right? So those images are mental Right. 
So that's my that's contact with mind door not eye door Okay, so It's really not accurate to Understand that as seeing right Okay, although I do find it useful at times to Use that kind of you know to know to to kind of like if I'm seeing a lot of images thoughts as images I will use seeing as a kind of a noticing of this thought is happening through that sense door, you know through that through that Kind of route Although I know it's not actual seeing, you know, so it's so that's that's just a use of that You know, I do find it useful sometimes to kind of touch into what's the modality of the thought You know, sometimes they can come as like physicality like you're doing something Sometimes it can come as sight sometimes is sound and sometimes it can be useful to to recognize the thought in those terms But understanding it's not actually the sense that's involved. 
It's it's strictly mind. 
You're noticing something of the mind Yeah, I frequently use imagining. 
Yeah imagine, you know a kind of way of Knowing yeah, what's going on. 
Yeah, uh, which which kind of set which kind of Of discerns it from hearing a real sound Yes, or real Real as in I could go over and touch it as opposed to just imagine it. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Okay. 
Yeah, that's it. 
Thank you great So there was a question that came into the chat box But we're out of time. 
So I'll pick this one up next week Um And actually I think it actually fits in More with the topic next week, which is the the um the next aspect of the suta Which points to the worldly and unworldly Feeling tones and so there are certain feeling tones that arise Pleasant feeling tones that are part of the path and the question kind of points to that a little bit You know when feelings of well-being simplicity serenity wisdom arise, you know Those can have a pleasant quality to them and that's actually part of the path So what about wanting those so that's that's the question and we'll we'll talk about that Um some next week.
