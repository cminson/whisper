 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Okay, beautiful. So hello, hello and welcome everyone to happy hour. So happy to see you. So for tonight's guided meditation, I'd like to invite us to explore the marriage of metta, or love, with wisdom. Love plus wisdom equals equanimity. Equanimity is a practice where the brahma vihara is the cultivations of the heart, kindness, compassion, joy for joy of others, meets wisdom. In fact, all the brahma viharas need the factor of wisdom to be balanced, not to veer into the extremes for say compassion, not to become just agony and pain, just feeling the pain of others without the sense of balance. Or say, wisdom is needed so that metta or love doesn't become attachment or grasping. Oh, I'm going to wish you well so that you're going to really be well. Okay, are you well yet? I've been wishing you well for five minutes, or the attachment of I'm going to love you so you love me. So wisdom supports the balance of all these practices of the heart and really the fourth brahma vihara. So the four brahma viharas, just as a review, the four of them as you know them already, four practices of the heart, the first one being metta, loving kindness, second one being compassion, karuna, third one being vuddhita, vicarious joy, happiness or happiness of others, the fourth one being equanimity. Really equanimity is where wisdom, the sense of clarity, not veering into neither falling into nor with attachment, nor pushing away with aversion. So equipoise equanimity is where wisdom of being with things as they are becomes to full fruition with care with metta with care. Because if equanimity didn't have care in it, it would become aloofness, it would become like, Oh, yeah, things are as they are, whatever, I don't even care. But that's not equanimity, that's aloofness. And sometimes we can confuse many of us actually do confuse aloofness like, Oh, yeah, I'm just being quantum, so whatever, which also can be spiritual bypass. Watch out for that in your practice with true equanimity, which which holds with make space for things as they are. So if there are questions that have come up, it's okay, please sit with the questions. As you all know, we'll have time for reflections and questions later. But I think that's enough for setting the stage for what I want to say. And let's just practice together as I'll have invitations for us to explore this space together. So let us begin. Let us land. In our bodies, and if you need to move at this point, either move your body so that you find comfortable position, rolling your shoulders back or need to move from your chair to your cushion. Really taking care of the body. What does the body need right now? To sit comfortably with a sense of a brightness. Or if you're lying down with a sense of integrity, could be standing up to not a problem. See if that is what your body needs. Ah, and softening, relaxing. Letting go. Letting go. Letting go of the shoulders. Letting go of the holding tightness in your back. Hightness in your forehead, in your jaw. Hightness in your chest. Hightness in your abdomen. Any tension in the sit bones and the legs. Feeling grounded, connected to the earth. With your feet, your sit bones. And releasing, releasing thoughts. All that has come before so much has happened today already. Or might be happening later today. Letting go of planning mind, remembering mind. No problem. They are helpful but not right now. Not right now. Thank you. Not right now. I am got it not now. I am meeting withminute my Denlecting body. Let the breath move through the body. Let attention, let awareness connect with the breath. Let every breath come to you. The entire day of the breath, the entire day of the in-breath and the out-breath. Let each breath empty you. Empty, empty, empty, empty. Not with force, not fighting content, not with force, not fighting content, not with Fighting content But your devotion with your devotion to loving the breath just this breath loving it Notice devotion to this breath can empty you Without you trying to empty it just happens through loving Feeling devoted to this breatharca you Letting go. Lovingly. Thank you, not now. I'm giving my heart to this practice right now. I'm giving my complete heart, my devotion. Just being present in this moment with this breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you Can you imagine that each breath is calming you, is this elixir. That is calming and settling you. Maybe with each breath there is more space in your heart. As if your body were a fluffy cloud with each breath. Feeling more space. And your heart and your body and your mind. And all of your body. Upper body, lower body too. Feeling lighter. More porous. Breath, thin breaths, out breath, don't need to be effortful. Let them happen on their own. Thank you. And if thoughts arise, let them be light like a helium balloon. Can they float away right now? Without a trace, only lightness. Space remaining. And maybe with this breath and with each breath. Maybe there is a whisper, it's okay, it's okay. A sense of expansiveness of it's okay. Whatever there is here or there isn't, it's okay. The wisdom of it's okay. A perspective that's wise and wide. Wide as the whole sky, spacious. It can hold everything, spaciously. The body, the mind, the heart. It's okay. It doesn't push away, it doesn't turn away with aversion. It's not scared. It's not intimidating, but it's so spacious. Yeah, this too, this too, yes, this too. It's okay. It's okay. Thank you. We get a thoughts arise, it's okay. Let them be a light helium balloon floating in this vast sky. Vast kind sky of the heart of the mind. Let there be kindness. A sense of presence with everything that arises and passes. Wisdom of spaciousness, a wise, a wide perspective. Grander, grander than our usual limited vision. That can get fixated, tight, unbalanced, unmoored. There is so much more that our vision or perspective can hold. With a huge breath, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Notice it's okay is kind, it's not aloof, it's kind. Same way that maybe if a child is upset, the parent caretaker has a wise and wide perspective that this is not the end of the world. It's okay, it's really okay. And yet caring, so caring, it's okay, it's okay. Wide and warm. Whatever is arising, whether a thought, sadness, an emotion, something in the body, it's okay. Stay with it with kindness. The wise perspective. Thank you. Even if something comes up that you don't like. Can you hold the not liking, the aversion with equanimity? The aversion can be the child that is upset. I don't want to. Can you have equanimity? Spaciousness with the aversion, with the resistance. Let it be held wisely, widely, with care. Not believing it, falling into it, not resisting it. Not adding more aversion to aversion. It's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The simple equanimity of it's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Whatever arises, can it be okay? If it's boredom, can you meet it in this wide sky of the heart and the mind? It's okay to be bored. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay to be burned up by it. It's not to be bothered by it. Simply aware, simply knowing. It's okay. It's all okay. It's okay. It's not applied. It's okay to make something go away. It's okay to make it disappear. No, to make more space with equipoise can be just as it is. Just as it is. By being, making space to be with what arises just as it is. We cultivate more strength in our heart, more courage, more stability, more care, not turning away, distracting ourselves. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your shatter. Makearems. Pure refreshments. mind like the sky, heart like the sky, expansive, spacious. For whatever arose or did not arise in this practice period, it's okay. We've done our best, we've showed up. Trusting, trusting that we're planting seeds of stability, of care, with every moment of staying and turning towards. May all beings everywhere, including ourselves, have the wisdom, spaciousness, care of equanimity in their lives to support them, the jewel of equanimity. May all beings everywhere, including ourselves, be free. Thanks everyone, thanks for your practice. Well, I feel more equanimous, I don't know about you. I feel more calm and peaceful and spacious. So we have a few minutes and I hope in chat you're welcome to raise your hand, your zoom hand, because if it's your physical hand I won't see you, many of us. If you want to share a report of the field practice of what arose for you initially. I think actually you're one of the only people I do see in the small strip and I do see your hand, so please. Yeah, I was feeling a lot of fear about an issue in my life and so to hold that with care and compassion is just saying, oh it's okay, it's okay to feel this. I'm making space for this. So my question is, I'm not clear on how to hold an intense emotion with care. Yeah, yeah, that's a very good question. So I'm gonna borrow a page from Gil's book for a moment because what he likes to say, and I love the saying the way he puts it, he often says, let your fear feel safe, let your fear feel safe. So the idea is similar here that you are, when we have a strong emotion and you brought up fear, so let's talk about fear, there could be any other emotion, fear. And when it arises, there is a sense of feeling seized up, it's all there is. The entire visual field, if there was a visual field, the entire field of knowing, it's like it becomes contracted, that's all there is. It's not that the fear is so great, it's not that, it's that our space of knowing has contracted, right? So that's all we get to know, it's like, oh my god, this is so overwhelming, what's gonna happen? Ah, what am I gonna do? What are they gonna do? That's all we perceive, right? Especially with fear and with other emotions. So instead with this practice, what I was pointing to is to first open up, have a sense of spaciousness in the field of knowing, oh yeah, the breath, oh yeah, first you stabilize, yes, you stabilize, you expand the field of knowing. And then, oh yes, there is fear, the fear is coming up. But fear is, in a way, it's been cut to size. It's not, it doesn't capture everything, oh yeah, in my life there's also joy, there's also care, there's also love, there's also this, there's also gratitude, like there are all these things, oh yeah, and fear is there too. Okay, all right, fear, there's a lot of space to hold you, and I'm not going to push you away because it's okay, you can be here, yeah, it's all right. Gratitude can be here, fear can be here too, and that actually, that sense of care, that sense of spaciousness and care, it changes our relationship to fear. Fear might still be there, it may go away, it may not, but we're not doing this practice to make the fear go away. That is really important, we're not doing this practice to make the fear or anything else go away, it's a shift in perspective, and the fear can still be there, but it doesn't scare you anymore. It comes really interesting, does that make sense? Do you know what I'm talking about? Yes, I see, yeah, and you're welcome to unmute or not, it's all good. Thank you, yes, that's very clear and helpful, thank you so much. You're so welcome, thank you. Yeah, any other questions, reflections, of what came up for you? Reports from the field, Sarah, there. Hi, everyone, hi, Sangha. So I've been dwelling on this question for a couple of days, and it's because I'm a first-year teacher this year within a middle school, and I have been noticing some very immense gaps from between who I think I am with my loving-kindness practice and out in the world, and then in the classroom when I lose my patience and I get upset and I do things that I look back and I'm like, how could I have done that? That's not me at all, and I'm kind of struggling with this perceived gap of the heart that I know that I have when I sit and when I'm not in stressful situations, and then when I am in these very new situations. So I was wondering if you could comment on that a little bit, those gaps in being out in the world and this perceived self that I have. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you, Sarah, thank you so much for that question. And the beauty and the vulnerability of that question, because it's not just you, this is the human condition, right? This is us, right? We have this intention, which is beautiful. I hear what you're sharing, kindness, goodness, and when you're in a very stressful situation and being a first-year teacher, I can only imagine how difficult the situation must be with youngsters. So various things, various invitations here. So one is first to have instead of, you didn't say this, but just to say not to self-flagellate when there's a sense of, how could I do that? Oh my goodness, I raised my voice and I lost, like, oh my God, that is not helpful. Instead, oh sweetheart, you must have been really stressed. Okay, yeah, this was hard. This was really hard for you. This was really hard for you because that, if you self-flagellate, if you kick yourself, it becomes harder. That gap, acknowledging that gap becomes harder and also doing something to support it becomes harder, but with self-compassion, actually you take more responsibility, just as you have, because there is the sense of care. Like, yeah, this was hard. Like, that was a hard day. My goodness, that was a hard day. I was hungry, my blood sugar was low, and that kid was screaming, and the other one was like, oh sweetheart, that was really hard. Okay, all right. Well, it's good that you didn't scream twice. You just screamed once. Okay, let's just say, right? So, starting there, and then it might be after the fact, when you think about the day, after you hold yourself with a lot of kindness and forgiveness, okay, sweetheart, I have this intention and yeah, this is what happened. It's okay, it's all right, I'm doing my best. If it could have been any different, it would have been, I'm learning. Okay, settled, that's number one, and it's huge. It's really huge to have that container, really set the container of self-compassion first, number one. Number two, think, okay, what happened? Again, with self-compassion, okay, what happened? All right, the height of intention, oh wait, was I hungry? Was I stressed? Was that just like, what was going on? Like, try to get a sense of, oh, these are the situations that really press my buttons. Okay, so what can I do? So then, when it arises, maybe you recognize it not after, first maybe you recognize it after two hours, then you recognize it after one hour, then you recognize it after 30 minutes, then five minutes, then at some point, you will recognize it while it's happening. Oh, here it is, my buttons are being pushed, and also with mindfulness of the body. That's another thing that you need to strengthen with your practice. Really be aware, because so that before you get to that boiling point, there is a sense of, okay, I'm going over the edge, okay, I know what the signals are, my heart starts, you know, my heart starts to raise, and my palms start to start, or whatever it is for you, you get to know it before it happens. Like, all right, this is time to say timeout, like, okay, put your heads on the desk, nap time, or whatever it is, I need time out, right? So it can happen little by little, but it'll take time. And you're not bad, you're not wrong, just this is a stressful situation you're learning. And you'll come through more compassionate and kinder through the other side, on the other side, Sarah, thanks so much for the question. Yeah. So, so the time has come for us to turn our attention to practicing together, care with kindness, with equanimity in small groups, breakout groups of size, roughly three. And the invitation is to share maybe just one nugget about what, what supports you to have equanimity, what supports you and what actually challenges you to have equanimity. So inspired by the question that Sarah brought in, what supports you and what challenges you? So maybe you go around once, maybe you talk about what challenges you, let's talk about what challenges you first. And then maybe go around one more time and talk about what supports you. So, and each person will just say one nugget and you'll go around and round a few times, hopefully. So I am going to create the rooms. Hold on one second, I'm in trouble. Okay, rooms are created. Okay, so take care of each other. Take care of yourselves. And here we go. Okay, the rooms are closed, everybody's back. We have, well, we don't really have any time unless there is a burning reflection or question just to squeeze in very quickly at the end. Yeah. And somebody typed me a question, a type of question. Jerry, I'll stay and answer afterwards. So let's, let's close. Let's close. Thank you all for your practice, for showing up, for cultivating kindness and wisdom, equanimity for all beings everywhere. May all things be happy. May all things be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Take good care. Stop the.
