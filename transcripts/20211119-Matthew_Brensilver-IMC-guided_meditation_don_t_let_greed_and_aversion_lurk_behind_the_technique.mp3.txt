 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning. It's good to be with you. Just watching the chat on the side of my screen. Yeah, welcome. Welcome to you all. So, generally I've practiced in a very technique-oriented way. And that's been of profound benefit and lean on meditation technique often. And strikes me that sometimes the urge to reach for technique means that greed or aversion has already taken hold. Yeah, in the background, the urge to find technique sometimes is an expression of our reticence to meet the clinging already present. Now sometimes technique is the best way of meeting it. But we want to be a little wary, I feel, about using technique to defend against the wildness of our heart and mind. And so I just plant this seed as I will proceed to teach technique, but I plant this seed so that we have some appreciation of the subtleties of the movement towards technique. And it's helpful in a way not to recapitulate the clinging in our practice. A little subtle, but to consider. So, let's practice. So, just all at once, the awareness can arrive. Just affirming your aspirations for practice. Summoning some measure of courage actually takes a lot of courage to truly meet the intensity of the human condition. So, bringing attention to the sensations of breathing, wherever they're felt most clearly, wherever that is, just rest the attention in a simple way there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Feeling the some precision when the inhale begins and when the exhale begins and ends. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we settle, there's less and less light that escapes to other phenomena. The breath is illuminated. Everything else is enveloped in darkness. But that's not how it usually is. The throb of worry and concern. Preoccupation and strategizing. All of this wants to share the attentional light. Your thinking is the kind of top layer of that top geological stratum. But beneath it is affect, feeling. The body under conditions of threat and opportunity. And so when the attention moves away, when that light begins to leak away from the sensations of breathing, let's see if you can make a perfect peace with affect, with feeling. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Some ways the breath attending to the breathing, this gentle, precise way, it's shelter from the storm, but in order to feel like shelter, we need to have made peace with the storm. To attend to the breathing is to release the grip on the rest of phenomena. To put down covetousness and displeasure with respect to the world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
