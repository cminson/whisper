Welcome back to IMC, Donald.
Thanks very much. I am pleased to be here again to see a number of familiar faces
and some people whom I don't believe I've met yet.
So I wanted to talk this morning more generally on the theme of the spiritual journey
and the phases of that journey, really how we can see our lives.
I want to do so in a way which I hope can energize and inspire us to give some perspective,
perhaps to have us understand maybe in a different perspective some of the experiences of our lives.
I was inspired to explore this theme in part by helping to teach the two-month retreat at Spirit Rock.
I was one of the teachers for March and reflected a lot on some of the larger patterns of spiritual practice.
So what I want to do today is to really look at that theme of the spiritual journey with three main reference points.
One of them is a poem that I want to read probably at the beginning and also I think at the end.
A poem by Mary Oliver called The Journey. Some of you know this poem. It's a wonderful poem.
I was thinking of making copies for everyone but I thought it might be more efficient to let you use Google,
especially because of the locale.
So the first reference point is this poem which I'll read in a moment.
The second reference point is each of our lives and our own sense of the kind of journey that each of us is carrying out really.
And the third reference point is The Journey of the Buddha, the historical journey of the Buddha, which when we look at it actually is a little less path,
a little less easy than we find in some of the stories.
And in reflecting the life of the Buddha, I was particularly inspired by one of my colleagues' talks at the March retreat,
which was particularly focused on the life of the Buddha.
And I also refer you to that talk which is on Dharmasid on the web, talked by Larry Yang.
I think it'll be his last talk for March if you want to look that up. So I was also quite inspired by that.
And for those of you not familiar with the life story of the Buddha, I just want to give a very short version of it.
You know that the Buddha was born into a royal family.
He was a prince. He was protected. His parents received a prophecy that he would either be a great sage or a great ruler.
And they were invested in the second outcome. And so they protected him.
And there are lines in some of the texts where the Buddha says, I was most delicately brought up.
He was protected and not permitted to see any sign of difficulty or suffering.
There was comfort all around. And many of you know that at a certain point he had some curiosity about life beyond the palace.
You can take that as a metaphor. I'll explore that later.
And he went outside the palace and so the story goes on successive nights. He came in contact with an old person, a sick person, a corpse, and a wandering mendicant or yogi.
And that really encounter with difficulty or suffering shook him to his core.
And he resolved to leave his protected environment in search of spiritual truth. He went on the search for six years which had many ups and downs.
It was not some easy process. And eventually very much came to his own path really to find this truth.
He had an awakening, a powerful awakening. And then sometime after the awakening decided to bring it back to the world and to teach which he taught for 45 years and affected the course of history.
And of course there are many other beings who have some parallel stories.
There are many lives of many figures who have had really a similar kind of search or have battled difficulties and come to some kind of awakening or breakthrough.
So that's what I want to explore. I hope to finish with some time for discussions. One of my favorite aspects of teaching is to connect with people.
I teach right at 10.45. So I'll have to do the entirety of the spiritual journey in about half an hour if we want to have some discussion.
So here's the poem, first of all. The Journey by Mary Oliver.
One day you finally knew what you had to do and began. Though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice.
Though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles.
Men to my life each voice cried. But you didn't stop. You knew what you had to do. Though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations.
Though their melancholy was terrible. It was already late enough and a wild night and the road full of fallen branches and stones.
But little by little as you left their voices behind the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds.
And there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own that kept you company as you drove deeper and deeper into the world.
Determined to do the only thing you could do determined to save the only life you could save.
So I'll explore this theme of the spiritual journey in part by coming back and referring to the poem and to particular lines in the poem.
I wanted to say first just a little bit about the idea of the journey. It's a metaphor.
It's very commonly used that we're on a kind of a journey. It's very similar in a sense to the metaphor of the path.
You know that there's a sense that we're walking. We're in movement. We are going down a road.
We are in a sense looking for something. We are going in some direction.
And of course a path is a little more of a clearer journey we might say because many of our journeys we don't know where we're going.
In some sense our life is sometimes like a journey and we don't quite know where we're going.
Or sometimes we don't know where we're going and something happens and we learn where we're going.
Or I was remembering what is that famous line by Yogi Berra who says something like you think I'm forgetting it.
Anyone remember that?
I think I've got it. When you come to a fork in the road take it.
I think as he said something else also if you don't know where you're going you might not get there.
So the journey is a powerful metaphor and the path again very common metaphor but it's a sense of walking, a sense of movement.
And path is I think a little more distinct because it has a sense that there's been a kind of a clearing.
We can walk on a path. Maybe we have a sense of the underbrush or the difficulties or the obstacles have been cleared some and we can walk.
So a path is a little more, the movement is a little clearer. We're often in a particular direction.
And yet we do it really in a sense step by step, the very word for path in the Buddhist text.
Some of you know this text called the Dhammapada.
The word pod is we have the same root in Indo-European languages refers to the foot like a podiatrist.
So the pod is the word for path and it's something we do by walking.
It's really step by step in a sense moment by moment.
So it's a beautiful metaphor that we're on a journey. We don't always know where we're going but sometimes we do, sometimes the path becomes clearer.
And so I think the poem and the life of the Buddha really bring out a few phases of our paths.
And I want to refer to those phases.
The first we might call, this is really about the bad advice that we, the first phase is when we have a certain kind of discontent with the way things are.
Maybe there's a certain kind of suffering or difficulty and that comes up in our life.
A second phase is when we hear the call to something different.
We hear maybe an internal voice that says, let me move away from the familiar conditioning.
And then a third phase is we might say we leave, we depart, we move out from the familiar in certain ways.
And then a fourth phase really in a sense, the heart of it is where we go through the process, the ups and downs of coming to greater awakening.
We might say we go through a certain difficulty, we go through a certain struggle and we come towards that greater awakening.
And then the fifth phase is that we return in a sense to our lives, to the world.
I think all of those are right there in the poem.
So first there's the sense of the bad advice.
It's one day you finally knew what you had to do and began though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice.
And I think this is about our conditioning.
It's our forms of suffering.
We look at that in our meditation.
A lot of meditation is the detailed study of the bad advice that we've received and that we keep giving ourselves.
We listen to our own voices.
I remember something I heard from Gil a while ago which is really stayed, which he said once,
if there was anyone who repeated what we repeat to ourselves,
if there was another person who was kind of outside of ourselves who repeated to ourselves what we tell to ourselves continually,
we would consider that person the most obnoxious person on the earth.
Of course there's sometimes good advice.
But I think this first phase is when we start having a sense of seeing some of the conditioning,
seeing maybe not being satisfied with what's going on, that there's some questioning,
some maybe some discontent.
Maybe there's the sense that maybe I've succeeded in certain ways but something else calls me.
There's a line from Joseph Campbell who was the person who wrote the book The Hero's Journey, which gives one model of these different phases.
And other people have done other versions.
There was a woman who wrote a book called The Heroine's Journey which said it's a little different for women.
And one of the starting points that Campbell identified, he said,
you may have climbed the ladder, you may get to midlife,
and you may realize I climbed the ladder but it was set against the wrong wall.
So we may have succeeded in certain ways.
But there still can be a sense of that dissatisfaction.
Something more, something is not quite right where I've succeeded but my life is too busy or overly scheduled
and it doesn't have the depth that I want.
And that comes to all of us.
Maybe for many of us that's part of the reason that we're here, that we're here.
And there may also be certain experiences that we've had which make us wonder about the conventional way our lives are structured.
There may be sometimes early in life, you may have had experiences,
I think most of us probably had experiences as children that made us question the way things are.
I know for myself, when I was four or five, there was something that really struck me about encountering the cruelty of other kids.
Maybe you've had similar experiences.
One experience I remember, I don't know if this is universal,
but when I went to kindergarten for the first day, the first and second graders taunted us.
I don't know if that happens throughout the country but they said,
kindergarten babies soaked in the gravy.
This is my first experience going to kindergarten and looking back there can be some humor,
but it was awful in the lived experience of a four or five year old.
It was an awful experience and I had to say, where does that cruelty come from?
Something shook me and there were maybe other experiences I can remember as a kid, just what is this?
There may have been experiences of betrayal from people close to me who I remember also.
I grew up in a part of Maryland which was a town where there was railroad tracks through the middle
and on one side of the tracks were a lot of relatively poor whites recently come from Appalachia.
On the other side of the town were poor blacks and then there was the town
and then beyond the town there were growing suburbs.
And spending time in the black part of town as a little kid,
because I went to school with some of the people there, it was really like, what is this?
What are these divisions?
Because it was very poor.
There weren't paved roads.
And what is this?
Again, I imagine that most of us had something like that maybe as children or maybe it came later as adults.
I know for myself, really coming as a teenager and later coming of age during the time of the Vietnam War
and just being and learning about war and violence and some of the foreign policy of this country
and just learning about the reality of the world, these were shocks to my system.
And something in me said, why is this?
Why isn't there kindness?
Why is there cruelty?
And this kind of, of course this can sometimes be difficult for us and can shut us down
but it also can open us up to questioning.
Or it might be something like a midlife crisis.
Many of us maybe came to this practice because we had some encounter with what was difficulty,
maybe an illness of our own illness or a friend's illness, something happening in the family.
And it was both difficult but something woke up and said, I want to go more deeply.
I want my life to be deeper.
And the Buddha had that experience as well.
That experience of going outside the palace and meeting, encountering an old man the first night.
And in the text, there are these lines where it says, like, he asked his charioteer who took him out there,
what is this?
He said, this is called an old man.
He did not know that experience.
And in the text it talks about how this old man was really infirm both in body and in mind.
And then the Buddha asked him, is this the old man unique?
Or are there many old men?
And the charioteer says, this happens to everyone.
And he was shocked.
And something like that happened encountering a sick person, encountering a dead person.
And then encountering someone who was on a spiritual search.
And this shook him.
So we all may have something like that that has at times shaken us, had a big impact.
And we may want to look for what is deeper.
How do we understand this?
The Buddha wanted to understand whether life was simply about getting old and dying.
Is there something else?
Is there some other dimension to things?
And then there's the hearing of the call that in the text it says, one day you finally knew what you had to do.
And it repeats this, you knew what you had to do.
It's very interesting in the text of the Buddha.
It's often said that someone who goes on the spiritual path and brings it to conclusion did what had to be done.
That's the translation.
And so there's this sense of the calling.
That one doesn't stay with the conditioning.
And the call to something else doesn't come just once, but it can come many, many times.
That's very interesting.
We may get the call and say, what is this as a four-year-old, as a five-year-old?
And then it maybe comes again as a 13-year-old, as an 18-year-old.
And maybe it comes as an adult in big ways, many times.
What's this call? And something is inviting us to find really that true voice.
In the text of the poem, it says, one eventually finds one's true voice.
And it's very interesting that we sometimes talk about that as finding one's deeper vocation.
And the actual etymology of the word vocation refers to hearing a voice.
Vox.
The word for voice is there in the word vocation.
And there's a beautiful passage from Carl Jung, where he says that true vocation is hearing one's deep inner voice and following it.
So there's something about hearing that call and really moving with one's authentic voice.
And it's hard to find that authentic voice.
In the poem, it says, you felt the old tug at your ankles, mend my life.
And later it says that the road is full of fallen branches and stones.
It's hard.
We have these other people telling us what to do.
One of the difficulties of when we really make some changes, we have a lot of people around us telling us, if you change, I will suffer.
It's very common.
And so there are these lonely aspects to this path, of course.
And there are these times of uncertainty and not knowing what will happen or thinking we may lose something.
The Buddha actually had to choose to follow his vocation or to stay with his family.
He had a young child and a wife.
And he left them for a number of years.
And the inner struggle was a lot for him.
And so there is that.
That inner voice is hard to find at times.
I remember one of the times where there was really a kind of a breakthrough was for me when the early days when I was doing retreats and learning to meditate.
And I was on a retreat at Insight Meditation Society in Massachusetts.
And I was feeling fear.
I was doing walking meditation next to people.
And I suddenly felt fear and I didn't know what it was.
And I remember stopping.
This was a long time ago.
But I remember stopping and just saying, why am I afraid?
And I didn't know why I was afraid.
And I just stopped.
And something happened that hadn't happened in the way it happened before.
Which was that I got an inner voice telling me why I was afraid.
As it were telling me the truth.
It was not something I had to tell anyone else.
It was very private in a way.
But for me the message I got was I'm actually afraid of these people because I perceive them as powerful.
And that's scary for me.
It was something like that.
And that was an important message in itself.
But in some ways what was more powerful was personally having a kind of an activation of something inside that was at a little deeper level that told me what was true.
It was very powerful.
On that retreat I kept on using it.
I kept on saying, okay, what's true right now?
What's true right now?
And I found it extremely useful like I'd be in a situation and I wouldn't feel comfortable.
And I would say, what's this about?
And there would be some kind of truthful response almost all the time.
I likened it later to what the Quakers call the still small voice.
It was very private.
It had a lot of authenticity to it.
And it wasn't always easy to follow.
And probably many of us or most of us have some access to that or maybe have had some kind of experience like that where something like that gets activated.
And how do we follow that?
How do we know it?
There's a lot of bad advice that covers that over.
Whether our own voices or the voices of the outside.
So how do we follow that deeper impulse?
It's a huge question.
And so we know what we have to do.
We hear that voice.
That voice starts getting stronger.
And in some ways we leave this third phase, we leave the trembling house.
The whole house began to tremble.
And in the poem, it was already late enough and a wild night and the road full of fallen branches and stones.
But somehow one leaves.
One summons the energy to leave.
To leave the conventional patterns perhaps.
Or it's going to be different for everyone.
But in some way make a break with the old pattern that is no longer helpful.
And somehow we leave.
It may be we leave a relationship or we leave a job or we start a relationship or we start a new job or we cut.
I don't know.
Move to California.
Solves everything right?
Almost everything.
And so we in some way find a way to shift or maybe it was to really make a commitment to our practice.
Something like that.
We leave.
And as we do that, the fourth phase, I wanted to connect with this finding your own voice.
Little by little as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds.
And there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own.
So that new voice comes more and more to the fore.
I think a lot of spiritual practice is in fact, as it were, coming to be with the static and the conditioning and the bad advice enough so that we touch something authentic.
Whether it's the authenticity of just being directly with emotions or with the body or with what we really want.
I find that meditation practice takes me continually back to my authentic voice.
And sometimes when I've had difficult decisions, maybe should I take this work or not or do this or that?
I've taken a few days for meditation because invariably I find on retreats there's something gets cleared away and I have more access to that deeper voice, what I really want.
It does get covered over, doesn't it, in our daily lives?
It's hard.
That's why we need these times away from that to some extent.
And it's not easy.
It's not easy in this process of finding one's own voice.
The other side of it is that we work through challenges and difficulties.
This phase that I'm calling finding one's own voice is also a phase when we kind of have struggles and ups and downs as we awaken more.
And the Buddha, we may think from the story that he just went out and got enlightened and that was that.
But when you read the accounting, he was six years searching.
Had a lot of difficulties.
He was close to death at times.
He came to question all of his teachers.
He had periods of fear, periods of confusion.
And that's part of our path.
One of the reasons that I like to explore these stages or phases of practice is that can really help us to frame where we're at, particularly if we feel a little stuck.
That stuckness or struggle, when we're in the midst of it, is hard.
Or if we're in a year-long phase, which is a little bit more struggle or trying to find our way.
It's not easy, so it's helpful for me to know that this comes with the territory.
It helps a little.
And sometimes it helps a lot to have that perspective or to maybe have friends who've gone through that.
And they know what we're experiencing and they can say that in some sense you have to stay with it for a while.
And if you stay with it with that authentic voice leading, there can be movement.
It's a difficult process.
This awakening process is not easy.
It's difficult.
And one of the challenges that we have is that, kind of paradoxically, as we awaken more, we criticize ourselves for having been asleep.
And we can get caught in that.
I know it was very interesting for me to see that a lot, you know, as I'm awakening.
I mean, there's a certain way that we actually do grieve for when we were asleep or stuck, and that's important and real.
But we can also get unbalanced in that and criticize ourselves as we're awakening.
And that, in a sense, may be an old pattern.
So there can be that self-judgment and that criticism as we awaken.
But as we come more and more to that authentic voice, things shift and we're more and more doing what we feel needs to be done.
Or what really expresses our gifts.
So I think it's one of the signs of this path and following this path that we move more and more into an expression of our deeper gifts.
In a way, you know, a phrase I like is, we take our stand on the earth.
I like that phrase.
We take our stand on the earth.
It's very much like when the Buddha was questioned about his own awakening, he put his hand on the earth, asking the earth to be his witness for his awakening.
You know, where there's a beautiful line from the great African-American mystic and theologian,
Howard Thurman, who was once asked by a young man, what should I do?
And he was, you know, an activist.
He set up one of the first interracial churches in the Bay Area.
And you might think that he would answer by saying, well, you know, we really have a need for a few people doing this.
We're doing this.
There's this campaign here.
You know, we really need people.
He said, rather radically, don't ask what the world needs.
Rather ask what makes you come alive.
What the world needs is people who have come alive.
So that has something to do with this authentic voice.
You know, it's going to be different for different ones of us.
Some of us may take a more conventional spiritual path.
Some of us may hear our calling to really help heal the earth at this time of need.
That can be a powerful calling for probably for many of us.
Or it could be to really excel in work or to be, you know, deeply committed to family.
It can take all sorts of expressions.
And then eventually we come back to the world and we offer, as it were, our gifts to the world, having gone through this process.
You know, and the Buddha comes back and he starts teaching.
At first, reluctantly.
But he is convinced that there are a few people who will hear me.
At first he thought, no one will listen.
It's too simple.
No one will listen in the sense of just letting go of where we're stuck.
But he said he was convinced by one of the deities who came down and told him,
there are a few with but little dust over their eyes, they will listen.
Now there are more people with little dust over their eyes.
So we come back into the world and we see what, again, we see what it is that needs to be done.
We do in a sense, as Mary Oliver says, the only thing that we can do in a sense.
We have a sense of our vocation more and more as we follow this.
I think I'll just end reading the poem again so I can have a little bit of time for discussion.
So here's the poem again.
Remember, listen for those five phases of seeing our suffering and our conditioning,
hearing the call, departing, finding our own voice, sometimes with struggle,
and then going deeper into the world or entering back into the world.
One day you finally knew what you had to do and began.
The voices around you kept shouting their bad advice, though the whole house began to tremble
and you felt the old tug at your ankles.
Men in my life, each voice cried, but you didn't stop.
You knew what you had to do, though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations,
though their melancholy was terrible.
It was already late enough and a wild night and the road full of fallen branches and stones,
but little by little as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds.
And there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own that kept you company
as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do,
determined to save the only life you could save.
Thank you for your kind attention.
I have time maybe just for one or two questions, please.
The question is about the story of the Buddha and it's an aspect that's always bothering me.
I'm thinking, as you spoke, of the story more as metaphor than the story of the Buddha.
I can imagine, I've never been able to imagine that somebody with the kind of insight the Buddha had
did not have the experience you described as a young boy and be troubled by it.
And then some traditions talk about the chariot or the carriage being the mind.
And as you spoke this, I realized maybe the story goes something like, or the reality goes something like that.
The question he asked the chariot here is really about the things he had seen.
Yeah, yeah.
There's an interesting question.
Because it's very much relates to how we take that story, which I think it is helpful to take a lot of the aspects,
maybe more psychologically, and to know that this may have aspects of myth
or that certain truths were told through the vehicle of the story.
And the same truths can come in different ways.
So that, when I told my story, there was a certain level of protection,
and yet there was some openness to certain kinds of suffering.
So I interpret the story as the Buddha had an extremely protected life.
And according to the story, his parents were almost maniacal about trying to create some fictional world.
And I think for me it's less important to look into the details of that,
but just to say, what does this mean for me?
And I think it's very interesting.
I found it very helpful to look back into my own childhood and to ask, when did I have difficulty with my own upbringing?
Or maybe not so much with what my parents did, but with the more the social or cultural setting.
And that was very, very interesting.
And like you say, the encounter with old age or sickness or death,
that occurs to us in all sorts of ways.
And it can occur as a child, it can occur as a young adult, it can occur as an adult,
it can occur ourselves as we age.
So many, many, many ways. Thank you.
Maybe just, I think this will have to be the last one, sorry.
Thank you so much for your wonderful talk.
One of the aspects of the Buddhist metaphor and the stories about his going out,
following his own voice going out and his teaching was, how did he come back home?
How did he come back to his wife, his child, his family?
There's very little about that part of his life.
And it's always been intrigued because that's a part of coming into our own voice
and learning, reclaiming parts of our lives that we let go of or lost on our journey.
So that's an interesting part of what we're going to know more about.
Yeah, that return is a very important aspect. Again, it's across cultures.
Some of you know the story of Plato and the cave in Greek philosophy,
where the journey of awakening is to go outside of the dark cave
where one just looks at shadows and go into the sunlight.
But then one's told, after you've been in the sunlight, go back into the cave
and help take care of people.
It's the Bodhisattva in Buddhist tradition who maybe has the potential
of having a private awakening but commits to helping others.
So there's a lot of compassion there and there's a lot of really not staying isolated.
So that I think that quality of return or in the Zen tradition,
there's that sense of after one has gone on the path of enlightenment,
one enters, re-enters the marketplace with bliss bestowing hands is the phrase.
So it's quite remarkable.
And I think it occurs in all sorts of ways.
Yeah, for the Buddha it was a little bit indirect.
Of course, he didn't have models.
And he came back and he eventually became very, very close with his wife and child.
His child, they both became students of him.
Disciples and we're very close and some of the most beautiful texts are his guidance to his own son.
In the text, they're very beautiful texts.
So there's some sense of return that for him was a rather winding path.
And it's not always predictable how we return.
There's some sense of maybe it's very much like the shaman, the shaman goes on his private journey or voyage.
But always the purpose is always for the sake of the community.
And so the return I think has something to do with the sense of connection and compassion.
Because the awakening is a lot about seeing into the conditioning, seeing into the suffering.
And in a lot of traditions it's expressed that when one has that awakening,
one's also very tuned in to those who are more stuck, like one self was at it maybe a previous time.
It's relative, right?
We can be at stage three and see those relatively stuck at stage one and those at stage five look at us and see us as relatively stuck.
It's somewhat relative, but I think there's something about compassion here.
It's kind of a thank you, thank you, Rob.
It's a nice way to finish really with the morning, to really have all of this both opens us up to that inner voice but also to compassion.
So it's a sweet way to bring that framing.
So again maybe I'll just end with a dedication of merit which is a traditional way that I think often sessions are ended here.
Very much in the spirit of compassion which is that we remember that we do this practice not just for ourselves but also for others.
And may the benefits of our practice strengthen ourselves, strengthen those we're close to.
And may ultimately the benefits of our practice be offered out to all those we come in contact and then beyond that immediate realm of contact mysteriously often to all other beings.
Thanks again for your kind attention. I could stay for another hour or two but we have our schedule.
