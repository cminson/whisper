The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
We're thinking that equanimity is something that, as soon as we just
learned the right things, then we could just have that for ourselves.
But instead, I think whether we consider that equanimity is as a capstone,
or whether it's part of a mandala, it's really integrated with our practice,
with our practice as a whole, our Buddhist practice, whether it's meditation
or some of that way we show up in the world, some of the ethics or some of the
ways in which we might study and practice and combine them as all the different
ways in which there might be a Buddhist practice. Equanimity is integrated
with all of them, and maybe we can consider it as part of a growing, a flowering,
blossoming of these practices that help create the conditions in which there
can be some greater ease and spaciousness, which of course can lead to some
letting go, some ending of some grabbing, and instead can more and more
letting go, that of course leads to more and more freedom, which of course
leads to more letting go, which can lead to the greatest freedom.
The biggest, the highest happiness, if you will, from the way to awakening.
So in this way, equanimity is really an integral part of our practice,
and a way that we can both infuse everything we do, as well as can be a
way in which what we're doing flowers and allows the equanimity to show for it.
So maybe I will open it up and see if some of my co-teachers here
have something that they would like to say before we open it up a little bit
more broadly, if they have some comments that they'd like to add here.
Well, I will say this, that unfortunately I'm going to have to go right now,
but I feel, just this three classes, a deep sense of gratitude for your
practice and your study, what an inspiring gesture for the world.
And so may this bring much benefit to all of us and to the people around us
and all beings. So I'm going to have to bow out a little early today.
Thank you.
I don't think there's much to add to Diana's wonderful summary,
maybe just to say that we see the boundlessness of equanimity.
It's useful in so many different ways.
It comes about through so many different practices.
This is a quality of its boundless nature, its ability to be relevant
in all situations in some way.
So I hope it will continue to infuse your life as you go forward.
So many lovely words. I'm not going to try to better my colleagues there.
Kim, Diana, very nice kind of wrapping,
bringing tying various threads together.
Why don't we turn to questions?
We've left ample time here for some questions, some comments,
some exchange, and yeah, what's coming up for people at the end of these
three classes, these three sort of different entries and entry points
into recognizing, cultivating, leaning in toward equanimity in our practices.
And again, feel free to raise a hand, raise a blue hand,
or just unmute and share.
I see Lori here.
We've been discussing equanimity as the capstone,
which I looked up in, it says, crowning achievement.
And we've been talking about equanimity as kind of glorified,
how we do about enlightenment a lot of times.
Just some exalted state.
But what about, and in the models we've looked at,
everything leads to equanimity.
But what about just moments of equanimity that come and go?
What's their place in the scheme of things?
Is this truly a taste of equanimity?
Or freedom even?
Like moments of awakening?
Or are these just kind of teasers that aren't the real thing?
Thank you, Lori. What a beautiful question.
Really appreciate that question.
You know, it's interesting and sort of a reflection on our teaching
that it may seem as if we've sort of placed equanimity on a pedestal.
And in a way, the graphic representation maybe implies that or reinforces that idea.
And I don't know, in fact, I think I can say that that really hasn't been our intention.
Nor is it really, as we've seen in the text, the way it arises in the texts.
There isn't any, I think the texts are just as relevant to any moment of equanimity,
any moment of peace, any moment of freedom,
as they are to sort of a path that culminates in something like equanimity or being more awake.
So I think the moments you point toward, yeah, those are moments of a quantumist presence
of places without preference that moves us toward tension in the mind and unskillful action, for example.
And certainly in these meditative practices that we've sort of worked with in the guidance,
we've heard several instructions saying just notice any little amount of equanimity that's there.
Equanimity can be not just at the end of things, but in the thick of things.
It can be there when the mind's busy, the heart's tortured, the body's in pain.
Equanimity is still available.
It's how we hold those things.
And in Kim's meditation, so lovely, just completed,
the way in which we can sort of hold all of experience with stuff we like,
the stuff we don't like, the stuff we're wrapped up in at the moment.
The way we hold it is where there's the equanimity.
Kim, Diana, any thoughts?
That was just me jumping in.
Maybe I'll just add another reason why I appreciate Laurie's comment is that sometimes we do tend to dismiss
those little moments of contentment, those moments of ease that are arising in our life,
but often our mind naturally kind of goes towards what's difficult,
what we think is a problem that we have to miss.
So maybe our spending these days thinking about reading, about looking, about equanimity
will help us or remind us to just appreciate when those moments do arise.
So we chose as a kind of like a pedagogical tool, as a teaching tool,
how to show how equanimity is a capstone.
But that's just, you know, a perspective that we chose for this class.
But I think it's perfectly, as Laurie, as you're rightly pointing out,
of course there's equanimity, just it's infusing all activities of our life,
meditative or otherwise.
And this alone, we should underestimate how powerful that can be,
just to appreciate when it does arise just spontaneously,
and maybe one way to appreciate, quote unquote, is to kind of like, just check in.
Oh, I think this is equanimity.
It may feel like equanimity and maybe just tune in to how does this feel in the body?
How does this feel in the mind?
And as the body and the mind just gets more familiar,
it just becomes easier and easier to access.
So rather than trying to make it happen,
appreciating when it's already happening.
So it's one way we can practice with it.
Thank you.
Yeah, nice.
Yeah, other thoughts I see.
Chris has raised a blue hand.
I want to make sure I haven't missed any physical hand,
but I don't see any and I don't see other teachers indicating.
So Chris, take it away.
Take it away.
Lori's question was on my mind too, certainly.
As I practiced and practiced and practiced,
I keep coming to these sort of exalted states where I really feel the nirvana of it all.
I'm samsaring consistently and then with practice,
sort of nirvana-ing, finding the freedom.
And there's this drive, sort of like this pill out there,
this sugar pill or the final, Diana just said at the end,
this final awakening that confuses me.
It's when I start to think in terms of,
oh, I'm just got to keep striving here because there is this sort of final exalted state.
And that's caused confusion for me throughout my practice, actually.
And I let go of it. I've learned to let go of that quickly.
And I don't know what my question is there,
but Diana, could you talk about that a little bit or anyone want to offer that up?
Because I'm realizing now that equanimity is in my life.
And as I see it and touch it, it's like, wow, there it is and there it goes.
There, oh, I'm feeling it.
So I'm definitely cultivating it and moving through practice,
yet I don't know and I'm trying to stick with the state of this is life.
This is how it's going to be as opposed to this sort of final exalted state.
I guess that's my question.
Yeah.
Maybe I'll ask Kim to bring in her voice on this topic.
Okay.
Well, just when you mentioned how you were sometimes realizing you needed to look for equanimity,
I thought of a story that I heard from Gil Fronstahl,
who said that on one of his retreats, he was very interested in the seven factors of awakening.
And he kept reporting to the teachers how he was seeing all these factors of awakening.
And he was, of course, imagining that his mind was going to awaken.
And he was talking about how he saw this and that and then there was more of this.
And at one interview, the teacher said, I noticed you haven't named equanimity yet.
So somehow he had done the other six, but there's a, there is this infusion of equanimity that comes in.
And, you know, it's, it's fine to have a lot of ideas and aims and all this in practice.
But I think we don't get there without them.
And there's also the letting go of them. So I love that you mentioned that when you see these things,
you're able to let them go because it's actually the letting go that is much more related to awakening than any particular state.
So it might be interesting.
You didn't ask for advice, but since I have the floor, I'll say that it's useful to when you feel that letting go,
and then you say, oh, I'm going to let go of that one, but pay attention for one moment longer to what it feels like with the absence of whatever it was that has arisen.
So just notice that absence also, that'll be helpful. Thanks.
And I, I might just add to that response, just sort of a general comment about this idea of the sort of an ultimate goal versus what's available here.
In all the texts we've read, and I think, I think it's true of many, many, probably the vast majority of these other texts that come to us.
There's no indication that there is anywhere else, but here.
Today, for example, in the Majma 119 reading, this, this is a very present practice, and it's a very embodied practice. It doesn't, we don't get to get away from here and this embodied consciousness.
This is, this is where the freedom is happening. And your question in a way I would relate back to Lori's. Yeah, that those moments of equanimity that's there.
And here.
So just the thoughts. Plus, I've got to put in a plug since Kim, neither Kim nor Diana did it for the next class in our study and practice series, in which we'll take a look at the Degan Nikhaya 16, the, the discourse or the sutra in which the Buddha's
final entrance, entrance into sort of a, you know, an ultimate state of Nirvana is, is talked about here's a picture of that above my head.
But yeah, tune in stay tuned. Keep coming back to here.
Okay.
I see two hands up a real hand and a blue hand and I'm going to say Jose first just on the off chance that I've missed her hand previously having been having seen the blue hand so Jose.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. This has been absolutely amazing. And I want to know, how do we know what's coming and when and how do we hook up.
If I can get hooked on anything.
Diana. Yes. Thank you. So the next offering that we'll be doing will be starting on January 30. I think that's right. I'm looking for Kim Kim. That's yes, yes.
And, and we'll be doing this will be a four class series. It's a Saturday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Again, so it's just within one week. And right now it's on the IMC calendar.
I put it just a placeholder on there we don't have a rich description yet right there's four of us we have to, we'll put together a description and get that up there.
I'm wondering, is this the question that you're asking like when is it and how do you find out yeah.
Yeah, because I is this is the first time that it's new for me the Saudi center thing. And I don't even remember where I, where I found it so I guess it must have been on the IMC calendar.
Oh, yeah, so we put it on both places for Saudi center and I am see sometimes the distinction between these organizations organizations get blurred. But, and we, we know, I think that we've decided amongst the four of us that we will send out an email we
bombard people with emails, but when we have a new thing that we're doing that will send it out to people, and just to let you know. So, and we do have a few things more on the rest of the year but those aren't on calendars yet and so we'll be working on getting those on the calendars.
So, Saudi center website, Saudi.org, and the IMC website inside meditation center.org specifically the calendars on there you can find what we're doing.
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks for that question.
I hope you enjoy this a lot and we love the idea that other people find this supportive of their practice this way of sort of engaging with the with the textual tradition and you know it's richness so yeah we I like the idea that somebody
might become hooked on this.
That would pretty much describe us Fred.
Thanks. First, I'd like to thank all three of you for and the fourth year for offering this to us. It's been a wonderful class and really enjoyed it.
I think I came in, maybe with not too many expectations.
But one of the things I discovered.
It seems that equanimity is present all the time. And if I just settle into it.
It's not, it's, it's feels like it's both arising and me settling into it.
And I found that to be a wonderful experience.
Because it gave me an easy path. I didn't have to rise to some occasion.
I could just settle into the occasion. And the experience of that was beautiful.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, that's beautifully, beautifully put. There's a whole, that's a whole teaching to itself that these things are available. They're there, actually, they're part of our experience and as we tune into them, we cultivate them, we strengthen them.
And we make them more available as, as Diana pointed out.
Thank you Fred.
Thank you, Diana. Anything to add.
Okay, well, let's take, but maybe one or two more questions before we give you homework. No, just kidding. No homework.
You know what we'd say anyway, but let's let's turn to Alana.
Thank you everyone for teachers for what you've provided so far. This has been a really illuminating class.
I wondered if you could speak about equanimity and daily life and how we can.
The point to mind is, you know, for example, you know, difficult situation arises, and we have the presence of mind to be able to respond in a way that's not reactive in a, in a damaging way.
This is for my own self sometimes that might might be overriding some other strong emotions or inclinations or states of mind that sort of call into question whether it was really an active equanimity, or whether it was maybe pushing something away very subtly.
And so I'm wondering if you could speak to how we could work with refining that awareness.
Good question, really good question.
Kim, Diana.
Well, I'll offer something you see if the others want to add. I think your question first of all was beautifully framed there's a lot of awareness in the way you said it because there is that question when something is arising that we know is reactive fear or anger, for example.
When we find a way to not get sucked into that, there is a little question of whether we pushed it aside in a certain way or whether we were fully aware of it but not reacting to it.
And so one of the things you asked how to deepen you already have a fair amount of nuance there because we don't want to be suppressing but we also don't want to be acting out of these unskillful roots.
The way to refine is to be aware might help to know that reactive emotions come with a demand that they are important.
That's one of their qualities because that's that's part of the their self consistency that's what keeps them sustained. And so the anger comes with a lot of lawyers about why it's all righteous and justified and so forth.
And the fear comes with a lot of justification that this really is dangerous. And so tuning into that quality of the unwholesome roots is really helpful in being able to figure out whether or not we are in some way using a version,
or if we're allowing them their full flowering and yet letting the energy just pass through. You know it's the transparency of that energy it can pass through and we don't react to it but we haven't suppressed it.
And sometimes there is a little bit of discomfort in saying no to an unwholesome root because it has that demand it has that four year old quality to it of, hey, I'm important.
And to say actually no you're unskillful, but I'm not suppressing you.
That's a subtle thing and so maybe it just helps to know that they always have that little hook on them, the way a small child does and so just to be aware of that hook will help you know whether or not you've gotten caught by it or not.
That's what all and maybe others have more to say.
I can't add to that that that that was really nice. Yeah.
Yep. That's the practice that that careful watching what's going on really noticing and inclining toward the since you asked about inclining I think earlier, inclining.
Clining toward wholesome.
Why don't we take one more question and then we'll close.
The POSICO.
Kim's response.
Kind of connects with what I was going to ask about
really opening up or fully feeling letting pass through really intense emotional state like a vanger hatred rage through process of grieving.
And yeah, I find like in my experience with this, I noticed that if I'm doing meditation practice and there's this unfolding of one of these aspects of the grieving process.
If I do concentration like I focus on reading, for example, it can suppress these or avoid or I don't know if this is the right way to think about it, but it can kind of divert my attention and I can focus on something else and I don't start
sobbing or crying or like breathing heavily or shaking. But if I just kind of have a more open awareness and soften then these really intense body states unfold like shaking crying heavy breathing things like this.
And so in a process of breathing, if this is continuing day after day of these intense states, I ask myself like am I indulging in it?
Or is this just something that eventually is going to exhaust itself or like what's is the concentration preferable because I am not feeding the like four year old.
That's wanting to like keep being fed or the hooks so yeah I'm a little bit confused about is this skillful or unskillful or what to do.
That's a good question and I want to say first I appreciate you sharing something that, you know, in this, this container here that it feels safe enough to share the sorts of things that are really coming up for us.
And I think what I would say about that is just that the container that the meditation provides and the samadhi can provide for that kind of intense deeply felt emotion can also be, you know, sort of a safe place.
And that the everything you describe I think, you know, can can fit in the prasket practice. Grieving takes a long time, you know, and it's complex and as accompanied by lots of many things as I'm sure others here know and appreciate.
And I think the practice on the whole can help integrate those experiences, instead of sort of holding them away or pushing them away in very much the ways you've you've described so I think I would leave it.
That's that's all I would say about that I don't know if Diana Kim have anything to add to that.
Do you have something you'd like to say.
Okay, one thing I wanted to maybe I'll just say quickly here is this is a practice.
And so sometimes, you know, we will slip into having our emotions really just getting really big and getting away from us.
That's not helpful. Maybe there'll be a time in which our emotions are getting expressed maybe there is crying, but it's a way that's helpful.
So we don't want to undermine or pretend like we don't have a rich emotional life that's part of the human experience.
Maybe Kim was pointing a little bit to is there a way in which they can be expressed but be helpful. And there's only one way to learn how to do this. And this is to discover all the ways that don't work.
And the only way that we do that is we kind of like no slip into. Oh, okay, that was some repression because I know can feel it showing up in my body in another way.
As well as we can this idea like we could be thinking that works cultivating equanimity but then we discover that we're a little bit disconnected from everything and we've like oh we slipped into disconnection disinterest.
And then that's not quite equanimity. And then we only learn that to by finding ourselves there again and again so point to kind of the art of practice.
And it's just like mindfulness right we learn mindfulness by discovering all the ways in which we're not mindful and what it feels like to not be mindful.
So, and maybe I'll just add here, can we somehow bring a little bit of equanimity to all those times we discover we're not economists.
Like, of course it's going to happen of course we're going to feel like, well I don't know that things are a little bit into overwhelm or disconnection or all these things as we like practice and grow.
So, maybe that's my sense there.
I think now it's time to wrap up. So, I'll just, unless I'm looking at you, Kim, if you have anything you'd like to add here, or
I guess we had said that, although this is not through Sati Center IMC there is a weekly suit to study group that I run. It's technically through a different organization but online, it really isn't so important and there's more and more people who are
in this area. So, that's on Fridays at 11am. And it's, if you want the zoom link for that it's probably easiest just to email me.
I can put my email in the chat.
See. Yeah, and so please go ahead I'm just mentioning that if I don't have anything more to say so somebody else can go on.
I think we, given the time we probably should close.
I think I'll just say the following which is that we, I feel a great deal of gratitude for people for sharing what they've shared and joining us in this exploration also providing some teachings.
So, it's just a rich learning environment for the teachers and to the extent people have shared valuable things. We, I think a lot's been a lot's been taught by others. So, I welcome and want to express gratitude for that.
And that there is a way to, to express generosity for these offerings through the Sati Center, or through IMC, and just want to let people know that that's available as part of the, as part of the offering.
And then I'd like to ask and they're going to duke it out Diana or Kim to dedicate the merit of our practice together over the last three days.
Whichever one of them unmutes first. Oh, Diana, I saw it.
I think it falls to Diana to dedicate.
That's very funny because I was going to say, Oh, Kim, do you want to do it, but I had to unmute in order to say that.
Yeah, maybe I'll just start by saying what a pleasure it is, what a pleasure it is to practice with you all to see you all and to spend part of your Saturday with us. So beautiful thing, beautiful thing.
With a deep deep bow to my co teachers, Yang, David, Kim and I were good friends. It's such what a great thing right to be offering the Dharma with your friends and to be meeting more and more friends all the time. It's just a fantastic thing.
So may all the goodness that brought us to this class that brought us to our practice that supports our practice.
The meditation we're doing, the studying we're doing, may all this goodness flow out from us, support us, fill us and be for the benefit of all beings everywhere.
Without exception.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Maybe I should use three times.
Thank you Diana for that. And why doesn't if you feel the urge, feel free to unmute and say farewell. We hope we expect we'll see many of you again. Thanks for joining us and take care.
Take care. Take care. Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.
Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Have a wonderful rest of the day.
Thank you for these beautiful sharing.
Thank you.
Bye everyone.
