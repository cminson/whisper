 Okay, got it. So formally, hello and welcome to happy hour. So nice at the beginning with our informal start to welcome ourselves and each other to the space. It always warms my heart when folks say hi and type in chat along with the weather report in different places in the world you are. So, so for today's practice, for today's practice, I'd like to invite us to explore meta in the form of radiating meta. There are many different ways to practice cultivating goodness, cultivating care, cultivating friendliness, cultivating loving kindness for ourselves and others. And there are many phrases that we use a skillful means. And yet sometimes phrases can be helpful and sometimes they may not be and it's nice to have facility with either using phrases may I be well may I be happy may I be safe etc whatever phrases you use the simple ones or the traditional form or just sitting in the state sitting in the feeling of meta and radiating. So, and sometimes what happens for many practitioners is that phrases are used as support at the beginning to prime the heart. And it could happen sometimes during some sits or some retreats. That phrases then seem heavy and then the phrases naturally drop away. And one just wants to sit with the feeling of meta feeling of friendliness feeling of kindness. So there is no one size fits all is what I'm trying to communicate here. Some people love phrases, it helps them stay grounded, stay with the feeling. Some people don't like phrases, they seem like distractions. Some people like them and then they drop away. They use them to prime the heart. So, so the invitation today. Maybe what we'll do is maybe we'll start by as always, we will start with settling into the breath with the body with awareness of body and breath, just to sell and arrive and this being Friday for those who are joining live, perhaps after a long week for you of activity. So I'll include a lot of silence that's beginning for us to settle. And then maybe we'll conjure up some of the phrases just for a little while to prime the heart and then we'll drop them. See what happens if you drop them and just sit with the feeling of friendliness, radiating, radiating friendliness. Ah, radiating friendliness, good will. Even if it feels, especially if it feels like work, it's not yours. It's not yours to generate. Imagine that it's just, it's there. There's this, there is the sun shining in your heart. It's above and beyond you. It's something bigger than you. The sense of goodwill friendliness that is just there. So I think that's enough for setting the frame. Let's practice together. So fight you to land. Land in your body. Land with your breath, your in breath. And just as importantly with the entirety of your out breath, cleansing, releasing. Greeting your self at your own door, the door of your awareness. Ah, as if you're coming home after a long trip, you're tired. It's been a long week perhaps. Hello dear, hello dear, welcome, welcome home. Welcome home to your own body. Especially if you've spent time away from your body, worrying, thinking in your head. Welcome yourself. Ah, oh, it's nice to be back in this body. It's a turtle back, cozily in its shell. Ah, this home, this body. Greeting the body, greeting yourself in the body from the inside. With each breath. Maybe dropping in hello, hello dear, hello your name. Hi, welcome home. With each breath. And if thoughts, plans, worries from the past or the future arise, in this moment, giving your heart to being present here with the body. And asking the thoughts to come back later. Thank you for visiting. Please come back later. I'll wait for you. Now I'm giving my heart to itself. The simplicity of just sitting and being breathed at my home, in my home, inside my home, my body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Being simple, simply breathing, as best as you're able to showing up in this moment, in this body. Thank you. I'm dropping in the question in this moment as if you were dropping a pebble into a lake letting it reverberate, dropping the question into your body, not answering it from your head, dropping it in. Why am I here? What is my highest intention? In this practice, in this moment of my humanity, what is my highest intention? Why am I here? Why am I practicing in this moment? Connecting, connecting with whatever arises and whatever level it arises. Breathing with it, breathing into it, recognizing its goodness, your goodness, your goodness, the beauty of the inner goodness. Letting your goodness shine, this goodness, this intention, whatever it is. Whether it's for you or for others, I want to be kinder. I want to be happier. I want to be gentle. I'm here to serve. I want to connect more deeply, whatever it might be. Let this goodness, this intention for wholesomeness, for goodness, let it shine, let it shine. I appreciate its goodness. Knowing that any goodness you wish for yourself will impact others. Letting the wholesomeness, the goodness, continue to shine as if there is a sun, as if there is a bright sun shining the middle of your chest, the proverbial heart center, it's shining. This goodness is this wish, this wish, fulfilling jewel, shining, whispering into the world, shining its light into the world, more goodness, happiness, ease, love, peace, service, kindness. Notice that the rays of the sun touch you, warm you up first, bring you ease and peace. Goodness. Ah, they shine upon you first, and they shine outward unto the world. And maybe as a part of this message of goodness, of friendliness, happiness, love, and care, maybe for a moment, the whisper becomes more audible. May all beings, may all beings, everywhere, including myself, may all beings everywhere, including this being, be safe from inner and outer harm. Letting this light, this sun, radiate, this message, this whisper, this light, this wish of safety, knowing the world isn't safe always, we know that, and yet it's a wish, it's an intention, it's a goodwill that we share freely, freely. And maybe the second phrase of Metta becomes audible now. May all beings everywhere, including this being that is me, may all beings everywhere be happy, joyous, filled with happiness, may their hearts sing with joy, with gladness, with contentment. Letting your inner goodness, inner sunshine, brightly, resting with its goodness. May all beings everywhere, including me, myself, may all beings, enjoy physical well-being, may their bodies, may my body be healthy and strong. Again, knowing that it may not always be possible, you may not be fully healthy right now, but it's okay sharing this as an intention, as a wish, it's a generosity of your heart, as an inclination. May all beings have this goodness, including me, all of us, all of us beings, on this planet and beyond. Thank you. Feeling in your bones. Ah, the goodness, the generosity of this wish. Spread, falling wide. And maybe now the fourth metaphrase, the whisper of it, it's been shining, becomes audible in your mind, in your heart. More so, may all beings everywhere, may all beings everywhere, including myself, have ease. May their lives unfold with ease, may I meet this moment with ease. You're welcome to consider hearing the whisper of the phrases or whatever version of them you like. Or let the shining of your inner goodness, inner wish, or happiness, health, safety, love, ease, to reign through the world, shared with all beings in silence. Do you decide what's best for you? Whatever you choose, let it be easeful. Let your body relax, resting in the goodness of metta. Connect with your Frederic locking coming together. Is there any other way anymore? as a human in your life. Reconnect. Reconnect with the beauty, with the sacredness of the sun shining within you. Reconnect with the beauty, with the sacredness of the sun shining within you. Reconnect with the beauty, with the sacredness of the sun shining within you. Reconnect with the beauty, with the sacredness of the sun shining within you. Reconnect with the beauty, with the sacredness of the sun shining within you. Reconnect with the beauty, with the sacredness of the sun shining within you. And for the last moments of this practice, feeling your body embodied, sitting a little more upright, perhaps. Breathing in and out, the goodness of your intentions, more fully, letting them shine into the world, unto yourself, unto your fellow practitioners in the Zoom Room, on YouTube, across time and space. And if any judgments have arisen, no, I failed, I was distracted, not good enough, let the shine, let the sun of your goodness shine on that too with kindness, with friendliness. Shining on yourself, thanking yourself, thank you. Thank you, dear, for showing up as best as you are able to in this moment. In this moment, for aligning your actions with your intentions, showing up. Thank you. May the goodness, may your collective goodness expressed, shared, cultivated further, more deeply, be a cause and condition for awakening full freedom of all beings everywhere, including ourselves. May all beings be happy, may all beings be free. Thank you, thank you for your practice. Ah. So, this practice we explored at the beginning, coming home to our bodies, embodiment, welcoming ourselves home. And then we connected with our intention, with our highest intention. And through that, allowing this intention, whatever it might be, for goodness, for happiness, for peace, for love, for joy, for health, this goodness, allowing it to permeate through the world, allowing it to permeate. And to actually see that the inner goodness, this inner wish is not so separate, perhaps, from Metta, this wish of goodness for the world. Because when we allow our most beautiful intentions, our aspirations to shine in the world, they serve the world as if we're wishing the world well, everyone well, safety and happiness, health and ease. So, seeing that those are not too far away, and then dropping them if we wanted to, dropping the phrases and being with the permeating of Metta. So, a lot of different things we explored, and I wonder, what do you notice? What was alive for you in this practice? We'd love to hear your reflections, your insights in service of awakening, both for yourself to be held witness and also in service of community. You can raise your Zoom hand, because your physical hand I may not see, or type in chat, I've just changed the settings. If you type them publicly, I'll say your name as I read out the chat. If it's just to me, I will read the reflection, but not your name. So, why did you discover sharing for the benefit of all beings, dear Sangha? Is there a part which particularly spoke to you or was new for you? Is there a part that didn't work for you and you have questions about how do I work with this? Or maybe how you feel now compared to the beginning when you arrived at Happier. I can tell you, I feel a lot more calm and rested than I felt. I was pretty tired when I arrived. It had been a long day, a long week. I'm rested now. I feel happier. Yay. Sarah, please. I really liked it when you were saying coming up, being at home, being in your home, in your body, in your home. And it brought tears to my eyes because sometimes I feel alone. And that helped me feel like I'm not alone because I have this body, I have a place to be. So I really liked that. Thank you, Sarah. Beautiful. I am so touched. I moved. My body's resonating with what you said. Happy making. Yay. Home in our bodies. Yeah, nice. Bill says the idea of connecting with highest intention appeals to me, but I frequently wish for change now need to be patient. Nice. Nice. Thank you. Yes. And one thing to say about that is, yes, need for patience, the practice of patience and the highest intention is an aspiration. It's something that we keep waking up to, waking up every day, working towards little by little by little. So yes, patience. For us says when you had us drop in the question that first I was squeezing, trying to figure out the answer, but then I realized it was very pleasant to treat the question itself as my meditation object. Could you say more about how to use questions? Oh, lovely. I love that question for us. That's fantastic. So, so that the way that you actually use the question, what is my highest intention? Is that how you used it first? I wonder if you would say a little more just so that I'm a little more clear about how you use it as a as an object. Yeah, it was when you had us ask what our highest intention was, which I know I've also been doing since Gil Fransdale introduced that. And then I switched to just keeping that question as my object of focus, but not thinking about it, just like keeping the question continuously as my object of focus, which was interesting. I don't know if that was how you're supposed, you know, how you can work with it. Yeah, yeah. So, so the question, the question actually being, what is my highest intention in that way? Beautiful. I love that. That's a beautiful way to use the inquiry. It's kind of like dropping it in. So, so you can use it that way. And sometimes I've used another way to work with this is to, to, to repeat it intention to repeat it multiple times and repeating, putting, dropping it once see what arises, maybe nothing arises. Dropping it again and see what arises sometimes different things arise as you drop it, drop it in. So, you know, you might drop it in and an intention can come up. Oh, I want to be happy. I'm here because I'm tired. I'm just exhausted. Okay, that's great. Okay. Because I want to serve or, you know, different layers can come up. That's another way you can work with dropping in the question, see what arises. And sometimes just as you were saying nothing might arise. So, so you work with this as a, Oh, my highest intention. It's, it is sacred to actually be asking this question. What a beautiful question to be asking. And that's how you ended up working with it. Lovely. Thank you for that. What a gift. Beautiful. Stephanie says, Oh, same here, Sarah. I love that Stephanie too. That's great. And I see Claire's hand is up so let's make it brief because I realized 649. So, yes, tell me what's up. What's up Claire Yeah. I had two contradict totally contradictory experiences was very funny. When you talked about speaking versus non speaking. I was originally trained to practice by focusing on a thought visual anyway, and letting go of all my thinking altogether. And just, and that's the way I prefer so I thought I was going with what you were saying, I said, Oh, I'm going to go back to what I know because it really works for me. And you started to talk. And you talked about the door and coming back home and it was so helpful to me. This doesn't make sense. I just said to myself, you know, talking, but because I tend to be out in the world a lot. I like to interact with people. Yeah. I forget to come back to myself. I love it. I love it. And this is what it's doing for me. Great. I love it. I love it. I hear so it's like, Okay, quiet silence. Yes, that's what I mean. But you know, oh wow, this talking actually these guided the guidance is so helpful because I forget beautiful. Thank you, Claire. That's lovely. It's hardwarming and Kenneth. I wonder, would it be okay to come back to you after the groups. I see your hand is up. Yes. Okay, great. Because it's 650 I want to make sure we have time for the summer. This is around the time we transition so when we come back from the group Kenneth you're up, so would love to hear from you. So, the invitation now is as we go into the small groups invitation so the invitation is a lot of times what comes up for practice is comparing mind we compare ourselves less than greater than bigger than my son is bigger their intention is bigger. What if we drop all that my practice, but better there's is better just dropping all that what if we just drop all that. If you're just showing up just. We're just showing up as if with beginners I as beginners eyes as if you're first time practitioner you've just shown up you're, you're, you know, Martian or your baby you've just shown up on this earth, you're just, ah, here are other babies. See what that feels like. Okay. Let's try this out. And the rooms are open. Enjoy. Everyone's back, and we seem to have just one minute left and Kenneth Kenneth here. I think Kenneth had to leave. So, okay, can't hear from Kenneth but does anybody have any quick comments to one comment to make something you noticed about this new way of being in the group perhaps different way or going once, going twice. All right, since it's seven o'clock. Let's let's wrap up and I trust that I'll stay a couple minutes extra actually today. If anybody has any questions or comments. It's the Friday special so stay calm. It's like you know, at IMC I would sometimes I would say late so that people can ask questions or just hang out a little bit. So maybe I'll just stay a few minutes extra afterwards. So, but let's formally close our beautiful session of practice together. Thank you for showing up for your practice for yourself, and for all beings everywhere. May all beings be well, may all beings be happy. Thank you. Now.
