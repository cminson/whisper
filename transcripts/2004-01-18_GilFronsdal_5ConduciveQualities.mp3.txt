 There is a remarkable story preserved in the teachings of the Buddha about a monk who had trouble with his meditation practice. His name was Magia and he was for a period of time the attendant for the Buddha. The Buddha was often retreat, he was living on some mountain someplace and with Magia as his only attendant. One morning Magia went out for alms as the customers for Buddhist monks and to collect food. He collected his food and then had his meal of the day and then he went for a walk to exercise his legs a little bit and maybe kind of help with his digestion after eating. He came across a charming mango grove at the edge of the river and he thought this would be a great place for me to meditate. So he went back to the Buddha and said I found this really beautiful place, this mango grove by the side of the river. It's a perfect place for a monk to go and endeavor in spiritual practice. May I go there and endeavor? And the Buddha says wait Magia until another monk has come to be with me. The Buddha doesn't want to be alone for some reason. And Magia asks again, I found this really wonderful place, it would really be good. I still haven't finished my practice, it would be good for me to go there and really plunge into my practice. And the Buddha said a second time, no, just wait until someone else comes. And then a third time Magia asked the Buddha and asking three times is a kind of a, there's a I think a whole lore about asking three times in Indian religious circles and it means like certainly if you're really serious. And so when he asked three times the Buddha can't say no anymore and he says go and endeavor as you like. So Magia goes off to his beautiful mango grove and sits down to meditate. And then sometimes later he comes back to the Buddha and says it's really amazing. In one translation it says it's really awesome. And another translation I've seen he says, comes back and says it's really wonderful, it's marvelous. Here I was, I've gone forth into the monastic life from serious about my meditation practice, serious about spiritual discipline. And I found these wonderful conditions to meditate in and just grove and sitting down to meditate. And as I sit there, I am assailed by three kinds of thoughts. I'm assailed by thoughts of sensual desire, I'm assailed by thoughts of ill will, and I'm assailed by thoughts of causing harm, doing harm. And my meditation practice is not working, not getting anywhere because of this stuff, it's coming. So then the Buddha says to him, oh, for someone who is not yet mature in liberating their mind, there are five conditions, five qualities that bring about the maturity of liberation of mind. So here we have this monk who's having trouble with his meditation practice. And even though he has very good intention, he's inspired in his practice. And I think many people who practice for long periods of time certainly practice meditation will go through periods of time where they have difficulty with their meditation, I think they do. Some people have difficulty from the first day if they start doing it. And some people maybe are like the monk or beginner's luck, they're quite inspired. And early time of their meditation practice, it works really well. And then at some point, might run into some difficulties in practice, it makes it difficult to continue. Or sometimes people run into a dry spell, meditation seems kind of stale or uninspiring. Or sometimes we run into a phase where it just doesn't have any meaning anymore, it made so much sense early on. But you know, he's done it for a while, and it just doesn't make any sense, has no purpose or meaning anymore. And why are you doing this? And there are other things more interesting to do, perhaps. And sooner or later, I think it's often useful to think of spiritual life, any part of life, but spiritual life and meditation life, to go through cycles, through phases. And so you'll be visited by many phases as you go through the practice over a long time. And then learning how to be wise about these different phases is a very important part of the practice. And what to do with practice when it's no longer fresh, and when it feels stale, and you're uninspired by it. Or when you come across something, it's just really difficult to sit there. Strong emotions and feelings, or strong thoughts arise. And just, you know, you keep pulling you away, pulling you away, or just making you really restless or agitated, impatient to get on with things. Or meditation practice is not enjoyable. You do it diligently, but actually the end of the sitting, you feel worse than you did before. You feel kind of like your energy level has kind of been drained in the process rather than being revived by it or refreshed by meditation. Or perhaps maybe even a little bit, maybe a little bit of headache, or something kind of from the strain or pushing or trying so hard. Or there are times when people get really discouraged from meditation. For many reasons with their meditation practice. And it feels really, you know, difficult to keep it up because of all the discouragement. You know, why should I do this? And, you know, and there are many reasons for that discouragement. So here we have one story of a monk who's having trouble with his meditation practice. And the five qualities that help conditions and help bring about the maturity of awareness, maturity of this kind of liberation through awareness, I think are five qualities that might be helpful to look at, be reminded of maybe in all situations where we're being challenged by our meditation practice or find difficult to do. And so I'll just go through these and then talk about them a little bit. And then maybe talk about some other ways of understanding the difficulties and maybe some of the ways of working with it. So the Buddha said and replied to this monk. The first quality is having admirable people as friends, companions and comrades. I know the translation would be good spiritual friends, to have beautiful people, admirable people as friends, companions and comrades. And the second quality is being virtuous, living a virtuous life, living a life of integrity. Lately, I've been making a terrible pun on the word enlightenment and saying that the prefix is all wrong. It's not that two different letters should be at the front of enlightenment. And the letters should be G-O instead of E-N. So go light. And it's terrible pun, but it also points to something that if we can go through our life lightly, be light about ourselves, about our life itself, I think that that's one of the, makes it a lot easier to meditate, to be engaged in spiritual life than if we're heavy and burdened by our life or troubled by it. And part of the function of living a life of integrity is to help us live a life that's light. That we can light in a life not filled with remorse or regret or worry or fear, embarrassment or shame or just preoccupation with things. So to live a life which is virtuous, to live a life which is light. I also like the word light because rather than virtue here, because we tend to narrow the meaning of virtue, a virtuous life, to maybe a moral life, an ethical life. And for the Buddha, the idea of virtue was much broader than that. It had to do with all the ways in which we act in the world that are supportive of, or not supportive of developing our inner life or developing this liberation through awareness. And so to find a way to live lightly. And one of the things I think challenges a lot of people in the kind of lifestyle that many people live here in the modern west is being overly busy. It seems to be epidemic, contagious. This phenomena of having so many things to do and so many, we just have so many opportunities and so many things that can be done and so many messages that we should do them all. And I know a lot of people who are just really busy, they fill their time with activities all the time. And many of them are worthwhile. And if meditation practice is just an appendage to a very busy life, it can be very hard to get real meaning from the meditation practice. Certainly some of the deeper meanings of it that's possible, some of the deeper value of it. And so the goal light implies not just simply living a virtuous life, but it implies living a life so that meditation practice maybe is at the center of it or there's enough space around the meditation practice so the meditation practice can really have a meaning in our life rather than just kind of shoved into the corners of our day. I think that if a person is very busy and active and having a lot of active things going on in their life and they sit down to meditate, the mind's going to keep racing. And if your meditation practice is 30 minutes long, it might race the whole 30 minutes. But if you have enough time before you sit down to meditate to have a cup of tea or go for a little walk or look out the window for 10 minutes and let somebody's things settle away, then you sit down to meditate. The meditation practice is going to be much more valuable than if it just spent 30 minutes in your mind racing. So to go light, to create a context for your meditation practice that there's time for it, you're kind of relaxed before you can do it, kind of open in something. So some people like to do meditation first thing in the morning because of that reason. There's less going on than the mind, it's not churned up so much. So to live a virtuous life, a life life. The third quality is to be able to hear at will easily and without difficulty talk. And this translator has it, talk that is... I won't read the part first, the censor at the time being. Talk that is conducive to the opening of awareness. So nowadays we can... that didn't have books. So the only way you could do it was to hear things, hear teaching. But maybe we could say now to have libraries and bookstores close by, to have a lot of books available or to have tapes or be able to hear. But to be able to hear directly from someone, there's a qualitatively difference between that that said than being able to just read about the Dharma. So to be able to hear at will easily and without difficulty, talk that is conducive to the opening of awareness. And the word that I dropped out is in this translation, talk that is truly sobering. And I'm not sure if that's the right word. Maybe it's a good one, but I haven't looked at the Pali word. Another translator has this as words, talk that is self-effacing. So some word there, but conducive to the opening of awareness. And then he gives examples, that is... So what do you think? And before I give you this, what do you think is the talk that is conducive to the opening of awareness? So in other words, to hear talks and Dharma talks or something that is inspiring, is certainly something that keeps meditation practice going and fresh and alive for people. But not just inspiring because inspiration itself can be a dead end. And that's one of the reasons why some people have difficulty with meditation practice, is that they've been inspired in ways that are unrealistic. And so they engage in the practice and they feel really great hope and vitality at first because they're involved with this great idealistic thing, but it's not going to go there in your mind, your heart. And so after a while you get discouraged, oh, I'm not getting there, nothing's happening here. It's two o'clock already and I'm not fully enlightened. And so we have to be very careful about how we get inspired and what we get inspired by. And some people are inspiration junkies and they just don't have much of a real core to the spiritual life themselves, but they go around and just get inspired all the time and they feel kind of buoyed and hopeful by that. And it can be a dead end to me discouraging after a while, or it can just keep a person hovering for a long time at a kind of inspirational level and never really develop some core inner strength or core meaning for themselves of what this spiritual life can be about, the practice life can be about. So this list is interesting. This is a talk, this is the kind of talk the Buddha thought was conducive to the opening of awareness. Talk on modesty. How many of you are inspired by talks on modesty? That just kind of really gets you revved up and ready to go. Talk on modesty, on contentment, on seclusion, on non-entanglement, on the arousing of persistence, on virtue, on concentration, on discernment, on release, and on the knowledge and vision of release. So he's kind of laying down a sequence here, which he often does, of kind of almost steps to a spiritual life. You know, there's many kind of descriptions of kind of steps or paths that are somewhat built on each other and it could be seen this way here, kind of building on each other. So I'm quite happy with the idea that modesty and contentment comes first, that somehow, that we're looking to be inspired in practice, the first mirror is turned towards you directly, not on some great ideal of what you can attain, but rather on some very simple thing that you can do for yourself, change yourself. And maybe the word modesty doesn't work for many of you, but maybe there's some other word like that that makes you maybe happy, maybe feel happy, maybe feel at home, feel like you're not chasing after egotistical identities or stressful ambitions, but rather some sense of kind of being at home or being modest or not being puffed up or not being assertive or aggressive or I don't know what whatever it is, but some way that you've been changed in a way that inspires you. That's the first thing, rather than saying, you know, go out and hear some, you know, rip roaring talk about how beautiful enlightenment is, the first thing you should learn about is modesty or something like that. Rip roaring talk on modesty. And then the second is contentment and I've been told that some of the Silicon Valley corporations would not hire someone who showed up for a job interview and said that one of the strong spiritual qualities they've cultivated is contentment. Because what you want is people who are not content because you want to have ambition and drive and you want to get some place, you know, with your company and someone's content is not going to have that kind of drive. And so maybe don't tell your boss, you know, what your spiritual life is about. But some, I mean, I think one of the most beautiful qualities a person can have is the quality of contentment. Some people are afraid of contentment because it feels like contentment is not going to allow them to be creative or have some kind of great enthusiasm for different activities in life. I don't think that follows necessarily. You can be enthusiastically involved in things and still be so content, really content in yourself. The enthusiastic involvement doesn't come out of a neediness or trying to fill a hole or an emptiness, but rather comes from, you know, being really centered in yourself. And from that, from that centeredness comes activity in the world, not from an attempt to fill some hole that we have. And then the word seclusion is a fascinating one. I like to call it independence, sometimes translated as solitude. But some ability both physically, in real life terms, but also in the mind to dwell independent and separated from all the things we get caught by and caught up in. And meditation practice itself is kind of often described in the tradition as kind of seclusion process. We go off into a room quietly under a quiet tree by ourselves and we close our eyes and we willfully let go of many of the concerns and activities that normally we do, maybe often healthy things we do in normal life for a period of time. So we can kind of regroup, find out what's really going on with us ourselves and plunge deeper into our psyche than we can if we stay continually involved in all the activities of the world. Probably if you read the newspaper every day, all day, and that's all you did, you're probably not going to drop as deeply down into yourself than if you sat under a tree at the hydrant park for the day. So sometimes we need to separate ourselves from some of the activities of our life to really be able to get some depth. And so that's what the word seclusion implies. The non-entanglement, letting go of the ways we're attached or entangled with things, at least temporarily, talks on arousing persistence. So this is being persistent in our practice, they maintain continuity of practice all the time. And this is one of the really important keys to an ongoing meditation practice. There's value in doing meditation practice, you know, I would say there's value in doing meditation practice, you know, just once there's value. And so I'm never going to say, if someone comes to me and says, you know, I only have a chance to meditate once in my lifetime, is that okay? And I say, sure. It's like, you know, the story about the monks in the monastery who wanted to smoke, I say during the intro class sometimes, the monks, two monks want to smoke in the monastery. So they go to the one says, I'm going to go ask the abbot. And he asked the abbot, is it okay to smoke while I pray? And the abbot said, no, when you pray, just pray. And so he leaves the office kind of dejected. And the second monk says, well, let me have a chance to ask the abbot. So he goes in and he comes out smiling and says, no problem, we can smoke. What did you say? Well, I asked him, is it okay to pray while we smoke? And the abbot said, of course you should pray in all your activities. So meditating just once is probably great. But meditating, you know, persistently all the time on a regular basis every day, when daily practice is really helpful a lot. And sometimes it's like maybe exercising or eating good food, healthy food. It doesn't, not always enjoyable to exercise. But you've experienced the benefits afterwards. And meditation practice can be that sometimes, that it's not enjoyable to do. But some people feel loud really makes a difference in the rest of my day. And so people will maintain it on a regular basis because of that. But to listen to talks that inspire you to be persistent, to be consistent, to keep it up day after day after day is a very important way of being inspired to keep going when things are difficult. Some difficulties will work themselves out on their own. And the persistence is really the key. Sometimes we get, we ride our difficulties very closely. And we think, oh, I have to fix this, I have to solve it. It's so important. So, you know, I'm so desperate about it. And all you need to do is to stay attentive and aware in the middle of it and be very honest about it being there. You don't necessarily have to fix it. And sometimes to be caught by the, by the fix it virus, fix it bug that people get, get. It just makes our meditation practice so much more difficult. But if you stop trying to fix your problems in meditation, just try to be aware of them and maintain the persistence through time. You'll be amazed how many things just kind of dissolve on their own and don't need to be fixed. Then the other virtue, concentration, discernment, release. That's a third. The fourth is to be persistent in abandoning unskillful mental states and qualities and being persistent in cultivating skillful qualities. So this is a very important idea in Buddhism that you have skillful and unskillful. But to start having some discernment in our life, are those quality states, activities that help move us in the direction of greater health, spiritual health, mental health in this case, and those that move us away. So if we live our life that's very stressful, sometimes it's more important to evaluate our life and see are the ways of changing that than it is to meditate. If we're trying to simply to meditate in order to de-stress, then we go back into a stressful situation over and over again. After a while, you might get discouraged by it all. And so to evaluate what is it that's healthy and what is unhealthy in the way that I live my life and about the way that I use my mind, the way I use my feelings, my motivations, what's healthy and unhealthy in the way that I use my speech and the way I talk. So to evaluate things by whether they're healthy or unhealthy and start to move our life in the direction of that which is healthy is considered to be very important quality that supports meditation practice or this maturing of of awareness of liberation through awareness. And then the last one is discerning, being wise about seeing directly into the arising and passing of things. And this has a wide range of intensities or it means to have some sensitivity to how things arise and pass, sensitivity to impermanence. And for some people this can be very dramatic when they're aware of death. And death can be very arousing to in a person's spiritual practice. And oh yeah, this is important, I got to do this. And to be reminded of that, not in a morbid way but in a way that really inspires us that this life is precious. And so you know maybe it's more important to actually get serious about some kind of spiritual practice or meditation practice than it is to play solitaire one more time on the computer or something like that. And so sometimes the reflection on impermanence and life and death can make a real difference to kind of put a little bit of fire underneath our meditation practice. But then in a very refined way to start seeing the arising and passing of things in the moment to moment way in which they think arise and pass. And this is hard to kind of imagine what this means unless you've developed your meditation practice for some time. But it's really remarkable how a lot of things that happen in meditation experience or normal things, our feelings, our thoughts, our body sensations, many things that even can trouble us or inspire us, have a quality within them that they're actually not really constant. But with a strong concentration you see that they're actually almost like flashing into existence. They arise and they pass very quickly. And your relationship to those things will be very different when you see the arising and passing moment by moment. And it actually can be somewhat disconcerting at times to see it. But also can be quite inspiring because you realize that there's nothing there that has any persistence, any constancy there to trouble you or to get in your way towards movement towards liberation. I don't know if I can reconstruct this little story, this little event that I did when I was guiding someone in her meditation practice. She was a long time Zen student, very strong concentration. And I was teaching her a little bit about Vipassana practice, how you could do it. And we were sitting next to each other and she was sitting in meditation and I was kind of talking her through it and she was telling me what was going on as she was meditating. And it was something like this where she said, oh, I feel some anger. And it was a common theme for her in her life was anger. And I said, okay, feel your anger, where do you feel it in your body? I feel this tightness in my stomach. Okay, so stay there, feel it. And notice what happens after a while. She said, oh, it went goes away. And then, fine. And then what's happening now? I'm not feeling a bit afraid. Great. Where do you feel your fear? I feel it. She sits somewhere else. And the fear went away after a while. And then she said, I'm feeling confused because these things, these things just keep going away. She's used to them. She's always with her normally. And she, her identity was tied to this anger and a little bit of fear. And she wasn't unfamiliar with it being disappearing so quickly. So I'm confused. And I said, okay, be aware of your confusion. And then she kind of opened her eyes and looked at me and build her way. Like I had done it in that trick. The confusion had gone away. And I like to shoot, you know, there's no place to stand. There's nothing, you know, no place left, you know. So the idea that, you know, at some point in meditation practice, see how things are so impermanent that there's no place for us to stay long enough to make a conclusion that life is this way, or I am this way. Isn't that something? So those are the five qualities. And the first one is to have good friends and or some good comrades or companions. And I like that they extend it to all three kind of friends, companions and comrades. Some people who are here, the context of good friend means someone who is engaged in the same practice you're involved in. So that you can be inspired by them, encouraged by them, get feedback from them, learn from them. And that's the first quality that Buddha gives. It's important for the maturing of practice. And so coming here to meditation group is very important. Going on retreats can be very important for that reason, because you realize that other people are doing the same thing and you're inspired by those people. But also having maybe one or two companions or buddies or someone who you can check in with on a personal level from time to time. Sometimes it's a teacher, sometimes it's just someone who feels more like a peer in the Dharma. And you take them out for coffee and say, you know, I'd like to hear a little bit about how your practice is or how it's going or your experience in practice. Learn from them a little bit or share your experiences a little bit. It can be very, very valuable. If your meditation practice is not enjoyable or valuable, then you need to look at it more carefully and seriously. There are certainly times when it's not going to be that way. And then you have to keep just keep practicing. But if it persists for a long time that way, then you want to do some very careful evaluation. And one of the ways to do it is to come and talk to a teacher about it. But, you know, explore why is it not enjoyable? Why is it not enjoyable? What is it? Something about the way you do it, the technique, perhaps, or the attitude you're bringing. Maybe you have too high expectation or maybe you're too hesitant or maybe the hindrances are coming to play too much. Or maybe you haven't set up the conditions around yourself, around the meditation time to make the meditation really enjoyable. Some people find meditating and first thing in the morning, maybe before anybody else has woken up, to be very deeply satisfied because of simply the peace and being left alone and the quiet that that involves. And so it's very enjoyable the whole time because of the context that's just been created for it. So that's what the Buddha said to Magiya. Then, on realizing the significance of what he had just said, the Buddha then exclaimed. And this is in a, this sutta is in a, this discourse is in a collection called the inspired utterances. And because every once in a while the Buddha would be inspired to just produce a poem on the spot. Just boom, you know, back in, before they had writing and writing and stuff and people are much more poetic just spontaneously. And so he just kind of composed this poem just inspired by his own teachings, I guess. Little thoughts, subtle thoughts, when followed, steer up the heart. Not comprehending the thoughts of the heart, one runs here and there, the mind out of control. But comprehending the thoughts of the heart, one who is ardent, mindful, ardent and mindful, restrains them. When followed, they steer up the heart. One who is awakened lets them go without trace. So please don't let your thoughts steer you up. Don't pick them up. Leave them alone because someone who's awakened, they, you like, the thoughts are let go without any trace. Thoughts arise and they let go of and there's no, they leave no momentum, no trace of themselves in the mind, no energy in the mind, no momentum, no feelings, no emotions, no further thoughts. So maybe that's enough for today, unless you want more. It feels like enough. If you guys have any questions or comments, you ever feel like Magia? Does he drop it there? Does he drop it? In terms of the way. Does he finally get it? I don't think he, you know, there's not, yeah, you know, it doesn't, doesn't go that far. It doesn't say. Yeah. In some of the longer discourses at the end, there's a little comment about how the monks or nuns or the people, the audience received the teachings. Usually they're happy. Sometimes they're enlightened, but at least in one discourse, they're unhappy. And that's always good for Dharma teachers to remember that at the end of a Dharma talk, the audience isn't necessarily supposed to be feeling happy. Even the Buddha, you know, got people feeling unhappy at the end. So one of these days I'll get you really good and unhappy. Yes. And what's the penalty for giving a talk on contentment? It's like a satisfaction. Sorry? It's like a satisfaction. Well, that's quite interesting. And, well, there is maybe something subversive about Buddhism. To value yourself. To value yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes meditation, what meditation practice can do for us has no economic value. And it has no value in the kind of society sometimes that people live in. It doesn't, you know, it's not making you more money and it's not, you know, educating you about, you know, the latest whatever that, you know, information that you need to have or there's all these things that, you know, the other people value, you know, it doesn't make you more interesting in cocktail parties. Nothing seemingly, but I've noticed sometimes when people meditate, there's a kind of a, sometimes a kind of beauty that seems to shine out from the inside. And even when people are deeply contented in a very nice way, there's kind of a beauty that shines through that. And, but it has no, you know, it's hard for, you know, to be valued. So I agree with you. It can be hard. That's why having friends or companions is very helpful, very important so that we don't realize that we have more support for that change. Yeah. Mm. and study meditation, and I think a good group of scientists who are people can actually affect things like crime rights. And some social scientists are pretty skeptical of the way that justice seems to be fairly credible. I don't remember if it's in part of the streets, but it's possible. Maybe someone will go check the Redwood City police records and see if the crime on Birch Street has gone down since we moved here. The interesting thing about meditation having meaning and value. In the Zen tradition, I practice this, they sometimes like to say that zazen had no meaning at all. Part of the value of saying it has no value is that the mind is so conditioned to always go after something, to want something, even beautiful things, wholesome things. But if the mind is really going to be free, it has to stop going after things. And so for the mind to do an activity which is meaningless, it pulls the rug from underneath all the neurotic attempts to try to get meaning. So in Zen they like to tell you there's no meaning. And you go there and you struggle with that. In our tradition we like to tell you there's some. And so you don't get to struggle as much. But maybe that's good for beginners. But sooner or later, you have to see there's no meaning. But sooner or later you have to let go of all meaning. Not that there is no meaning, but if the mind is concerned about it, it's an obstacle. Do you think that, this is such a... when you begin this mindless meditation, that neurotic mind just talks about... It's almost like, is it possible that it gets worse? And then it turns to the stuff that you're trying to do? Because you've been doing it and it's been neurotic for so long? Sometimes it gets worse. Sometimes it's like a trapped rat that, once it's trapped, runs around even faster. But eventually it's going to get tired. Sometimes it can be very frightening for the ego or for a normal way the mind works to be challenged or realize there's another way. And sometimes as we meditate, the mind quiets down and we get agitated because we realize we have to pay attention to something that's very quite painful. That we don't really... sometimes it's painful memories, sometimes it pays painful feelings and all kinds of things. And so sometimes it seems seemingly we go backwards in meditation practice rather than forward because we have to go through this period of dealing with things which we've been ignoring for a long time. Until that rat is dead, running around neurotic, exhausted, wounded, everything that is until it's really dead, shouldn't that ever happen? So sometimes we hold on to being wounded because... There's always another way to hang on to that rat, whether it's running around or exhausted or whatever. Last one then, George. I think that's a sense of likeness to me. I think actually the pursuit of my powers working, I think that I must have surprised it for me because then it becomes something like I want to manipulate so I can introduce it. Something that I've just thought about while you're talking, there's definitely a community of ministry to encourage and embrace that. I think that's a common thing. I think the practice is actually told by manipulation. I don't feel as if I'm going to the meeting of the problem. But maybe I won't be confident in the one that's last in the day. I think persistence is very important and also keeping the practice very simple. The real goal is just to be mindful. If you set up any other ambitious goal, it often will get in the way and cause discouragement. Just be mindful and trust the mindfulness or the mystery of that. It's a very profound way of practicing. Sometimes if you find meditation practice a challenge, for many other reasons it could be a challenging, one solution to that challenge is then to do more of it. Sometimes if you don't sit long enough for the daily sitting practice, and they sit only long enough to kind of daily stuff, the agitation kind of settles down. They never have gone beyond the level of settling the agitation. But if you sit longer, then you can settle the agitation from the day and then go into some other interesting place with the meditation practice. Or sitting longer, you can see more clearly what's going on. So you must try that. If you're finding yourself challenged sometime with your meditation practice, try sitting more. So thank you very much. I hope this was useful.
