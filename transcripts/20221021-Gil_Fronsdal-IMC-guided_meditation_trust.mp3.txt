 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello, and welcome to this meditation session and to the talk that we'll follow. And as an introduction, I want to use an analogy that if you learn to float in water, or learn to swim in water, and then can feel very comfortable and confident in the water, so that you can flip over on your back and float. Maybe you're even in a salted body of water, a salt lake, salted lake, or something that you're, with the salt, we're even much more buoyant. And you just stretch back, lay, and float on the water. And there's a way in which then we're trusting the buoyancy of the water, the water. We know how to rest in the water, be in the water, and there's a kind of a trust to it. People who swim are trusting that they'll float, but they don't even think about the trust. It's just so obvious. It's like, you know, it's just so taken for granted, almost a second nature. But there is a trust. And same way, when we do Dharma practice, we are trusting. We're learning to trust something that holds us up. The word Dharma, the etymology of it, literally means that which supports something that holds up. And so the Dharma holds us up, and to be a little bit more practical about it, it's the practice that holds us up. We can trust the practice. And, you know, that's not always so obvious, but over time, people who practice a lot learn more and more that if they practice, if they stay in the practice, even if they don't see the benefits immediately, they can trust the practice. It's like saying you can trust honesty, you can trust being present, you can trust being present and non-reactive. There's something deep that arises, that's available, that comes with that kind of practice. But more broadly, people will trust the Dharma sometimes, and that means trusting some of the basic principles. Trusting non-harming, trusting being ethical, trusting kindness, compassion. And so to put the meditation practice in the context of this kind of trust. And if you're new to meditation, the trust obviously and appropriately won't be there. But as we keep practicing, the trust infuses the practice, or is connected to the practice that we do. And that trust, we're trusting something, the Dharma, the practice, that is an association of meaning. We're assigning a certain kind of characteristic to the meditation, the characteristic being that it's not just our own efforts. There's something else very profound, maybe even more important than what we do, that holds us up. Maybe the practice becomes second nature to float in the practice, in the Dharma. So with that as an introduction, you can maybe take a posture, assume a posture, where the posture is a posture of trust, a posture that you can somehow relax very deeply, knowing or as if you know that you're going to be in a trustworthy, safe, supported during the meditation. Almost as if the meditation will support you. No matter what happens, trust the meditation, trust the mindfulness, trust the... Keep showing up and being present. Don't trust the reactivity, don't trust the judgments, the bias, the fears. But trust the clear, honest awareness that there are judgments and fears, reactivity. Trust the practice of attention, trust awareness. Taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. Breathing in deeply, preparing yourself for going into the water or into a delightful place where you can trust. If water is not a good analogy, maybe your mattress is trusting going to bed, laying there. Breathing in deeply and long, relaxing exhale, softening your body. Letting the breathing return to normal. Maybe on the exhale, relaxing into your body. Maybe like you're lowering yourself into a pool of water. As you exhale, lower yourself into your body. And in this body of yours, is there some location in the body that you associate with a kind of trust or confidence that I've been talking about? When you trust deeply, where in your body does that seem to live? Yes. And so sitting here, maybe breathing through this place, breathing from it, breathing with the trust that being aware, being present is trustworthy more than anything else for these minutes. And if you wander away from that place of trust, then when you remember, remember that place, come back to that trust and let the trust be the source or the support for this awareness practice we do. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, being aware, being attentive in mindfulness here and now, not contending with anything, opposing or favoring anything, just aware, aware of the breathing, the body, and maybe in the middle of the awareness, can there be trust? You trust the awareness, floating in the awareness, not so much doing awareness, but resting in it, allowing it floating. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, and then as we come to the end of the sitting, a meditation where trust has been evoked, there are other things to trust when we trust, other things than just awareness that we trust when we're in the Dharma, we can trust generosity, being generous, trust kindness, friendliness, trust compassion and care, especially when the opposite of those are strong for us, we have to be careful not to trust those, we have to learn to practice with them and be wise about it, but the idea of entrusting ourselves to them, giving ourselves over to being greedy or miserly, being unkind, mean, angry, hostile, uncaring. In the Dharma, this is what is dangerous. And where our safety is found is in generosity and kindness and care. And when we trust those, it turns out that it's easier to trust than to trust the other. It turns out that it's easier to trust being aware. It's also more wonderful and wondrous to be aware in the context of wishing well to others, wishing well to oneself. May it be that your trust of the Dharma, your trust of mindfulness is strengthened with your good will, well-wishing to others. May it be that you wish well to those people in your life, those you encounter. May others be happy. May others be safe. May others be peaceful. May others be free. And may I trust enough, may each of us trust enough to float on those wishes, to be free. And may I trust enough to float on those wishes, to act on those wishes. May we benefit, bring benefit and welfare to others. Thank you.
