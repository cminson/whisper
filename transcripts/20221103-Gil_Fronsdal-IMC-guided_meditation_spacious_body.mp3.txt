 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone. Warm greetings from here at Insight Meditation Center. Dark morning. I think it's just a little teeny bit of hint of light in the sky out the windows. So what I'd like to say today from preparation of this meditation is that one of the discoveries in doing mindfulness meditation, maybe a lot of meditation that goes kind of deep concentrated enough, is how much our experience is mediated by concepts. Concepts that run quite deep in the mind, so we don't really realize that we're living in concepts. And so to give a very simple idea that I'm looking here now, that the camera for seeing you all on YouTube is on top of a bookcase with four shelves. I see it as a bookcase. If we go back in history, maybe only a few tens of thousands of years, and bring this bookcase to the people who lived on the planet at that time, I don't think they would have seen it as a bookcase. I don't know what they would have thought about it, and I wouldn't know how they would use it. Maybe they'd put it down flat on the ground on its back and use it to store different things, to distinct, or maybe they store kindling for wood. Maybe it was a kindling holder. I don't know, but they wouldn't see it as a bookcase, I'm sure. And the idea of seeing a bookcase, I can do effortlessly. It's like I don't have to think about, conceive, or have a thought bookcase. What else could it be? But as we sit and meditate, this subtle conceptual mind begins to quiet and quiet. And not seeing it as a bookcase in the deep meditation is not a big deal particularly, or relevant. But what happens with the eyes closed, meditating, is that the concepts we have of our body begins to dissolve, begins to stop operating. So I think a couple of days ago I clipped my fingernails, and in my meditations since then I have not thought once about my fingernails. But I could have. I could have thought my fingernails now short. Maybe I didn't cut them quite right. Maybe they should have been more curved or rounded or this way or that way. And I'm having fingernail thoughts. But luckily for me, I was able to meditate without thinking about my fingernails. I could think about, you know, that meditation think about my hair. And I have thoughts about my hair and how long it is and should I get a haircut or this or that. But luckily I did not have to think about my hair during meditation. And so my hair and my fingernails receded from attention, receded from awareness, something I wasn't really, it wasn't really in my experience, it wasn't really something that I thought about or that I perceived. Partly in meditation to perceive fingernails and hair, I kind of need to have some concept idea that's operating. But without them, they recede. They kind of disappear. And so as we sit and meditate, if we sit in front of a mirror and look at our face, we have all kinds of face thoughts. But when we're sitting closed, with eyes closed, there's no, maybe very few thoughts about the face. And the face is not, it can still be a concept when we think about, but there's no direct seeing of the face because there's no mirror. That eyes are open. And the ideas of our face come from memory and ideas unless they're kind of itching or pressure or tinkling in the face, warmth in the face, then we feel sensations. But those sensations can occur without the clear mental image or clear self-conscious thought about what our face looks like. So this is a way of trying to explain that as we meditate deeper and deeper, the definitions, the ideas, the concepts that we use for the body begin to quiet down. And we begin finding the body after a while has no boundaries. It has no edges. It has the things that we, of course we have these things in the body, but the conceiving of it, the perception of it quiets down. And this entering into a world where the body is experienced, is not experienced as solid, not experienced as bounded, not experienced as something conceived or remembered. And it's just all these different sensations, but the sensations can exist without connecting it to a concept of that place. The warmth I feel in the moment in my hand, I can say hand, but I can also just experience the warmth without any concept of hand. It's kind of like in and of itself, the warmth that just kind of hovering in a certain kind of space and exists quite capably, independently of idea of hand. The edges of the hand disappear and they're just warmth and other sensations there. So this is a direction that meditation goes as the mind gets quieter, the conceiving mind, the thinking mind, the defining mind gets quieter, that the body begins to get more diffuse, lighter, wispier. It feels feeling that there's lots of space in the body, that the edges are porous or the edges are diffuse, the edges disappear. So taking a comfortable upright posture, begin with being very clear idea of having a body and you assume a nice posture with this body. And within this body, aware of eyes, enclosing the eyes. In this body, a clear concept of breathing and where breathing occurs in the body. And feeling what changes in your body as you take some long, slow, deep breaths, relaxing the shoulders on the exhale, relaxing the belly, letting the breathing return to normal. On the exhale, relaxing the face muscles. And on the exhale, relaxing, calming your thinking, the thinking mind. So in the beginning of meditation, concepts, ideas of the body are useful. And then to begin settling into breathing. And many of the concepts of body are no longer needed, letting them go in favor of being attuned to the sensations of breathing, the rhythm of breathing. And as you breathe, let the energy go in favor of the body. Let the attention receive, take in sensations of the body breathing. Where what part of the body do you feel those sensations you don't have to think about? You don't have to operate with an idea, concept, image, of chest to feel the movements there, belly to feel the movements there. Just movements, just pressure, release of pressure, expansion, contraction. With every exhale, quieting the thinking mind. Or with every exhale, letting go of your thoughts, letting them drift away like clouds drifting in the sky. Need more breathing. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. Exhale. As you're meditating, there might be parts of your body for which you have no perceptions of unless you think about it. For example, you might not be perceiving the toenail of your middle toe on your left foot. Maybe during this meditation so far there's been no perception of one of the knuckles on your hand until you go looking for it. If there's no backrest you're leaning against, the perceptions of your back rib cage are probably much more subtle than the front rib cage. Maybe there's a feeling of space around the subtle sensations of the back ribs. Edges are diffuse. Attune yourself to how within the body that there's plenty of locations where there's more sense of space than there is clear sensations. They're not sharp boundaries. And becoming aware of the space between sensations of your body. And in that place of space, diffusion, absence of concepts, might there be a feeling of peace, stillness, maybe even safety. If there is, stay close to that. Breathe with it. And to rest for a few minutes in the spaciousness of the body. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to imagine or feel or sense that the body is porous, that it's mostly made up of space, at least the body that we directly perceive with the eyes closed, the body that is not conceived, but rather perceived through the senses, that that perceived body is diffuse, spacious, open. And that the words people speak travels right through that space, not touching anything. The things that we see in the world, in a way, just kind of doesn't land in the space. The space is not troubled, agitated by anything. And so the heart can be receptive and open without reacting, contracting, asserting. In the spaciousness of the body, the heart can be kind, can move through the world with simple goodwill, looking upon all things kindly, looking upon all things with a generosity of care, with the spaciousness of the body. May we care for the welfare and happiness of others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Thank you.
