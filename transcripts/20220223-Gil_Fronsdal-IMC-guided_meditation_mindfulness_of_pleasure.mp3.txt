 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good day everyone. The topic these days this week is, we could call it just pleasure, but it's pleasure and pain. This pleasure doesn't quite work as the opposite, the pleasure and pain, so we say pleasant and unpleasant. But for this meditation I'd like to focus a bit on pleasure. There is the wise use of pleasure in meditation. Just as there is the growth of wisdom in regard to both pleasure and pain, the pleasant and unpleasant. But for now let's do the wisdom of pleasure in meditation. Let's assume that you will not become attached to pleasure, assume that you won't be chasing after pleasure or holding on clinging to the pleasure that might be there. Let's start with the idea that with a very relaxed open-handed way, open-minded way, we appreciate the pleasure that's here as part of meditation. And particularly those forms of meditative pleasure that make it easier for the mind to be present. I think the mind is happier being present for things which are pleasant than unpleasant. And so if we can find things that are pleasant in the meditation, that's part of the meditation, that support the mind, enthusiasm for being present, then it'll show up more in this present moment. So as we're meditating I'll guide you a little bit to experience pleasure. And I know that some of you will already have physical discomfort you're dealing with, physical pains. And I'm not trying to say that you won't have those or it's wrong to have those, but it might be that even with the presence of those, you could loosen up a little bit the focus on them or the concern with them just a little just enough so that you could also take in that which is pleasant. So you could also take in to... So taking a alert meditation posture. And if there's already some pleasure just in the posture, which can be the case for people who've been meditating for long enough that there's a kind of a visceral memory of the goodness of the posture, allow yourself to feel the pleasure of the posture. And then gently, maybe very gently so it's kind of enjoyable, take some deeper breaths just deep enough that it remains enjoyable. And is there a way that you can exhale that you enjoy as well? Maybe almost as if the enjoyment of ah as you exhale. And the joy of an inhale which is like a fresh breath of air filling the lungs. It's almost like you're smelling the freshness and taking a delightful inhale and a relaxing exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And if you can now, as you exhale, relax different parts of the body. But if you can notice any pleasantness or pleasure that comes with relaxation, with the relief. Maybe beginning with the muscles of the face. Releasing around the eyes, releasing around the cheeks and the jaws, releasing the shoulders, softening the shoulders. Softening and relaxing in the back. Exhaling your belly. the whole body, releasing any ways in which you're bracing yourself against life. And appreciating the way that there is some pleasure, enjoyment in any degree of relaxation or calm there is in the body. And then letting the attention settle on the body breathing. Familiarizing yourself with the experience of the body breathing. What moves in the body as you breathe, what expands and contracts, what sensations are activated and appear and disappear? And then as you experience your breathing, is there any pleasure, pleasantness in any of the sensations of breathing? Maybe the pleasure is more on the inhale, maybe it's more on the exhale. Maybe it's in the release of the chest as you exhale or the belly. Maybe it's the speed and flow of the inhale. Allow yourself to feel any pleasure that's present in breathing. Even if some of the breathing is uncomfortable, is there any part of it that is pleasant? Maybe the air going in now through the nostrils. Maybe the subtle expansion and contraction of the back rib cage. If there's a gap between the exhale and inhale, maybe the pleasure is in that pause. And if there are very simple ways you can adjust your breathing, adjusting it so it still feels like a natural breath, maybe adjusting by slowing the breathing down or a little bit faster, relaxing the belly and more belly breathing. Maybe a momentary pause at the end of the exhale where all things become still and peaceful. And if there's any pleasure in the breathing, be sure to feel that each time it appears, stay close to the pleasure of breathing and let the thinking mind become quieter so that you can better register the pleasantness, the pleasure, register it with your body. Let the mind be pulled into the pleasure of breathing. Let the mind be pulled into the pleasure of breathing, pulled into whatever meditative pleasure that's occurring for you. Gently allow yourself to be filled by it, awareness to be filled. Let it be a support for present moment mindfulness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Letting there be the kind of stillness that highlights the pleasure of meditation. And let the pleasure of meditation be a support for staying present. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Feeling whatever there is to enjoy about being physically present in your meditation. Any pleasure or pleasant sensations in your body, breathing. If you're more settled and calm in your body, maybe that is pleasant, enjoyable. As you breathe, breathe with the pleasure, breathe in and out with the enjoyment of sitting here and see if there's something you can learn about letting go by resting in the enjoyment of the moment. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to whatever degree of enjoyment there is for you, pleasure, pleasantness, how might that inspire you to wish pleasure, enjoyment to others, that they can go through the world experiencing well-being, ease, pleasure, delight, happiness. Maybe your own enjoyment can be something you wish others to experience as well. Wouldn't it be great if everyone could enjoy this life? We would probably care for each other more. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, we would probably be able to enjoy this life as well as to enjoy the life of others. May all beings be free of their afflictions and their pains and their sorrows. May all beings feel the pleasure and joy and happiness of life. May they be happy. May all beings be safe so they can enjoy this life. May all beings be peaceful so the simple pleasures of a life are available. May all beings be free so they can live a life that they enjoy and value and delight in. So we can live a life where we also delight and enjoy caring for each other. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. And may all beings be free. Thank you.
