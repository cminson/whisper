 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hello everyone. And contentment is a little maybe problematic when a person is broadcasting to hundreds of people. And that for a few moments here, I was just content to sit here and kind of was not thinking about that I was supposed to speak. So it is nice to be here. And I want to begin with just a story that hopefully you're generous with, going along with the interpretation. Because that's the point, it's the moral of the tale, not how well it fits the moral. And so because there's a spiritual seeker, who's very sincere, dedicated to the spiritual path, wants to find. But has been doing for a long time and hasn't had any success, whatever that might mean. And goes to find one of the most senior elder, wise people in that spiritual tradition. And explains the difficulty. And you know, been practicing for a long time and searching for a long time. To no avail. And the teacher says, oh, okay, it's not far away for you what you're seeking. But you have to seek, search, look, practice wholeheartedly. And the person said, what do you mean wholeheartedly? I've been sincere and dedicated. No, no, you have to practice wholeheartedly. Do that for a year and come back. So the person does that, is not quite sure what wholehearted means and tries all kinds of things. Sometimes strains too much and learns that that can't be wholehearted. And sometimes practice wholehearted relaxation, but that doesn't seem to be quite it. Sometimes kind of evokes all the faith the person has, lots of faith in the spiritual path. But that doesn't seem to quite do it. But keeps trying, keeps engaging, keeps finding out what is wholehearted, what is wholehearted. A year later goes back to the teacher and says, well, now I've been doing this for a year. And described what had been the practices of wholeheartedness, the efforts. And the teacher said, very good. You've been seeking. So now realize, now turn the attention around 180 degrees and realize that what you're seeking, what you're searching for is in the seeking. And with that, the person was set free. So the story of kind of searching for something, what out there that we're going to attain. But maybe there's something very profound to be discovered, not in the what, not in some realization, not in some understanding, not in some experience. But rather in the capacity to be aware. The capacity in which we know anything, which we gaze upon and see. And sometimes we're blinded and don't see the seeing because we're looking for something. We're involved in something, thinking about something. And to take that backward step, that 180 degree turn, and to appreciate and find maybe even freedom in the seeing, in the knowing, in the awareing, is a radical paradigm shift from how many people live their lives and how they find meaning in their life. So to assume a meditation posture that will be the support for a wholehearted awareness practice, wholehearted, just being here with experience now, I like to interpret wholeheartedness not as straining or pushing or trying a lot, but a complete willingness to enter into this moment of experience. A wholehearted means to enter wholly into the experience of now. Gently closing the eyes, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths, relaxing with a long, extended exhale. Continuing with some longer, deeper breaths, hopefully in a comfortable way. And then at the next exhale, the end of the exhale, hold your breath for as long as it's comfortable. And while you do so, feel your body and let your body relax more until you feel the strong pull, strong urge to breathe in and then gently breathe in deeply. The end of the exhale, hold your breath for just long enough that you start feeling the body relax. Maybe holding your breath at the top of the inhale, that pause before exhaling. There's a heightened attention to the body, to the urge to inhale, exhale. There's also maybe a heightened sensitivity to the body that allows you to, the body to relax more. Holding your breath for most people puts them more fully in the present moment. And then returning to a normal breathing without holding anything. And on the exhale, continue this process of softening, relaxing your body. And then is there a way that you can be aware of the present without trying to be aware? And allow yourself to be aware. Where wholeheartedness is not trying harder, but rather allowing more fully, holistically, globally, for awareness to be here and now. Not trying, but allowing the present moment awareness. And in a sense, allowing breathing at the center of it all to come to you, to come to awareness. Rather than you directing the attention. The attention receives the experience of breathing. sensitive to the And in the wholeness, wholehearted awareness, whole awareness of the moment. Let that include honesty, an honest recognition of what is happening within you. Thinking, feeling, wanting, not wanting. An honesty that needs nothing, wants something, nothing. An honesty that's not judging. Just an honest recognition of what's happening now. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. An honesty that's not judging. And to turn the attention around 180 degrees, to find freedom in the searching. Rather than being aware of freedom as something external from awareness. To be aware of the, to know the freedom of awareness. Is there a sense of freedom and non-attachment in the simplest acts of knowing, sensing, seeing with the mind's eye, even if it's just a hint. Rest back in the freedom found in awareness and being aware. Rest back in the freedom found in awareness and being aware. Rest back in the freedom found in awareness and being aware. Rest back in the freedom found in awareness and being aware. Rest back in the freedom found in awareness and being aware. Rest back in the freedom found in awareness and being aware. Rest back in the freedom found in awareness and being aware. And then as we come to the end of this city, to imagine yourself sitting back in an easy chair. Maybe you are even. Nothing's required of you, nothing you have to do or say, but just be present here and now. And the people of your lives start coming in and they sit down around you, with you. Neighbors come in, strangers come in, the whole town, the whole county, the whole state. Everyone comes in as the walls of your house expand bigger and bigger. Nothing's required of you, but to be present, nothing you have to say or do. And maybe it's possible to be aware of them all with the freedom of awareness. The awareness that doesn't get stuck anywhere or attached to anything. Kind of like looking out across the ocean, just not fixating on anything, seeing the ocean. Relax, that ease. Gazing upon all these people that have come to you. And perhaps to bring forth goodwill and friendliness. A goodwill that simply is wishing them well. May it be that they have lots of benefits, lots of happiness, lots of safety. Lots of peace. May they be well, may they be safe. Gazing upon all beings kindly while staying calm. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
