Good  morning.  Today  I’ll continue  with the second  talk 
in the five-talk series  on anukampā . I’ll talk more  about  
it if you’re coming  today  for the first time.  It’s a word  that 
I translate  as ‘care.’ 
 
Yesterday  I introduced  this topic  by giving  a very 
personal  story  around  my relationship  with the Buddhist  
concepts  and attitudes  of compassion,  loving -kindness,  
and care – anukamp ā. One of the reasons  I was so 
personal  yesterday  was because  some  of what  I’m 
going  to talk about  this week  and especially  today  is a 
little more  scholar ly. Hopefully  it will not be too much  so. 
I really  want  to pull out the meaning  of anukampā  from 
the ancient  teachings  of the Buddha  and highlight  it, so 
that we can benefit  from it. I think  it’s a wonderful  and 
appreciated  aspect  of these  ancient  teaching s. It points

  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg  to a capacity  we have  inside , and gives  it clarity.  This 
particular  capacity  has a wonderful  place  in our lives in 
the world.  
 
As I said yesterday,  in the Buddha’s teachings , the 
word  anukampā  is often  translated  into English  as 
‘compassion, ’ which  is quite  wonderful.  We could  just 
leave  it that way, and that would  be nice.  But another  
word  that’s translated  as ‘compassion ’ is karuṇā. Most  
people  associate  karuṇā with the word  ‘compassion ’ so 
much so that when  they see ‘compassion ’ in the English  
translations,  they assume  that it’s probably  karuṇā in 
the original.  
 
However,  the word  anukampā  is much  more  common  in 
the suttas  than the word  karuṇā. Anukampā  probably  
appears  three  times  as often . It also has a wider  range  
of meanings  than karuṇā. 
 
The word  karuṇā as ‘compassion ’ has a very narrow  
meaning.  It occurs  almost  entirely  in two formulaic  
passages  that get repeated  all over the ancient  
teachings.  One of them  refers  to the practice  of the 
Divine  Abidings  – the Brahmavihāras  – on karuṇā. I 
think  it is quite  beautiful.  It talks about  practicing  under  
karuṇā in deep  meditation  where  the mind  is quite  
conce ntrated,  still, radiant,  and open,  and then 
becomes  a field for expansive  karuṇā. The passage  is:  
3 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg  One abides  pervading  the east with a mind  
accompanied  with karuṇā. And likewise  the south,  
the west,  and the north,  above,  below,  horizontally,  
everywhere,  and all over. One pervades  the whole  
world  with a mind  accompanied  with karuṇā, 
extensive,  expanded,  limitless,  free from cruelty.   
 
Imagine  the mind , with awareness  of the scope  of 
attention  that spreads  so wide that the whole  world  is 
pervaded  with karuṇā, compassion!  
 
That’s one of the two formulaic  passages,  and it repeats  
over and over again.  It doesn’t say what  karuṇā is. 
Nowhere  in the suttas  is karuṇā defined.  There’s no 
obviou s, clear  indication  that it should  in fact be defined  
by the English  word  ‘compassion. ’ It’s just a long 
custom  that we’ve done  that. 
 
The other  formulaic  passage  where  the word  karuṇā 
appears  is also most  likely  a meditation  state  – the 
liberation  of mind  based  on karuṇā. The liberation  of 
mind  here is not awakening,  but rather  meditative  
liberation  – freedom  from the hindrances  and ordinary  
attachments.  This can also come  via karuṇā with 
maybe  compassion.  That’s quite  beautiful,  and I’m 
inspired  by that. It’s very meaningful  for me to read 
about  this, and to have  some  minimal  contact  with this 
kind of experience  in my own practice.

  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg  Other  than these formulaic  passages,  the Buddha’s 
teachings  say very little about  karuṇā. But the Buddha  
does talk a lot about  anukampā . He talks about  it in 
many  different  ways,  and I want  to share  some  of these  
ways.  The Buddha  is described  as having  anukampā  
for the welfare  of people.  I translate  anukampā  as 
having  “care for the welfare  of people.” Talking  to his 
monastic  students,  the Buddha  says: 
Whatever  should  be done  by a caring  teacher,  out 
of care for his disciples,  desiring  their welfare,  that I 
have  done  for you. 
 
Here , a teacher  is described  by the word  anukampā ya, 
meaning  “out of compassion  or care and desiring  their 
welfare.” The desire  connected  to anukampā  is desiring  
people’s happiness  and welfare.  To want  people’s 
welfare  and happiness  could  be seen  as compassion.  
But generally,  when  we think  about  compassion,  we 
feel that it’s an attitude  or a response  to suffering  in the 
world.  We feel. We have  empathy.  We suffer,  and we 
want  to do something  about  it. We want  to help alleviate  
it, or we want  it to go away  in some  way. We want  
people  to not suffer.   
 
That,  in fact, is the Oxfo rd English  dictionary  definition  
of compassion:  “a strong  feeling  of sympathy  for people  
who are suffering  and a desire  to help them.” That is 
inspiring  and very meaningful.  It has been  an orienting,  
organizing  principle  of my Buddhist  life and work,  and  
5 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg  how I have  lived my life. I certainly  don’t want  to 
diminish  the great  value  of that.  
 
But anukampā  focuses  on happiness  and welfare.  For 
someone  who is not suffering  much , or maybe  not 
suffering  at all, it’s still possible  to care about  their 
welfare  and happiness  without  tuning  into their 
suffering.  That’s why I see anukampā  as being  broader  
in meaning  than compassion.  If compassion  is defined  
as having  empathy  and sympathy  for people  who are 
suffering  and a desire  to help them,  then it has a limited  
range  of meaning  – whereas  desiring  people’s  welfare  
and happiness  has a wider  range.   
 
Trying  to find a word  to translate  anukampā , I’ve settled  
for now on the word  ‘care.’ It seems  that the word  ‘care’ 
was a very common  word  in India  during  the time of the 
Buddha , and even  up until the present  moment.  It’s still 
a common  word  in the Indian  languages.  Sometimes  
people  who know  Indian  languages , when  speaking  in 
English,  will translate  anukampā  as ‘compassion. ’ It has 
a strong  association  with that.  
 
But in the ancient  texts  of the Buddha,  it seems  to have  
a different  meaning.  One wonderful  example  of this that 
I want  to share  shows  how anukampā  is an everyday  
word.  The Buddha  talks about  parents  as having  
anukampā  for their children.  I certainly  hope  that 
parents  have  compassion  for their children.

Also the Buddha  says that good  friends  have  anukampā  
for their friends.  I hope  that we have  comp assion  for our 
friends,  when  it’s needed  or appropriate.  But if my 
friends  were  constantly  having  compassion  for me, I 
think  I would  feel a little overwhelmed  and oppressed.  
However,  if they had care for my welfare  and 
happiness,  that’s what  I would  expect , and would  like. 
Having  care for a friend’s  happiness  and welfare  can be 
continuous.  It’s more  open  and allowing.  It’s not seeing  
me through  a particular  lens of how I’m suffering  and 
how I want  that suffering  to be over.  I think  it’s 
appropriate  to have  caring  feelings  that are deep  and 
more  extensive  than compassion  only. The word  
anukampā  fills that role.  
 
The Buddha  also said that childcare  providers  have  
anukampā  or care.  When  people  make  donations  and 
acts of generosity  to others,  the Buddha  refers  to that 
as being  done  out of anukampā , as opposed  to 
compassion.  Again,  when  we want  to make  offerings  or 
gifts to someone,  the gift is not always  given  out of 
compassion  for their suffering.  Most  often,  it’s because  
we care about  them.  We want  them  to be well and 
happy,  so we make  offerings to them  for their welfare.   
 
I would  feel a little troubled  if every  time someone  gave  
me something,  it was out of sympathy  and care for my 
suffering.  I’m very fortunate  that my wife often  makes

every  day, and felt like it was out of compassion  for 
poor Gil that she was offering  a meal,  I think  it would  be 
a little hard for me. But to offer the meal  out of care for 
my welfare  and happiness  is a beautiful  and generous  
thing.  I’m generally  quite  happy  to be the recipient  of 
that. 
 
For the Buddha’s monastic  students,  he does  not only 
instruct  – he praises.  Praise  is kind of strong  word.  He 
praises  tende r concern,  protection,  and care towards  
lay families.  Monastics  should  offer concern,  protection , 
and care – anukampā  – towards  lay people.  
 
Over  and over again,  we see in the suttas  that the 
activity  of caring  and generosity  for the world  is 
expressed  through  the word  anukampā . The word  
karuṇā, translated  as ‘compassion, ’ is never  expressed  
in this way. It has a very particular  domain  of meaning,  
which  seems  to have  to do mostly  with meditation  
practice  – a certain  state  of meditation  one goes  into 
without  really  any reference  directly  to other  people.   
 
Anukampā  is a social  emotion.  Anukampā  is how we 
meet  people  in the world  with care for their happiness  
and welfare.  This is one way of highlighting  the 
importance  and the significance  of this word  anukampā . 
I’ll continue  over the next few days  to do so.

  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai -edits  LK_mg  In the meantime,  over the next 24 hours,  you might  
consider  for yourself  the distinction  between  
compassion  and some  of the other  ways  of caring  for 
people.  Do you have  a way of wishing  for the welfare  
and happiness  of people  that is distinct  from 
compassion?  Is there  a role in your life of living  and 
acting  out of the welfare  and happiness  of others?  Is 
there  a value  in teasing  these  apart?  
 
Thank  you for listening.  I’m happy  to share  this very 
profound  aspect  of our human  hearts  – care.  Thank  
you.
