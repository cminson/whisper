 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. I hope you're doing well and that your area is doing well enough that you can sit here and meditate aware of the challenges of this world while at the same time being able to put it aside wisely, safely knowing that sitting and meditating is a preparation for being in the world in a wiser way, caring way, that sitting in meditation and putting aside the wider world the best we can has the idea of turning ourselves into a gift for the world. It's not an escape from the world. It's a pause just as it would be to pause to go in the shower so that you can be clean for the people you're going to be visiting. So meditation prepares us to be better people for entering into the world. So one of the important aspects of Buddhist practice, a little bit like what I just did, is to reframe how we think about our lives, approach our lives, how we're aware of our lives. Because often the framework, the orientation which we use, is part of the source of the challenges that we have. And if we take our existing orientation for granted, which is what is so easy to do, we grew up with it, we've had it all our life, it's almost as, you know, it almost seems like it's inherent to existence that the way that I see the world, see myself, that's the way things are. But as we begin to settle in meditation and mind begins to quiet some, we learn either on our own or because it makes sense in teachings we hear that there are other frameworks, other points of view, or other very foundational kind of understandings from which we can live our life. So Buddhism offers many of these, but I'll offer a few too today. One is that when we have anything happening for us, especially things that are challenging, but even things that are really good, is not to dismiss any of them, but allow us to be present in a wiser way. It's helpful if we don't identify with them, but don't take them to define who we are, and rather to add a very simple four letter word, and that is with. So if we're filled with fear, rather than saying, I'm really afraid, we say I'm here with fear. I'm here with desire, craving. I'm here with anger and resentment. I'm here with doubt. I'm here with distracted mind. I'm here with joy. I'm here with calm. And when we say with, rather than I am, then there's a gap, a space between us and what we're experiencing, and that space is invaluable. It might just be a crack initially, but with that space, with the with, now we can engage in deciding how close or how far away to be with the difficulties we have. What I mean with when we're aware of it, is awareness going to come in close and get really in touch with the feelings, with what's happening for us? Or do we want to step back, almost like we're standing across the street or up on a hill, looking back at what it is that's a challenge. Oh, fear. If I step back, if I stay close, it just seems too much for me. But if I step back 10 feet in my mind, imagine, well, still difficult. But if I stand back up on the hill 100 feet away, well, I can kind of, then it's okay to feel the fear, to be with it. And I don't become it. I don't get it influenced so strongly with it. Or there's agency, there's ability to kind of reclaim our life from the way we get swept up in what we identify with. And engaging in certain amount of agency, certain amount of capacity to say, oh, I'm with this. I'm with this difficulty. And in that with, decide how close or how distant you want to be, or how close in or how expansive and spacious you want to kind of, oh, I want to hold it. How big of a container do you need to make of awareness so that you can be with what's happening? So to experiment with this. So sitting and meditating, sitting in meditation posture and closing your eyes. And to then just check in with yourself, how are you? Just in the most general way, how are you sitting here? And whatever way you answer, can you kind of gently step back and say, oh, I'm with this way of being. So you don't identify yourself with it, that this is who I am, but I'm with tiredness. I'm with preoccupation. I'm with calm or agitation. I'm with being okay. And then in that space of with, or can you find a space between you in a sense and with to decide how to hold, how to be aware of how you are. That's most helpful. Do you want to get in close and really feel it intimately? Or do you want to open up and be expansive and spacious, spacious rather than intimate? And then as you're sitting here, your body is breathing. In a certain way, you can just let yourself know that you're here with the breathing. And being with breathing, does it feel nicest to be intimate with the breath, with the body breathing, or open up and be spacious, spaciously receive as if breathing is a bird gently flapping its wings in the vast open sky. Or intimate and close as if you curl up with a comfortable blanket. You kind of curl up with breathing or breathing curls up with you. You are not your breathing, but you are with your breathing that accompanies you not to identify with it, but to accompany it, to be with it. And in that space between you and it, how will you be aware? So if you take a time out from meditation to step back and check in with how you are, what's happening, in what way are you identified or caught up in something? Where you can switch to recognizing it as you're with this, with preoccupation, with sadness, with confidence, whatever it might be. What are you leaving out? And then begin meditating again, staying close with a place where awareness, mindfulness, and allows you to be with things instead of being what's happening just with. So to clearly recognize you can be with whatever's happening. And in that with, there is a gap between you and the phenomena. And in that gap, you can decide whether to be intimate or to be spacious. And if things are difficult, sometimes it's easier to be with it if you're very intimate with the direct experience of it. And sometimes it's easier, much easier to open up and be very spacious, maybe even being aware of it with kind of a peripheral vision. So you're not being aware of it directly. So and then as we come to the end of the sitting, the ability to accompany, to be with, becomes kind of a power, strength, when we can learn to accompany and be with others, rather than being preoccupied with ourselves, rather than being preoccupied with ideas of should and shouldn't. Preoccupied with pleasing or protecting ourselves from others. The operating word is preoccupied. To shift the frame of reference from being preoccupied to learning to be with, with ourselves and with others. And we have a clear sense of being with. There is in that place of agency, place of choice for how we will be with. And one way to be with others is spaciously, calmly, so that maybe we can be with others kindly. May we accompany others in their lives with our goodwill and encouragement, our appreciation of others, our love for others. May we live with kind regard for those we are with. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
