 So, I was thinking, kind of today, wondering what I would talk about, that the only thing it may tend to talk about is coolness. And if I had great powers of eloquence, I would give a talk, I'd give a talk about, they would evoke coolness in all of us. And I don't have that ability. But there are a number of ways in which coolness is evoked through meditation practice. There are practices to evoke it, to make yourself feel cooler, as there are practices like, you know, some of you know the Tibetan practice of Tomo, where you kind of generate heat. The person sits in the snow and generates this heat and melts the snow around them. And the, but it's also possible to do the reverse, and that is to create coolness, and that is why you really feel cool. And the usual way of doing this as a practice is to focus on that part of your body which feels cool, coolest. And in a hot day like this, you might not find much. So I've never done this before, really. But I thought I was going to mention to you, I tried, now while I was sitting here. And for a while I could wear it, cool. But then after a little while I found that it was cool, a little bit, there's a little bit of breeze or wind or something against, kind of felt like against the hairs of my upper arm here, right below the sleeves of the shirt. And so I focused my attention there. And if you've cultivated, if you've developed your powers of concentration, and so you really need to have concentration in order to do this, then you hold your mind there. You make that your one-pointed focus of concentration on that coolness you feel there. And if you're very good at it, then everything else that you pay attention to begins to fall away. So things like the heat, the noises, the sounds, the itches, anything else, you start kind of receding from awareness as the mind kind of becomes absorbed in what it's focusing on. And so if you're focusing on coolness, then that's all that's really, you're really doing it well, that's all that's really left is this experience of coolness. And then if you get, and then at some point as you're really locked into it, then the instructions are to spread that coolness around your body. You're actually manipulating and moving it around until your whole body feels cold. How much of this is happening literally and how much is happening in the imagination is hard to know, probably a combination of both. But the effect is appreciated either way, on a day like today. So that's one way that coolness is evoked. The more important way is that ancient India, much of ancient India itself, much of India, is quite a hot climate. And it can get quite a bit hotter than this. I was once in northern India in the month of June. And it was great to be in Burgaaya, the pilgrimage site where Buddha was enlightened. Because in June, there aren't any tourists there, because no one in their right mind goes there. And so people usually go in January, December, February, when it's the cool season. And so it's great because we had this whole Mahabodhi temple and the bodhi tree where the Buddha was enlightened under, pretty much to ourselves. You can walk around freely and no crowds and very quiet. But it was intensely hot. So India is quite hot. And in a heat, in a hot climate, what's most appreciated is coolness. And coolness can seem very refreshing. And so the vocabulary of spiritual attainment in Indian culture, in Buddhist India, was that of coolness, of being refreshed. And in many ways, that image was evoked in the spiritual teaching. And nirvana, the awakening experience, was often defined as a kind of coolness, attaining coolness. And there was a famous Thai teacher named Buddha Dasa. And Buddha Dasa would, his little encouragement to everyone, we came by his psalm, and maybe when people were laughing, he'd say goodbye. He would say, be cool. And I don't know, maybe he had no idea of the connotations in America for being cool. But some of us have tried very hard to be cool. Maybe some of you are still trying to be cool. And if you want to do it really well, you attain nirvana. That's the way to do it. And Ajahn Amrow kind of gave a similar teaching about this, the vocabulary, the usage, the word coolness coming from in Buddhism because of its Indian climate. And he pointed out being English himself, that in England, which is not a hot climate, it's often cool, cold, it's often wet and cold, that there, what's valued a lot, the kind of language of warmth. So for example, someone's warm-hearted. That's really a great thing. So the idea of personal warmth. So that kind of language tends to be valued. In India, it's more the language of refreshing, being cool. That person's cool because the person is calm, is peaceful, not because the person's aloof. So the idea of coolness, being refreshed, being refreshed by the practice, being very refreshed by the experience of awakening. And maybe some of you had the experience of being refreshed from meditation practice. Occasionally, I've had the experience of very dramatically feeling completely refreshed, like renewed, like really, reborn is probably much too strong of a language, but kind of, it's quite dramatic feeling, completely refreshed, made anew, purified, cleansed. And it's really a marvelous feeling to have that happen. Partly it's a function of concentration. Partly it's a function of wisdom, of insight that sees through things and allows the mind to be turned over or cleansed in a very radical way. The contrast to a cool mind or a cool heart in the Buddhist tradition is often the example of someone who's on fire with agitation. We have that language in English also. Fever of desire, fever of passion, and hot head, and these kinds of things. And so the same thing in Buddhist day India, the idea of someone who's filled with heat and fire. And the Buddha once gave this sermon called the Fire Sermon. And in a book I once saw on the best speeches ever given in the history of humanity, the Buddhist Fire Sermon was in it. And when I saw it in the Fire Sermon, I read it as if, I kind of imagined maybe he was a great orator, Martin Luther King or some really strong, and I imagined him giving this speech in a very powerful way, not just the way I would read it, which is kind of namby pamby. That's what I read. But it went, you know, he said, the world's on fire. The eyes are on fire, the ears are on fire, the noses on fire, the tongue is on fire, the body's on fire, the mind's on fire. The things we see are on fire. The things that we feel are on fire. The things we smell are on fire. Things we hear are on fire. The things we think are on fire. The world is on fire. And he goes on and on like this is an image of fire. It's on fire. And so what's he getting at? And then he says, it's burning with a fire of greed. It's burning with a fire of hate. It's burning with a fire of delusion. And so the eyes, our ears, our nose, everything are the vehicles that manifest or show the kind of fire that's in our hearts and our minds, fire desire of hate. And he offers the practice then to overcome that fire, to quench that fire, to put an end to that fire, and then to experience this refreshing feeling of coolness of the mind which is not inflamed by desire, by compulsion, by fear, by all the things that keeps the mind agitated. Sometimes this refreshing mind or heart of nirvana is likened to, is described with the adjective immobile, unmoving. And unmoving may be an best analogy, is often sometimes a very still pool of water that's unmoving. You can see right to the bottom, completely clear and fluid, no agitation in it at all. And what you find then in Buddhism, a lot of use of water for describing spiritual attainment. As people get deeply into their meditation, sometimes the experience you have is likened to that of being in a cool, refreshing mountain pond, lake. So imagine this hot weather just laying there, kind of floating in this cool, refreshing water. And if you get deeper into the meditation, then it's described, it goes further as if there's this upwelling of refreshing, cool water from the depths of the pond or the lake coming up and kind of enveloping you and you feel this kind of saturated by this feeling of coolness that moves through your body. So to being refreshed. Sometimes the analogy that's given is, also with water, but very different kind of sense I think is someone who is lost in the desert and maybe dying of thirst, very, very thirsty. And then finally they see in the distance, they see a lake, fresh, clear water to drink. And the experience of seeing that clear water, their mind gets filled with joy and delight. In anticipation of being saved, anticipation of what it's going to be like. Then they go to the lake and they drink their fill and they sit down on the edge of the water and lay down and just lay there and relax and rest, having drunk their fill of the water. And then there's a very different kind of happiness that comes over the person. That's very different than the excitement and anticipation, the joy of being saved, the joy of the water. And now it's kind of very tranquil, peaceful happiness. Oh, it's been done. I can relax now and be very satisfied. So that's also a description sometimes of what happens in meditation practice. That at times in meditation when the concentration is strong, there can be a feeling of this great kind of almost like anticipatory or exciting kind of happiness or joy, kind of a thrill. Partly it can be a thrill that maybe people have never experienced this. It might be odd to point this out, to hear this. But as the mind, as you get a sense or as the mind gets a sense, they can begin to concentrate on something. Not just simply kind of hold itself over a few seconds or a few minutes, but this magic of kind of being engaged, absorbed, maybe locked in is not too bad of a word, but kind of you feel at some point that the mind is kind of willing happily or engaged with the object of meditation, with the breath or whatever the focus is. If you never had this experience, maybe it sounds bizarre, but as we get more and more focused, then at some point the interest, the impersonal fascination of the mind begins hooking on or engaging or it's very easy and you just stay there. It doesn't want to slip off very easily. It's like, want to stay there. And so you get a sense of thrill. Oh yeah, I can stay there. My mind's not going to slip off. And so it's thrill, this joy arises. It's the liken like this person seeing the pond who's thirsty. And then as a person gets into it and it's not just seeing the possibility and the excitement of making it work, then the mind kind of begins to actually rest there and stay there and it feels really satisfied with being there. It's like the coolness of refreshing feeling after you've had your drink and laying there on the edge of the pond and being quite refreshed. Is it working? Am I refreshing you a little bit? Not that hot. Then there's a Zen approach to heat. And the Zen approach to heat or cold is when you're hot, you're hot. When you're cold, you're cold. And part of that is you don't resist it. You don't try to run away from it. You don't try to manipulate your experience to make it better. You let go of all the things that, all your judgments, all your resistance, all your aversion, all your desire, all your clinging, any kind of neurotic involvement with experience that keeps you separate from it or keeps you anxious about it, you let fall away. It's just you and the heat. It isn't just you and the heat because you're one of the problems. So you're one of the things that kind of limits the experience. So you're supposed to drop yourself away. So it's just the heat. When you're hot, you're hot. When you're hot, just heat. And so part of the quest and sometimes in Zen is to let everything else fall away except let the heat just be there if you're hot. And then the heat's not a problem if it's just heat. But if you're experiencing the heat and you're then judging the heat, then you have problems maybe. So you can have the Zen approach. You can have the approach of finding coolness and developing that coolness in your body. Or you can have the approach of going deep into concentration, deep into insight and tasting the wonderful, sweet, refreshing winds of nirvana, of awakening. So that was just kind of not even my talk I was going to give. I had this whole talk prepared, which I could say for next week. I just kind of went on and on about coolness, thinking that might be nice today. Would you like to ask questions or talk about coolness or something about what I said? Or would you like me to kind of venture forth on section A, B of the talk? What would you like to do? It's nice to have questions and hear from you and have it be more informal because we don't do it that often. Yes? Is it normal to change your temperature as your meditative? I wouldn't say it's normal. Pretty much everything is normal in meditation. Part of my job is to normalize everything for people. It's okay. That happens to a lot of people. It's true because a lot of things happen to people. A whole wide range of things happen. Most of it is pretty normal. Occasionally, there's something you have to work with more carefully. One of the things that can happen is sometimes body temperature can change for various reasons. Some people get, for various reasons, their metabolism kind of quiets down and they get cold really easily. You see some meditators put on gloves and all kinds of stuff. Other people will find that concentration itself sometimes brings on a lot of heat. You see people sometimes, it's really cold, and they start taking off their shirts and t-shirts and just sitting there. Everybody else is looking at them. Who's this viking there? Then the concentration begins to wane, and then they have to put their clothes back on again because it functions up. There's a lot of things that happen, a lot of physiological changes that can happen through meditation. There's no wonder that meditation can have such a huge beneficial physiological effect on our body medically because what we do with our mind has a big impact on our physiology. That's just one little thing, changing your temperature. People say, it's quite well known that as people relax, generally people will get warmer in their fingers and their hands. Some people use that as a biofeedback response with a focus on making their hands warmer and it helps them relax. I've noticed some people report that their hands get warmer and tingly when they meditate. But other people actually get colder through meditation and they have to put on, and they were all different in so many different ways. Was that kind of addressing your question? Yes. Someone said that you intend to get hot. I don't know. When you said that a Zen approach would be if you're hot, let everything drop away with the heat, for that sense of note. But isn't that in some way what you always say that it would be possible? Sure, sure, sure. It is. If you want to develop concentration, stay with that as long as you're capable of staying. I was curious how you distinguish between. The question, if you don't figure it out, is that if the Zen approach that I talked about would be hot be hot, isn't that also a Vipassana approach? I think the difference is that maybe perhaps, in Zen there might be the practice to do that, just become one with the heat. In Vipassana we're not practicing to become one with anything. We're practicing just to pay careful attention to what's actually happening in the moment. If you're hot and you're paying attention, you'll notice your resistance to the heat, or your aversion to the heat. If you notice that carefully, then the resistance tends to fall away, drop away. When the resistance drops away, then you might talk about being one with the experience. Generally we don't talk about being one with the experience in Vipassana. It's a little bit heretical in the Vipassana scene to say, you're one with anything. There's no Vipassana jokes. LAUGHTER Yes, please. This resistance is thrilling, you were talking about. Is this not the part of the Pali... Pitti? Pitti is the joy that comes up when you feel... When the person sees a lake in the distance, and it's thirsty, and so it's kind of the excitement, the thrill. Pitti sometimes occasionally translated as thrill. And then the happiness, once you've drunk the water, and you're laying on the side of the lake, just relaxing, that's sukkah. Do you have a question earlier? Did you have one? I saw your hand earlier. Oh, it's really very similar. I observe that as you're practicing, some of us can walk counter. Yeah. When I was at Tassajara, I was at the Zen monastery, I actually got chilled lanes, which is, I didn't even know what chilled lanes were. And then I found out that this is something that tended to plague English housewives when they used to have central heating in England, because they would, I guess the apartments were kind of cold, and they would plunge their hands into the hot dishwashing water, and then they would go into the cold parts of the house. And what chilled lanes are is when, if you have kind of thin capillaries, and your hands go from being hot to being cold quickly, or being cold, I guess it's from cold to hot quickly, is what it is, then your blood will suddenly rush into your capillaries, and your capillaries are constricted, and can't handle it, and then they'll burst. And so your hands get kind of red, and they itch terribly. So Tassajara, it's very cold, and there's no heating, they had this rice paper windows in the meditation hall, and we get down below freezing and stuff, and we'd be sitting there with rice paper windows. And back when I was there, and it's better now, now they believe in heating the room up. But in the golden age of Zen, when I was there, there was no heat. And Tassajara was also famous for having these warm hot springs. And the wintertime was one of the delicacies, was to go into the hot springs. But I couldn't use the hot springs, because of what I did with my chilled lanes. And I couldn't actually have my hands in the full sun in the wintertime, I'd have to keep them coming back when I was in the sun, because it was so cold that it was in the sun, or any kind of heat, and I would start itching. So meditation would aggravate it, because I would be sitting in meditation very, very still, and I'd get really cold, and be really still, the combination of being really still for an hour and a half, and being really cold, and made it really bad. And so after a while I got wool sock, and I cut off the end, and made a muff from it. And then I went and got these sports shops, I got these little packages that you kind of open to the air, and they make heat, and I'd have it there on my mudra, on my hand, like this. Sorry about that digression. Other questions? Comments? Yes, Kate? Heretical is too strong a word. There's a lot of different kinds of spiritual experiences people can have. And there are very profound experiences where a person does feel a one with things, and a variety of things. And I don't think that Buddha, which is kind of our reference for our tradition, is particularly critical of those kinds of experiences. They have their place, some of them are quite useful. But why I said it was heretical is that if you take those kinds of experiences to be the ultimate purpose of the practice, or you make some kind of metaphysical conclusion of oneness, our true nature is oneness with the universe, our true nature is oneness with nature, or something like that. That's what's called but heretical. You might have the experience of oneness, but you don't want to interpret that through metaphysics, or that means that I am one with nature, I'm one with the universe. But the opposite is also heretical, to say you're separate. So the idea is you're not supposed to play that kind of game, where you're kind of saying who you are in relationship to anything. That the liberation that Buddha was talking about couldn't be formulated in a metaphysical statement based on who an I or self. So I saw another hand. I was just wondering what you meant by the experience of being one with an experience. What that means? I think probably there's a range of things a person might experience, but one is feeling non-separate, or very intimately connected to it. Sometimes when the mind is not preoccupied with its thoughts, concerns, fears, projections, self-obsessions, and all that, and the awareness gets very soft and spacious, then it can sometimes feel like the object you're paying attention to is right, present for you, which is like you and it are not separate, it's like an extension of your hand almost. Or it feels like another way of experiencing it is that your awareness seems to reach beyond the confines of your head. It seems almost like what awareness is, is this big feel, this bubble, that kind of stretches out in front of you, around you, in all directions. And because somehow everything that occurs happens within this bubble, within this feel that's you. That's hard. Another way of oneness is more retrospectively, retroactively, and that is that a person can feel so absorbed in what's happening that all sense of time, sense of self, sense of other, everything falls away, except for that thing is all there is. And so for some people they call that a oneness experience, because you become one with a thing, you become the thing. You don't feel any separate. So there's a range of things that people might call becoming one with. There have been a lot of people who took LSD back in those days, the experience of cosmic oneness. Yes? There's only one other urban Vipassana center in the country. There are several retreat centers where you go to be resident, to be on retreats. But in terms of being in the city, around where people, a community meditation center connected to where people are, there's only two, one in Cambridge and one here. And we're different than one in Cambridge. The one in Cambridge is, I'm not sure I want to characterize it, I don't know that much about it, but we're much more of a community center here than they are. And some people kind of joke that we're more like a congregation here at IMC. But we're much more open, we do a much wider range of things. We have teen programs, we have family programs, and our doors are open in a much more fluid way than some other places. And we're more connected, I think, in some ways, we are in the community. Also, we run it differently than CIMC in Cambridge. We run it completely on a donation basis. So the doors are open to anybody to come in, and no one has to pay. Money is not meant to be a barrier to anybody coming. Whereas, I think at CIMC, you expect it to pay something. They have memberships there, you pay these $240 a year or something as a member. And it's more formal there. Here, what I hope, what I would like to try to have here is kind of informality, where it's relatively easy for people to come and go as they wish, and there aren't formal barriers for that. I'm fond of the fact that the building has seven doors to the outside, external doors. And whereas, most of the time, most of them are locked. Symbolically, I like the idea of the seven doors, because the ideas were open to the community at large, quite freely. People can come and go. It's easy to come in, it's easy to leave. Something like that. Thank you for asking, because that's the kind of things I'm supposed to talk about in this interview. Yes? You talked about becoming one or something. Boy, this is a... That's right. No, dissertations now. Psychologists have tried to study this in states of absorption, and I think that kind of concluded that around age 12, that ability becomes fairly stable. But do meditators have a different perspective, that this can be a skill that grows through practice, or do you find that adults going into it tend to have a fairly stable ability to become one or something? I'm not sure how to answer the question. It is true that that ability can be developed through concentration and through self-awareness and learning how to let go of all these things that get in the way. So it can be developed. Some people have...it happens accidentally. So, you know, we don't know how it happened. It just seems to happen. Some people report it occasionally in lovemaking. There can be a feeling of great oneness with that person. And I remember once I was teaching a meditation class at Stanford, and this young Stanford undergraduate talked eloquently, you know, on and on about how wonderful lovemaking was, because he felt a kind of oneness with a cosmos in making love with his girlfriend. And I asked him, how does your girlfriend feel about that? She's probably there, hey, I'm over here. He's commuting with cosmos. In terms of it being stable, I mean, it's either stable for reasons which are innate to who you are, that ability, or it's something that can be cultivated. Or some people will take drugs to do that. I don't recommend that. Say something more. You said you're doing a dissertation on experience of oneness. Well, it's on three things. It's really on whether or not depression can be alleviated through meditation or hypnosis. But I'm also looking at states of absorption, because that's very closely related to hypnosis. And we found that it does seem...I'll be killed by my boss, I'll say. It does seem that meditation may have a fairly profound effect, but the results are very early. And we haven't compared it with other state-of-the-art therapies, because he could do better or worse. But in terms of absorption, there's this idea that absorption is related to infantizability. And I've been interested in how is it correlated with the improvement people make through meditation training in terms of their depression. And so that's why psychologists seem to believe that around puberty, that's a bit stable. And there's some debate over... Or stable meaning it can't be developed anymore. Yeah, pretty much. Your ability to go into a very absorbed state is... If you can sometimes do it, that's all you'll be able to do most of your life. If you're someone who may be making love or reading a book or watching a movie get totally absorbed, then that's the way you're going to be. It's more stable than IQ, or so they think. But they haven't really investigated. Can you...how well can you train someone to be out of that? But then there's something that you can do. It's interesting. The Buddhist notion of the mind is that the mind is not a thing, it's an activity. So it's because it's an activity, it's valuable, it can be changed and developed. And so I mean, one of the premises of Buddhism is that you can cultivate and develop the mind. And you don't have to settle for what you're born with or what happens when you're 12. And you can develop and cultivate great states. But there's a great range of how easy it is for people to develop concentration and how far a person can go. And how much that has to do with personal qualities and all kinds of...there's so many variables. But there's certainly a difference in speed in which people get concentrated and how deep some people can go. But certainly it can be developed. And the mind can be changed that way it's malleable. And...yes? Well, I was just going to throw in another thing that can affect absorption and that kind of thing is rhythm. You know, rhythm, rhythm, maybe. But didn't certain rhythms come produced in certain states of absorption or frames and things like that? I think that can have a lot of other things. Because I think almost all music, like opera music, has some kind of a beat. And that's a lot. Mostly what people often use is what makes the music rap. Is the beat. That's what I would throw at you. Yes? Is there any parallels between a nata and one? A parallels between... Is there any discussion in the state of a nata, the lack of a self, without self, and the other...the all? That's kind of metaphysical step. The Buddha doesn't want to go. And the Buddha was very precise and very careful how he talked about this anata. And I think he was very careful not to call it a state of not-self. Or say you have an experience of not-self as a metaphysical thing. The way the Buddha talked about not-self in the suit was very carefully was... by saying...mostly as a qualifier of other things, was a characteristic. Anata is a lakshana, it's a characteristic. It's a characteristic of things, it's not a denial of things. So that the Buddha said form is not self, feelings are not self, perceptions are not self, formations are not self, consciousness is not self. So it's saying what's not-self. So he doesn't want to then reify the not-self experience. Therefore there's a not-self. And so you can't...it's a little bit hard then to make parallels with the experience of oneness. Though you know, you probably can. Mystical or spiritual experiences are...the descriptions of them are very difficult to correlate or compare or really to judge. Because spiritual, mystical experiences tend not to be described in heavy, precise technical detail. And more often they tend to be some slide over into more poetic descriptions. And so two people might say the same thing. And they might not quite understand each other. Because they might have different references for the experience. So it's very tricky to talk about parallels, correlations between different models, different descriptions. Because it's hard to know what they really mean in the descriptions. So how about shooting up? Emptiness? In terms of self, if anyone else knows, absorption or catamor. Well there are all kinds of...there's a whole range of meditative experiences, spiritual experiences a person can have. And some of them, there's a whole range of things that people have called experiences of emptiness. And some people might, in the experience of emptiness, call it an extensive oneness. You feel there's no self there. There's a lot of sounds and trees and bushes and all this. And so there's no self there. They might say it's empty. It feels very empty. It feels like a great void in some sense. And because it's so vividly alive with other things, you might say it feels like oneness with those things. But I'm reluctant to go and kind of say yes. There's so many different...it's like once you get into the world of spiritual experiences, it's like so much richer than our conventional reality that we live in. Conventional states of mind. There's so many different things. So I'd have to get in with you to actually see exactly what you're talking about and what's going on. But with emptiness, that also is very clearly in the... most of the orthodox Mahayana tradition and also the Theravana tradition is understood to be a characteristic of things. The heart sutra, for example. Emptiness is a characteristic of things. It's not a denial of things. So it's always in qualifying...it's always qualifying something. Form is empty. It says form... It's empty of...empty of what? What is emptiness? The orthodox Mahayana is not using emptiness as a state. You find a lot of Mahayana teachers trying to knock their students off their states. They experience great emptinessness. That's not the point. It's a big topic, in other words. It's very interesting what you're asking about. But it's very hard for me to respond without laying the map out carefully. Well, I'm just wondering... I guess the quality line...I don't know the word... The quality line is like an old-style spaceship over the beach. Yeah, it's a great thing. So it's a great thing. So then the question is... So what? What is that? Is that the ultimate experience? Is that the final goal? Is to have a great, spacious, all-encompassing mind? And then you have to look at the different Buddhist traditions. Different Buddhist traditions will validate or understand or place that experience different places along the map of all the different spiritual experiences a person can have. So it's one among many kind of spiritual experiences. Some people will take a more instrumental approach to that. That has certain usefulness, that kind of experience. Let's use it for a certain purpose. Other people will say there's no purpose for that experience beyond itself. And some people will say, oh, don't stop that. That's good. But that's short of the goal. And so the teacher will try to pull the rug from underneath your spacious mind. So it all depends on the tradition you're in and how it's understood. So I can't give you anything to hold onto tonight. Yes? Yeah. There's different things that might happen when you bring attention to bear on an experience in your body. And with enough mindfulness and concentration together, often the experience is a person to have something disappear. It falls away. It passes away as you're watching it. With pain, it can either happen because as we bring attention to it, it can relax. That part of your body disappears. Or it can be purely a function of the mind itself. But I think when you're using concentration to make something grow or to stay like that, then you're doing it without a lot of insight. If you're trying to use a lot of insight, you're trying to see very clearly what that experience is, the nature of that experience. That's what causes sometimes experience to begin to fade away or fall away. But if you're not trying so hard to study it, but just to simply fixate on it, that's when you can start manipulating and doing something with it. So you don't want to get too close then. And it's used sometimes for pain. It can for some people be very helpful to focus on pain directly with mindfulness. And that's often what we teach. But sometimes when the pain is very severe, it's counter-indicated to actually focus on the pain. And then sometimes people will focus on anything else but the pain. But one technique is to actually find some place in your body. And this is done sometimes when people are wracked with pain, like people who just, you know, just, you know, terrible states of pain. They can't be helped medically. And they'll focus on some part, find something in their body that's pleasant, pleasurable. And it might be just a very small little piece of their inner thigh, you know, that's just a little bit. And then to focus, develop a concentration there. And when the concentration gets strong on that particular point of pleasure, it's again expanding that pleasure throughout the body. And that's as an antidote then to being consumed or wracked with that kind of pain. So, you know, there's a lot of things you can do with your mind. The mind is an amazing tool. It blows me away what the mind is capable of. You know, just the uninitiated people who never actually worked with their mind or meditated in a consistent way, it's hard to imagine what your mind is capable of. It's not just an activity, not a thing. It's actually made up of a series of many different activities. So how you use the different activities and how you bring them into balance and what you emphasize and what you deemphasize affects a lot your experience of the mind and what you do with it. Generally in Aravipasana tradition, the emphasis is don't tinker with your experience. Rather just develop straightforward mindfulness of what's there and try to find how to be a quantumist with what's there, not to be in conflict with what's there, how to try to make it better or worse or fix it or avoid it by making coolness arise or, you know, all these things. But just be completely honest, uncompromising honesty and directness about what's actually your experience moment by moment. That's kind of the strong point of our tradition of doing that. But there are, you know, in the tool bag of our tradition a lot of other tools. And sometimes there are tools that involve intentionally changing your experience. I have a question. I can listen in to kind of show a group of things. I don't know if you like her or not. Is she talking to them? Because basically what she's doing is she takes this and then the attention, watching breathing and just turns into a breath and sits there, and then comes up and not having a situation. Is that kind of like... That's pretty... that particular practice is pretty universal in Buddhism. In the meditative traditions of Buddhism, meditating a breath and just letting everything go and just watch what arises is pretty universal. We do that in our tradition. Zen tradition does it. She comes out of the Tibetan tradition. And we would like to adopt her. Yeah. I'm glad that the past has been... I just don't know. This is for me. Yeah, kind of. I mean, it's a whole thing, the history of Buddhism. But the Buddhism evolved and developed quite a bit over the many centuries. It was in India. And so depending on the particular time that Buddhism went to different countries, like when it went to China and went to Tibet, it got a different stream of that development in India. And so the stream that we have that came through Sri Lanka and Burma and Thailand was a very early stream. It probably came to... left India probably around the time of two, three hundred years before the common era. So a long time ago, more than 2,000 years ago. And after almost a thousand years of development in India, then Buddhism went to Tibet. So you had a lot of changes in that time. And then in Tibet, it developed a lot more. And Indian Buddhism went to China before it went to Tibet. So around the years, 300 and 500. So depending on when it took... it received the Indian tradition. It differs. And the traditions are quite different. The differences can be in some ways as different as between Catholicism and Protestantism. And some people have actually likened the arising of the Mahayana and the Zen tradition, the Mahayan tradition, as kind of like a... similar to great reformation of Buddhism that's radically different from the earlier tradition. So there are big differences and there are big similarities. For some of us it doesn't know about any, but it's like... I love Buddhism because it's the very basic principles from Buddhism. Often a lot of the traditions share a lot of the basic principles. For many of us in the West, not knowing about the Asian tradition, Buddhism just seems like Buddhism. In fact, I believe there's greater variation within all the schools of Buddhism than there is between all the schools of Christianity. You take Eastern Orthodox to Mormons and there's a lot of variety. Okay. So be cool.
