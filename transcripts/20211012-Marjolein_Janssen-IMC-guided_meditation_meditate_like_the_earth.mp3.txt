 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So we can start with getting a little bit more comfortable maybe in a meditation posture. That is somewhat upright but still comfortable and you can sit comfortably for about half an hour or so. We can start with relaxing the body a little bit. We'll just tune into the body. What is it like right now in the body? Maybe there is some tension or maybe you're already fully relaxed. But if there's some tension somewhere in the body you can just go there and have some attention for it. Just a mild kind noticing. Maybe it softens up a little bit if you do that. Maybe we can relax our body like this. It's also very beneficial for the mind. The mind also softens a little bit when we do that. Maybe we can relax our body a little bit. You can see if you can receive the sensations of the body. Whatever is most obvious right now in the body. Maybe there is hardness or softness, warmth, coolness. Maybe you can feel little movements in the body. Whatever it is. You can try to stay with a direct experience. Receiving this direct experience of the body. Maybe there is pain or discomfort. If possible, if it's not too much, you can try to receive that as well. See if you can see a little bit deeper than just pain or just discomfort. Maybe there are certain sensations that go with it. Like throbbing, itching, heat. See if you can stay with a direct sensation. Whatever it is for you. If it is too much, you can always switch to a more neutral part of the body and pay some attention there. Be aware of something that isn't uncomfortable or painful. Usually there is something in the body that's not uncomfortable. Even if it's only your big toe. The Buddha says, just as they throw pure and impure things on the earth, like feces, urine, spittle, pus and blood, the earth is not repelled or humiliated or disgusted because of this. And so too, we can dwell with a mind like the earth. Fast, exalted and measureless without enmity, without ill will. We can see if we can receive whatever bodily or mental experiences come our way. Just like the earth. Without being disgusted or humiliated or rebelled by it. Just an equanimous receiving. Things that come your way, mental phenomena, bodily phenomena, are not really yours. They're just passing by. Just passing visitors. Maybe we can be like the earth. And not be influenced by what passes by. Just to quantumously watch whatever it is that comes our way. If you do feel reactive towards something. Maybe you can be like the earth towards that reactivity. Maybe that's okay. That the reactivity is there. Maybe you can be like the earth towards that reactivity. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

We come to the end of the sitting. to share the merits, beneficial energies that have accumulated during this sit with other beings. And even if you've been struggling the whole sit, you've been aversive or anxious or stressed or whatever, you've experienced your intention to sit and to practice the Dharma. It's what matters, that's what's generating wholesome energies. And so I can share those wholesome energies, the merit of our practice with all beings, if that's... That feels right to you. If all beings is a little abstract, you can also point down a certain group, like maybe all your loved ones. And we can share this through the intention, may all beings or all beings in this group benefit from this merit. May they all be free from suffering. Thank you.
