So we'll be continuing with the practice of metta meditation.
And as was described yesterday, metta is the Pali word for loving kindness.
And this is a cultivation of the qualities of the heart that we all have that may be
undeveloped or unseen, but they're all there ready like seeds to be watered is one way
that people think of them.
And that this is a practice of cultivating those qualities.
And so just like anything as we engage in a practice, sometimes it arises and we feel
it and sometimes we might not feel the qualities of loving kindness as much.
So one of the things that's helpful for me, because sometimes I don't generate this feeling
of loving kindness towards myself that I use the image of the night sky and the big dipper
and this sense of like the big dipper scooping up, you know, loving kindness and pouring it
all over and I'm one of the beings that's receiving this loving kindness that's infinite.
So it's all encompassing.
So what I'll be offering tonight are some phrases that support us with this practice.
So it's kind of a way of encouraging continuity of attention.
It's another way that we can use our loving kindness practice to support our mindfulness.
And so I'll offer some phrases, but please feel free to use whatever phrases work for
you or no phrases at all.
And then the other thing is if you speak a language other than English, please feel free
to use whatever language speaks to your heart in utilizing the phrases.
So this is all just about our capacity for cultivating kindness and love and we'll be
directing the love in various directions and we won't go through all of them tonight.
There's generally a number of different directions and we'll just choose a few.
And one other thing that's encouraged when we do our meta or loving kindness meditation
is that you take a comfortable position because you're encouraging this kindness towards yourself.
So just take a position that really allows you to feel comfortable for this.
You may want to place a hand on your heart or on your stomach, but a way of connecting
with yourself.
So sometimes helpful to take a few deep breaths just to feel the sense of your body as you
arrive in the sitting posture or whatever posture you're meditating in.
One of the possible ways of doing the meta or loving kindness practice is to imagine
if it works for you that you could breathe in and out through your heart center.
So just imagining as you breathe this inclination of the heart, this invitation towards generating
a kind feeling towards yourself and then perhaps on that out breath just letting go.
So breathing in, inviting kindness, caring and on the exhale letting go.
Sometimes it's challenging to invite caring for ourselves so sometimes people will take
the image of themselves as a young child, maybe the baby that you're hearing about.
Or just thinking of yourself as that young one or you can bring to mind someone who loves
you, a dear friend, family member, a pet and bringing this image to mind sometimes helps
open the heart to the love.
So breathing in, inviting in, caring and kindness, breathing out, letting go.
You may want to synchronize the phrases with the breath using phrases that resonate for
you or the phrases that I offer.
And I realize somebody mentioned to me that on Zoom I often say, say the phrase is silently
to yourself but if you're alone with yourself you could actually experiment with saying
the phrase is out loud or silently, traditionally they're silently but I don't see what would
work for you.
So breathing in and out, wishing yourself care and kindness.
May I be happy, truly happy.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be healthy and strong as much as is possible.
May I live with ease and be free.
May I be happy, truly happy.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be healthy and strong as much as is possible.
May I live with ease and be free.
May I be happy, truly happy.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be healthy and strong as much as is possible.
May I live with ease and be free.
The phrase is support the development of continuity and concentration at the same time the capacity
of loving kindness.
Feeling free to adapt the phrases in any way that works for you, but just tuning into the
sense of loving kindness in the body.
May I be happy, truly happy.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be healthy and strong as much as is possible.
May I live with ease and be free.
Continuing on in your own pace, in your own way, wishing loving kindness towards yourself.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be safe and protected from inner harm.
May I be safe and protected from inner harm.
May I be safe and protected from inner harm.
Sometimes you may feel expansive, other times contracted in the heart center, not needing
to push away or for anything to be different.
Just remembering that this is the practice of cultivating the heart.
We're changing our relationship to ourselves, cultivating loving acceptance, not needing
to deny or turn away.
May I be happy, truly happy.
May I be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May I be healthy and strong as much as is possible.
May I live with ease and be free.
Now we'll be expanding our circle of kindness to include everybody in our Sangha.
So just imagining that the kindness that you're generating would ripple out and touch all of us who are practicing here together.
Using the phrases that I share or the others that work for you.
May we be happy, truly happy.
May we be safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
May we be healthy and strong as much as is possible.
May we live with ease and be free.
May we be happy, truly happy.
May we be protected and safe from inner and outer harm.
May we live with ease and be free.
Knowing that each of us faces challenges in our lives and our families and our communities.
Wishing for kindness.
For this community of practitioners and all the communities that are touched by everyone here.
May we be happy, truly happy.
May we be protected and safe from inner and outer harm.
May we be healthy and strong as much as is possible.
May we live with ease and be free.
Now just allowing the phrases to drop away.
Tuning into any sense of kindness and caring in your body, in your heart, in your mind.
Opening to the field of loving kindness, coming into the stillness.
And as if you would drop a pebble in a pond, imagining that this kernel of kindness,
this intention towards developing this capacity of loving kindness,
could ripple out in all directions and touch all beings.
Imagining kindness extending in all directions, both inward towards yourself and outwardly with each breath.
The heart of the world.
Knowing that the survival of ourselves and all others depends on a loving, compassionate heart.
Acknowledging so much suffering the world.
Inviting the feeling of loving kindness to ripple out in all directions.
We'll extend loving kindness in the six directions, as indicated in the metasuta and the chants.
To those beings below in the earth.
The worms, the nematodes, the fungi, the plants, the wolves.
All beings who live in the earth.
May they be held in the heart of loving kindness.
To those beings above us of the air.
The insects, the birds, the bats.
The animals who sometimes are in the air like the monkeys and the squirrels.
May they be held in the heart of loving kindness.
Extending loving kindness to the other four directions.
Starting with the north.
May all beings to the north. Those living in the cold lands.
The polar bear, the eagles, the caribou, all the people.
All the beings to the north.
May they all be held in the heart of loving kindness.
May all beings to the east.
From where the sun rises each day.
All those who are involved in governing.
All those who serve this country.
Those who grow our food. Those who build our cars.
Those who live in the prairies, the rockies.
All those who live in the east.
All beings in the east.
May they be held in the heart of loving kindness.
May all beings to the south reaching down past the equator.
All beings in the deserts, the tropics, down to Antarctica.
The camels, the butterflies, the iguanas, the rainforest dwellers.
And the penguins.
May they all be held in the heart of loving kindness.
May all beings to the west.
All those who live in the oceans.
The jellyfish, the plankton, the killer whales.
The albatross.
And all the people to the west.
Asia, Australia, all the many people who live in the west.
May they all be held in the heart of loving kindness.
Allowing the loving kindness to radiate in all directions.
Upwards to the skies.
Downwards to the depths.
Outward and unbounded.
Abundant, exalted and measurable.
Unlimited to infinite capacity for kindness.
And knowing that this capacity for kindness doesn't distinguish
raiding and aiding outward and inward in all directions at the same time.
May all beings in all directions.
May all beings in all worlds be free from suffering.
May all beings without exception
be held in the heart of loving kindness.
