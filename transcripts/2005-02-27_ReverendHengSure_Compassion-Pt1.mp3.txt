 Good morning everybody. I'm Hong Shui and I'm going to be spending the next 45 minutes to an hour. This DARPA talk has an audio visual component. Like Ajahnabaro, we call ourselves the monks of the silicon forest. So here we are in the city waiting for the Macintosh to fire up, which I'm convinced it will. Can I ask how many of you came to Buddhism from Protestant background? Whether you were Protestant, your parents were Protestant. That would include the whole suite of Episcopalian to Baptist. Okay. How many of you are going to Catholics? Not quite as many, pretty close. How many Jewish? About the same, so three. Okay. How many Hindu? Okay, good. Any Muslim? Quakers? Jews? Do we have any other? Who didn't I mention? Nothing. Nothing, yes. That's our secular humanist, atheist, agnostic community, which in the Bay Area there are quite a few. What else? What are both of you? Baha'i. Baha'i? Okay, thank you. I didn't mention Buddhists, right? How many have Buddhist backgrounds? Anybody? Good? Okay. Alright. I grew up Methodist. So here we are. And the reason why I asked that question was because when I talked to Gil, Gil Fromstahl, about what I should be talking about today, Gil said, well, metta is great. And metta is a great, metta-bhabhana is a great component to Vipassana. It's a component to Vipassana. But my tradition, I'm going to be moving around, so I'll block the screen only some of the time, okay? And then I'll sit down. My tradition is from China, the Chinese Maya, and so while certainly metta is a big part of what we do, we spend more time with the second one of what's called the four limitless minds, which is karuna. And karuna is great compassion. So I wanted to share with you something that's a very big part of my life and my formation as a monk. Maybe if I stand here, I won't block anybody. What's that? And it's great compassion in the Mahayana. Certainly it's the animating heart behind a lot of what Buddhists in Asia buy in arch practice. So I wanted to talk today about Aholukite-shwar, Guanshireen-pusa. Now, those of you who, when I was growing up as a Methodist in Toledo, Ohio, no Ohioans here? We didn't mess with the Catholics. We were real clear about that. We didn't go into the Catholic's homes because they had too many kids, and besides, you know, they just, you didn't want to take any chances. It was pretty narrow, pretty exclusive, and probably wrong-headed. But later on in life, I went to Catholic services just because actually I had become a Buddhist before I had my first Catholic Mass. But when I saw the way Catholics did religion, the way they did Christianity, I realized that the Chinese Mahayana does Buddhism the very same way compared to Theravada. Theravada becomes, and even more so, even more so, becomes very Protestant, and we become very high church. Now, that's the external trappings. What about the heart? Well, of course, there's not that much difference. We spend a great deal of time with our Dharma brothers, Radhava Aghiri. Adun Sumedho, I've known since 1979. So, what is the difference inside? One of the major differences inside with high church Catholic, i.e. ritualistic, religious Buddhist tradition is very steeped in mythos. If you understand Kieran Armstrong's mythos logos distinction in Ishi Parsi's Karma Mentalism, well, mythos are the folks who keep the stories going, for whom meaning is pretty much the identity. Logos is, it's up for grabs. It's evolving as you invent it. It's a different mind. Okay, what's, why did I bring this forward today? Because there's a lot of information. You are always familiar with mythos. You use it in your lives, I'm sure. The, what I hear many of my Zen, Vipashana friends say is, you know, all that sitting can tend to get a little dry. Now, I find Agho Kiteshara, Bhojasaltha, to fill the same space in my heart that I see the Blessed Virgin filling for Catholics. Now, so that's enough of an introduction. Let's get on into the pictures and I want to show you what I have prepared here. Many faces of compassion. This, this show is too long for the time we have so I'm going to go quickly. This is my teacher, Master Shrenghwa, my teacher in religion, Shrenghwa Shraman. This, this show was last shown in Hong Kong, last two months ago. So it's all Chinese and I quickly, quickly put the English there. I got the English there. Shrenghwa is the teacher passed away ten years ago, Master Shrenghwa. From the Chan village, my tradition is Chan, which is in northern Mahayana. Chan went to Japan and came. That's him. Right, Korea, it was called Song. Okay, who's this? Anybody then to Barcelona? This is Bonserat, this is the Black Madonna, the original Black Madonna. And if you'll notice, maybe some of you know your Buddhist iconography, she looks a whole lot like I think Bhojasanthara. Down to the wish fulfilling pearl in her hand. And the child who has a wish fulfilling pearl in his hand. And a very compassionate face. Bonserat is this monastery nearly a mile above Barcelona, Catalonia. And this entire monastery is infused with this compassion. Very marvelous, I recognize it right away. Oh, I know who that is. Okay, well here are some of these lovely images. This feeds a western spiritual nature. Somehow. Okay, no. Today I'd like to just poke around inside that if it's alright. Just to kind of investigate what that might mean in our lives as Brutus, as Brutus practitioners. This is Guanyin Bodhisattva, Ava Lokiteshvara. This is a Guanyin stained glass window. If you come to the Berkeley monastery, you can see Guanyin. Great compassion. Now, female, i.e. feminine, you could say Sophia in a western context. Okay. Wisdom. This is a Guanyin Bodhisattva pumpkin. Ava Lokiteshvara is taking root in America, taking seed in America. Pumpkin seed. Created Buddhists over there. This is a Trama Sutra. In ages past, the Buddha, whose name was light of proper Dharma, because of great compassion and, although he as a Buddha had already realized the proliferation of suffering, still cared enough for living beings. That he made appear, he manifested the Bodhisattva's body, and based on vows to listen to the voices of suffering beings, returned to ask Guanyin Bodhisattva. So, this is the part of the mythos in the Mahayana. The current Ava Lokiteshvara, Guanyin Bodhisattva, was a Buddha in a past life, who, instead of staying in her van with distillness, said, living beings are suffering, I'm not done. I'm coming back from Florida to appear again to rescue living beings. So that's how the story, that's the legend, the founding story. Okay. First thing we're going to do is identify Guanyin by name. Guanyin in Sanskrit is Ava Lokiteshvara. Okay? Sanskrit name. In Tibetan, Chandresi. Okay? We're going to go quickly, so if you're taking notes, I'll come back. Vietnamese, in Baino, Guante M. Bodha. Guante M. Bodha. Vietnamese, Chinese, Vietnamese pronunciation, Chinese. In Cantonese, Goyim. Goyim, what's that? In Japanese, anybody know? Kanoan. Kanoan, in the full, is Kanzi-go-bosatsu. Kanzi-go-bosatsu. Kanoan. In Korean, I don't know. Any Korean speakers who know on... Yes, what is Guanshi and Bodhisattva in Korean? Once again? Guanshi-go-bosatsu. Thank you very much. Beautiful sound. Same. Same sound. In English, how is Guanyin going to make it in English? Probably not. The awakened being who hears the voices of the world. Because there's just too many syllables. Right? I suspect Guanyin is probably going to be Guanyin. Or, depending if you come from Cantonese, Guanyin, or Bantian. Vietnamese, Guanshi-go-bosatsu in Korean. Okay, that's his name. Guanyin's name is too. Guanyin Bodhisattva. Bodhisattva, we'll define as awakened being. Guanyin, for short. Guanyin the maiden, she's known in Taiwan, Guanyinyan. That's her name. Guanyin, the mother of all Buddhas, plural. That's another name. Guanyin full is the way she appears in a popularized version. Guanyin has been around in China for so long that she's morphed in with the native indigenous face. Holy mother, Guanyin. Guanyin Ma is also her name. Guanyin Ma. So Guanyin clearly in the Chinese tradition, Asian tradition, responds to the feminine nurturer. Okay, Guanyin appears as the disciple of Amitabha Buddha in the pure land, Thousand, Missiniti, translated, Thousand Han Guanyin. You've seen Guanyin. In fact, the backdrop is Thousand Han Guanyin. It's a Bodhisattva image of this kind of fan of hands behind it. There's stories behind this. Guanyin who bestows children, souls of Guanyin. Guanyin is famous for responding to parents who seek children and responders, you know, that can't give birth. And Guanyin who contemplates it easy. If you've been to the Nelson Museum of Kansas City, there's this beautiful, huge Guanyin image right at the front door. And that's Guanyin at Royal ease. That's the image. We'll see a picture of that. Guanyin, Suyin, Pusa, Adilabha, Dithra. Okay, so those are more names, my valley. Guanyin with the white robe. Guanyin with the fish basket. Guanyin who bestows courage. Green Tara, white Tara. Okay, those images. Tibetan and Mongolian and the police. And the Holy Blessed Virgin, which my Catholic friends tell me is inside. They call it the HBB. She is. Guanyin, Pusa. With the white robe. Interesting. So, these are the outside. This is what the eyes see. What is the mind doing with this capacity? Is this something we're reaching for? And is this going to come to the west in a certain form? Is it already here? Interesting. Guanyin's universality. In 1983, I had a chance to go to Pagan, Vermont. Sometimes pronounced Pagan. Pagan is a city of 1300 stupas. 1300 reliquaries. There's a long, long story about it. The rulers of Pagan were very devout. And they emptied their treasury to build as many stupas as they can. A stupa holds relics of the Buddha. And so they built something like 1400 of them with incredible technology that several Asian university architecture departments are still trying to trace. How they got the joints. What kind of mortar that they used. They tried to rebuild something. Well, 1100 of them are still standing. And now this is the heart of Theravada Buddhism. It could not be more devoted to the Buddha Shakyamuni and the form of the truths and Vipasha. But we were poking around and right in the center we found one stupa called Ananda Stupa. And who was inside? Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. I have another friend who went through the great proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai. He's an artist and a collector of art and a museum curator. And because he was educated and gentry, he was struggled against and imprisoned and beaten the whole horror story of what happened during the Cultural Revolution. And he said, if you profess any religious faith at that time, it was your life. You'd be killed. He said, because he said the only way I got through, well he has something like 300 Buddha images in his home. They were all trashed. They were all smashed to bits. So his identities, his life, his heart was all broken at the same time. He said the only thing that carried me through the great territorial cultural revolution and all that horror was I had a keychain. One of those lucky rabbit's foot keychains with little silver balls and little sticks there. And he says, I recited the name of Guan Yin on my keychain. They thought it was a keychain. It was a recitation piece for me. He said that carried me through. So he talked about, he said actually he had a chance at one point. He was let out. He was repatriated or reinstated. And he found some of the cadres who were running the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. And he got into their homes and he discovered hidden in the backs of closets their own Guan Yin images where they went for this place in our hearts of compassion. Portola Mountain is placed in the South China Sea where Guan Yin Bodhisattva is supposed to make her home, Putua China. So maybe she traveled to China a particular. Saigon, Vietnam. There's a story from it later, a book I have now. But I want to just remark that. Santa Barbara, California. Another story. We'll cut this. If we go along, we'll add the stories. If we have to move quickly, we'll cut the stories. But Santa Barbara, Guan Yin Bodhisattva appears in many places. These are the Laliana Sutras that teach about Guan Yin. Now, Gil would be interested in this. If you're not a Buddhist scholar, maybe this is just something even five ways away. A lot of information. But just take a note. The Lotus Sutra talks about Guan Yin in the Universal Board Chapter. The Durrani Sutra tells the whole story of Guan Yin in another aspect. The Sharabhama Sutra has a section that is devoted to Guan Yin Bodhisattva. The Avatopsika Sutra has the same thing. It talks about another aspect of Guan Yin. And the First Door Bodhisattva Sutra, Chivarva Bodhisattva, and our familiar Heart Sutra. You probably recited a variety of ways. When the Bodhisattva, the Avalukita Svara, was coursing the Deep Wisdom of the Ghandi Island, he looked down from on high and we albedified hims. Saw that they were all indeed, thus crossing over all suffering and difficulty. Avalukita Svara Bodhisattva appears in the Heart Sutra. So once you start looking, Guan Yin is formally placed. Guan Yin's primary identity in Asia is the ability to respond to those who recite from me. So, Guan Shi Yin in Chinese means contemplating the sounds of the world, contemplating the voices or cries of the world. Guan Yin, when she came back, as Bodhisattva said, anybody who recites my name can be saved from suffering. And that's where the hands came from. Sticking out a apology hand. I'll give you a hand. So, Guan Yin saves from seven troubles. She purges three poisons, fulfills two wishes, bringing children, men, boys or girls. She ends fourteen kinds of fears, speaks Dharma in nineteen ways, and makes a peer, thirty-two transgendered lives. This is the whole dogma of Guan Yin. This is the whole content of the teaching of Guan Yin. Okay, this fellow is my colleague from the Berkeley Buddhist monastery. This is Doug Powers. He has taught high school, he teaches high school seniors at Berkeley High for thirty-two years now. So, Doug is one of those gifted people who can actually teach advanced teenagers. That's the kind of gift. He's six foot two. He used to be Berkeley High School's football team quarterback. So, he's got that going from him. Big guy. And very stubborn. He and I got to the Gold Mountain monastery in San Francisco the same year, in 1973. And in 1978, we went with Master Shrenghua to Asia, on tour Asia. We got to Malaysia. We went to Western Malaysia, we were in China, Dingjalu, you know where that is. And Doug decided that it was time for him to leave the group because he needed to go climb K2. That was his plan. And so, we all say, Shrenghua, Doug, do you have any gear? Yeah, I got some tennis shoes, I'm almost done. Doug, think about it again. So, he goes and asks Master Shrenghua, and he says, do you have to go now? Doug said, yeah, it's going to snow soon. Shrenghua, check the weather. It's going to snow in a couple weeks. I don't want to get there. I just want to be able to climb. This is my chance. If you waited a little longer, do you think it would be the same? No, I think I'd better go now. If I could guarantee that it wouldn't snow, would you wait a while? No, I don't, I think I really need to go Shrenghua. I'll be back. I'll be fine. I'll call you as soon as I get down on K2. Okay, so we all went back here and did it. But you have us clearly saying, don't go now, what are you doing? Well, you've got to get there. It's really stubborn that it wants to get to the top of K2. So, we finished our trip through Asia. We got back and called Doug and heard him. Turns out that Doug is in the Stanford Hospital. And nearly every bone in his body was broken, including most of his face. And he was going through extreme reconstitutive, what is it? Reconstructive surgery for cosmetic surgery. It looks like he had the face left. So, as soon as he could come out of the ether, we asked him, what happened? He said, well, I probably should have gone. And he said, well, I got there and I started up and I got to base camp and I realized I didn't know the way. And the sky showed up. And he said, I'll take you up to the top. And he said, maybe I should have gone with him. But that first night, we made it first night up. He says, we were sleeping in a snow cape and I had to go out at midnight to take a leap. And he says, I took about three steps and I might have been pushed or I might have just slipped. But he said, I did three somersaults in space and I hit something hard and it was a rock ledge. And that was the thing that saved my life. It broke every bone in my body. He said, I was on this rock ledge for three days. And he said, I could feel that I was all broken. But somehow, he said, because I had been reciting the name of Vanyan bodhisattva from the time I took air, from the time I started my somersault, I just kept reciting. And he said, I was clearly outside my body, my mind was sitting, looking back at me, lying on a snow cliff. And he said, I had this long, long conversation with Vanyan bodhisattva about starting over, making my life different and being a kinder person than not. And he said, so I just kept reciting. He said, the next thing I knew was this royal Nepali helicopter, royal Nepali Air Force helicopter dropping the ladder down. He said, nobody knew I was up there. I hadn't told anybody. I was going up. He said, I don't know who notified him. I don't think Vanyan had cell phones back then. And so he says, the royal Nepali helicopter dropped me a cup on dew and my parents bought two airplane seats to take me back and I went to the hospital. So he says, I'm going to be a kinder person. So that's the kind of stuff, you know, these stories. I had them really close to home. You know, what can you say? I don't know what to say. Okay. These are the practices of great compassion. We know that Buddhism is an orthopraxic, not orthodoxic religion. Right practice counts a lot. And Guanyin's vows say, whoever recites my name will generate this response. Response to those who call a name. Reciting the names of Guanyin, Namo, Guan, Shuyin, Busan, is the traditional Chinese way of doing it. And instead of music, it's a musical chant and you recite it. Reciting the great compassion mantra. We have a mantra that is really central to our daily practice, great compassion mantra. It's called the Mahakaruna Dharani, Baba Jokha in the Chinese. And people recite this 108 times a day or longer. It's 84 lines. It takes about 90 seconds to recite it. And in the mantra, they are the sounds of compassion. So that's one of the main practices. Bowing the great compassion repentance, there's a liturgy based on Guanyin and this devotion that allows one to reflect on behavior, body, mouth, and mind, and rebuild it. So this is something that we do a lot. We have a lot of repentance liturgies. This is actually what I wrote by my doctorate dissertation. It was Buddhist repentance. Returning the hearing to listen to the nature, the inherent, the self nature, the sāhara, the inherent nature. This is a dharma that comes from the shirāmam. It's a chān dharma, a way of turning the hearing itself back so that you listen to the Guanyin and your self nature. That's a big practice. Cultivating 42 hands and eyes is a kind of esoteric Guanyin practice. Reciting the universal door chapter, doing what in the Catholic world is called makshirodavīna, taking a chunk of text and reciting along, contemplating and doing it in silence. And then reciting the name and mantra of aamitāgavudu from Guanyin is connected to you. So these are all very familiar practices. These are called dāvekam, great compassion, dharmatas, māyā. And people will practice those. I wanted to show you, demonstrate the method, the fundamental method of Guanyin practice. Can everybody say nāmō? In Pali, nāmā, Sanskrit nāmā. I've returned to you, I rely upon, I take refuge in. Guān, you say, guān, that's here, guān, nāmashīr, yīn, yīn. Where do you put sā? Put sā, where do you put sā? Say, put sā. That's the Sanskrit, the Chinese pronunciation of bodhisattva. The Chinese have a fairly limited syllabary, so you've got to squeeze a lot of Sanskrit into very few Chinese sounds. So, nāmō guānśrīr yīn pūsā is the way people recite. Let's try again, nāmō guānśrīr yīn pūsā. Great, sounds great. Your manner is getting better and better. So, we recite it with a tune, and the tune goes like this. Nāmō guānśrīr yīn pūsā nāmō guānśrīr yīn pūsā And it's, dādādādīr dādādādādādā Energetically moving your whole chakra system around, so it's designed. People will recite that literally for days and days and days and days and days, months and years. And that, there's some sense that that particular melody is a very real old melody. So, let's try it. Let's do it three times. If those of you who are melodious jump right in, if you're not melodious jump right in. Nāmō guānśrīr yīn pūsā Put it right in your center. Nāmō guānśrīr yīn pūsā Nāmō guānśrīr yīn pūsā Okay, more on this. What I often tell, this is the Chinese, by the way, nāmō guānśrīr yīn pūsā I often tell kids, we use guānśrīr bori sahaja for the teachings, when we teach kids a lot, because currently we're a child for this being a time of fear sometimes. Everybody's bigger than you are. At night, it gets real dark. Remember Calvin and Hobbes? Remember what lived under the bed in Calvin and Hobbes? You talk to him and feed him, and distract him and stuff. Anyway, we present guānśrīr yīn as a friend, a friend in need, so that if I knew when I was about this tall and I was walking down the road late at night coming home or something, that if I recited it down, once you knew, I had a friend, a big friend. Kids get that pretty quick. My childhood was normal, and there was a certain amount of anxiety. So we often teach that. Very interesting, we've got a wonderful Buddhist song written by Carol King called You Got a Friend. She didn't know, but I'm claiming it. We'll get to that. Now, this is another principle. Why I think great compassion, mahakaruna, is going to be as popular as metta-bhāvanā as when we get in, when we become more familiar, is because there's actual principles here. And since we saw our planet floating in space, the photograph taking the spacecraft, the things were different after we realized that we were just as little marble in this black mirror of infinite space. We started to see a system, and now a global village is just part of our vocabulary. So, and global telecommunications also gives us this sense of real relatedness. We see that there's just these systems of work, and we are in them. We are not apart from them. We are part of them, not separate from them. And Guanyin has this principle called ton-ti-ta, same body, great compassion. That is to say, Buddhism is often called the religion of analysis. One of the nicest things about ududādharma is that you don't leave your mind outside the door when you come in and meditate. You have to stay alert. You have to watch. So, when you analyze the four elements, earth, water, fire, and air, you get a sense of this shared body, same body. For example, there's ton-ti-ta, they are earth, right? You've done this analysis here, I'm sure, many times. Bones, teeth, nails, hair, the hard, the firm parts. When we die, where do they go? Back. They re-embody with the larger body, the plant. So, then we have water. How much? Some people say 80%, some say 75%, the body is liquid. And the composition of it is very much like salt water. Not a whole lot different. The blood, the tears, the sweat, the mucus, etc. So, that water goes back. We can do without food for weeks, sometimes we can't do without water from other candidates. So, water is a big part. Same in whales, same in birds, same in mosquitoes. Some people say it's the same in Republicans, but I'm not convinced. Never mind, we won't go there today. The fire part, 98.6, a little too cold, then work, a little too hot, doesn't work. You've got to keep it constant. What's the biggest fire source of the universe? Because sun, probably. When we pass on that, the sun goes back. Snakes are cold-blooded, yet still there's this warmth. We share that. There's warmth in every mammal. We share that. Non-namals. So, there's also air element. And that's what allows us to communicate, you know, passages. The fact that, by report, every element, any scientist in the room will know better than I, that every element is mostly air, mostly space. Protons, neutrons, electrons are this tiny percentage of every element. The rest is the air they move in. So, our bodies are mostly this. And the air that we're talking through, listening through, using as we breathe, is the same, more or less, like even a few more hydrocarbons, the air that our ancestors breathed, right, and that our grandchildren will be breathing. So, what's the difference? Same body, shared body, great compassion. The difference is what we make with our minds, okay? And often that's a lot of trouble. When you get back down to this level, you say, I would certainly resent being slaughtered and served as dinner, right? So do the other creatures that share this planet resent that. So, great compassion comes first by analyzing our real estate. Okay, not a lot different. Okay, I want to say, okay, yeah, these are two stories. They'll tell me. The, in that universal board chapter from the Lotus Sutra, there's a phrase that occurs called, Nian yi guanyin ni, recall the strength of guanyin bodhisattva. And essentially, it's a strength of heart. It's a strength of not entering your bond, but returning to rescue, right? Coming back because the world is full of the cries, the sounds, the voices of human beings, happy sounds, sad sounds, desperate sounds, tsunami-based sounds, right? Birthday-based sounds. Sister Mary Pham is a Vietnamese Catholic nun who was in my class at the Graduate Theological Union last semester. She grew up in a house that was devoted to guanyin bodhisattva. And interestingly enough, her affinities were with Catholics, but she used the Blessed Virgin, the HPV, to come across into Catholicism, the same heart that worship's going in. So we were, I teach Buddhist Christian dialogue, the GTU, the Holy Hill, okay? And so Sister Mary, wearing her habit, she still wears her habit, she says, oh, guanyin, my mom was so devoted to guanyin, she says, and it worked for her. That's what made me a Catholic nun. She said she was about 10, and she had three sisters, and the war was going on since 1973 or so. And they were in a city, Daat, that was being invaded by the Vietcong, and they were merciless. They were, they, it was a frenzy, it was a fever. They were on the march, they were winning, okay? So they were very, very ready to wipe out any dissident elements and rape any woman they ran across. And so she said, we were in my uncle's house, and there were soldiers coming down the street. And so my mother lifted the trapdoor in the floor and pushed us all down, covered the trapdoor with a rug, and then sat down, crossed her legs, took out her beads, and went, no mu kwet dey, no mu kwet dey, no mu kwet dey, kyoko kyoko nam. Guanyin has four other words, save us from troubles and difficulties. No mu kwet dey, no mu kwet dey, no mu kwet dey, no mu kwet dey, she said, I remember sitting down there, cramping with my sisters, not hearing, breathe, and hearing the shots coming, hearing the machine guns, hearing their voices. They stopped outside the house, so we could hear mom sitting on top of the spot, no mu kwet dey, no mu kwet dey, and the voices said, there's nobody in here, look down the street. Four steps went on, got shots, silence. She heard both, no, no, one day, I'm going to jump, I'm going to jump. She said that voice, there was nobody in the house who said that. That voice came from somewhere else. And she said, they opened the trapdoor and came out, sa, sa, sa. So she says her mother's devotion to Guanyin, she is convinced, was the sort of thing that rescued them. Likewise, Mary, Sister Mary's mother, she says, my mother was determined that the family was going to get out of Vietnam safely. And so at that time, if you wanted to leave Vietnam, you had to have something like five ounces of gold per person to get on these boats that were built for 200, and there were 600 people crammed on the boats, and the boat that got on the boats was down in the water, so the slightest wave had slashed her over the top. And so she said her mother would sell her mother's jewelry, etc., etc., etc., to get five ounces of gold to send her first sister, her second sister, her third sister, Sister Mary herself, and two brothers, one by one. And of course the chances of getting out safely were not very good. It was just too risky. Even if you got across the straits, often they would make land in Malaysia, and the Malaysian army would come down and push the boats back out into the water. You're on your own, try for Hong Kong. So not always, I don't want to paint the Malaysians as great villains, but the Malaysians had 200,000 people suddenly to take care of. If it was the government of San Mateo County, what would they do? Question. So anyhow, she says, mother would get the gold, she would light it since she would bow before Guanyin and spend the entire night chanting and then send her child on the boat. Sister Mary says, it's a problem, what happened? Sister Mary says, three years ago we had a family reunion in Santa Barbara, everyone was there, including mom. Mom, really? Mom. Okay, that's interesting. Okay, so that's the story of a culture where Guanyin has been part of the Buddhist practice for a great long time. Okay, Fran Lawton is a public health nurse who was in Ikaia. She was in Gold Mountain and she said, you really want kids, what should I do? And so she was about to come and talk. So she and her husband came and talked. And he said, well, Guanyin Bodhisattva is very compassionate. If you recite the name of Guanyin and sincerely promise to be compassionate in your heart and live that way, he said, you can head child. Guanyin is very compassionate. Fran says, well, I'm a public health nurse, I'm medically and ferociously low. Nothing to lose. So she made a major Guanyin herself and got some beads and started to recite and recite. And sure enough, she got pregnant. And she went into the hospital. And of course, all the other Americans at Gold Mountain, particularly the women, were just going to be like, oh Fran, what's going to happen? She said, well, help you recite. So they go into the delivery room and they discover that she's got a breach for difficulty. And so she's saying, well, I know my chances. I'm a nurse. That's good. So she's wheeled in. And there's about seven women, her buddies from Gold Mountain outside in the delivery room reciting Guanyin's name. And Fran was wheeled out about two hours later. And they're all going, what's going on? And they say, the story is told, they say she had this incredibly beatific look on her face, this kind of incredulity, but light-filled. And she said, Guanyin is now six foot four, and he's got a brother who's six foot three, red-haired kids. You know, it's like, present that for your witness. OK. Here's Guanyin Borisov with a thousand hands taken from the wall of the library in Dunhuang, the cave temples out in Xinjiang. This was a librarian's wall hanging from the Tang Dynasty. This is the 10th century wall hanging from Dunhuang, China. And how interesting, back, you know, 1,600 years ago, 10 centuries, so 1,100 years ago, Guanyin Borisov was a wall hanging, too. Just the way a lot of people do it now. See these thousand hands that are prepared to offer up and rescue. OK. Now, there's one in of your own nature. This I didn't get translated yet. This says, after I rescue beings from suffering, I allow them to bring forth the great Bodhi resolve, the great resolve for Bodhi daputishin. This is the Bodhicitta. I teach them to bring forth the Bodhi resolve and never retreat from it. Guanyin says, any thoughts of fighting inside, I teach living beings to use patience instead to cross over thoughts of fighting. So this is how Guanyin touches inside, Guanyin in our own nature. This resolve to attain vudu, but to rescue living beings is a great Bodhi resolve. OK. This is Master Shranghwad. There's a story about the pigeons that we're going to skip today with great, great students. OK. Now, here's where I have to beg off. There's, there's, there's, the Chinese devotional nature is very Roman Catholic. There's to say, the world is very animated. There's saints, there's bodhisattvas, there's Dharma protectors, there's gods, dragons, Gandharvas, Ashuras, Garudas, Maharavas, there's all these beings that populate this animistic, wonderfully spiritually charged world that the Chinese Buddhist within. Sometimes it goes to a level of idolatry, that is to say that it's in the image that I always want to bring back to my own mind. I want to bring it back and make it work here. But sometimes you wonder, this is a photograph. It's been colored, originally black and white, taken reportedly by an F-86 pilot in the US Air Force stationed in Taiwan. And he snapped his picture out his window of Guan Yin standing on a dragon in the middle of a storm. OK, so everybody goes, aha, you know, very nice. And the picture circulated widely in the Chinese Buddhist world. This has been tinted in a photograph or something. So I, OK, if you need that, there's a religious space in people's hearts that responds to that. The Blessed Virgin is the same kind of thing. I suspect in some cases, OK, seeing the Blessed Virgin on a piece of toast, you know, $27,000 on eBay, right, did you talk about it? Real sheets, great sheets. With a bite on them too, kind of like the apple logo. So OK, so I don't quite know there. But here's a photograph taken last year at Portola Mountain in the South China Sea. Somebody emailed me this. When I look at that, I think, man, clouds don't do that. What in the world could that be? I don't know. Just present it for your own view. Interesting. So you just wonder, there's a whole lot more that we don't know than we know. And I guess if we let it rest there, we can discover for ourselves. This is the Nelson Gallery's Guan Yin. That's at the front door of the Nelson Gallery in Kansas City. That's Guan Yin and Guoyu Yis. And this image is from when Guan Yin was a male. Guan Yin changed gender. Guan Yin in India was pretty much thought it was a he. The Chinese River desensibility definitely emphasized the feminine. But I think it doesn't matter. I think it's beyond gender. It's my sense of it. This is a Guan Yin-Guoyu Yis from our monastery in Australia. We've got a monastery in the Gulf Coast. This is a lovely bronze image standing in the lowest point. So this is somebody's online Native American Guan Yin with a blue dragon. Oh, interesting. This is a book artist. Alright, now I want to do something here. I was just in Hong Kong for our community. There was a funeral in our, in the elder nuns' pasture. And in Buddhist Asia, Buddhist monks do not play guitars. That's for sure. Just ask Ajahnav Rupi and tell you. But I was a folk singer back when, back in Monty Ute. And I watched James Barras pull out a guitar. James teaches at the birthday of his monastery every Thursday night. They've been there for 10 years now. This is the spirit rock East Bay. So you're a spirit rock South Bay. So anyway, James pulled out a guitar on his 50th birthday. He was celebrated there at the monastery. And by golly, I thought, this is a power tool for us here at the West. And so let's keep that one going. So I recently was in Hong Kong. And I was invited by the culture center, the Taiwanese government. It's as close as they get to an embassy, which they can't have in China, because Hong Kong is not Chinese. But it was a place where you could talk about philosophy and religion. So the law on the philosophy show the religion. So I said, okay, why not really show what Buddhists are doing with Guan Yin bodhisattva in the West? And so I brought my guitar on. Now that was kind of risky. Because you know, there's some such a thing as deportment. And if monks are playing guitars, they definitely would have an opinion about that. So I thought, well, let's try it. And the reason is guitars came to Asia with the Beatles. So guitars equal rock and roll. It's not a native Asian instrument, although it was. It's good. I think it's probably a progenitor. Anyway, so we grew up with guitars as Stephen Foster. The sun shines bright on my own Kentucky. It's part of what we do. It's not the guitar. It's what we're singing. So anyway, let's try. So Jennifer Berezon is a songwriter in Berkeley who is quite a marvelous spokesperson for particularly feminine energies. And she has a song about Guan Yin that I think completely nails it. I think she has the heart of compassion in this song. So I'd like to share it with you. And then you can vote and you can decide whether or not Buddhist monks in America play guitars. And whether this is losing deportment.
