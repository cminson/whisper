The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Good morning everyone. Can you hear me all right? Great. It's nice to see you
not in your heads. And good morning to those of you who are on line and watching
on YouTube and appreciate all the ways in which people attend these Sunday
morning sittings. And I appreciate all of you being here. Walking down here today
I reflect a little bit on how special it is to have a group of people arrive
together, to meditate together, and have some kind of shared interest, interest in
meditating perhaps, and then interested in the kind of space, the kind of ambience
or its mutual support that comes when meditating together in a group. Some
people find it hard to meditate alone and being in a group is really inspiring.
Some people, some of you might be here because of the shared values. There might
be some kind of values that are shared here that are very different than what
you'd find if you go to the mall. You might feel a different set of values
that are being operating there. Maybe some place. And some of you are here
because you're interested in hearing some teachings and maybe because there's
something important going on for you in your life. You're suffering in some way
or challenged in some way and you want to address it and you hope that the
teachings will somehow touch something that you're struggling with
or working with. So this is kind of in the room here. A lot of different
things that I'm reflecting on and many different backgrounds here that people
you all be coming here and maybe some of you bring particular things with
your background and maybe some of you feel particularly safe coming into
an environment like this different than many other places. Some people maybe
don't feel so safe in coming here and looking around wondering you know is
this okay for me to be here maybe first time or a little different than what I
think other people are like and you know is this okay and many years ago there
was a woman who came and she was really concerned about coming here and didn't
quite feel like this okay and am I on the right track if I'm here because so
many of the women here have gray gray hair maybe not maybe not today but
there's there's some and in her culture you didn't let your hair go gray and so
that was that was like a big deal for her and you know it's just do I have to
be like that and so what is here in the room and question for me is speaking to
all of you Dharma teachers I could just kind of read an encyclopedia entry on
some Buddhist topic and then there's the teaching you got it but you're not
here just a meter read and it's like a pedic entry on what mindfulness is you
know there's also things like the way we're attuned to each other we attuned
to this did the meditation do something with the attunement that we share and
the quiet the peacefulness what's here you've sat being mindful for a period of
time and and so what is the connection that you feel now to the room and the
people that was different than when you came in here and maybe some of you
never been in this community before has it changed at all when I you know when
I teach on YouTube and I usually today I don't have a laptop in front of me but
I usually have the screen in front of me and it made such a big difference for me
when I started teaching on YouTube I first time I was gonna like I thought
this is weird you know you know before the pandemic I would have said no way no
way that can't be done but it immediately changed because there were all
these chats and not everyone chats but there was a representative of those
chats and they were so friendly and so appreciative and and something was
conveyed of a connection to people through those chats that they came alive
for me and there was much more than just providing information now if there was
an exchange there was a sense of feeling of of a community in a connection and
maybe some of you were doing on YouTube today are already chatting have
chatted to each other and or you will saying hello for example and so to be
attuned to what what is here what do you hear for and all the different ways and
sure you hear some people some of you have heavy things on your hearts some
of you have you know incurable diseases that are some people have the
recent losses and griefs some of you are really troubled by current events of
different kinds the anti-semitism in this country that's growing seemingly the
the racism in this country which is maybe not growing but becoming more
public and prominent and see in the violence that's becoming stronger and
stronger and seemingly the mass shootings of black people and LGBTQ and
cholera springs black people in Buffalo New York and synagogues so these so you
know is this in the room at all is this you know kind of in the background or
you came here for a respite from all that you didn't want to have these
things named here because like finally this is a place where we don't do that
then we can put it all down so how do I as a Dharma teacher take all this into
account should I take it into account or should I just read encyclopedia entry
on mindfulness and then you know close the book and we can go home and done
with it's much more going on here than just the bare teaching there's a
connection that we have and and part of that connection for me is that I'm
conveying something that I find incredibly valuable and I'm delighted and
grateful that I have the opportunity to share it with a group of people and and
I'd like to support you I'd like to I value you and feel like don't take it
for granted that you've chosen to come here you're doing this practice so I
think it's quite the beautiful thing you're doing and have a lot of respect
for what you've what brought you here and all the different ways so thank you
and I hope to that this what I do today here will have some bearing and and what
I want to do today is partly inspired taking this time the beginning to
establish or to explain all this say all this and that is that what does it
mean to be mindful practice mindfulness in our relationship with other people
and what what what is mindfulness enough is enough just to show up and be with
people mindfully it depends on the answer to that depends a lot on what you
mean by mindfulness what you think it is lately I've been thinking the heart
of mindfulness practice is non non reactive awareness we might react but
the awareness that is not caught in our own reactivity and so we can bring a
kind of attention that is not being influenced by our reactivity so that we
can bring a kind of presence attention to whatever is happening to ourselves the
challenge that we have internally and the challenges we have externally where
we can be present see it clearly but the seeing is non reactive the seeing
stays clear balanced maybe centered maybe available to see clearly and say
this is what's happening and if that kind of is a one definition of mindfulness
non reactive awareness some people with or slightly different definitions some
people get the idea impression that that's enough it's enough just to be you
know just be mindful but it's little bit passive non reactive awareness and and
in being passive what you know is it in is it enough just to be passively aware
non-reactively and you know look at someone then be silent I'm just I'm
just being mindful with you once many years ago I many years ago maybe when
I was more foolish as a teacher but I wanted to again what I wanted to give
a group people a weekend I was teaching on mindful speaking and so I wanted to
get give them the experience of what it's like all the different
communication goes on between us that is not words so I asked them to go into a
dyads and talk to me and one person talk about something really important in
their life I forget what it was and the other person to just listen and look
without any expressions on their face without any nod and just kind of be it
be fully present but not you know not and for anything and you could imagine
that how that went you know it was you know it was kind of it felt pretty
strange and so that group got very clear sense very quickly that there's much
more going on and being present than just being non-reactively aware there's
other factors happening in it and what are those other things that are useful
that are important so one of the things is could be is attunement to be
attuned to the other person and attunement means that we have a sense and
understanding of who the person is what's going on with the individual or
the group that we're here and and and that's how do we become attuned how do
we have a bigger sense of richer sense of who this is person is and what they're
saying what they're feeling what they're expressing what they're hoping for what
their life is about so that they feel seen not just heard and seen just kind
of this non-reactive awareness we don't nod but so they really feel like we're
with them in some ways and that takes take a little bit of time willing to
learn about them find out about them take time to take them in and understand
how they are maybe with if you're just meeting someone maybe with their posture
maybe with their emotional tone maybe with their demeanor that we take in and
really feel and feel connected to and somehow attuned to what's happening here
with this person and many years ago maybe something that was kind of a
little turning point in my social life and in caring being attentive to people
was I was working at a restaurant and I was in the changing room and there was
a changing of shifts and and I was getting ready to leave and a friend of
mine walked in and I just I blurted out something very quick and fun and you
know maybe funny or just kind of made a joke or made a kind of something on a
remark that I think was innocent and finding up in and of itself it was a
way of making a connection but what I hadn't done is taking the time to attune
myself to know and recognize what's going on for my friend where were they
at because I was so spontaneous as soon as I saw my friend and it turned out my
friend another friend of his had just died and he was just coming to work just
with caring with that with him and I had missed that and so in some ways I
caused distress and harm because I hadn't taken the time to get attuned to be
to understand and see and I probably could have picked it up quickly if I
just kind of taken two seconds to wonder what's going on here for this
person and so so to be attuned to someone and so it takes an it means an
interest in the person and one of the things I think that is really helpful
for proper attunement is to respect others to respect their value their
importance to respect their humanity to really kind of be attuned to pay
attention to listen to learn want to find out who this person is with respect
your important respect means you're valuable I see you as being important
enough to get to know and how many times do we not do that just like me with my
friend blurting out you know I've been in situations where I was kind of caught
up in some concern and I just really wanted to get my you know my latest
opinion out and and not really finding out whether the person wanted my
opinion about something or wanted to hear hear a five-minute story about
something that it happened to me you know that day and so you know I've talked
to people sometimes you know just kind of caught up in my own thing and then
eventually halfway through or something kind of noticing the person's eyes have
glazed over and and why didn't I notice this earlier did they just glaze over or
how long how long were they glazed over so so you know to talk as if the other
person is not there and I've been on the receiving end of this where people have
talked to me and like a few times maybe not a lot of times but a few times over
the many years I've had people talk to me and I kind of felt they must be
somehow high on something you know I don't think they were you know any
drugs but they were like they were like like I could have gone like this in
front of their eyes and they wouldn't they wouldn't have seen me the eyes were
kind of locked into their concern and it was quite just kind of a little bit I
don't know possessed at the right word or but you know really kind of in their
thing in such an intensity that I kind of felt like I didn't exist and you know
listening to them so to be attuned to be interested in being attuned so
mindfulness in relationship to other people like to propose is more than
non-reactive awareness it's an awareness that searches for an attunement what is
here what's going on here and that's also true for ourselves the non-reactive
awareness that we bring to ourselves is also an awareness that's doing something
deeper to ourselves and just kind of matter of fact seeing things as they are
but it's a vehicle for deeper attunement to ourselves to get to know
ourselves in a deeper and fuller way and then there's and then with
attunement then there's also connection the rapport that we have with someone
what is that connection what is going on between us is there friendliness is
there is there resistance as a hostility is there disinterest is there is the
person why is this person keep looking at the door you know you know not
looking at me there's something going on here what's happening here in that
connection but I think I would like to suggest when there we when we bring the
mindfulness practice if we really want to be mindful and really use them get
the most out of mindfulness that it means we're also being attuned to how
we're connected and being careful with that and perhaps being conscious
conscientious about a connection which is healthy that is nourishing that
supportive that helps us feel more connected to each other rather than
more separate and one of the one of the reflections that I often do during and
also after being with someone was did what I say and how we were together do I
not feel more connected with them or do I feel more disconnected and I've said
things certainly that at the moment or sometimes afterwards I think I could
feel that the person kind of pulled back little bit or shut down little bit or
that made everyone quiet and and and so there was a disconnect so for example
some emotional expressions like anger will will sever a connection I mean some
people have been angry very quickly in short notice and the connection to
someone has been severed for decades it doesn't take so much sometimes to a real
dramatic severing of connections to happen but you know you see you can feel
that is that what you want do you want to kind of really have that cutting
people off or pulling back or do you want to kind of create a possibility for
deeper connection what's the value what what it was important for you is in your
attunement to it all do you recognize in yourself that you're afraid what
happens if your anxiety is there with in the relationship and maybe there's good
reason for it but how do you then establish connection or how do you care
for that connection with your anxiety do you tell someone you know I feel
anxious right now but I still want to go for a walk with you and maybe we'll just
talk just know that I'm feel anxious that's how how I am or do you somehow
adjust that just the situation so you can feel ease more at ease with your
anxiety maybe it's better if you go for a walk maybe it's better if you say let's
go get some tea just something to break you know because it seems a little bit
too intense otherwise just having a cup of tea between you that can be a great
protection you know you don't have to be you don't have to be completely
connected you know because you're drinking so this is a little I don't know
private thing I'll tell you that I don't know how far I wanted to go on YouTube
the world is so I teach retreats a lot and and you know and I love teaching
these retreats they're wonderful and but the most difficult part of the retreat
for me is when it's finally over we're in this big room at our retreat center
and we're sitting in a circle and it's finally over everyone gets up and they
can talk to each other and everything and that's the hardest part for me
because for good reasons you know people feel grateful or feel like they've
really shared something deep during the retreat and I'm the teacher for the
retreat so I'm kind of the point person for what happened maybe and so people
come up to me with certain kind of like it's really important that I have some
important things they want to say they say it with all this week-long retreat
energy and and I'm you know kind of you know how I am with them has some more
value in that context than you know just someone they met at the mall and so you
know so so for standing I learned I feel like I have to offer a lot of
attention to really be there and receive them and acknowledge it and so
that's fine in and of itself but there's a series of people like that and so I
end I'm exhausted so that's the most tiring part of the whole retreat so
what I've learned to do is you know with the closing circle I'm sitting in a
chair and and everyone gets up and talks what I've learned to do is I don't
leave the chair and by not leaving the chair there's a very different way
that people like what they expect from me if I'm sitting in a chair and they
come up to me they kind of don't expect me to be fully there I'm kind of I can
be I can be kind of casually there from sitting in a chair and then so and so
then that's it works really well for me and I appreciate talking to them it's
nice you know and I can be there and and and it's somehow easier the whole
thing is more relaxed and so so here's you know a connection that didn't work
for me I recognized it and I found another way to be with people in a way
that worked so what is the connection how do we establish the connection what
are we doing with that connection are we is how we're being with it are we
losing connection are we severing connection are we healing connection are
we making connection are we finding a way to be together it's nice that's all
part of the the art of being mindful in relationship so attunement connection
and then there's also a connection while we do this to something that's other
different than just who we are together as a group you know individuals one on
one for example there's also the what else is here so for example here at the
IMC for this today we're not just meeting at the cafeteria at the mall and to
talk we're here at a meditation center after having meditated together as a
group and there's something about this room with a high ceiling at place
people meditating now here for 20 years before those 20 years there was about
almost maybe 40 years where people there were Christians who were here use
there's a Christian church and they were Christian mystics and they sat in
silence here in this room and part of the reason they wanted us to have it was
this church is because we sat in silence they wanted to have that continue so we
have this you know this now you hear this history right of the place and so
there's something here that we're sitting in there's a Dharma we have the
Buddha statue you know so the Dharma some what does that mean for you what are
the associations we have the values the background some of you might have been
born into a Buddhist family and so there's a deep family connection family
history and associations and that with with being here and Buddhism some people
it's other things that you associate with it that maybe maybe even touches
into onto the sacred coming in a place like this or something maybe some
something spiritual here that you feel and sense and what's what's going on
here so what is that that's part of this picture too so what else is going on
when you're mindful of being with another person mindful being with the
group of people is there an ambience is there an environment is there a wider
kind of association of feeling of what's here and how do we take that into
account the how do we care for that and so what else is present here so this
question what is present is kind of the core one of the one way of saying the
core question of mindfulness what is present here but if you ask the question
what is present here you're opening yourself up to discover something take
the time to feel and sense and know what is present here and if you only ask the
question once you probably only get one answer if you ask the question twelve
times you've got twelve different answers there's so much here so in any
situation but not so much that you have to ask this all the time but mindfulness
is also entering into situations kind of available ready what to let's let
yourself be informed a kind of a way of paying attention that you're available
to feel and discover and learn what else is here what's here in the fullness of
things that you can't if you're completely preoccupied in your concern
and whatever it might be and you know but there's a kind of a dropping of
self-concern enough that you can what is present here and everything I'm
talking about how to do this with other people is something we do to ourselves
as well what is present here and me if you're caught up in the thoughts of
self-concern me myself and mine ruminating about you know something about
yourself it's difficult to be have this kind of what is present here question
what's really here to be a tune to yourself to discover the same thing if
you ask yourself that twelve questions in meditation you might get twelve
different answers but you might be living in only one of them what happens if
you open keep opening what self is here what else is here so so one way that in
the wider outside the Buddhist inside world that some people refer to what
I'm talking about to hear is not mindfulness they talk use the word
presence practicing presence practicing presence to the present moment and so
practicing presence means mindful but you're being mindful more than just with
the cognitive mind that knows you're being present with all your faculties
you know in your body hearing listening smelling feeling emoting kind of the
residents all the ways in which we resonate and feel what's going on presence
means so much more than just mindfully you know non-reactive awareness I think
or it fills it fills it it puts you know fullness into what non-reactive
awareness might be but what's fascinating for me about this word
presence it can be something we do but it's also what's the what's what's
present here and some people say what's present here is many things and so
there's a presence here of calm there's a present here of attentiveness there's
a presence here of maybe of certain values many people when they come into a
Buddhist community have a heightened value in kindness friendliness compassion and and so you know there's so
the what's the presence of a kind community or presence of a space where
people there's an openness and attentiveness awareness so and so you
know in some circles you know again you know non-Buddhist circles people are
also practicing mindfulness but they call it the presence of God or the
presence of the divine or the presence of the sacred or the presence of in
Buddhism people might say the presence of emptiness or the presence of
compassion you know what is it is there something here some of you might not
would prefer not to use these languages this way of talking but in if you want
to kind of understand a little bit our practice of mindfulness that how it
overlaps with so many different practices in other religions in other
ways you mean to kind of appreciate that they have other language than we have
and one of them is presence and so when you show up what's the presence you
bring not just what what awareness do you bring but what more do you bring to
the table to the situation and sometimes I go home and and I feel you know I
bring exhaustion you know after a seven-day retreat sometimes and after
that closing circle you know I bring exhaustion sometimes I come home from
retreat and I bring a lot of calmness I feel very quiet sometimes I bring all
kinds of different things home sometimes I bring grumpiness home you know
and and you know so what's the what what kind of presence do we bring in this
situation and how do we how do we bring awareness to how we are and what we're
bringing to it where we hold it with this non-reactive awareness the bottom line
for mindfulness practitioners I would like to suggest suggest or the kind of
the first first first approach is to really learn well what non-reactive
awareness is that's really key to everything else because without the
non-reactive awareness self-awareness can be bad news for a few of us you know
people discover all kinds of things about themselves which are not
necessarily you don't necessarily have it projected onto the walls everyone to
see what's going on in your mind and or you know where we have a grumpy or
something you know it's like oh no not again and or other people are being
grumpy and not again you feel like that last time I was this person there grumpy
and I think I'm going to recede into the background or shut down a little bit
because this is too much for me or I don't know you know what exactly I'm
saying here what I'm trying to get across is if we can learn to practice
non-reactive awareness if that can be the bottom line the kind of fundamental
thing we're doing then all the other things we pay attention to it's a
little bit safer it's a little bit wiser a little bit more it kind of works
better because then we don't get caught in our reactivity in the way that we're
present and aware so I might be grumpy but I'm not been afraid or angry with
myself or self-conscious or embarrassed just oh I'm just grumpy that's how it
is now and and you know and so it's very different than if I'm embarrassed or
upset with myself and the same thing with other people occasionally people in
the world don't behave very well it might happen and and then if we can have
non-reactive awareness of it then maybe there's a whole different way in which
the situation can unfold for example what if the person's misbehaving and what
if you say what else is present here how what what what is it what can it be I
attuned to in this person this person certainly angry but as I take the time
to attune myself to the person I see the person's also very afraid that seems
to be the background for this anger is their fear and insecurity does that make
a difference how you relate to them and then how you connect then because of
it or you know so this non-reactive awareness is the foundation so but
non-reactive awareness maybe is not enough maybe the fullness of mindfulness
practice has all these different dimensions to it that do it does
involved is not passive does involve intentionality of some type free from
you some sense of purpose let's let's practice non-reactive awareness to
become better attuned better connected better aware of the context of the
atmosphere and what else is present here let's enter into this world more
fully so that we can be wise and caring for this world in a way that we can't if
we are not really aware attuned connected and respectful of everyone so
mindfulness bringing mindfulness into your life at the end of retreats people
often ask is mindfulness is fine how do I bring it into my life and some of you
maybe got more than you wanted to today wow that's a lot of work it's a lot to
do so maybe we can take a couple of minutes if some of you have a comment
or a question you'd like to make about any of this but anything else we have a
few minutes here with the non-reactive awareness and just being aware of sort
of this where other people are at where you're at I've had situations and I've
heard a lot of teachers say the way people behave towards you has more to
do with them than you so I try to bring that into my awareness but sometimes if
there's like so much of someone's anger coming towards you I I just don't know I
can't always be present with that and work with it and it's very upsetting in
relationships because I feel like there's been situations where I I didn't feel like
I did anything but I'm bringing up something and someone else and then it
just it wasn't saveable even with the awareness of what's going on in that
other person so I guess in that situation I can only work with my
reactions to it and it's just really it can be very painful yeah yeah so there's
huge the topic what you're raised there's so many variables so many different
ways that this plays itself out so I'll say a few words one is that there is
something to be said about being prepared for those those events not to
kind of just show up and think you're supposed to take care of it then and
there but if it's a regular thing enough prepare yourself and one of the ways is
to meditate necessarily just before the event but just a regular practice
because it gives you the presence of mind the calmness the attentiveness so
that you're not reactive excessively that someone's angry with you and then you
can kind of be a little bit calm enough to then find your bearings and know what
you should do that's one the other is in preparing if it's someone you know well
and this happens you know regularly enough wait for a time when it's not
happening and everything is cool and nice and say can we can we have a little
conversation it would be helpful for me you know I get really afraid when you're
challenging for me when you're angry and probably gonna happen again could we
have some understanding of how we navigate that next time it happens like
can I just raise my hand and and we pause and breathe deeply for three breaths
would that be okay with you or something you know you know see if you can make
some kind of arrangement ahead of time might might work might not and some
sometimes it's helpful in terms of I mean in certain certain circumstances it's
helpful to let people know the impact their anger has on you and and there are
some people if you tell them boy when you're I feel really afraid right now
people can some people are surprised by that and it kind of changes the context
like you know like well what do I do now with my anger if they're afraid do I
just keep going or hold back and and so some people that's a powerful thing to
say I'm why I'm really afraid right now and then it might change the context of
the conversation it happened here in this building for me once where we were
doing renovation on the building and there was a lot of noise and one of the
neighbors who had a tendency to complain about any noise that came out of this
building I mean imagine this is what do we do here but occasionally you know
there's noise coming out and there was a renovation work and the person came
over and was furious and it was I was the recipient of this fury and I just
stood there receiving all this fury was quite something and the person finally
paused and I said this I said oh well you know I feel really afraid right now
the person immediately calmed down it was dramatic and and I don't think the
person wanted to have that impact and realizing how big the impact had been
then it the person backed down dramatically from it and we the whole
thing kind of you know de-escalated or whatever so I don't know that doesn't
always work but it's a whole art I mean this I don't want to suggest that it's
a simple and easy thing to do and sometimes certain situation the best
thing to do is get out of there stand behind someone else you know so it's
so many different you know scenarios that where this plays out but but this
idea of preparing yourself thinking this prep you know by just practicing and
developing capacity for mindfulness and calm awareness so that the best you have
maybe maybe the best chance to figure out what to do thank you it's maybe one
more all the way in the back if you don't mind taking it there and then we'll
just we'll stop here all the way yeah well I noticed in myself that I became
reactive when I heard that this was being broadcast on YouTube and I'm just
wondering what your thoughts are and how we can mindfully relate with YouTube
and social media because YouTube is you know the the the politics the economics
the capitalism the there's so many so many problems with YouTube and social
media and all these reasons right things like that yeah I was just wondering
what your thoughts were on that yeah that's a big topic and I think it's
reasonable to have your concern and I wish I was as well-informed maybe as
you are but all this works so I I'm remiss in not being fully educated about
the impact and how it all works but what I what I understand is that we're
using the social media or the YouTube that's what it's called YouTube and for
for a greater good and we're taking something and we're putting a positive
spin in it so it's being used in a good healthy way and one of the evidence is
that maybe it's a healthy place on YouTube was at some point someone joined
us for the first time on YouTube and they put in the chat this is the
friendliest place I've ever seen on YouTube and so you know I don't know if
that's true I don't I'm not on YouTube otherwise but but I'm hoping that the
goodness of what we're doing here is doing greater good for the world and
harm okay thank you thank you so there's a T now as you say hello to each
other some of you are here for the first time are new what I'd like to ask you if
you're willing and you don't have to but if you could just turn to someone next
to you and say hello and even if it's your first time here welcome them welcome
you welcome each other and if you want to tell a little bit more you can say it
was anything about this talk that was you know maybe useful for you to hear
interesting that you want to kind of think about more or something and then
just it can just be two minutes or so if you'd like it just is just to be
friendly and and then if those of you want to stay we'll have the tea time and
stand outside we can take off the masks outside and it's blue skies so it should
be good for a few minutes for a little while thank you
