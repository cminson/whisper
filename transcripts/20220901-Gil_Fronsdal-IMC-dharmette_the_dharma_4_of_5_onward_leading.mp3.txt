So, my friends, we continue now on the five characteristics of the Dharma. 
And this little statement is often chanted. 
It's part of the probably daily liturgy of Theravada and monastics. 
The Dharma is well spoken by the Buddha. 
It is visible here. 
It is immediate now. 
It invites us to see its onward leading to be experienced personally by the wise. 
So, today the topic is onward leading. 
This is a beautiful and wonderful quality of the Dharma, quality of this practice we do, that it is onward leading. 
It leads to what's really good. 
It leads to freedom. 
It leads to peace, to a kind of dharmic happiness. 
And how it leads there is also quite fascinating because we certainly have our role in the practice in going the path of practice. 
But also, there's a way in which we end up kind of doing this practice in the current that carries us in the direction of what's good and healthy. 
That there's something that we discover that leads us to greater peace and happiness. 
And so, in this way, the Dharma's onward leading carries us on. 
And how does this work? What is this? And some of it has to do with this ouch and the ah that I talked about in the meditation today. 
And that is that it's simplistic to just orient ourselves to feel and sense things from the point of view of an ouch and an ah. 
But the benefit of it is it's so simple. 
The ouches don't have to be understood in all their complicated ways. 
Just to take it, you know, whether it's, you know, some irritation at having an, you know, I don't know. 
Meditation cushion is too hard to having some major world of difficulty happen for us. 
We just see ouch, no stories, no complicated things, no trying to understand why. 
And the same thing for the ah, we can get sensitive to what feels good and feels right and move in that direction without making it complicated for us, without appropriating it for self, for me, myself, and mine, identity. 
Not making it a big project, an engineering project, understanding why we're doing it and questioning what is this all for or am I doing the right thing? There's a way of making it so simple that comes from a sensitivity and ability to be really here and present. 
So this is not thinking about things. 
It's more closer to feeling things or sensing or experiencing the ouch and the ah. 
That's the other advantage of these words is they're more experiential than they are concepts and ideas. 
So as we're able to kind of stay here in our direct experience, as we're able to stay in the direct experience now and this extended now and maybe even timeless now, really stay here time for time. 
Just relax and not rushing and being ahead of ourselves here. 
And we respond to the call to see more carefully what is here? What is this experience? What's going on here? And to see as simple as oh, that's ouch and that's ah. 
If I'm breathing in a way that feels a little bit shallow and deep and maybe a little uncomfortable, then I might have a thought that wow, I ate too much breakfast and I'm always eating too much breakfast and I'm a lousy breakfast eater and now I can't be a good meditator. 
All those sentences, all those attitudes have an ouch to them. 
If you're really quiet, if you're in the thoughts, if you become the thoughts, then they kind of drive the show and we almost don't even see the ouch in them. 
But if we're quiet and peaceful and calm enough, we can say oh, that's an ouch. 
There's another ouch. 
I do a lot of ouches. 
These are the second arrows that we talk about in Buddhism. 
How we pile, we might have something uncomfortable, some suffering and then we add suffering on top of it. 
Then on top of it, there will be layers and layers of self-criticism or blame on the world or anger or despair or all kinds of extra things. 
And so this simplicity is oh, that's an ouch. 
And have time for that. 
Oh, not in a hurry, not pushing it away, not judging it. 
Just oh, look at that. 
That's certainly an ouch. 
And because of that time, lots of time that we have to be here, then we can also feel and sense there's a direction. 
There's something that opens up in the direction of an ah. 
There's a way of being that's onward leading. 
There's another way. 
In fact, the simple fact that I'm giving time and space to feel the ouch, that is an ah, that is good. 
The ability to step back and see it, to be curious, not entangled in it, but to see it from a place of some modicum of calm, that's an ah. 
Trust that. 
Use that as a guide. 
That is onward leading. 
Stay close to the ah, the uncomplicated ah. 
If there's an ah that we stand appropriate for ourselves and say, oh, that's really good. 
I should really kind of luxuriate and really kind of indulge in it, or relish it, or this is my chance. 
And if you do, in fact, give yourself time to feel what's going on, to really see it, you'll see the stress in those attitudes. 
You'll see the ouch in it. 
The onward leading way is the way in which mindfulness is self-correcting or corrects us. 
Mindfulness gives us information for what is ouch and what is ah. 
And as the practice deepens, as we get calmer and the ah opens up to more time or space, more present moment attention, more sensitivity, it works beautifully to help us not get caught in the ouches and to move towards a more and more valuable ah, a more and more valuable way of kind of moving towards greater peace or greater freedom. 
The word for onward leading in Pali is upani in that phrase. 
It's upanayako. 
And the upa is a prefix that can mean upward, and the nayako is to lead. 
And so upa can be upwards, leading upwards, which is kind of a metaphor for moving towards freedom. 
It could also, the upa also has a prefix meaning of near, leading close to. 
So this leads closer to freedom. 
This leads closer to peace. 
This leads closer to what really feels right here, full, present. 
And sometimes we follow that path towards what's onward leading, upward leading, brings us closer. 
And sometimes what you can feel is that we're being brought there, that the dharma is leading us, the dharma is guiding us. 
We're in the current that flows in that direction. 
And a lot of what the practice becomes is just continuing to open and let go of anything that gets in the way of that process. 
It's letting go of all the alchas, all the self-centered efforts we might do. 
And part of the practice is to know when to let go, when to trust that process. 
And that takes this very deep sensitivity of comes from being present in a timeless way almost, to really feel and sense what's here. 
So we can sense and feel when it's best for us and most healthy for us, most awe for us to come back, to apply ourselves, to let go of something, and be more actively involved because the alternative is worse. 
And when the best alternative is not to do so much, just let go, let go, let go. 
And then that letting go, feel like being carried and moved along. 
So it's one of the great aspects of the dharma is that the dharma is not external to us. 
It's found inside of us. 
And it's found inside of us in this onward leading way in which our psychophysical system moves towards freedom given a chance, that has a capacity to move towards the greater awe, the greater ease, the less stress to the absence of stress, the absence of strain, the absence of inner oppression that we can often live under. 
So try today to go through parts of the day or the whole day. 
See how simple you can make this understanding, this observation, of suffering in your life and happiness in your life. 
Make it so simple, there's an ouch and there's an awe. 
And see in that simplicity whether there's a little more freedom around the ouches and a reminder to kind of stay calm and mindful. 
And a greater awareness of the awe, the possibility that you don't have to sacrifice, that maybe you don't want to ignore, that you want to make space for this awe because it's onward leading, it creates a good environment. 
It also creates a more onward leading healthy direction for our social relationships. 
And that's part of the value of this dharma. 
It also supports our communities, our relationships to move in a healthy direction. 
So try today's, keep it simple, ouch and awe. 
And if you can have enough time to really feel that, maybe you can feel the onward leading nature, the door that opens up from the awe that can take you further in the direction of awe. 
So enjoy and I look forward to giving the last talk on this series tomorrow. 
Thank you.
