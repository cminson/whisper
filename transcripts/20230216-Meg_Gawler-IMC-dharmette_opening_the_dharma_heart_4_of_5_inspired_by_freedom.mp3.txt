 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. Greetings Dharma friends. I'm very glad to be here with you. And this is the fourth talk this week on the theme of opening the Dharma heart. The early Pali texts talk about opening the Dharma eye when a follower of the Buddha awakens and fully penetrates and realizes the Dharma from themselves. And what's necessary for this insight to happen is to understand the truth of how things really are. The wonderful artist Mark Chagall said, If I create from the heart nearly everything works. If from the head almost nothing. And I believe this is especially true for everyone who has suffered greatly. I talked earlier this week about this Dharma practice as a process of sculpting ourselves as though we're creating a beautiful work of art. Where more and more through our practice would become a force of beauty and goodness for both ourselves and others. So I think I coined this expression opening the Dharma heart, which by the way is not canonical. Because for me, opening the mind was not enough for getting ready for the insights that give rise to liberation. I had to progressively little by little for a long time, learn how to open the heart. And this wasn't going to happen if I couldn't fully accept myself, warts at all. So the heart had to open for the mind to be able to settle down. In my case, to be comfortable, resting in moments of emptiness. And to open the doors and windows to let in the sunlight and spaciousness of the Dharma. Like many of you, I'm a creature of this Western culture. And it's quite intuitive for me to distinguish between the mind and the heart. But this may not have been the case for the disciples of the Buddha. It's fascinating that Chitang, the word in Pali that means mind, also means heart. And even today when you ask someone in the Indian subcontinent to point to their mind, most people will put their hand on their heart. So this week we're talking about the qualities of mind that the Buddha held as valuable in preparing for awakening. We've seen that we need to cultivate receptivity, making space in the mind to receive the Dharma. We need a soft mind, which in Pali is mudu. And when I talked about this on Tuesday, I mentioned that the etymological root, mud, means not only soft, but also happy. And then I went for a walk afterwards, and I had sort of a mental light bulb, and I said to myself, but of course, when the mind is soft, even temporarily, if it really doesn't have sharp edges, one can't help but feel happy. So it completely makes sense actually that the root of this quality could evolve into either softness or happiness. And yesterday we evoked the quality of having a mind that is free of preoccupations, again, even just temporarily. And likewise, the absence of the hindrances is naturally a source of gladness because we're no longer slaves to our preoccupations. What a relief. We can be here in the present moment with more agency when the hindrances are not pushing us around. And moments like that are really moments of freedom. And this taste of freedom leads naturally to the quality that really woke today. So the Pali word for today's wholesome quality is udaga, which comes from the prefix ud and the word aga. And ud means upwards. And aga has a number of different meanings. As an adjective, it means highest, foremost, supreme, ultimate, superb, and as a noun, peak, top, conclusion, result. So this may sound a little abstract, but in fact, udaga is usually translated as elated or inspired. It can also mean enraptured or exalted. And this kind of intense rapture is an early phase of deep concentration in meditation. And in this context, I think it's important to recognize that there may be dangers if when we experience being elated like this, it can be pretty enrapturing. And it could become a preoccupation in itself if we cling to the intense pleasure that it produces. And I think this quality, the way that Buddha was intending us to welcome it, is more a quality of being inspired in a way that allows the mind to settle. So that the dregs can filter out and we have the genuine clarity to be able to receive these insights. So we don't want to be captured by being elated. And as I said, I think it's important to recognize that there is a lot of importance in the mind of the dregs. And so we have the ability to be able to receive these insights. So we don't want to be captured by being elated. And as I said earlier, all of these wholesome qualities exist on a broad spectrum. And they're, of course, easier to access on a long meditation retreat. But it's worthwhile tuning into and recognizing even subtle occurrences of them during our daily meditation and daily life. As the Buddha teaches in the Dhammapada, all experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind. Speak or act with a corrupted mind and suffering follows, as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of the ox. All experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind. Speak or act with a peaceful mind and happiness follows, like a never-departing shadow. That we're constantly creating our experience by what we focus on. And the news is full of disasters and unethical behavior. But it's worthwhile taking the time to make space in the mind for what inspires us. Perhaps we can think of the courage and generosity of all the rescue workers in Ukraine and Turkey and Syria and elsewhere in the world, who risk their own lives to help others. And in our meditation practice, even if we have short moments of receptivity, softness, and malleability, and the freedom from being pushed around by our preoccupations, just a tiny moment of that is worth celebrating. And for me to have confidence that this dharmic path I'm trying to walk is the right place to be brings me great gladness. I know that I'm in good hands. I know I'm on the right track. And it's okay to walk this path, even with imperfections. So I hope you can take that in and trust yourselves to be worthy practitioners. Don't be impatient. This Dharma path is made for slow bloomers, as well as fast bloomers. And there really is space for all beings to be here. So we can be inspired by tasting and celebrating even short moments of being free of the hindrances. So as you open your hearts and minds in your meditation practice and in your mindfulness throughout the day, be sure to honor those tastes of freedom and let them bring you gladness. So that's your homework. Making peace with who you are and recognizing and even letting yourself be inspired by whatever tastes of freedom are offered to you moment by moment. Thank you for your practice. May your day be sprinkled with moments of gladness. And may your practice inspire you.
