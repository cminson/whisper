 Okay. And I want to thank you, Neil, for posting, as always, information about Happy Hour Google Groups in chat where folks can join. Information is shared often on these Google Groups. And yeah, it's a place for Sangha to connect. So, so hello and welcome everyone. So happy to be with you to see you and to practice together in this day, observing independence in the US. And the topic of independence can have many different connotations, many different connotations, of course, in this context celebrated here as independence, having autonomy, being able to have autonomy to make one's own choices, etc. So, so one way we can in the Dharma in the practice in our practice, the theme of independence can show up in many ways. One is to have independence, to have autonomy through practice, from what's called the three poisonous roots from greed, hatred, and confusion, so that we have autonomy from them, we're not bound by them. Something arises, some thought arises in the mind, all of a sudden greed arises, we need to have it, we want to have it, or we hate it, make it go away. So as if we're in bondage, as if we are in bondage, we don't have control. We don't, we don't have autonomy. That's the word I want to use. We don't have autonomy, it seems like we're on a leash, like greed and hatred and delusion. So that's one way I like to think of independence in the Dharma, independent in the Dharma. And there's other senses of independence in the Dharma when one actually practices for a while. The practice becomes the path, the path becomes life becomes practice, practice becomes life interchangeably. And there is a sense of trust, there's a sense of trust in the practice that arises, there's a sense of autonomy that arises actually. One has this complete faith and trust that these practices actually work. I'm freer, I have more freedom. Again, freedom in the sense, in the sense of dharmic senses and freedom to go and wreak havoc and do whatever, but it's freedom from again, these bondages, greed, hatred, delusion, these bondages in the mind and heart that come up and we are reactive, we act reactively. So there's a lot of and also to say, Kim Allen, who's one of the teachers at IMC, gave a lovely talk about other nuances of independence in the Dharma, independent in the Dharma on Sunday, yesterday. And so that's an audio Dharma for any of you who would like to listen to that. But for tonight, for so having acknowledged this idea of independence in the Dharma, it depends from greed, hatred, delusion. One way, one way of practicing, which is what we cultivate here, in happy hour, the practices of the heart, which support which are liberating practices, which they attenuate greed, hatred and delusion, they also attenuate, especially hatred, self hatred, hatred of others, self judgment, like, judgment, criticism, all these bondages of the mind, all these habitual patterns that can become a lot bring up a lot of sadness, bring up a lot of depression, bring up anxiety, bring up a sense that you're imprisoned, you're imprisoned in your own mind, you're imprisoned in your own life, because of these prisons that we create in your in our own hearts and mind habitually. And sometimes we can step out and look at our way of thinking and go, huh, that wasn't very helpful. What was I thinking you can, their sense of freedom, sense of freedom when you step out of yourself, when you step out of some habitual ways of thinking that may not be supportive may not be helpful. So, so with that, another theme I want to bring in in our practice, which will start in just a few seconds is the theme of interdependence, independence always brings up a sense of interdependence, the more we become independent in the Dharma, the more we feel the more we become fully aware of our interdependence with other beings, our interdependence with others, people we love people, we don't like, we see our independence interdependence with all beings. So independence in the Dharma brings up a sense of interdependence with all beings everywhere. I am because you are, you are because I am our happiness, our goodness, our freedom is dependent on each other. Which is also similar to the concept of Ubuntu. In South African culture, Ubuntu, I am because you are so. All right, I've said plenty. So that's setting that is the setting for our practice tonight. And I'll weave some of these themes together and allow silence, silent space stretches for us to explore. So without further ado, dear ones, let's let's get into our practice together. Landing, landing, landing into our body, landing with a sense of recognition of this moment, recognition of this body, turning our gaze inward, allowing the breath, the entirety of the in breath, especially the entirety of the out breath, making space for the next in breath. Ah, to be soothing, calming, to connect, arrive and land in this body. As each in breath and out breath on their own, breathing, being breathed. And noticing that your mind can have malleability in this moment. As you invite it, invited to connect with the breath, being calm, self-soothed, to have a sense of independence. Even if for a moment, from habitual thoughts, patterns of mind, a sense of freedom, freed for a moment, releasing, letting go. Ah, as if thoughts are the fireworks of the mind, letting them go. Ah, burst. And in between there's stillness, silence, freedom, independence from habitual patterns of the mind, even for just a moment. And then tying these little moments together. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, releasing, releasing. Not that there is anything wrong with thinking, but in this moment, but in this moment giving our heart, giving ourselves completely to this practice Sittling, quieting the mind, receiving each breath Celebrating independence from habitual thoughts, putting them down with respect, with kindness Claiming our autonomy, our independence in this moment Sittling, quieting the mind, receiving each breath Celebrating independence from habitual thoughts, putting ourselves completely to this practice Sittling, quieting the mind, receiving each breath Celebrating independence from habitual thoughts, putting ourselves completely to this practice Sittling, quieting the mind, receiving each breath Celebrating independence from habitual thoughts, putting ourselves completely to this practice Sittling, quieting the mind, receiving each breath Celebrating independence from habitual thoughts, putting ourselves completely to this practice Sittling, quieting the mind, receiving each breath Celebrating independence from habitual thoughts, putting ourselves completely to this practice Sittling, quieting the mind, receiving each breath Noticing the freedom that arises When you notice thoughts or habitual patterns and kindly, gently, smilingly let go Ah, the peace, the ease The freedom that shows up in the body, the heart and mind Sittling, quieting the mind, receiving each breath Observing that sitting or lying being where you are in this moment Noticing that it's dependent, dependent on gravity Hmmm Noticing the contact points between your bottom and the cushion, your feet on the floor Your lower legs if you're sitting on the floor Contact, contacting the earth And how this body is dependent on the air that we're all breathing in this moment Interdependence, appreciation, gratitude for this gift Of the air, life-giving breath The parts of the body are so many processes in this body, so many processes that work Even if there may not be full health at this moment or some pain, but so many processes work interdependently with one another Appreciating, appreciating Hmmm All the interdependence, the processes of this body They depend on each other Hearts and lungs, that the lungs bringing oxygen, the heart pumping blood, etc, etc So many systems interdependently working And this body interdependent on the food, on the air On the food we eat, this body eats to sustain itself The earth, the land, the sun, the water, that helps produce the food The farmers, the drivers, the shippers All the infrastructure, the store, and the town, the country, and the world And all the people who have something to do, a part to play The food that sustains us, every bit touching every piece Of what supports us, the clothes we wear The technology we're using to connect right now, to practice together And all the people, all the beings We have depended, we have depended on All the people who have nurtured us, cared for us Who've challenged us, pushed our buttons so we grow Who've come to this world, helpless baby, helpless, no more So much interdependence, so much to be grateful for That has sustained us, that we have contributed to, we continue to People whose lives we touch directly or indirectly Gratitude, awe, sense of awe, stepping outside of ourselves for a moment As if we're looking at this planet, at this universe with all these beings Interconnected, all these systems interconnected Sense of awe, amazing Stepping out of ourselves, this being that is us, deeply connected Not an island, deeply, deeply connected Even if we feel disconnected As a physicist, one's up In order to make apple pie, you need to create the whole universe first Allowing sense of gratitude and appreciation arise from a sense of awe And awe and appreciation turned around and radiated through the whole world with good will Wishes a well-being for all beings, this interconnected web of life, all the critters Including ourselves And all beings Be well You You You You You You You You're welcome to do metta with phrases, if you wish, or just radiating good will and friendliness All around, touching yourself first All right Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wishing well for all the beings, all these interdependent ecosystems. All the plankton in the sea. All the sustenance for other organisms, all the fish. All the little critters that crawl and hop and slither. All the mammals, all four-legged creatures, all two-legged creatures. All creatures that fly. You can choose particular creatures, if you wish, to wish well for. May you be safe, happy, healthy, and have ease. You're interdependence with your family of origin. You're interdependence with so many chosen families, communities, sanghas. May all be well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For the last moment of this practice, let's step outside of ourselves for a moment again, as if we're looking at ourselves. Our life is at our interconnection, interdependence. We're not an island. Letting that interdependence fill our heart with awe and appreciation for all the ways we receive and all the ways we give, acknowledging the giving too. The way this person you're watching who's yourself is a good friend to someone, perhaps a sibling of someone, a colleague of someone, so many other functions. Bowing to the inner goodness of this sharing, giving and receiving, and stepping back into yourself. May all beings everywhere, may all beings everywhere be well, may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. So, explored a couple of themes today. Well, lots of themes, but in the guided meditation, we started with the theme of independence, independence, independence, freedom from habitual tendencies of thoughts, reactivities, putting them down, releasing them, landing in the sense of freedom, independence, from those thoughts, habitual patterns, even for a split second, feeling that sense of freedom and peace. And then we turned to feeling interdependence, interdependence of this body, on gravity, on breath, all the interdependence says inside this body, all these intricate processes and the interdependence of this being on so many processes externally, so many beings that are in the sense of freedom, and from that place of awe, allowing metta, loving kindness, goodwill to shine for all these beings who are just like us, they want to be well, acknowledging our interdependence. So, so many themes that love to hear, love to invite your reflections what you've noticed in this practice today, for both your own benefit to be witnessed and for the benefit of the Sangha when you share your practice, whether it's something that you discovered, it's a gift to others, or it could be a question that challenge this didn't quite work how this was hard. That is also a gift, definitely a gift because you can trust that other people, other practitioners will either have a similar question or have had it, etc. So you're welcome to raise your zoom hands, especially if you haven't shared in a while. I'd like to encourage you to speak up, you can also type in chat, and I share and I change the settings so that you can type to everyone if you wish, in which case I'll read it out loud, I'll say your name, if it's just typed to me privately, the chat, I will not have a name, but I will just read out the reflection. The benefit of the Sangha. So, what did you notice. How was this practice for you. Practice of independence in the Dharma, as interdependence and so on, perhaps arising or overwhelming rising back and come up to in this practice, a sense of goodness. And Jerry says the interdependence seemed amazing. Jerry I'd love to invite you to say more if you would what you mean by amazing. If you would hear, you could unmute yourself now you should be able to please tell me what arose for you. So, it was the dependence part that got, but the interdependence when you started thinking to the blankton and everything else in the universe. It made. It made me think of the earth as a sort of organism. And I was just part of that organism or maybe the whole universe. And so it really became quite powerful to think you chart about, you know, all the biochemical reactions that happened in the last second, probably in the millions in our body, and then thinking, you know, more. You know, you look at the granular level and then you look interdependently and you think, wow, it's quite a. And they were not an island. We're all, and of course, with things facing the world nowadays. And so, you know, climate change makes it seem so even more real. So, it seemed a way amazing in terms of its breath and also in terms of its. Amazing in terms of its like the patterns, you know, like in nature, you see practice here, like all of these things that you just go like, how does this all happen just happens. I was in awe. Thank you. Beautiful. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you. Sharing your sense of all that arose. Yeah, beautiful to witness. Thank you for sharing that. More reflections in chat. I appreciate it connected even when we feel disconnected. I have been feeling disconnected. Nice to not also feel like a failure for it. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, it's okay to feel disconnected now and then it's part of being human. It's part of being human. And not to feel like a failure. And it's okay. It's okay, sweetie. It's all right. It's okay. Casey says yes, agree with Jerry felt a lot of gratitude as you named different examples of interdependence. Thanks Casey. And Mark says thank you all. Thank you to all beings in all countries of this world who sustain my life through our interdependence. I am grateful. And thank you, Nikki and thank you Mark for coming and practicing in the Sangha. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you guys. All of you being here practicing. This is part of our interdependence here we co create happy hour together. Don't forget that. Claire says, love thinking of letting go of negative thoughts as a path to freedom. Yes, yes, absolutely. Beautiful. So dear ones, on this day of observing independence interdependence. Now, let us practice in small groups of interdependent to create interdependence. And let's show up just as you are. Let's show up just as you are. Just for six minutes or so you will be in these small groups interacting with each other, co creating a sense of connection with each other it's so precious to just connect with fellow human beings from around the world. So touched by the Sangha for just a few minutes and sharing goodwill sharing goodwill. So, I'll create the breakout rooms and let's, as always start with 15 seconds of silent meta for one another just in silence. And then you can share as little or as much as you like with each other about your practice, caring for yourselves for each other, just in kindness in kindness in interdependence. And if there are other human beings in this room there will be three of you. Three or four we'll see how it goes, or two or three or four. They're just like you so caring for each other in this way. Alright, I'm opening the rooms. Here we go. Enjoy. The room. So, before we have a couple minutes for any reflections. What you discovered in groups especially if you haven't shared before for a while, love to hear from you can either type in chat or raise your zoom hand so I can see you. What did you discover, please. Questions, comments. You feel more connected interconnected. Yes. Anyone feel more interconnected after happy hour Yes, I see a few thumbs up. That's great. Yeah, Richard please. You hear me. Yeah. My morning set up of Barry with don't Sue Morgan, they've been discussing the contrast between Duka and suka. It's nice so what I'm hearing is that you've been exploring. So for those who don't know those words. Duka is suffering is challenges pain is, is, is what's difficult, and Suka is the opposite of the guys is. You can think of it as sugar suka, you know, they have similar. They have similar words. So Suka is what's pleasant in the mind what's pleasant in the mind what's pleasant in the body. So Suka and Duka, the, they play the opposite of each other and richer you're saying that this sit reminded you, or was more filled with the presence, always brings me to it. Oh, sending you met Richard. Yeah. So violet says nice to connect with the group on the theme of independence and loneliness. Thank you violet. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah.
