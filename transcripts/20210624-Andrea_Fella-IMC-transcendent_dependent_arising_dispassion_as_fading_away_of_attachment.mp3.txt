 So continuing our exploration of these teachings of conditionality in the direction of the conditions that support movement towards freedom, towards ease, towards peace, towards letting go of habits and patterns that create suffering. This is the Buddha's teaching on transcendent dependent arising. And it's, we're pretty far into it at this point, but I just want to, I just like to do a little like recap at the beginning or a little bit of a summary of what we're, what we're talking about to kind of carry the thread from week to week. Hopefully different each time, a little different flavor of the, of the recap each time. And this time what it occurred to me to say kind of in general about transcendent dependent arising is that it really, in a way we can think of it as describing how the mind transforms as it practices, the qualities of mind that begin to arise more frequently and that support the other qualities to arise. It's a little bit of a description of a path of what happens to the mind as we practice. It's not a description to me, at least it's not a description of practices. It's a description of when we practice, what direction does the mind move? And to me, this is similar in a way to my understanding of the teaching of dependent origination, which is basically a description of how the mind gets caught in suffering when we're not practicing. You know, so the habits and patterns that kind of tumble us on into habitual tendencies of suffering. That's not, that's also not framed as a practice, but you know, we don't practice dependent origination. We don't practice the, well, we do kind of practice the arising of craving, but it's not an intentional kind of thing that we do. It's more what happens to us as we don't engage in the path of the Eightfold Path. And so the transcendent dependent origination we could say perhaps is what happens to us as we turn our attention, our mindful attention, we walk on the path while observing how suffering is created. So we walk on the path of the Eightfold Path, wise view, wise intention, wise speech, wise action, wise livelihood, wise effort, wise mindfulness, wise concentration. We apply those practices. That's really where some of the practices come into our Buddhist path. We apply those practices to looking at the creation of suffering, looking at that cycle of dependent origination. And as we do that, that's a different, that's a different approach to being with or seeing dependent origination, seeing how suffering is created as opposed to just being in the creation of suffering. So the transcendent dependent origination, we could say is what happens when we walk the Eightfold Path, observing the unfolding of the conditioned nature of our suffering. And this transformation, this transformation in the mind starts to happen. When we meet suffering with the path of practice instead of with the habitual tendency to go back and meet it with greed or aversion or confusion, when we meet it with some wisdom and some interest with some faith and confidence that there's something else that's possible, we begin to cultivate these qualities, these other qualities of faith, of delight, of joy, of tranquility, of happiness, of concentration. Was the first, the first half of the qualities that or the ways our mind begins to transform as we begin to walk the path. As we look at suffering, look at the habitual patterns of mind with these tools that the Buddha offers us, these qualities strengthen, they grow. We become happier beings, we become lighter, we become more tranquil. Our minds become less reactive and more able to know what's happening in the present moment. Concentration of mind, stability of mind, not necessarily one pointed concentration, although that can happen, but the kind of concentration where the mind isn't pulled out into reactivity, but it's just available to be present for what's happening moment to moment. This is where the path begins to tip into real understanding, where the mind begins to understand the nature of experience, not as something that I need to fix or change or figure out or get rid of or hold onto, but as unfolding conditions, impermanent, unreliable, uncontrollable, not self conditions. So seeing that, the concentration sees that, and with seeing that, what we talked about last time was how the mind is starting to see the nature of experience. Essentially our minds get caught in that cycle of reactivity because we don't see the impermanent, unreliable nature of experience. There's a fundamental misunderstanding that there is something reliable, something that could be clung to or held onto that would make me happy. And that's that pattern, that path or that pattern that we tend to get hooked in. But as we start to see through the tools the Buddha offers us, noticing the impermanent nature of all experience, that's one way we're directed to look at our experience, be curious about the impermanent nature of experience. Notice that when something is impermanent, it's not reliable. It's not a place where we can land and say, yeah, that's going to make me happy. So we begin to really take in those truths of impermanent, unreliable, not self. And we begin to get, basically I think we get disenchanted with the habits of mind. We get disenchanted with the ways that our mind has habitually navigated stress and suffering, which has tend to keep us hooked into the cycle of stress and suffering. So this is this place of disenchantment. We see that we've been kind of confused or that we've been operating based on misperceptions, misunderstanding. We've been enchanted. We've been enchanted by thinking things are reliable, permanent. And when we see that they're not, that process of disenchantment begins. And we talked about that last time, that that's not a smooth process necessarily. It can be a kind of a bumpy ride, that disenchantment. Because at a very deep level, we don't, we like our old strategies. We like, they're very comfortable. They're familiar. And when we start to see they don't work, we begin to feel a little bereft at a loss. And we don't quite yet understand the freedom that's possible with letting go of those strategies. And so there's a little bit of a bumpy ride there in this process of disenchantment. But as we become, as we keep going with the practice, as we keep going and keep observing the impermanent nature of experience, and then noticing the last, last time we talked about noticing our reaction or noticing our relationship to seeing that nature of experience. So noticing the feeling of being bereft, noticing the feeling of fear about not having a place to have security or safety. A lot of the challenge with disenchantment does have to do with a feeling of not having safety because of impermanence. There's not a place that's reliable. And that is a very vulnerable place to be. It feels very vulnerable. And so our minds tell us, our minds keep saying, no, there's got to be someplace that's reliable and keeps looking and keeps searching. And so the thing that we need to do at that point in practice is be curious about the searching, be curious about the fear, be curious about the feeling of being bereft of our old strategies. The feeling like, what do I do? What's next? That feeling? All of that is the next bit of our practice. It's like all of that is revealing ways that we are at a very deep level clinging to wishing things were reliable and wishing things were permanent. Wishing things were not as they are. And so that place, as we begin to turn our attention to our relationship to becoming disenchanted, the mind begins to let go more and more, let go of those strategies and begins to taste a completely different kind of happiness, a completely different kind of ease and peace, not the ease and peace of having something to hold on to and land on and say, oh, that's it, but the ease and peace of letting go of the need to hold on, letting go of holding on. So this is the next part of what happens in the transformation of our minds moving towards freedom. Transformation helps us to see things as they are. That's a transforming place in our practice, starting to actually see impermanent, unreliable experience, experience as not-self. And then the transformation around disenchantment that we basically see that we're not getting is what we thought we were getting out of our strategies. And with that, the mind transforms into a very natural letting go. It's like our mind seeing the uselessness of those strategies, seeing how those very strategies are creating stress and suffering right now. The mind begins to, the mind basically is kind of backed into a corner. It's like, I don't know, I guess I let go of that too. And then it tastes a different thing, a different quality, a different experience of freedom and happiness that's not dependent on having anything, on anything being a certain way. It's a happiness that is connected with letting go rather than having something. So this part of the transformation of our mind is called dispassion. The mind becomes dispassionate. Now that word might have a quality of like, well, why would I want to be dispassionate? Because again, we may have an idea about what that word means. That it means basically not feeling much. If we're dispassionate, it means we're not passionate. That's what this, you know, we might think dispassion means. But the dispassion is really around the passion we have previously put into getting and having in the greed and aversion and delusion. So it is dispassion around this old strategies of our mind. So the way to maybe think about this, this kind of transformation of the mind from seeing these truths of impermanent, unreliable to becoming disenchanted and to becoming dispassionate is to think about, you know, as we age, as we grow, as we transition, we change in our lives. And, you know, think about something that you really, really liked when you were like five years old. What was it that you liked more than anything when you were five years old? Or some toy or some, you know, not food, because we may still really like those foods, those same foods. But when you think about some toy or something like that, what was the thing that you just couldn't be without? Some toy or a game or something like that. And you know, remembering your relationship to that, what happened in that? Just this is a reflection. You know, for myself, I used to play with these little tiny dolls. I had this dollhouse and I had these little dolls and I loved this dollhouse and I loved and I moved the furniture around and I get new furniture and I arranged the dolls in the dollhouse. And, you know, I spent hours doing that. And then there was a certain point in my late, you know, just pre-teens, like 11, 12 years old, where my friends were transitioning out of playing with dolls. But I still really liked playing with dolls. And so it was a little embarrassing. I didn't tell my friends I played with dolls. And so this was the beginning of the process of being disenchanted with that toy. And it was a little painful. You know, it wasn't kind of my choice to begin to let go of it. It felt more, you know, I wasn't quite ready to let go of it. So it was a little bit bumpy. But at this point, you know, at this, so there's this process. And then at a certain point when I was probably 15, 16, it's like, I would remember those and remember them fondly, but there was no longer an interest in engaging with that toy. So you know, there was a disinterest. They were still in my house. I wasn't ready to give them away. But there wasn't an interest in playing with them. So that disinterest is a kind of a piece connected with disenchantment too. We think of something and it's like, yeah, don't think so. You know, it's like that it's present with us, but there's not an interest connected with them. And then as an adult, you know, here I am, 62 years old. I have not even thought about this dollhouse probably since the last time I talked about the dollhouse in a talk like this. And you know, it's like disinterest and interest don't even come up. The letting go around that toy is so thorough that just the idea of it doesn't even arise in the mind. Interest or disinterest is not relevant anymore. The mind has just let it go. It's no longer even picking up the idea of that thing. That's the area of dispassion, the movement of not picking up those habits and strategies anymore. There's a place in the path, in the dispassion where we do experience something like the letting go. We may feel the mind being enchanted with something and feel it let go of it and then feel the way, the kind of the ease and the release there. So there can be a movement in the direction of experiencing the release from the being held by interest or disinterest. It's like interest and disinterest don't apply in dispassion. It's not that the mind is not interested. It just doesn't even think about it. It's just not arising. So there's a kind of set of different qualities or stages of transformation that the mind will go through. The period of time, perhaps when we're seeing the letting go happen multiple times. Now this word dispassion, I want to bring this in. Because the way I'm talking about it may sound like this just happens at once. We become disenchanted and then we let go. But it seems to be like we're disenchanted and there's a letting go. We may feel the delight of that release and ease and peace. And then the mind goes, but I really liked that thing. It goes back to investigate it some more and say, well, is there some kind of satisfaction there? So it goes back and clings to it again. So we go through multiple cycles there. It's not like once and for all we let go and it's forever gone. Kind of like the way it was for me with those dolls. It was a long, slow process of letting go of that. And I don't even know the last... It's interesting. I probably don't even know the last time I played with them. I did not know when that time was probably. It just faded away from the mind. And that fading away, that is the word that actually literally translates, the word that is usually translated as dispassion. The Pali word is we raka and it literally translates as a fading away. The word is... Could be used. I understand that that word could be used in connection with a dyed cloth. That if the cloth sits out in the sun or you wash the cloth a lot with soap and water and some of the dye comes out of it, gradually that cloth fades. That's the image. That's the word the Buddha uses for this transformational part of the practice. For this, the transformation that happens at this point in the practice. It's a fading away of the attachments to our strategies and habits. And if you think about the way a cloth fades, it's pretty gradual. It's like you wash it and a little bit of the dye comes out and you can hardly tell there's any of the dye that's gone. But over time, it's like, yeah, that black shawl is not as black anymore. It kind of looks light black. It looks like a light color of black or it's not quite gray, but it's not as deeply black as it was. Or any color that fades, it's just a slow process of fading. That's the way the Buddha, that's the image, essentially. I love that in many places as the Buddha describes what happens to the mind in these paths, in the path, he uses words that are analogies, essentially, this fading away. It evokes an image. It evokes an analogy of fading cloth. And that is probably something that was a very visceral kind of experience at his time. The scrubbing, the cloth, seeing how the clothes just gradually fade over time. Probably hanging in the sun, that additionally fades the cloth. It stops being vibrant and it becomes more muted. The colors become more muted. Even that piece of the analogy, as colors are vibrant, our attention is really drawn actively to them. When colors are more muted, it tends to be less of a pull or a draw to the color. So the fading away or the dispassion, I like to reflect on this image because it does point to the gradual nature or the gradual process of this practice. Fading away dispassion is not a once and done kind of thing. It is a very slow process of seeing how we're attached and beginning to experience some release, getting the taste, the flavor of a different way, getting the taste or the flavor of a different kind of ease or peace that stands in quite a lot of contrast to the happiness of the holding on. The happiness of the holding on comes inherent with tension, inherent with the fear of the loss. Even if we're not seeing it, that is all there. And the happiness of the letting go, the experience of that, we understand, oh, this is not relying on anything being a particular way. It's a much more flexible kind of happiness. And so over and over again, we get to see how our strategies come back. We see the unreliability of those strategies. We see the way we're misperceiving them. We may begin to feel some ease and peace and release and let go. So we always are kind of meeting the suffering in this path. We're meeting the ways in which we're trying to find our habitual ways of trying to find happiness. We're meeting that with our mindfulness and gradually beginning to taste and learn a different flavor of happiness, an entirely different flavor of happiness. And so that begins to be something that we learn, I think this fading piece is, we begin to learn to trust more that kind of happiness that's not dependent on having or holding or getting. And we learn to trust that kind of happiness that comes from letting go. Slowly, slowly we begin to trust that. So one other piece I'll say, and then it's going to be time to stop, is the experience. So the word dispassion, the word dispassion does sound like we don't have any juice for anything. But as our habitual tendencies towards greed, aversion and delusion fall away, there's a kind of a different kind of juice that comes up, a juice that's not reliant on identifying and identity, but is connected with an open heart, connected with our capacity to meet suffering without resistance. And this juice is the brahma vahara. In kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. These qualities are not felt as passionless. Compassion even has the word passion in it. Compassion is felt with a strength, joy, the mudita, the joy of celebrating the happiness and others. And that is also not something that we would say is a detached kind of feeling. I remember the first time I really felt mudita for a friend of mine, and it was just so delightful to see. And it was delight in her practice. I was watching, I looked out the window, I was doing walking meditation, I looked out the window and I saw her walking by, and she was walking so mindfully that just delight and joy arose in me. I was just celebrating that her mindfulness. It wasn't what I would call passionless. It was a celebration. So the qualities of heart that arise as the mind moves into the letting go, that also can be a little bit of a surprise. The feelings that come there, the transformation that happens. There's an emotional transformation that happens along with this transformation of the mind. Very naturally the mind moves more towards these qualities of the Brahmavahara's being the motivators for our actions and our feelings that come up.
