So over the last weeks in this session we've been exploring the teachings from the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Satipatanasuta. 
And in exploring that, going into kind of detail, there's a lot of instructions in the Satipatanasuta that often we don't necessarily speak about in the depth that the teachings connect to it in the Suta. 
In the Foundation of the Body, Mindfulness of the Body, there are six exercises that are pointed to. 
And we've talked about four in this class. 
We've so far talked about mindfulness of breathing, mindfulness of body postures, mindfulness of daily activities, and the elements practice. 
And all of these are a kind of an encouragement, at least the way they're taught now in the West. 
You know, there possibly were some different ways they were taught at the time of the Buddha. 
But the way they're taught at this point, these are the encouragements to be aware of the experience in the present moment, aware while breathing. 
That one's pretty clear in the Suttas that that's the instruction, establishing mindfulness with the breathing process. 
Then the awareness of bodily postures, aware while standing, sitting, walking, lying down. 
And again, I think in this case, there's less of a sense of pointing to some particular aspect of experience, but more than knowing, knowing you're walking while you're walking, sitting and knowing that you're sitting, that simple instruction the Munindra points to, standing and knowing that you're standing, lying down and knowing that you're lying down. 
So the just general encouragement to be aware and to cultivate a continuity of mindfulness. 
And this deepens in the awareness of daily activities from the postures to a little more specific actions, reaching and bending, going and coming, speaking, remaining silent, and particular activities that you might do eating, urinating, defecating, a whole range of activities are explicitly mentioned. 
Again, I think a sense of encouraging a continuity throughout the day, throughout everything that you're doing, a continuity of being aware, being present in the present moment. 
With the elements practice, which we talked about, I think last time we met this in the way it's taught these days, and certainly in the the commentaries, it's explored as a kind of direct experience of the sensation level of experience in the body. 
The elements, the language in the sutta says one is aware in this body, there's earth element, fire element, water element, air element, and the Visurimagi, Visurimaga points to specific sensations that are connected with those elements. 
Hardness, density for earth element, moisture, liquidity, fluidity for water element, movement, vibration, tingling, pulsing for air element, and temperature, heat, and coolness for fire element. 
There's also some possibility that it was a little bit more of a kind of a reflection practice in a way, and to just kind of reflect that this body is composed of the same elements as the world. 
You know, that there's not a difference between the physical body here and what's out there in the world to kind of, you know, almost equalize or remind oneself that this body is actually formed from the same components, so it's not special in a particular way. 
So it can be also understood as reflection, and I think in some ways the two, the last two that are remaining, the anatomical parts, the contemplation on the parts of the body and the death contemplation, both of those, at least in my experience of working with them, and I've only done a little bit of this in both cases, has been more of that kind of reflection. 
So I think in the foundation of the body, and we'll talk a little bit more in depth about these last two today about how they're supportive perhaps for some, there's definitely pointings in the suttas themselves that have some caution around the use of these, these practices, they're not for everyone, and that's fine, they don't have to be for everyone. 
But I think that overall, the first thing that the the foundation of the body is pointing to is first being here, and then to become kind of aware of different, the kind of habitual perspectives we hold about the body, somehow that it's special, that it's different, different from everything else in the world, perhaps, and also the contemplations are also encouraged not only for our own selves, but for others, and so kind of breaking down this this contemplation of the body begins to break down the barriers, thinking that we're somehow different from others as well. 
So, you know, the the the bodies aware that this is a body that's composed of parts, that's moving through space, that's conditioned, all of these reflections are kind of encouraged in the in the in the foundation of the body. 
So these these last two, I think the the anatomical parts, the last two pieces of the foundation of body, the anatomical parts, the kind of subtitle that the commentaries gave this is Asuba, which basically is literally translated as something like unbeautiful, and that gives you a sense of, you know, the perspective that at least the commentaries laid on this this aspect of experience, the kind of assumption that we take our bodies to be beautiful, and bodies in general to be beautiful, and that kind of to bring in a reflection that the body is just composed of parts, you know, it's got hair, it's got head hairs and body hairs, and it's got skin and teeth and nails and and flesh and bones and the connectors, the that sinews, it's got, you know, the organs, so just a kind of a reflection on the various parts of the body, and when we think about each of those individually, you know, do we consider that beautiful? You know, do we consider the, you know, if we and there's one one encouragement in the Visuddhimanga that said, you know, for for instance, the hair, taking some hair off your head and putting it in front of you, was that, you know, is that beautiful? Well, it's just hair when it's cut off your head and it's just sitting there, it's yeah, it's just hair, so you know, you don't necessarily think of it when it's not connected to the body as being beautiful, and so the, you know, kind of a kind of a looking at where does this idea of beauty come from? But I think that the in the overall sense, because, you know, there may be different trends perhaps in in in different cultures at different times that, you know, in this in this labeling of this as a contemplation of the unbeautiful, to me that betrays that people of the time tended to perhaps think of bodies as beautiful, and you know, there are certainly in our culture, in the Western American culture, at least, there's particular perspectives about bodies as beautiful, but it's it's a kind of a narrow definition in some ways of what a beautiful body is, and many of us have a sense that our bodies are not beautiful, and so, you know, it's like I think that this that this form of contemplating the body can be used to correct either perspective, you know, to kind of like take take the the idea of comparison out of body, which is, I think, a lot where the sense of a body being beautiful or not being beautiful comes from this from comparison, and when we just look at or think about, okay, take the hair off our heads and put it in a bowl, it's like, well, it's just hair from there, it's hair from there, it's neither beautiful or unbeautiful, it's just hair. 
There's one place in the in one of the suttas that says that if you're contemplating the body in this way, just thinking of it as various parts, there's a quote that says, how how, except through lack of understanding, could one praise or disparage oneself or another because of the body, you know, in doing this kind of contemplation, it's just body, and so that, I think, points to the underlying movement of this particular contemplation. 
I was doing this just a little bit in the in the guided meditation, and for me, you know, just, I mean, afterwards, when I was silent, I was just playing with this because I've been reading about it, and so the the words came to my mind, and I think this is this is a kind of a reflective practice that my understanding, so I want to stop for a moment and talk about what reflective practice is, we've talked about that before, but just as a kind of a clarification, let's say. 
Direct awareness practices are opening to just what's here, you know, what's the sensation level of experience, what's the actual experience in the moment. 
With reflection, we actually bring in a concept and orient our experience, our our awareness around a concept, and so the language of this Suta, I'll read a little piece of it. 
It says, one reviews this body from the soles of the feet, up from the soles of the feet, and down from the top. 
In this body, there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bone, bone marrow, etc. 
So just kind of it uses this language reviews and has this list in the in the Visuddhimaga, the instructions for this tell you, first of all, to memorize the list and to do a verbal recitation first, and then a mental recitation, and so using thought actually. 
So this is, to me, this is bringing in reflection to help us to recognize that this is this is the components of the body. 
So it's it's using thought to help us to have a different perspective on what the body is. 
Joseph has this this great story, he said at one point he was, I think he had a procedure where they put a camera inside his body and he could be aware, awake, and they invited him to watch the video while he was aware, and he chose to do that. 
I never choose to do that. 
I'll just, you know, let myself not watch. 
But in any case, he chose to do that, and he said he was fascinated while watching this and looking inside of his body, and he says, yes, like, you know, that doesn't look like me. 
That's the inside of my body, you know, that's that's the inside of my body. 
He said, but I like, when I just look at myself all wrapped up in skin looking in the mirror, it's like, yep, that's me. 
And so, you know, so this bringing this reflection in can help us to have a different perspective. 
Look at where, what is the concept that we're overlaying on our body to kind of to kind of recognize that we do overlay concepts onto our body. 
And it's it's often in those concepts where we would attribute beautiful or unbeautiful, you know, praise or or disparage oneself because of body based on concept, based on ideas, some some ideal of what we think a body should be. 
There are warnings, let's say, in the suttas. 
There's one story of when the Buddha taught this practice to a group of of monks. 
And then the Buddha went off for a long retreat during this time. 
So he taught the monks this practice and then went off for a long retreat. 
And during that time, people, people, about half the people I understand, about half of the monks who were doing this practice, killed themselves. 
And when the Buddha came out, there's this kind of poignant story and he, you know, he kind of comes out of his meditation after after these months of being in seclusion. 
And he asks Ananda, he says, what's happened to the to the Sangha? It has become so sparse. 
And Ananda says, well, you know, in practicing the body parts practice, half of them killed themselves. 
And he said, maybe it would be a good idea to teach them mindfulness of breathing. 
So that there's this kind of, you know, recognition, actually, I think this is a very touching story of kind of the humanity of the Buddha, you know, that, you know, he taught this practice and seemed to be not not so clear or aware that it it might have an unfortunate effect. 
Now the sutras or the commentaries actually kind of say they say that those they would have killed themselves anyway, because, you know, the commentaries have this vested interest in a way and not having the Buddha make mistakes in his teaching. 
But to me, this points to, you know, I have actually more confidence in the transmission of the teachings when I hear things like this, you know, when I hear I have more confidence that the teachings have been recorded kind of more accurately in some way. 
And so to me this this does kind of point to not all practices are appropriate for all people. 
I think that's the lesson of this of this story, not all practices are appropriate for all people. 
This practice is not intended to create aversion. 
And so the the a good kind of thing to check into if you choose to explore this, you know, if aversion arises this is not a practice for this time. 
Can it can it be, you know, more just kind of curious and just just like when I was doing it before it actually I did it I didn't do the whole list I did just what I could remember down to bones because that that part I can remember pretty easily it goes from outer to inner head hairs body hairs nails skin teeth flesh sinews bones kind of outer to inner and you know I just using it as a reflection to me it just kind of created a sense of balance of of yeah that's what this body is it's it's just a body and so that's I think the the intention and that there's a there's a little analogy offered with this contemplation I'll read this to you too because to me this brings in exactly the perspective that is pointed to for the contemplation just as though there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain such as hill rice red rice beans peas millet and white rice a man with good eyes if if a man would good eyes were to open it and review it this is hill rice this is red rice these are beans these are peas this is millet this is white rice so to one reviews this same body as full of many kinds of parts and this body there are head hairs body hairs etc so that analogy it's just like a bag of beans a bag of you know a bag of beans and rice basically when you're looking at a bag of beans and rice there's not going to be either a sense of it's beautiful or unbeautiful necessarily there may be concepts around I like this kind of rice I don't like that kind of rice or you know so there there can be that but it it tends to be a little less you know it's just this is just a bag of rice and beans and the the fact that he says you know there's an opening on both ends you know this is like this is the body we have openings on two ends of the body and it's full of food you know that's what the body is it's been created by eating rice and beans basically and so I really appreciate that analogy as a as a kind of a pointer to the the mind state that might be possible in this kind of a review and I would I would suggest being cautious about this the the story in the suit is actually I think asks us to be cautious about using this particular contemplation and be careful if there is a version maybe not the practice for you then the the last contemplation is the death contemplation and this one really is encouraging us to remember that we are mortal the whole emphasis on this contemplation is to remember our mortality the contemplation in the Satipatana Sutta is reviewing a corpse in decay and again this is a is it's either intended to be a practice where you actually go sit at the charnel ground in the the time of the Buddha they apparently had charnel grounds big pits where bodies were thrown where you could actually see the bodies in decay watch the animals come and you know pull the bodies apart and see them over the course of days, weeks, months, shift into you know different stages of decay and yet the the the Sutta the text says something like as if you were I'll read that too as though one were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground one two three days dead bloated livid with oozing matter one compares this same body with that this body too is of the same nature it will be like that it is not exempt from that fate so the the main contemplation is again that this is just the nature of a body when the body dies this is what happens to it and it's you know again a little bit of a corrected towards our kind of habitual sense that or habitual denial of the truth of our mortality to keep this in mind so the the kind of the reflection is this body too is of the same nature again this isn't intended to create aversion or depression and in my experience with working with death contemplation and I've done some I've done some of it we had one class where we had actual photos that we looked at that could help us kind of envision what happens to a body I've been to an anatomy lab where I've seen the corpses the corpses so done I've done a little bit of this and you know the there is there is some revulsion I experienced some revulsion in seeing that and yet the corrective of yes this is you know this is the body in in the the large in the the overall the overarching effect that this kind of contemplation has had on me is not a version or depression but rather a kind of appreciation for the preciousness of life right now it in fact has created a kind of a delight and joy in the the being alive knowing that that is what will happen someday so again it's useful to check into what is the effect that it has on you if it's tending towards a version or depression probably not the contemplation for you for me it really has been you know when I contemplated it it brings inspiration it's like this this is that there is this kind of preciousness an inspiration to practice a kind of the the sense of yeah I don't know how long I'm going to have and it's kind of got an inspiration to live skillfully I remember one time I was washing my dishes and I was experiencing a little bit of some kind of annoyance or irritation about something I can't remember what at this point but in that moment the contemplation of death arose I think I had been contemplating it at that time and so it kind of naturally arose it arose with that kind of you know the mind state that was kind of grinchy and this contemplation of you know this could be your last few moments and the reflection was is this how you want to spend your last few moments and very quickly that irritation just fell away so that that it can have an effect in the moment when it arises in the moment this kind of inspiration towards a more skillful kind of life towards the release of greed aversion and delusion there are in fact some simpler forms of death contemplations that are offered in suttas and this is more the kind of death contemplation that I have done I've done more of than the the corpse and decay kind of contemplation but there's several that are offered one is this the simple reflection that the Buddha offers that the five subjects of frequent recollection which is essentially reflections on impermanence and the conditions in nature of experience I'm of the nature to age I am of the nature to sick and I am of the nature to die but those are the first three of the five subjects and that we're encouraged to reflect frequently reflect on this remind ourselves regularly of the impermanent aging nature of our body that the fact that it's of the nature to sick and of the nature to die again as a corrective for that kind of amazing a delusion that we have that even seeing death all around us even seeing people get sick even seeing people lose their houses in the fires we think this isn't going to happen to me now maybe this is in this time of coronavirus in this time with all of these things happening it's like stunning to me this year how supportive this has been for me in terms of the reflection it's keeping it alive for me this reflection on yes you know this house who knows this house might burn down too you know I'm just waiting for the earthquake you know it's like we've we've had just about everything else here you know it's like that the earthquake could be next so and it could happen in any moment so how do we want to live our lives so this just simple reflection I am of the nature to die a simpler version of this contemplation elsewhere the the Buddha is asking some of his followers how they practice death contemplation and several they're talking it's interesting to me this one because they're speaking about contemplating death in connection with how long do I have to practice the Buddhist teachings so the death contemplation is phrased something like might I live just a night and a day so that I can attend to the Buddhist teachings and they say that's how I practice death contemplation so it's just a kind of a reminder a remembrance that we don't have forever to to engage in being aware of our experience and contemplating our our bodies and minds in this way freeing our minds from unskillful unskillful mind states and so there's there's a set of these you know six different six different people offer six different things and they all phrase it in this way might I live just a day and a night so I can attend to the Buddhist teaching might I live just a day so that I could attend to the Buddhist teaching might I live the length of time to eat an alms meal so that I can attend to the Buddhist teaching these times getting successively shorter might I live the length of time to chew and swallow four or five bites of food might I live for the single mouthful of food might I live for a single breath to cultivate and contemplate the Buddhist teachings so the Buddha in hearing this he said the first four people are cultivating mindfulness of death sluggishly that there that that the you know that the might I live a day and a night it's like that's not keeping the contemplation alive enough but he says that the contemplation of might I live for this single mouthful of food might I live for a breath so that I can practice the teachings so this to me is bringing you know kind of holding this reflection or keeping this alive in every moment that's the encouragement of that teaching for death contemplation if you're practicing death contemplation it's a some it's essentially having that reflection in mind every breath I can only do this for short stretches of time myself you know I forget I forget but it doesn't depress me when I do it in fact it in one of these I don't have the note about which one oh here it is there's another another another contemplation that says when you go to bed you should reflect you might not live through the night are there any unskillful things in the mind right now and to practice to release those if noticing their unskillful habits of mind operating and likewise when you wake up you know reflecting that I might not live through the day are there any unskillful states of mind and this one the Buddha brings in many of you have probably heard of the analogy of practice like your hairs on fire this is where that analogy comes from we could die at any time it's like you know if if we really if we really had this understanding the the analogy is you know if someone if someone's hair were on fire they would be trying to put it out immediately there would not be slacks or sluggish about that he says in the same way if we are aware that we might die at any moment we would not practice sluggishly so those are some reflections on those aspects of mindfulness of the body and I'm curious what are your thoughts about this how does this land for you this is this is not something we we teach a lot of there's certain teachers that that do teach these practices there's a couple of teachers Bob Stahl and Richard Schenckman both teach these practices so if you're interested I would encourage you know that they've got some courses and some retreats that they offer on these Bante Buddha Rikita teaches a death contemplation that's very like the metacontemplation actually it starts with with self and reflecting I'm of the nature to die and then brings in a dear person a neutral person they too are the nature to die so just kind of bringing that as a as a death contemplation in so you know if you're interested I would encourage probably it's useful you can play with it a little yourself and see if there's ways in which the contemplation supports you and yet it could be useful to to have some support too in this kind of a contemplation so I'm curious what are your thoughts yeah Olga so my sitting group we did about I don't know several months of study with Analyos practice book is the second book he did about the Sati Patana which is four foundations and he was it was much more much less theoretical and much more practical I'm sorry for the background noise I'm outdoors I got trucks going by and that book is is really useful and he goes through all of this and to accompany that book you can get online his guided meditations that go with the book and he goes through everything you've just discussed and I kind of did adopt his his meditations around the skin flesh and bones the body scans and also the elements and I do them very regularly and have and have found that actually they've become something of a of a concentration practice for me especially at the beginning of a sit when I can sort of collect the mind around a body scan that looks at skin flesh bones and then earth element water element air element fire element and those those talks can be found online pretty easily and he has a very sort of interesting way of doing guided meditation but I would say that primarily I my one of my goals if you want to call it that has been sort of to disidentive well not disidentify but identify less with the body as my body to see its generic nature and and so I would just say anybody who is interested in just doing their own thing and can find these guided meditations online if I think if you just you know Google Analyzo and you know four foundations of mindfulness guided meditations they will be there yeah yeah thank you for pointing to that yeah I'm aware of the the practices that he does and it's he doesn't he doesn't it seems to be he starts once you get familiar with them then you use them to kind of focus and settle the mind just as you're doing and I think it can be as exactly as you say you know what you say it kind of helps the mind to recognize it's just a body it's not my body it's just a body and I think that as I said that's probably the overarching theme of the first foundation is to come to that to come to that recognition yeah thank you other comments or reflections on this I guess you're not seeing me because I'm no I'm seeing you oh okay yeah I'm seeing you so if if I recognize that it's just a body if I recognize that I may have one or two breaths left in this in the body why would I care about the body why would I take care of it so I think there's that's an interesting question I think you know there is the understanding that we could die at any time and yet we also could not die at any time and so there's this interesting balance of recognizing yes there is a kind of a preciousness to this moment that I don't know you know how do I want to spend this moment if it is my last moment and yet also the recognition of it may not be my last moment and so what you know needing to take care of ourselves yeah I think I think we have to we can't just come in to this moment and I think I think you know it's interesting I think when we do come into this moment there is a way certain sometimes when I'm in deep meditation this moment is all there is and there's not much of a sense of the future but in daily life even coming into this moment what's here in this moment is not only this breath but also thoughts about the past thoughts about the future understood when I'm practicing well when the mind is clear understood as thoughts not as the actual reality but understood as thoughts and understood as what might be skillful to do if I do have time left so in a so I think that the point of the coming into this moment do I you know if I only have this moment left is the yeah this is interesting I think for some minds if you haven't understood the the teaching certain minds might think well if I've only got a day left why not go wild you know but if you are paying attention to what's happening in your system like myself when I noticed that that grinchiness was happening while I was washing my dishes there was nobody in the house at the time it didn't matter in terms of other people around me but my own experience of is this how I want my last moment to be you know and the answer was so clearly no so you know it's like the the practice itself guides us in the direction the more we practice the more we explore being present with our experience the more we understand those arisings of greed aversion and delusion as painful in this moment the more the system does not is not interested in having those around and so when we come into this moment recognizing yeah there's this you know irritation or this aversion or this greed happening right now and this might be my last moment the system just understands this is not helpful this is this is not this is not the direction that this mind actually wants to be doing if this is my last moment so some of it I think is a little bit of a of a trust and a development of the mind in the practice so explore for yourself you know what happens if you think about this is my last breath what happens you know how do you want to spend your last breath you want to be with people you love do you want to be out getting drunk you know what happens that's that's I think part of the reflection thank you it you've shifted my thinking more what you said shifted my thinking more to what I recall Jerry Jampalski once saying over and over again now is the only time there is yes yes so it's time to stop.
