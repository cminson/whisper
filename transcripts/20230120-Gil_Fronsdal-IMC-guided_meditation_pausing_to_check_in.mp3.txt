 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone. Welcome. And welcome to this meditation. And meditation is ideally something which is a bit of a mystery, a bit of an unknown, unknown how any meditation will go, unknown what parts of ourselves will come into the forefront, unknown what we tap into, unknown because there's more going on when we meditate than our own efforts and our own even purposes and intentions. I came across a wonderful quote yesterday of James Baldwin. I am what time, circumstances, history have made me, but I am also much more. And this much more, we are much more than what we usually think we are. We are much more than our challenges. And part of this much more, this willingness to take in the fact there's more going on here than we know is to also appreciate or open up to trust that we can be aware. We can step out of our challenges enough that we can be clearly and calmly aware of our challenges. There's a way in which we can bring a sense of agency, a sense of personal capacity, ability, and introduce it into whatever is happening where otherwise we would be preoccupied, caught up in, swept away in, we would be identified with it, this is me, this is important. And there's a way in remembering we're much more. And part of that much more which opens the door to even more and more is to pause and be aware, to step back and recognize what's happening, to make space for what is happening. And in the making of space, making room for it, we are opening up, we're taking, using agency in, and taking a sense, maybe even taking a stand here, here I am, there's much more here than my concern, my preoccupation. What else is here? Let's make room for more. And in this kind of this step, this movement towards awareness, to know, to step back, to pause, in there, there is something beautiful, something wondrous, there might even be something you can start getting little hints of at first, of calm, of clarity, of non-entanglement. So to paraphrase James Baldwin, you are what time, circumstance, and history have made you, but you are also much more. So taking a meditative posture, a posture that has lots of room for that of which you are more. And this movement towards making space, pausing, opening up, begins by consciously and intentionally assuming a posture of attention. Gently closing your eyes, and as you do so, feel into your body. Feel the vitality that's there in your body. And another place where we take some agency, some stepping away from business as usual is in consciously and intentionally taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. It's a way of reminding ourselves that we can be consciously present, present with a degree of agency. Here I am, and I will be aware, I will be attentive. And part of this taking agency, pausing, engaging consciously, is also to relax. As you exhale, relaxing the body. Letting the breathing return to normal, and continue on the exhale to relax the body, consciously, intentionally, not letting things be as business as usual, but to feel a relaxed but clear intentionality, a choosing to be intentionally relaxing. And then letting go of efforts to relax, except to take a few moments to soften and relax your mind. And if this assume assumptions of agency is a strain or tense to relax, soften. And with a relaxed, soft agency, consciously, intentionally, gently become aware of the body breathing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Taking a moment to pause, step back. And how are you as a practitioner? How are you practicing meditation right now? Hardly at all because you're drifting in thoughts, complacently, engaged nicely and present. How are you as you're engaging in this practice? And can you ask yourself the question, how? Gently, spaciously, non-judgmentally, open question of curious discovery, oh, it's like this. And then with the same open, relaxed spirit of discovery, begin again with your breathing, whatever else you're aware of here in the present moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If you are caught up in your thoughts, there might be a kind of unconscious agency, unintended agency in your mind to do so. Can you redirect that, reclaim that to calmly, gently, but clearly begin again with the breathing where you appreciate a relaxed, gentle, but intentional being aware? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To gently take a pause, stepping back for an overview, how are you in the effort to meditate? How are you? And to step back and pause where there's an opening, an opening to wider possibilities, a checking in. Is there some way that you would like to now adjust your meditation so that you can be more present here and now? Where the way that you're present feels good. It's a nice way of accompanying yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Then again, so we come to the end of this meditation to pause, to step back, to check in with yourself. How are you? How are you? How are you? Taking into account you're always much more than what you think. And can you ask that question? Can you consider that question as a way of being relaxed and open and curious, where how you are with the question is more important than the answers you get? Asking how you are with an openness, a willingness, a curiosity, a kindness, where you're willing to accompany yourself as you are, even with what's difficult. And then to turn the gaze outward to the world with the same question, not looking for an answer, not rushing to an answer, settling on the first answer. How is the world? How is your world? Asking that question with an openness, a willingness to be present, curiosity, making space for lots of possibilities. That would be not possible if you answered quickly. Your world is always much more than anything you think. What is the way to be aware that's available to the much more? And can you accompany this world, can you accompany others with this generosity of attention? With kindness, with making room and space, where so much of the joys and suffering can be held with caring attention. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Thank you.
