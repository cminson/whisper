 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, so welcome to everyone. Let's go ahead and start our day together, our time together. So, settling in for meditation, finding your usual posture for sitting or whatever feels appropriate for you today. And if you're comfortable doing so, you can close your eyes. And just having a sense of turning in or settling in to your own experience of your body, how it is now, your mind, how it is now. Feeling balanced where you're sitting. Today, the meditation will be on mindfulness of breathing in a similar style as is taught by Bhikkhu and Alio. So it comes from the sutta on mindfulness of breathing, the Anapanasanti sutta, which has many interpretations. So as you settle in to the body, having a sense that you are in a secluded area, probably, or you've found a place where you can sit that's a little bit removed from other people in your house, for example. And just enjoying that sense of, to whatever degree of seclusion you have at this time. And tuning in to the sense of straightness in the spine, could be that you're sitting upright, or it's also fine to feel the straightness as you're in the lying down posture. And just passing the attention through the spine from the bottom to the top. Feeling each vertebra relaxing and aligning the spine. You can go kind of slowly. So having the sense that you're supported by the straight and relaxed spine. And then bringing to mind some motivation for practicing. Could just be your specific motivation for this sit. Could be your overall inspiration to practice. It's nice if it has an altruistic dimension to it. Connecting with your inspiration. Establishing in the mind mindfulness. So bringing the awareness of the present moment to the foreground. And actually taking a deliberate period of time to sense what it feels like when there is mindfulness in the mind. What does mindfulness feel like for you right now? Perhaps clear and sharp or soft and warm. Broad and spacious. What is the flavor of mindfulness right now? And then gently turning the attention to the sense of in and out breathing. You don't need to feel the breath at any specific place. But for now just maybe a general sense of knowing when you're breathing in and when you're breathing out. In whatever way it's easy to connect with that. So we have the sense of mindfulness, the sense of in and out breathing. Allowing that to fill the attention. If the mind feels drawn toward other concerns at this time. Just gently say, not now. I will definitely get back to you later. But for now, staying with the in and out breathing. And now we draw the attention a little bit closer to the breath. In order to know the length of the breath. All that needs to be known is whether it's on the longer side or on the shorter side. The in breath and the out breath. So we have to pay attention along the whole length of the breath. And then the whole length of the out breath. Just generally knowing is the in breath longer short, is the out breath longer short. They might be different. Natural breath. We may find that as we watch, the breath gradually gets shorter. At least the active part of the breath. The longer gap. And then opening the awareness now to feel the entire body breathing. We don't change the breath at all. We just change the breath of the attention. We're aware of the whole body sitting in the breath occurring in the body. When the mind feels connected throughout the body. Still paying attention to the in and out breathing. We incline the mind toward tranquility in the body. It helps to physically soften areas of tension. It helps that the simple repetitive nature of the breath. It helps to act as an anchor for the mind. It helps to have a lot of energy in the body to settle out. Throughout the body. And when the mind gets distracted as it surely will. We just smile and gently return to the sense of the whole body. In and out breathing. And now to our narrow focus on the breath. Points toward ease. And to the sense of being present with the body and the breath. And to the sense of being present with the body. And to the sense of being present with the body. As the body becomes even slightly more tranquil. The bodily activities are calm to even a bit. We can recheck the posture. Maybe a slight shift would help the body feel more balanced. It's natural that as tensions release some adjustments are helpful. Just balancing with that sense of in and out breathing. And to the sense of being present with the body. And as the body becomes somewhat more calm. It's very natural that a sense of joy can arise. So opening the mind to the possibility of a kind of inner joy. It comes about because of being in meditation. It's often felt in the body. It feels like almost like an inner smile. Emerging from that ease. But even if it's very mild or we don't even feel any of that joy. We can also feel in the mind, just a sense of contentment. Content that we are mindful at this moment present for what's going on in the body and the mind. The joy, the slight joy of mindfulness can be this contentment. If we can feel the happiness of presence, it's actually a happiness that's always available anytime we're mindful. So allowing the mind and body to feel this inner joy or at least contentment. Mindfulness does not always have to be a neutral noting of exactly what's happening. We can incline the mind toward this kind of inner well-being and pleasure. Just allow that to be there, resting in that along with the body and the in and out breathing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's natural that as we feel even some degree of this joy, happiness of sitting, of breathing, that the mind will become calmer. We see that busy mental activities of wanting or not wanting are less enjoyable than simple presence. Resting in awareness, we can watch the movements of the mind slowly settle out as we watch the agitation in the body slowly settle out. Such tranquility available. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We can get a sense that peace is possible pretty close to our daily life. Something quite different is available when the mind is able to be present and still. And although the conditions will change in a few minutes, we might consider as we go out into the world, change our way of being, our level of consciousness. What are we willing to give up our peace for? There's peace that we feel. What is more important than that as we get out into our lives? Is it worth getting tangled up in a conflict or in anxiety or in pursuit of something? Is there a way we could just carry this into our interactions, into our work, into our errands of the day or our tasks? And to see what a gift that is for others, maybe they too would feel just a bit of that. Gil often says there's no way to practice just for yourself. It has to help others even in these very simple ways if we carry the practice forward from meditation into the world.
