Okay, so today the topic is the joy factor of compassion.
And I think compassion is often not associated with joy.
Maybe it can be associated better with joy if we realize that the word joy is maybe a wide range of what it can mean.
But it was a big surprise to me, very big surprise.
The first time that I was feeling, I was caring for someone, someone who was challenged to make her way around and needed support and help.
And I was just doing it in a matter-of-fact way.
I was happy, I was kind of like, just was natural to do it.
But what surprised me as I was doing it, the sense of pleasure and joy and well-being that seemed to well up in my chest as I did it.
And that it was, and I wondered, is this okay to feel this kind of sense of well-being and joy in helping this person or supporting this person?
And then I've even wondered, am I doing it for the pleasure of it or doing it to help her get around her?
But I was so surprised by how good it felt.
And since then I've discovered that when I feel compassion, that it's possible that compassion comes with a sense of rightness, a sense of joy, a sense of pleasure.
And sometimes when the suffering is really huge, it's a little hard to see it or recognize that it's being joyful or exactly like pleasure exactly.
But it just feels really good, it feels right to be a witness for the suffering, to be open to it.
And so how is it that compassion, which is the awareness of suffering in oneself and others, how is it that that can be associated with joy?
The Dalai Lama has gone around the world with their teaching that if you want to be happy, be compassionate.
And so how is it, what's associated with that?
There's many answers to that.
It's an inner psychology of many different facets.
But one of them is that how we're being compassionate, that if compassion comes along with a lot of sense of duty and obligation,
it can feel quite heavy.
If it comes along with a sense of conclusions like deciding that this means that life is really frightening and terrible,
it can really feel also oppressive to experience compassion.
But if compassion comes along with an awareness that's open and available, like an open window where the wind can blow through,
nothing stops it, nothing blocks it, it just goes right through us almost, but we're available for this opening.
We have this availability for as things as they occur.
It's part of that joy is in that availability because we're not contracting, we're not resisting, we're not coming to conclusions,
we're not elaborating with this means that the world is a terrible place or whatever it might be.
And we're not kind of immediately caught up in, I have to do something, I'm responsible.
But the simplicity of compassion, the simplest version of it, to be open to experience what is,
and this openness, this ability to be available is kind of a very important aspect of mindfulness practice.
The mindfulness, some people use mindfulness as like the end of a, the end process of a very short few moments of concluding,
or this is what's happening, done, concluded, it's kind of, it's extreme version, it's a checklist approach to mindfulness.
People use mental noting, and I used to do that, I would note breathing in, in, just as I began breathing in,
and if the in-breath was a little bit long, I would kind of check out, I would kind of wonder if I'd draw from my thought
for the last three quarters of the in-breath because I'd already done my mindfulness practice,
and then I would try to be the beginning of the exhale and out, and done that, and then I would kind of, wouldn't be there very present for the out-breath.
And I learned that rather than, you know, to do what instead is to be available, to be open, to experience,
so the word in for me, if I do, is an invitation, is an opening, like, okay, it's the beginning of a process,
okay, I'm breathing in, that's what's happening, now let's feel that, it registered, let it be felt more deeply in the system, in the body,
and exhaling, this is the beginning of really feeling this now, it might be very brief, something might be very fleeting, and that's okay,
and one of the things, one of the great treasures as we do this availability, being available to what's happening, is we're also then feeling what it's like to be available,
we're feeling what it's like to have the door open, as opposed to having it closed, and that feels good, that has a nice feeling,
so when we do that with compassion, we're open, we feel, we see the suffering of the world, we don't come, that's not a time to come to conclusions,
this is a, for compassion's sake, this is a time to allow something to begin, and at the minimum, it's a beginning of becoming more fully aware of it,
and so this sense of being aware is the joy of compassion, at least for me,
so we're doing the seven factors of compassion today, this week, and so we're back into this mindfulness, how mindfulness is,
and as mindfulness is, we're being mindful of it in a calm, relaxed way, we become aware of how we're not open, how we're closed, or resisting,
or we're tight, or we're suffering in terms of compassion, we become aware of how we're suffering because of the suffering,
we're laying layers of suffering on top of experiencing the suffering of the world,
with our judgments, our fears, and taking it personally, and all kinds of things,
so then we learn to make a distinction between these other layers of suffering and just being open to the simplicity of the original suffering we're present for,
as we make that distinction, we learn how to be mindful in a more relaxed way, in an open way, and we make the effort to do so,
we make a different kind of effort to be present for the suffering where we're not tightening up and stressing around it,
and that leads us to this joy factor that now we're available, we're open in awareness without stress, in awareness without force,
in awareness which is calm, light, open, and in some ways the lighter and more calm the awareness can be,
the cleaner and fuller can be the experience of compassion, the way of experiencing suffering,
and that can be against the grain for some people because when we feel suffering of the world, suffering of others,
we better take it seriously, we better get gear up and do something big, and this is really important, some sufferings are huge,
and so it can be very counter-intuitive that the way forward is not to take it too seriously,
or take it so seriously that it's so important that you can't afford to get tense, you can't afford to get stressed out,
it's so important that to let the best qualities of who you are come forward and your best ability to think and to act and to do is in fact to relax and open and be available in a nice way.
So to go back to the example I gave the first day about the girl in the playground who's injured herself, scraped her knee,
if the caretaker comes over and cares for her, is distraught, is upset, is angry, feels like this is a disaster, it's a crisis,
and is yelling for help and saying this is a serious problem, the poor girl is going to learn all kinds of unhealthy things,
she's going to feel frightened, she's going to feel oh maybe things are much worse than I thought, and bad enough I got my knee scraped now,
maybe it's a disaster, I wonder if they're going to call 911 and the ambulance for me,
or now the little girl learns that the world is a frightening place to be in,
that all kinds of secondary things, because the caretaker got so alarmed and took it so seriously,
if the caretaker takes it respectfully, carefully, lovingly, fully, but has a lightness and ease and a calm,
and even has a sense of enjoying or appreciating or feeling the rightness to him here,
really comfortable in being here doing this, this little girl learns something very different about life.
She learns that this is available in life, she learns that life is a place where things are not a crisis,
that you meet your experiences and difficulties with a certain level of calm and lightness and ease and love and care.
So the ability to find sweetness in compassion is one of the great powers of compassion,
it's one of the great capacities compassion has, so in this week we're calling it the joy factor of compassion.
So I would like to suggest that if you have occasion today to encounter suffering, however small or large it might be,
and maybe it's best if you don't have to act quickly and immediately for it, that it doesn't require that of you,
see if you can find a way to register and feel and know that suffering clearly, not denying it, not dismissing its importance,
but that you can take the time to let it register and be known in you that in the knowing, in the being available for it,
you actually feel some sweetness, you feel some goodness, it feels some rightness.
And then what difference does it make for you if you experience compassion that way?
How do you then maybe respond differently with that?
So the joy factor of compassion.
So thank you and I look forward to continuing tomorrow.
