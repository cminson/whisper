1 Dharmette : Doing One Thing at a Time  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

I want to say a few more words about doing one thing at 
a time . The practice of meditation and mindfulness that 
we do  mostly has its origin  in the  monastic communi ty. 
Occasionally people think, “Oh, I think I ’d like to go off 
and live in a monastery for a while ,” or “I’m living a lay 
life and I can ’t quite benefit as well from this practice as 
someone who is a monk or a nun. ” One of the quali ties 
that makes monastic life so supportive of practice is that 
there  are more  opportunities to do just one thing at a 
time. And if you would like to get some of t he benefits of 
being a monastic  without being a monastic, then 
throughout the day, when you ’re doing something, give 
yourself over to doing just that one thing. Look for 
opportunities to just do one thing.  
 
This can take many different  forms. For example,  if 
you’re going from your kitchen  to your laund ry area  to 
put the clothes from the washing machine into the dryer, 
just do that. Walk from the kitchen to the laundry area – 
just do that. D ecide , “This is what I ’m going to do ” – as 
opposed to : starting to walk there and then noticing  that 
the dishes need to be put awa y, or that maybe it ’s time 2 to go and check the mail. It ’s so easy to get pulled left 
and right. Just do that one thing. If you set yourself a 
course, to get to your laundry area, just do that. Maybe 
make sure your phone is off , so you ’re not going to be 
distracted.  
 
Or it could be that when you pick up a pot, you pick it up 
with both hands , so you ’re really there with you and the 
pot. When I was in the m onastery in Japan I was 
berated by the other monks  for picking up the rice pot 
with only one hand. I thought y ou just pick it up and 
carry it into the dining area. “Gil when you pick up the 
rice pot, you pick it up with two hands. ” If you give your 
whole body, with both hands , over to that one activity , 
then you ’re really doing it, that one thing . What I found 
was if I do it with one hand , part of me is not really 
involved. I ’m not really giving myself over to do that one 
activity fully. I learned from Zen training that if you do it 
with both hands, more of you is connected, involved, 
more fully present.  
 
One of the advantages of doing one thing at a time is 
that you ’ll start noticing all the ways that you want to do 
more than one thing at a time. You ’ll start noticing all the 
impulses to try to do other things, or to get it over 
quickly so you can go onto the next thing. When you do 
one thing fully, you ’re not really even concerned about 
finishing it. Just do thi s one thing. Wash your dishes. 
“Okay I ’m here to wash the dishes, it doesn ’t matter how 3 long it takes, I ’m going to give myself over to it. ” If you ’re 
thinking about the next thing , then you ’re not doing one 
thing. You’re doing two things: the dishes and what 
you’re thinking about next.  
 
One of the things that you ’ll discover, when you do one 
thing, is you start noticing all the forces inside of you 
that want to  do more than one thing . “This is not good 
enough. I t has to be done better. There are  other things 
to do that are more important. The grass is greener 
somewhere else. This can ’t really count. This can ’t be a 
spiritual practice. Walking  to my l aundry room? That ’s 
not really where spirituality is.  I have to co me to a 
special place like IMC. ” All these beliefs , and thoughts , 
and re actions come into place. There are  a variety of 
thoughts that might arise that keep you at a distance 
from what you ’re doing. You might be doing it , but you ’re 
not really doing it.  
 
I remember when I was taking a painting class in 
college, Introduction to Painting.  I’d never painted 
before , and one of the big lessons that the teacher had 
for me was , “Gil, when you paint , you should b e more 
committed to the canvas; do more with the paint brush. ” 
I was just ever so lightly dabbling, kind of poking at the 
canvas [laughs] . Just put that brush in there [laughs] . 
But I was afraid – afraid  of the consequence of painting  
– so I wasn ’t giving myself over to the painting. There 
may be aversion  or fear or desire . There may  be all 4 kinds of things operating that keep us  from really being 
fully in the activity we ’re doing. We hold ourselves back. 
One of the things to discover is how we hold ourselves 
back.  
 
Or you might discover that , because you give yourself 
over fully to an activity,  maybe you give yourself into it 
too much. Maybe you ’re pushing too hard to make 
something happen. There ’s all this extra desire , and 
ambition , and expectations that are involved in trying 
too hard – wanting  too much  to get something out of it.  
 
Doing one thing at a time allows something to relax , 
because often the stresses we feel in our day  come not 
from the particular activity we ’re doing in and of itself, 
but from all the other things we ’re thinking we have to 
do. There ’s a lot of extra that we add on top of our life. 
And to allow yoursel f to just do one thing simply, fully – 
to have  one act ivity – hopefully , you can shed  a lot of 
thoughts and concerns that are not about that one 
activity. My suggestion to you is that probably a great 
percentage of the stress you experienc e in your day has  
to do with that  extra. It has nothing to do with the one 
activity.   
 
So you ’re cooking. If you ’re really there for that cooking , 
and you can let go of anything that has nothing to do 
with the cooking, chances are yet i t’s quite a pleasant 
experience, and  it will be relaxing to do. But if you ’re 5 concerned about getting the food out quickly, or getting 
it over with quickly, or paying your taxes,  or all kinds of 
other things that have nothing to do with the cooking, 
then it ’s easy to build up distress. And t his is very 
important because your heart is really precious .  
 
One of the great tasks, I think, of any spiritual life is  to 
find some way to let your heart get settled, to relax, 
open up , and have a time and place in your life. The 
more we do multi -tasking , the more likely it is that the 
heart gets lost and forgotten. It doesn ’t get noticed. But 
if you do one thing at a time and  you can relax in that 
one thing, chances are that your heart begins to come 
forth and show itself.   
 
So if you ’re interested in t aking what you learn in 
meditation and extending it out into your daily life more, 
make it a richer, more integral part of your daily life, a 
simple way to do  that would be to find more 
opportunities to do one thing at a time. Driving, turn off 
the radio . If you like to have the radio on when you 
drive, you ’re doing two things. If you ’re talking on the 
phone while you ’re driving, you could do that for sure, 
but you lose an opportunity to  have driving be just one 
thing in a relaxing way. It d oesn ’t sound tha t relaxing to 
talk on the phone and drive at the same time. It ’s a 
qualitatively different kind of experience.  
 6 Look at the situations in your life where you multi -task, 
and compare what  happens if you multi -task versu s if 
you “uni-task. ” Experiment a little bit , and see if it ’s to 
your advantage, to your ben efit, to do one thing at a 
time more often than you do now.
