 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. Welcome to our meditation session together. And the idea that we're doing it together, so many of us from around the world, for me is quite meaningful. It's always been meaningful for me to practice in community, meditate in community. I've done a lot of it and I probably wouldn't have practiced as much as I have if I hadn't had a community around me sharing the meditation. I probably wouldn't have learned as much. And I've learned a tremendous amount sitting together with other people in meditation. So we have this way here now, with the medium of our electric communications to have a chance to meditate together. Thank you. And sometimes when there's a particular Buddhist practice that's given, and it's offered not as a universal practice, do this all the time. Well, if it is offered that way, then we do it for a while and then we forget and then it's just always there and we might do it and might not. But an alternative way is to have a practice that we do for a very specific time. And maybe even a short time. This is what we're doing now. And what I'd like to suggest that for this next 29 minutes now or so of meditating together, that the primary practice be letting go. And maybe let go and let go into your breathing. Keep the thread of coming back to your breathing over and over again. And it's a way of highlighting what you can let go of. Anything that takes you away from the breathing. Gently, lovingly, kindly, maybe even slowly, let go. Release it. Thoughts, let them float away like thought bubbles. And we're not letting go of things, per se. What it is is letting go of our preoccupation with them, our concern with them. So it's not a judgment or statement about the value or the lack of value of anything. It's just the value of not holding on. The value of having a heart, a mind that's not concerned, preoccupied, involved with. Anything at all except gently concerned with the breathing. Letting go into the breathing. Being with a breath. And any kind of extra effort, straining, pushing, judging, commentating about how it's going, let go. Let go of your concern with it. Let go of your interest in that kind of thinking. Let go of giving it authority or value. Just let go and be with the breathing. Be with the breathing. So to assume a meditation posture that maybe provides you with a certain kind of little bit of strength, a little bit of dignity, a little bit of presence here and now. If you're sitting in a chair or sitting in a cushion, perhaps you can straighten out the back of your neck a little bit. So the last vertebrae of the spine, there's a gap between the last vertebrae of the spine and the skull. And as you kind of lift up and open that part, at the same time maybe open your chest a little bit. Not puffing it out, but just letting the shoulders maybe roll back a little bit. And feel where the weight of your body settles on your chair, your cushion, wherever you are. Would you feel the groundedness there? And taking a few long, slow, deep breaths on the exhale, releasing yourself into that support while staying upright. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And it's a lot easier to let go if the body is relaxed. So in whatever way that's possible, but not more than that, relax the body. On the exhale, relax the muscles of the face. Maybe when you feel the muscles of the face, you can get a sense of how much they work. Speaking, smiling, communicating, responding to the world. In meditation, let your face relax, taking a break from all that, relaxing or softening around the shoulders. Perhaps you carry the burdens of the world, the things we're preoccupied with. The preoccupation is maybe held or expressed in the shoulders. For these minutes now, putting everything down, letting the shoulders relax. And the belly. Maybe anxiety, fears, chronically held in the belly. And if there's fear or anxiety, it's hard to let go of our mental preoccupations, even for a short while. Softening, relaxing the belly. Feeling the weight of the belly as you do so. And finally, I can also relax the thinking mind, the energy, the pressure, the tightness associated with thinking. Maybe in the head, maybe somewhere else. As you exhale, maybe a little longer exhale than usual. Relax the thinking muscle, the thinking mind. And then breathing normally. Noticing how the body experiences breathing. So you're not so much in the control tower as you are in the experience the body has of breathing. The sensing, the feeling in the body. Either maybe feeling more fully or a little bit like placing a flag in the sand. So here, this is the place where the attention will now reside, come back to. And any other concern for the occupation of the mind, as soon as you notice it, let go. Especially let go on the exhale. Release your preoccupation. Let go of your concern, your involvement. Whether the thoughts you're caught in go away or not, that's secondary to releasing your interest in them, your involvement with them, whether you're deliberate or conscious. Interest returns to breathing over and over again. Let go of everything else, but resting gently with the breathing. Let go of everything else...... of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end you Let go. Let go of the layers that get revealed as you let go. Release. Release your concern, your involvement. It's not that you're so much letting go of what you're thinking about. You're just letting go of holding on, being involved. And let go into your breathing. Let go into knowing, breathing. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. Release. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, sometimes the practice of letting go in meditation where there's no need to be thinking about certain things or being concerned with things in the moment, no inherent need, we start seeing how much our desires, our thoughts, keep us from the task at hand. And sometimes when we're with other people, caring for others, caring for ourselves, we get hijacked, pulled away by our thoughts, our judgments, our commentary. And learning to let go can be a learning to really be present for others, present for ourselves in a deep friendly way, caring way, kind way. May it be that what we learned about letting go supports us in caring for self and others for a focus on supporting the welfare and happiness of all beings. May letting go, wise letting go, give us the ability to wish and support happiness, safety, peace and freedom for everyone. May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be peaceful, may all beings be free. May all beings be free. Thank you.
