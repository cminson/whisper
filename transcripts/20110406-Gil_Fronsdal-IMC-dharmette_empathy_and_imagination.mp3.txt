Dharmette : Empathy  and Imagination  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on April 6 , 2011  
 
 
I have a topic , but not a talk. So I’m not sure where this 
is going to go. The topic  that I’m thinking about today  is 
empathy . And it’s  a very important topic for being 
human. The human capacity for empathy is a beautiful 
thing. In order to think  about it a little better, I looked up 
‘empathy ’ to learn what the great world authority , 
Wikipedia , had to say about it [ laughter] . One of the 
surprises in looking at the Wikipedia entry was that the 
person who wrote it clearly was saying that empathy  – 
the word and the concept  – has been coined relatively 
recently , and people  in the last decades have been 
trying to come up with a definition for it. There are 
different definitions  for empathy, but not one that is 
agreed upon .  
 
But all the meanings have to do with understanding 
other people and their feelings in some way or another. 
Some people emphasize  that it’s feeling the feelings of 
others , not in a contagious way where you take them  on 
as your own , but instead  you sense them clearly as it’s 
their feelings . Some people point out that empathy 
means understanding the perspec tive, life situation , and 
frame of reference of  someone else. You p ut yourself in their shoes, see their life experiences and what went on 
for them. So that’s having more  to do with cognition , 
rather than feeling. It means  understanding the bigger 
picture of their l ife, and what it’s like going  through life 
like that. Some  people poin t to the role of mirror 
neurons to pick up and sense the facial expressions and 
gestures of people. Something inside us feels what 
comes through other peoples’ gestures. Other people 
talk about the role of imagination  – that we use our 
imagination to imagine ourselves in their shoes , and we 
dare to understand how it is for them. So for different 
people, empathy is perhaps different.  
 
Empathy overlaps with compassion. Similarly 
compassion – what it is, how it gets stimulated or 
invoked, how people feel it, and act on it – may be for 
different for different people. But whether it’s empathy or 
compassion,  
one of the really beautiful thing s that can happen 
through meditation and Buddhist practice is that our 
capacity for it grows and develops. One of the reasons it 
does that is because the obstacles to empathy and 
compassion  fall away. It’s as if empathy and 
compassion are innate capacities  we have , which 
mostly will operate on their own if we get out of the way. 
So when  we sit and meditate , our distractions, fears, 
anxieties, in hibitations, anger , frustrations , and 
interpretations we have when we overlay on top of our 
experience  begin  to qu iet down , and settle away. The field becomes cleaner and clearer , and we’re much 
more likely to either feel more fully, see more clearly, 
think in a more effective way , and use our  imagination in 
ways that are much more immediate and valuable.  
 
For example, I could  be talking with someone, and I 
could spend my time imagining how wonderful it would 
be to have a red sports car  [laughter] . That would be  
one use of my imagination. Or I could be sittin g meeting 
with someone , and somehow my imagination is evoked 
by the person . They’re telling me their story , and what 
goes on. I’m imagining what that’s like  for them . My 
imagination may not be completely accurate , but still it’s 
enga ged with their story, w hat’s going on for them, their 
background and history, and what it must have been 
like to grow up that way , or to be that way. So one 
imagination takes me away from them , and the other 
imagination brings me hopefully towards them  where  
empathy  is more like ly. 
 
What  I’ve found is that my capacity for empathy and 
compassion has grown with practice. One of the 
beautiful things in my life is to feel  a greater sense of 
empathy and compassion  – a connectedness to people. 
In turn, as the empathy grew , it seemed that it also 
fueled my practice. It became a source of 
encouragement or motivation to practice  further 
because I wasn’t practicing just for myself , but to also  
support and be helpful to other people , and to become a better  person in the world. I feel t hat this sense of 
mutual interplay  of practice supporting the growth of 
empathy , and empathy  supporting  the growth of 
practice , has gone back and forth in my life in very 
important ways.  
 
So when  you come out of your meditation to start your 
day and go  into the world, it might be interesting for you 
to look, see, and be open to feeling, sensing, being 
present  for, and imagining the people that you ’ll 
encounter as you leave. Don’t  use your practice as 
some way to b e self -contained, self -absorbed , or 
holding on to how you feel in a way that shields you 
from really taking in someone else. But instead , really 
come  out of your meditation willing and able in a quiet 
way to feel, sense , and be connected to others. Then  
see what happens , and see what gets touched. I 
imagine a variety of different things will be touched 
depending on the person that you encounter.   
 
Look at how empathy play s out in your life. Is it mostly 
body -based?  Does so mething resonate in your body in 
relationship to them? Is it feeling -based? Do emotions 
get elicited in you in response to someone else where 
you’re feeling  similar things to them? Or is  it 
imagination , thoughts , and perspectives? Are you 
interested in und erstanding other people’s point of 
view?  
 There may be not much we can do about feeling other 
people’s feelings or having a resonance in your body 
with what’s going on with them. It either happens or it 
doesn’t happen if we’re open to it. But we do have s ome 
choice over using our imagination and thinking. So if 
you find yourself in a difficult  interpersonal situation, 
from what perspective do you look at the difficulty? One 
of the perspectives to bring to this situation is , “What is 
it like for that person? How is it for them to be in this 
conflict , and how  is it for them to be struggling? What’s 
going on for them in their life that they’re so angry? Let 
me take a moment her e to try to understand the 
background of their situation. They’re afraid , and so 
what  happened in their life that they’re so afraid? ” It’s a 
choice to take the time to think and reflect on what  is the 
perspective  and bigger picture under which  this person 
is operating , as opposed to only maintaining the 
perspective that this person has had an impact on me , 
that they better understand my perspective, history, and 
what happened to me in my life , and I’m going to tell 
them [ laughs] . 
 
So there are these two dif ferent sides to compassion 
and empathy . There’s the side that gets evoked or 
awakened in us – that we’re available. There’s less of a 
filter between us and the world, and something can 
happe n in a more  intuitive or direct way. And then 
there’s a side that is not automatic or natural 
necessarily . But we choose to engage that part of us that allows for fuller, deeper understanding  and 
empathy to occur. Some of that has to do with 
imagination. Some of it has to do with  a shif t of 
perspective , and realizing that there are different 
perspectives in any given situation. So, be willing to  look 
at different perspectives. Stretch and put aside your 
perspective for a little while , and look at it from another  
perspective,  and a nother one , and another one  to get a 
fuller picture.  
 
In the end , I think my approach, hope , and wish in any 
situation is to look for what is best for everyone 
concerned , and not just at what’s best for me  or for 
another person . Can we find a place that b rings what’s 
best, beautiful, helpful, and with the greatest sense of 
wellbeing to everyone concerned?  I think that empathy 
and many of its forms is one of the great supports for 
helping us find what’s best for everyone. Thank you.
