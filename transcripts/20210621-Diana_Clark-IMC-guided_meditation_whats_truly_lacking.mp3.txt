 Good evening, welcome, welcome. Nice to be here. So we'll start with a guided meditation. It's a way to support our practice and to support our being here now. So taking our meditation posture and having the body in a posture that expresses our intention to meditate and also has some ease, has a certain amount of relaxation. And then tuning into the body as it is at this moment. Maybe in a global sense, feeling tired or restless, agitated or calm, happy, sad. Maybe we're not sure. And then tuning into some more particular experiences, the pressure against the body of whatever we're sitting on, on our lower legs, our buttocks, our back, perhaps our feet. We're here now. And then allowing the attention to land on the experience of breathing, and the movements of the body associated with breathing. The chest, the abdomen. It's subtle, but we might also notice a little bit in our back. Or perhaps the feeling of air going in and out of the nose. And a relaxed, easy way without straining. Just noticing the sensations of breathing. And when the mind wanders, of course the mind will wander. And when it does, we just very simply, gently begin again. And when the mind wanders, we might notice that sometimes there is a wish for something more. Sometimes we might be planning what we're going to do or obtain. Or we might be imagining how it would be so much better if only... And when we find our mind lost and are pulled in this direction, we might, just a little query, ask ourselves, what in this moment is truly lacking? In the spirit of, can we bring our attention back to this moment, the fullness, the completeness of this moment, as opposed to focusing on what's absent or what's not matching our preferences. At this moment, is anything truly lacking? Maybe you'll have to modify the question in a way that resonates with you. Does there have to be this sense of lack? This sense of not enough? If it feels too complicated, too burdensome, to be noticing when we're wishing things to be different or planning what we're going to obtain or acquire or do next. And then responding with the question, what's really lacking? What's truly lacking? Is anything lacking that's really important? And if all of that feels too burdensome, just being with the sensations of breathing. We're approaching our meditation in this way. To help support a sense of, it's okay in this moment. We don't have to have, we don't absolutely have to have these things that we're thinking about or planning. Right now we're just here, meditating. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
