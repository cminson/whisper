 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Let's begin with some meditation. So take a deep breath in and relax on the exhale. This is a morning meditation, noticing the rise and fall of the breath. Just relaxed, being breathed by this body, effortlessly allowing the body to breathe you. I thank my breath. I thank my breath. It spreads oxygen throughout my body and brain. And then turning attention to your heart. Maybe feeling the heart pumping blood, tirelessly pump, pump, pump, pump, pumping blood throughout my body. I am so grateful to my generous heart. And turning attention to the stomach, the liver, the kidneys, all of the soft tissue organs, transforming food into nourishment for this body, keeping this body alive beneath my consciousness, tirelessly digesting, transforming food into nourishment for this precious body to remain alive. And I turn attention to my hands, the ingenuity of these amazing hands that hold things, type, carry, reach. So many things with these amazing hands drive, wash dishes, hug. I thank my hands. And these strong, stable feet on the ground that carry me everywhere. I thank my feet. I thank my strong, upright back, supple that keeps me upright. And now letting the awareness spread out through the entire body, all the cells of the body interacting with each other, magical. The white blood cells gathering around, cells that are not working so well and expelling them from the system. All the cells of this entire body, this precious body, this wise, amazing body. I thank my cells. I thank my body. And now shifting the contemplation, imagining someone who really cares for you, maybe loves you, friends, family, a grandchild, a pet, someone who loves you, cares for you, is in front of you now. And you can feel his or her love for you, penetrating your entire body, pervading you with his or her care, her softness, his wish for your well-being, his concern and care, kindness, wishing you well. And allowing this warm, loving being to dissolve into light and to let the light enter you and become you, become your Metta body. Feeling this Metta, this love, this kindness, throughout your body, bathing in it, drenched in Metta, drenched in compassion. There is a Buddhist prayer, may Metta arise where it has not arisen. And when it has arisen, may it not diminish, but increase further and further. May my practice today, this meditation, not only be for my benefit, but for my love ones, for the benefit of everyone in this room, for the benefit of everyone we know in this senior Sangha. May compassion arise where it has not arisen. May it not diminish, but increase further and further, reaching everywhere. May my practice reach everywhere, may it benefit to all beings, all suffering beings, in horrible situations like war, sickness, hunger, suffering the pains of racial prejudice, suffering the pains of attachments and aversions in this mind. May all beings benefit from my practice of Metta, of Karuna, of awareness. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free. May all beings know a joy that has no sorrow. May all beings abide in equanimity, awareness, free from aversion, free from fear, free from jealousy, free from pride, free from depression and attachments, free from attachments, but only cause us pain. Now let's just rest. Letting go of all contemplation, just resting in. Whatever is happening for you now, being with that. Okay. Thank you.
