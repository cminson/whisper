So the theme that we're using for this retreat are the three things to
cultivate in practice and three things to see. And it turns out that the three
things to cultivate and the three things to see are opposites. That we
cultivate certain qualities so that we can see the presence of something that's
kind of like the opposite of them. So we cultivate stability, we cultivate
well-being, and we cultivate confidence. So we're in a good position to be able to
see, in a useful way, to see instability, unhappiness, and lack of
confidence, kind of. But more specifically, we cultivate stability so we can see the
changing in constant and permanent nature of experience. We cultivate
well-being so we can see the dukkha aspect of our experience, the suffering
aspect, the stressful aspect, the unsatisfactory aspect of our experience.
And we cultivate confidence in order to see what is called not-self, the
impersonal quality of the things that make up our experience. And the
value of cultivating those first, before having these insights, is that it's a
lot easier to have those insights and have those insights be productive and
useful for us, have them be liberating if we've cultivated these other
things first. And you can probably well imagine that there are people for
whom their life has been hellish, and maybe they've had a lot of instability in
their life, grew up in war zones and difficult family situations and violence,
and had no stability. There were people who were constantly moving in different
places easily. I went to, I changed schools 12 times in 12 years of grade
school. So that's a lot of moving, right? So there are people who have
this instability. And to tell them that everything's impermanent and
this is good news and deal with it, it's kind of like bad news. It's
like pushes them over the edge. It's like too much. There are people who are
tremendously unhappy for good reason. They live under terrible conditions of
oppression and challenges and none of their own making. And it's very
difficult to hear from some of these Buddhist people that, you know,
life is suffering. It's not quite really what Buddhists said, but you hear that
kind of being said, or that that's kind of almost what people hear. You know,
everything's a suffering, all experience, everything's characterized by suffering.
And like what hope is there then for these poor people who that's all they've
ever had. And some people have tremendous lack of confidence, lack of
self-worth, self-esteem, self, you know. Their life experience is
really undermined, any sense of personal efficacy and value. And then to hear
that there's not self is also like, you know, confusing teaching to receive. But
to cultivate stability, the real healthy sense of subtleness and groundedness
and being really here in a strong way. To cultivate a strong sense of well-being
that's pervasive, sense of well-being through a whole system. To cultivate a
strong sense of confidence in our practice and ourselves and our capacity
to be in our worth, in our value, to be present for our experience. That allows
the mind to not be defensive, to not be afraid, allows the mind not to be
reactive to it or confused. It puts us in a condition that allows us to perceive
these deep existential truths that Buddhism emphasizes to three
characteristics in a way that allows those insights to help the mind relax
further, let go further, to release in a very deep way. And the point of these
insights is not to have the insights. So you don't want to get too cut up and
like this is like all important to have these insights. That's the point of it
all. It's more like the point of the insights is to be set free. And so we
cultivate these things in order to have these insights have value and have
impact, a good impact on us. And so a lot of Buddhist practices do with
cultivating qualities. There's an interesting that in English when people
say, you know, I practice, Buddhist practice in English-speaking countries,
Buddhists do a lot of practicing, you know, practice, practice, practice.
Robert Thurman was complained about these American Buddhists. All they do is
practice, practice, practice. Why is the performance? And the, but if you ask
a some in English-speaking person, many of them, what do you practice? A good
number of them will reply like that they're practicing a technique. I practice
mindfulness. I practice concentration. I practice metta. It's a technique. But
there's not exactly a word in Pali that fits really well as a match for the
arbor practice. Maybe there might be, but the most common word used for in Pali
to describe what people are doing when they do what in English we do we practice
is bhavati. Bhavati means to cultivate and bhavana is cultivation. And if you
ask someone, what are you cultivating? You get a different answer. It doesn't,
it doesn't, it doesn't, I guess you could say I'm cultivating mindfulness or
concentration. But what are you cultivating? It kind of points not to a
technique or points more to what you're developing inside. What are you, how
you're changing? How are you maturing? And and we're developing and maturing
among many things stability and well-being and confidence. And the, so
today I'm going to talk a little bit about stability. But I guess even before I
say that I want to say a few other things that about this wonderful heart we
have. That I think it is helpful to understand or appreciate or that this
very famous expression that Dharma practice goes against a stream. It goes
against the common currents of culture and the common currents of how people
think in our society and how we're trained to think. And and so I say that
because it's very easy to engage in practice, Dharma practice and Dharma
cultivation with the with the mindset that it goes with the stream. That we're
kind of going along with the old habits, the old cultural conditionings, the old
priorities and what's important. And one of them is to practice as if you know
it's all about me, myself and mine. And you know that it's my practice. I'm the
one who's doing it. I have to attain. I hope people are noticing. You know and
you know that I hope everyone's noticing how much I'm empty of self. That
would be great. And I hope they praise me because the or or people have very
little sense of efficacy in their interpersonal relationships and and you
know and don't really have intimacy or strong connections. And so there's they
want something to satisfy that whole and emptiness. So they're reaching into
Buddhist practice, even in Buddhist attainments, in order to fill some kind
of gap they have at all, which is not usually that healthy to do it that way.
And but you know still acquisited this, getting something from me, you know,
doing something so easy. And that's kind of going with the stream. But to
a different mindset, different approach, different interest, you know it's hard to
understand how to do that, how to think differently. And you know what's a
different way of approaching all this. So one of the ways is to just have a big
question mark next to yourself or next to your heart where you don't
necessarily validate everything that you believe and think and do. You're open to
some new possibility. You're open to something different. What else is here?
And that's particularly useful I think the first day of the retreat because
it's common for a good percentage of people in the first day of the retreat
to suffer more than they expected, one way or the other. And to be disappointed
in themselves for not being more concentrated, to be angry that they're
sleepy and they can't focus or to be dismayed. I'm thinking, I'm still
thinking about that. And so but that kind of being discouraged or
dismayed or upset about our condition, I'd like to propose is the old mindset that
belongs to the old way of thinking and of how I'm supposed to do things and
succeed at things or who I am and this defines me in some way and this presents
me in a bad light or whatever the mindset is. So we do these things, it's
okay, but just put a question mark. Like is that really so? You know, is there
another way? Just that. You don't have to necessarily even know what you're
doing and what your mind is, you know, your mindset you have, you're looking at
it. But just kind of like what? What is this? Is this really so? Or is there
another way? And so much of our life is subconscious. So much of our life is a
deep kind of wellsprings inside. And we don't even know what the right question
is yet or the right kind of place to touch and be with. So I think having a lot
of respect and care for ourselves and love for ourselves for what we're up
against and what we're working with and who we are, and that is a question mark.
Maybe this, maybe what I see and what I know is not really the full picture.
Maybe it's not really what's the, you know, I need to kind of get so concerned
where I'm wrapped up with, upset with. But does I have a question mark and being
still and quiet and be willing to be receptive and find out what's here? And
what is in your heart? You know, if you kind of were able to go a
thousand miles down into your heart, what question might open the door of peace?
There's reservoirs of peace. And where would you, how would you sit a
thousand miles deep in your heart in the place where you don't know to allow
that door to open to that peace or to unlock what's there? So this kind of
willingness to kind of not know in some ways and be open to possibility and be
open to going against the stream. And this becomes a little bit obvious in the
surface of the mind when we see the opposite of stability, when we see how
instable the mind is or the agitation of the mind. You know, I've been meditating
for a very long time at least, you know, at least one way of looking at it. Another
way of looking at it, I'm just beginning. But you know, it's, you know, for a
long time. And so I still get fooled. And one way, kind of where, if I'm going
around and being busy daily life, and I feel pretty good and content and
happy perhaps and doing all the things I'm doing. And then I go and
meditate. And then I find out that actually my mind is pretty agitated. It's
spinning, it's caught up in its concerns, or momentum, and I'm kind of jumping around
from thought to thought. And I couldn't see that when I was busy. My life
was jumping around, going to different things, because maybe my, you know, it's
camouflage then. It just looks like everything else, right? So you know, you
know, it doesn't, you know, I don't see it. This wonderful expression, distracted
from my distractions by my distractions. So, but then you sit and I say, wow, the
mind is agitated. My body is agitated. I feel like I'm jumping. I feel like I
want to, my legs want to bolt. I feel this restlessness, you know, and my mind is
kind of racing and spinning around all these different things. And so I get
fooled because I don't, you know, I don't remember that. And then I sit down, oh, yeah, this is
how it works. This is how it is. And then it takes a while to settle, settle. And on
retreats, like coming on retreat, that goes to a whole different degree. Sometimes
we settle in the first sitting or two, but we discover kind of deeper, because
we get more settled here more quickly than everyday life, even it doesn't feel
that way. We actually tune into and become aware of a lot more of what's
going on and has been unattended to. And so sometimes there's a lot more
seemingly restless mind or agitated mind in the beginning of a retreat than we
kind of expected. And sometimes I've had the conclusion that I must be going
backwards. You know, I was better off not being at the retreat, you know, came here
to get agitated. But that's not what actually was going on, it was I was
waking up to what was really happening and it was revealing itself and showing
itself and getting to know it better. And that's a really healthy process. It's
really good to get to know and to see what's happening. And that's the way
forward, is to see and understand and acknowledge and not deny and not try to
pretend it's not there or not to be, you know, or to be aversive or be bothered by
it and upset by it. But in a certain way, kind of like, yes, okay, this is good.
I'm seeing how my mind operates. Fantastic. As opposed to, oh, shit.
Or some other equivalent. And then what I said yesterday, I'd like to
reemphasize that, well, I'll get to it indirectly. Another thing we say in
English, I think, that we can very easily, many of us refer to my mind, my
mind this, my mind that. But I think that we don't do it so easily off our tongue
when we use the word awareness, my awareness, your awareness, you know. We
talked about the awareness, the awareness was there, awareness was strong, it was
clear, but there wasn't much awareness. But I don't think we so often put that
little, you know, mind in front of it. And I think there's a good reason,
because there's a sense, because awareness has a quality as a way of
operating naturally without it being something we do so self-consciously, or
something we make, happen, or do, or take ownership for, or, you know, feel like,
you know, we're in charge of. And you can see that because of how easy it is, I
don't know, easy, but that, you know, if you're pretty real, if you're out all
the sleep you need, and you're pretty relaxed, and contented, and just sitting,
doing nothing at all, it's extremely hard to turn the awareness off. You know,
it stays conscious. You know, it doesn't, you know, stop being aware. You know, if I
tell, I tell all of you, you know, order all of you, stop being aware. You
probably be just, it is making you even more aware than you are. And once you
start focusing on it, you know, like, you know, you can't bat it away. So awareness
is just that natural thing that we do. And, and so, it's helpful in this
practice to create the conditions that allow that awareness to surface and be
there. And one kind of little bit anthropocentric way of saying that is to
say that we're trying to create the conditions to where awareness wants to
show up. That it wants, it's our friend, and we want to create the conditions so our
friend wants to be there. And if, if, if it's, oh shit, you know, about what's
going on, or you know, your mind is all bothered by things and angry with how
things are, or you know, or somehow really selfish or really scared or something,
you know, that maybe the awareness doesn't really want to show up. And we
have to kind of dredge it up or pull it up or, you know, we have to work at it
somehow. But if our inner life, how we, our attitude and our approach and how we
are is, what, what, what, what approach would you inner life have? What, what
qualities of mind or heart you think that you would need so that your, your
awareness, the awareness that's in you, wants to show up. Like it feels like, oh
yeah, like show up in that mind, that would be great. There's space and there's, you
know, room for it and it's not so crowded with all this, I don't know. So, so, you
know, we're trying to cultivate a variety of things that help support
awareness to be there. And in a sense, there's like two things that we're trying
to do, and many things we're doing in practice, but to take a thing too much
here today, there's what we do and what we allow. And if practice is all about
only about what we're doing, there's no space to allow something to arise. But
if it's only about trusting something will arise, then we might not really
create the right conditions or the momentum to allow awareness to arise in
a very strong, stable, productive and useful way. And so, we don't want to
forfeit all responsibility, but we don't want to take responsibility for
everything. And so, we show up to practice and cultivate certain things. But
while we're doing that, we also have to kind of simultaneously allow for
something to happen. If you're wondering if it's raining, we have to open, many
people, what they do is they'll open their hand, their palm and have it towards
the sky and see if the drop of rain will fall on the sensitive part of the palm.
So, we have to, we have to do something, we have to do the opening, but we have to
allow the sky to provide the drop, right? So, those two things happen
simultaneously. So, we have to kind of both allow ourselves, you know, to show
up and be present for experience. We have to, you know, be here and not
thinking, maybe let go of our thoughts so that awareness can arise, or so that
concentration can develop, so that we can see clearly what's going on. So, that
goes against, it can go against the stream for some people. This idea of some
people, their stream is all about taking responsibility and doing, it's all about
what I have to do. And some people, it's all about not doing and just giving up
responsibility. So, how do we do both? So, with stability, one of the ways we do
that is first recognizing how we're unstable. The agitation we have in our
bodies, agitation we have in our thinking, agitation we have in our hearts, the ways
in which we're fragmented and jumping around or restless. And there's layers
and layers of this kind of restlessness and agitation in us. And don't
underestimate how powerful it is simply to recognize that it's there. There's a,
you know, a lot of mindfulness practice has to do but clearly recognizing, oh,
this is what's happening, this is what's happening. And I think of
recognition as learning how to recognize in a useful way is a big part of
mindfulness practice. You want to kind of not just recognize, you want to
recognize in a useful way. And the useful way is to recognize in a way that
gives space for what's there, rather than recognize in a way that's like you
sledgehammer to destroy it or, you know, or somehow trying to put a fire under it
to get it going even bigger if it's a good thing. But just a peaceful
recognition, a recognition that's not in conflict with what's there. And this
ability to be present and aware of our experience, even difficult experience,
without being in conflict with it is a very important part of developing
stability. So you might feel very agitated and so you step back in a sense
and see, I'm agitated, I'm restless. Now how can I be aware of this
restlessness so I'm not in conflict with it? What kind of recognition,
what's the act of recognition done so that I'm peaceful in recognizing the
agitation? And by every circumstance as we're in, there'll be a
different answer. How do I recognize this? How am I mindful of this in a way that
is useful and present? And to ask that question and do the exploration, is
beginning to extract, it's a process of beginning to extract ourselves from
being identified or preoccupied with what is difficult. If we're glued or
entangled with our, you know, mental landscape, it's very hard to practice or
very hard to make room and allow for awareness to come or allow for anything
to go to develop. And so we have to somehow disentangle ourselves from our
experience. That doesn't mean we have to get rid of anything, but to be
disentangled. And so this, you know, exploring this question, how do I
recognize this? How do I be aware of this so that I'm not caught in it?
Asking that question begins the process of disentangling. So just don't go,
okay, here I am and my knee hurts and I'm really, you know, anxious about it
and my mind is spinning a lot. So what would it look like for me to be aware of
that painful knee so I'm not in conflict with it or so that I'm kind of a
little bit more peaceful with it? And as we ask that question, we kind of begin
looking, well, do I feel it more closely and intimately? Do I step back and feel
it from a distance? Do I feel it with a sense of awareness? Maybe my awareness
is larger, that feels the knee. Or do I have to kind of bring my attention to
feel the anxiety that I have? And that's what's important to kind of find out
to be with. Should I be aware of the anxiety from a distance, looking at it?
Or should I feel the anxiety right in the middle of the anxiety? Should I, or
maybe, oh, look at that, I'm actually aversive to the anxiety. So maybe that's
where the attention needs to be. And so there's this kind of very gentle,
hopefully very relaxed, unanxious, unhurried, looking at agitation and
restlessness, getting to know it and seeing it. And that process and doing it
and exploring, how do I do that? So in how I'm aware is settling. How I'm aware
brings a certain stillness or stability to least awareness and makes room. One of
the remarkable things that can happen in this practice is that by not doing too
much, the whole system begins to settle itself. And you know, we all
heard many times the analogy of muddy water that settles if you don't
agitate it, if you don't stir it up and the mud settles to the bottom. And our
psychophysical system is tense and agitated and contracted and resistant
and clinging and attached and all these different things because something in
our system is working, is applying effort. It takes energy to do those
things. And energy is, you know, consistent energy is just tiring, it's
difficult. Inherent in all this stuff, all the neurosis, all the attachments, all
the clinging, all the resistance. Inherent in it is a movement towards relaxing
and letting go. That's really what it wants. If you take and grip something
really hard with your hand and really grip it, you can feel after a while how
much work it takes. And after a while you really want to relax and let go. The
hand itself wants to release the grip and you have to reassert the effort. So
this is why part of us, you know, is not to worry too much about being agitated
and feeling kind of all this inner instability, but to kind of get out of
the way and a lot feel it, be with it so that it has a chance to settle on its
own. I learned early in my practice how useful it is to, how useful for me, at
least in my mind, when the first, about the first ten minutes of a sitting, to
not worry about how much I'm thinking. I just let myself think and I do my
best to be present and focus and I kind of let go of my thoughts a little bit,
but I'm not worried or concerned and I just let it do its thing. And I
found that that was the best condition to allow the mind just to relax and
settle on its own. And then once at some point it settled enough, then I could
let go more fully. And then it was, there wasn't so much energy in it anymore and
it was, okay, let go and now let's, now let's get to work. You know, now I'm
ready. And now, but I needed those ten minutes to kind of let everything chill
and cool out. And so, you know, it's just not too much. Just show up and be
present the best you can, but you know, don't worry too much about things. Let's
up. That's worked for me. I don't know if that works for you. And then, so, so if
the ideal at the point is to cultivate stability, a good, really good way to
learn that is to understand your instability, whatever way that form
that takes for you. A busy mind, a racing mind, a racing heart, jumping emotions,
you know, agitation that we have in various ways, is to be content to get
to know what your flavor of agitation might be, how it is. But also, it's
possible to cultivate stability directly, not just allow it to happen by
settling. And, and so there's stability of the body and one of the reasons to
take good posture and meditation and to hold relatively still in meditation is
because we're trying to contribute to the meditation a stable physical
posture. And the physical stability will translate and support mental stability.
And so, to be careful with your posture and figure out how to both take a strong
posture, upright posture, and then also to relax in that posture, to soften in the
posture. For those people who can sit cross-legged upright, I found it very
interesting many years ago when I read some kind of physiology study that said
there are two postures, human postures, that allow the body to relax deepest. And
one is the yoga corpse posture. The other, the second that's equally helpful,
useful for relaxation, is the sitting and cross-legged upright. And, and some
people will think, well, you know, it's nice to sit upright, but I think the
really relaxing thing is to kind of sit back into the couch and relax and slump.
And, you know, and it might be true sometimes, but once the body has some
strength to it and conditioned and strong, there's something about the
alignment of sitting upright that allows the musclatures to relax deepest. As
soon as we begin slumping and the shoulders kind of roll and hunch,
there's actually less room for the deeper relaxation that can happen in the
body. So, for those people who can do this, it's a support. People who can't sit
this way, it's okay. There's other ways to, for this works, you know, through the
practice, but this is one way to get physical support for this process of
stability. And, you know, and having a firm, really feeling the foundation of
your body, your feet against the floor or your legs against the mat and feeling
real, making sure there's a feeling of stability there and contact with
something firm and good. And then being embodied in this body. It's so much
easier to cultivate stability if we're embodied. And, and it's very easy in our
culture to be disembodied. It's very easy for people to have very difficult
emotions to be disembodied. And so, a part of practice is coming back into the
body and feeling the body and allowing the body to really let the stability
and the strength of the body and the vibrancy of the body and the awareness
which is within the body, all the senses we have, the sensations we have in
there, to allow that to settle and be strong so that we can really feel and
sense stability. If we're not connected to the body, then the body's not going to
support us. It's not going to create the conditions for physical conditions that
make it second nature to be present for our experience. So, do you find, find
some way to be rooted in your body and come back in your body and feel your
body and take time to really connect and settle in your body? I've known people
for whom they've sat down to meditate and they've thought about it only as a
mental act. Only as something they're going to do with their mind. And, and they
kind of kind of disconnect to their body and not really hear for their body and,
you know, anything below the neck then, you know, is not spiritual or not
important or not, you know, not where it's at. And, but, you know, if we're one
whole, mind-body-whole, we want to, you know, be connected to the body and feel
it and sense it and open up to it and become alive in it. And that provides,
that becomes an avenue for not only stability, but it also becomes an avenue
vehicle for feeling well-being and confidence. Because happiness and
confidence are not just mental events. They're psychophysical events,
psychophysical things that happen. And so the stability and presence we get in
the body then supports us, the cultivation and the growth of other
really good things that can happen. And then there's stability of our thinking
and, you know, you probably have heard people speak in agitated ways, fast ways,
jumping around ways, changing subjects a lot, you know, and just, you know, it's
hard to track what they're saying and all that. Chances are that for some of us,
if we talked out loud what we're thinking, people might think that of us. And sometimes
we do what's called discursive thinking. There's layers of thinking, different
kinds of thinking that we do. And discursive thinking is when we're having a
conversation in our mind. When we're a conversation with someone else in our
mind or we're telling ourselves stories or reviewing a story that happened or
fantasizing about a future, you know, making up stories about a wonderful
future, or just plain and simple having a fantasy. That's kind of elaborate. And
that's a relatively coarse form of thinking. And that form of
thinking is generally not useful for meditation. And it usually belongs to a
more agitated, unstable aspect of the mind. And so there's other thinking, you
know, there's very simple sentences we say that says, oh look, my knee hurts.
That's not a discursive thought. That's just a recognition of what's happening.
It might be in the form of some words the mind says quietly. And that can be done
without much agitation. It's just very simple. It's just, you know, just the
facts, you know, oh, the knee hurts. And I wonder if maybe this is the time
I should bring mindfulness to my knee. And I wonder, would it be useful to kind of
be really intimate with that pain and really feel the details of it? Or would
it be useful to kind of create a really wide, spacious, open awareness and just
receive that pain into the awareness? So having those kinds of very simple
queries and thoughts can be done spaciously, relaxedly. It doesn't have
to involve a lot of agitation or a lot of busyness of the mind. And so that
might be actually supportive and helpful up to a point. But even because it's
trying to figure out something and, you know, trying to understand something, at
some point it becomes too much. And at some point you might feel that this is
not helpful anymore. This is keeping me at a distance or keeping me kind of
unsettled. And then it's good to know, recognize that there's even subtler
thoughts to do. There's just a recognition, there's pain. You don't even
say it's the pain in the knee because that's too many words. You know, it's a
little bit too complicated. You know, it's a little bit too abstract. It's just
pain. There's pain, hot, pulsing, burning, twisting, searing, stabbing. All kinds of
great. You know, just a simple recognition. Or there's pain and it's
moving, moving around, jumping around. And it's just a very, very simple quiet
recognition. So I go through those three different levels in order to bring us
back to this, you know, the discursive thinking level. If you're involved in
discursive thoughts and conversations, and can you gently, lovingly continue
those conversations in a quieter voice in your mind? Could you kind of talk in a
quiet, like you imagine you're in the library? And can you kind of like, if
you need to, you know, sometimes you can't just let go of it. It comes back,
right? Well, just to keep doing it. But can you like think, just imagine you're
really in the library and you're sitting close to the librarian station. You know,
so you want to be quiet, you know, and just kind of, you know, a whisper in
your mind that, you know, the conversation or the fantasy is always. And chances are
that a few things will happen. One is, you'll get calmer. You know, you're
talking a calmer way in your mind, you'll get calmer. You know, it's like you're
you're thinking about, you know, how terrible it's going to be at work on
next Monday and the terrible meeting and your boss and you have fantasy and
you're a little bit alarmed and agitated. And then you start thinking, oh, yes. Yes,
I think that that's going to be a difficult meeting. If the boss has X, I
think I'll say Y. Yeah, it'll be, you know, and pretty soon, you know, it's when
you're whispering, you know, with a librarian nearby, you know, you, you know,
things get quieter and you get calmer with it, maybe, and it just changes the
inner landscape. Then if you just continue down the stream in the normal
way, the other thing that might happen is when you whisper quietly, is you start
thinking it's ridiculous. You know, in a way that it's hard to do if you just go
along with the usual way of thinking, you know, because it's so much authority,
it's common, it's, you know, it's like this is what's supposed to happen or, you
know, we get fooled by it. And so we might think this is, you know, this, I don't
need to do this. And the other thing might happen is that we start seeing that
maybe it's not so valuable to do this. So to relax the mind, the thinking mind, but
don't, don't make it all or nothing, just a little bit, step by step. Can you,
can you, yes, you're allowed to think if you can't stop, but think in a calmer
way, you know, whisper to, you know, you know, imagine you're talking to the
librarian. I mean, then you really want to be quiet, something. So, so there's
mental calm and stability. And, and the mental stability of the mind takes the
form of the mind not jumping around a lot. It doesn't change subjects a lot. And
that's one of the reasons why concentration is a useful practice, where
we choose one thing and kind of hang out with it and stay with it so that it's an
antidote to the mind jumping around and picking up new subjects and racing
after things. And for some people, breathing is a nice concentration
practice. And kind of just stay with a breath and just stay there and stay there,
maybe count the breath in order to begin settling and relaxing the agitation of
the mind, the jumping around the mind. So the mind gathers together, it becomes
settled on one thing. Every time you let go of your thoughts and come back to the
breathing in an incremental, maybe small way, you are letting go of some of the
energy to keep thinking those thoughts. And slowly, slowly by letting go many
times, many times, coming back and staying with focus on the breath, that the
agitated energy that keeps us thinking begins to quiet down. The force, the
interest, the fascination, or whatever it might be. And the mind, as the mind
becomes more stable, it tends to become clearer, more clarity. And at some point
it's just easy to be here because the mind is so stable that we don't get
pushed around by things. It's like ballast of a boat. The boat doesn't capsize
because it has this strong keel, heavy keel. At some point when we're really
centered in our body and the mind is stable, then all kinds of things can
happen and we're not troubled by it. We're gonna stay stable, we can stay on
course. And then there's a deeper stability, stability of the heart where
the heart doesn't feel anxious about things. The heart feels like it's really
here and at rest, at peace, settled with itself. And that maybe is kind of an
emotional stability. And when there's kind of a deep inner sense of being
stable and settled, still, soft, begins to happen, there's an interesting thing
that can happen with the problems of our life that we're struggling with, that we
might have all kinds of things we think are big issues and that we have to fix
them and solve them and do things with them. But with enough stability, and some
of the other things we're cultivating like happiness and well-being and confidence,
sometimes the things we think we need to have happen are things that have to stop
or be fixed. We see it from a different perspective and we realize we
don't have to be so concerned about it. They're not that important after all.
There's something else that's much more important. What's more important and
more valuable is the sense of well-being, of peace, of stability, of really being
here. It's one of the great pleasures of life to have an ability to have awareness,
attention, stable, doesn't want to go off and run away and feel the goodness of
that, feel how satisfying that is, to feel that, why would I leave this to talk
about the resentments I have at work one more time? You know, I've done this 10,000
time of resentment thoughts and, you know, it didn't get me anywhere and it
takes me away from this feeling of wholeness and goodness and being really
here, rooted in the present moment as if the present moment is home, present
moment is where I belong. And so, you know, those thoughts about resentment
just don't have any value. Maybe I don't have to solve the problem. Maybe I can
just, maybe I just let it go or let it drift away or let it dissolve. With
practice, sometimes our problems don't get solved, they get dissolved. And that
goes against the grain, against the current of how the mind often thinks,
where I think, you know, it thinks that there's a problem, I have to fix it,
there's a danger, I have to make myself safe. And when we go against the
stream, we discover some inherently good place of practice, of stability, of
inner wholeness, of collectedness, and the contrast teaches us this is where to
be and those other things seemed really important in the agitated state. But now
that I'm an agitated, they don't seem so important anymore. And I think I just
think they're overrated. And that's one of the things that can happen with
practice. So be forewarned that you'll discover that many of your concerns
are overrated. And that's good news. And then there's more ease with them, more
relaxation, more letting go, less concern with them, less trouble by them, and less
bothered by them, or give, we give them less authority over our lives.
So one of the ways of cultivating stability in the retreat, there's many
ways. One of the ways is to be as simple at the retreat as you can. Don't try to
do a lot. Some people come and retreat and have the whole agenda of things they
want to do. This is that place where they're going to finally get their
eating in order. This is the place where they're going to really finally, they
can't do yoga at home, but this is the place they're going to start their yoga
practice and really get into it, you know, and really get good. Or you know,
some people come with long lists, the books they're going to read.
Get enough exercise and I'm going to do, you know, this couldn't do much meditation
at home for the last year, but so I'm going to do all the different
meditation practice I've ever ever read about from this retreat, and you know,
just go through the list, I have, you know, check, check, check, you know.
But yes, don't do a lot. One of the ways to become stable is trust the practice, do
the practice, have the continuity of practice that Ines talked about. And live
a very simple life so the mud can settle. Be very simple so that you're not
reinforcing the agitation by doing a lot. And even though, you know, so try to do
as simple and quiet as you can be, as reasonable. Of course you have to do
things, and of course there's doing some things which are settling. It might be
after a meal that's very settling to go for a walk and run the grounds or
something. But the principle of being simple, as simple as you can, and is one
way. Another way of developing stability is a little harder to do
automatically or just because you hear about it, but it really helps a lot if
you can pull it off to not be bothered by anything. And in particular,
don't be bothered by anything you think. You don't even be bothered by the
fact that you're thinking. And this is one of the great advices that I heard
when I was at Tassahara. Someone gave the advice, when you meditate, don't be
bothered by your thoughts. And I found that was so wonderful. It was a lot
easier to have the thoughts settle and get quiet when I wasn't bothered by
them. And what I discovered was that by being bothered by them, I was
actually fueling them. And actually, because it's actually giving them
energy to keep thinking. And so it's kind of a keto thing. If you want
your thoughts to settle or not think those things, just let them be and
don't be bothered by them. But all kinds of things, don't be bothered. Don't
get agitated. Try not to get worked up. Try to stay quiet. And then also try not
to look for trouble. That's one of the reasons why you're not
supposed to look at your devices on retreat. People have told me
that they've had to look at their device and something or other. I just
had to look at it one email. But then I noticed this other one. And it took me
two days to settle down. Literally. Because they get this message in
this ripe situation of the retreat. They get the message from someone. And
it's like, you know, I wish I didn't look. So don't go looking for things.
Be very careful that you don't kind of go searching for things. They
come agitating to agitate you. And then consider for yourself, in your
situation, what inner landscape, what inner way of being, could you bring on
to be supportive and helpful for you so that you can kind of settle down. Be more
settled. Be more stable. Be more rooted. Be more grounded. Not because you're kind
of, you know, forcing yourself to be that way. But what level, you know, what
inner, what attitude of mind, what approach and feeling and relationship to
your experience, could you kind of cultivate and bring about that would
help you kind of just really be here. Really in this place. Today, this hour,
this minute, that the world that you're in is the world of the present moment.
Not the world of tomorrow or yesterday or fantasy. But to really to be here, when
you're standing at the meal, the buffet table to serve your food, to really be
there with your plate, with your food, with serving yourself, as opposed to
being there and looking at what everybody else is serving themselves. That
person's take talked too much. And I can't believe that person took so little.
And, you know, that's not settling. That's agitating. But if it's just you and
your tofu, you know, just, you know, you and your plate and the serving utensils
and the tofu. And so when you put your spatula into the tofu, you feel the
softness of it and you feel the texture of it in the wonderful brown sauce and,
you know, just you and the sauce and what comes up. And, you know, just like, that's
a simple world. It's complicated enough. But, you know, it's a lot simpler than
what other people are doing with their tofu. So to get really here, simple, just
this moment, this experience, you'll find that that's the door to greater and
greater stability, steadiness, subtleness. That your system, your psychophysical
system, actually wants to move towards steadiness, stability, stillness. Because
to not be that is to, is to be, is to, is takes work and effort and agitation. That's
the direction it wants to go. So what can you do to support that direction? What
can you do to make space, to make room for the natural momentum the body has to
relax and settle? And one of the ways you can do is to be present in the
simplicity of this moment, here, now, this experience, walking down the steps, just
walking down the steps, that experience, walking across the community room floor,
just walking, not walking and thinking about which form of tea you're gonna
have today. Don't, don't think about tea until you get to the tea, just the walking.
And then when you get to the tea, just the tea. It's a simple life, it goes
against the stream of being sophisticated, you know, and having wonderful
thoughts and planning everything out or doing things. But trusting, trusting the
simplicity of the moment, simplicity of just being here for this experience,
trusting the value of just here. These are great ways of cultivating stability,
stillness, softness, steadiness, so that we get the vantage point, stable, still
vantage point, in order to watch how thoroughly our present moment experience
is flowing, unfolding and changing moment by moment. And that's the topic of in
some days. Finally, thank you very much for your practice today. It's not easy to
do this kind of practice, especially the first day. I have tremendous respect for
what people are up against, the challenges, and you all are here and still
here, and I feel very appreciative of you, and just wanted to express my gratitude
for what you're doing. In a few minutes we'll post, actually it's already posted,
the sign-ups for the practice discussion for the next two days. The way it
works is there's enough slots for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow for
everyone to have one practice discussion, one meeting with either Inez or
not. Either Inez or I. There's 43 of all of you, there's 43 spots up there. So don't
sign up for more than one, then you'll take someone else's spot too. Don't do
Inez and I. Just do one or the other. And we'd like to see everyone, and
please sign up today before, maybe before 7.45, the 7.45 sitting, because we
have to sort through it and then just be prepared to meet with you
tomorrow. So we need a little bit of time for that. So if you can do that, then
everyone sign up by 7.45 and make sure you sign up for a spot that doesn't
conflict with your work meditation or bell ringing or something. And then
whichever one you sign up for, for this round, in the next round you'll see the
other teacher. And so you'll see both of us. What we'll do is we'll simply cross
out our names, and like I'll cross out Gil and put Inez there, and cross
out Inez and put Gil there. So you're exactly the same time. Everything's, you
know, just the same in the next round of two days. So hopefully that makes sense.
And try not to get agitated about signing up. Thank you.
