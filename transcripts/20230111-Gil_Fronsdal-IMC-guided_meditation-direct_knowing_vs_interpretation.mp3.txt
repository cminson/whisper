 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Today I have the good fortune of being able to go between these two wonderful meditation centers. This is the home center. Happy to be back and happy to be with you here. People associate Buddhism with truth often, what's called the Four Noble Truths. Sometimes put those at the center of Buddha's teachings. That's fine, but in terms of practice, what is repeated over and over again in the teachings of the Buddha, much more often than any reference to truth, which is knowing and seeing. Perhaps knowing and seeing are meant to be an alternative way of talking about knowing and seeing truth. We want to be able to see and know what's happening in our direct experience. One of the things to distinguish is what's directly known and seen, that we can really verify through our direct experience. What is our interpretation? What is the value we put on something? What's the meaning we assign to it? What meaning do we assign it to ourselves? What do we make up about ourselves in relationship to experience? The interpretation, the meaning, the purpose, the value, they certainly have a place in this world and practice, it's important, but we want to really see the difference between the direct experience and the added layers we put on. Then we sit down to do meditation, mindfulness meditation. We want to emphasize the directness, what we can know, what we can know directly. It's possible to know directly that we are adding meaning, we are adding layers of interpretation, we are adding values, judgments, commentary, projections into the future, associations of what we have in the past. There's layers and complexity of all the stuff that we add that's extra. Even if it has some value and important to do so, it's still not the same thing as direct experience. When we sit, we want to become sensitive to this so that we can prioritize direct experience when we're meditating. After meditation, there might be time for a deep contemplation, deep reflection about meaning and purpose and contextualizing what's happened. But for meditation, we want to try to keep it really simple, as if what we can know and see directly, that's the door forward in the Dharma. That's where we can begin freeing ourselves from the layers of reactivity, free ourselves from the layer of cloudiness, the filters through which we see. It's the way in which we can see more clearly what's happening and in doing so become wiser. So in this meditation, you might do the basic meditation, mindfulness of breathing, being here in the present moment, but keep an eye out from the difference between the simplicity of the direct experience and what we add to it, meaning, interpretation, even something as simple as, you know, are we at the end yet? Boy, this is taking a long time. Or Gil is talking a lot. All that is commentary and it's nothing wrong necessarily, but oh, there's the commentary. This is not the direct experience. The immediacy of it is just like Gil talking, just a voice talking and sound happening. The breathing as you breathe and if your mind wanders off a lot, the idea that I'm a poor meditator, that's an interpretation. That's a made up layer on top of it. And the immediacy, what we can see directly, this is so simple and sometimes, and this is the relief that can come from it, is so simple that we're freed from the weight of these interpretations. So if the mind wanders off a lot in thought, then we see, oh, the mind is wandering off. It's that simple. And even the idea that it's doing it a lot means that it's higher level of interpretation based on history, based on what we remember, the repetition of it all. In the moment, what we can see and know, the mind is involved in thinking. Let's bring it back. That simple can be a relief. So to become sensitive to how you leave direct experience and then return to what can be known and seen, known and perceived directly here and now. So assuming a meditation posture, and the beginning of knowing and seeing directly in our own experience, you should do so in our physical posture. Maybe moving a little bit, twisting, rocking a little bit. To really feel and sense ourselves into an aligned, balanced, good posture. Slowly closing the eyes. And as already now, just sitting here like this, are you telling yourself stories, interpretation about what's happening, how it is for you and how you are? Are you judging or evaluating or you interpreting? Even if it's accurate, it is not the same thing as direct experience if we're seeing through the lens of those interpretations. If we see interpretation as interpretation, then we're back to the world of direct knowing. And then gently taking some long, slow, deep breaths. Relaxing on the exhale. Feeling the breathing return to normal and continue to relax on the exhale, anywhere in the body where you feel holding. Relaxing. And then centering yourself on your breathing. To the direct experience of an inhale, knowing how it's felt and known through the body. Knowing and seeing, knowing perceiving the exhale. What's known in the body. Do you think thoughts or feelings that interpret, react, assign meaning, assign a future? So recognize it as such and come back taking refuge in the direct experience. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. When you are more involved in thinking than with breathing, chances are as you're involved in the story making mind, the interpretive mind, the planning mind, you're involved, you've lost the touch with the breathing, the direct experience, perception. With whatever energy or capacity you have to think, direct it instead to knowing and perceiving breathing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. If you're telling stories or interpretations or thinking about something, perhaps it's something deep inside that needs to be reassured. It's okay for now. And then to find a refuge, a place of safety for a few minutes in the simplicity of direct experience here breathing in your body. Just knowing what is actually happening here without story interpretation. Relaxing. Relaxing. Relaxing. And as we come to the end of the meditation, how simply can you now open your heart to the wider world? Open your thoughts to simply know or sense or have a general idea of the people of your life, people you know, the people you don't know, people you'll learn about today or meet. And to perhaps aspire to the best of your ability to know them directly without the lens of our interpretations and stories and judgments, values, meaning, futures and pasts. Just to be with a person in their basic, simple way, humanity of the moment. And to have goodwill. To wish them well. A kind of wellness, simple safety, stability, contentment. Where being happy, being well, brings out the best in people. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may it be that the way that we are together with others makes it more likely for them to feel some happiness and safety, some peace, some freedom. May we be a refuge for others. Thank you.
