 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. Okay, all right. So, let's begin. By arriving together and acknowledging that this is a sangha. We practice together, not alone, fellow human beings who support us. By showing up, we support them and by their showing up, they support us. There's a sweetness in that. There's such a sweetness in that. If I was just here alone, staring to the camera, talking to imaginary people, it would be very different from me, just so that I share that with you. As I look and see your faces, that just warms my heart. You guys are welcome, actually, to put it on gallery views so that you can see each other. It's quite sweet to get a sense of, yeah, the sangha that has assembled. These wonderful beings were coming together to just practice and support each other, support each other just by your presence. So, I'll weave this theme into our meditation tonight. And yeah, without further ado, let's begin. Let's sit together. So, arriving in your body, seeing what your body needs, if it needs to shift and move a little bit, if the shoulders need to be rolled back a little bit, maybe side to side, the whole body to find your center of gravity. Ahh, arriving and settling, arriving and settling in this body. Here I am here. Breathing our feet on the earth, sit bones on cushion, our hands on our lap. Ahh, this body alive and breathing. What's happening right now internally? I can go from living inside your body and in this body. You can't go to sleep because you're resting. You just want to be on your head because you're almost Importance, Not*** privileged to really be being alive as a experience of your life. for the first time. Relaxing, relaxing the body and receiving, receiving the sensations. Receiving the sensations with interest, with openness of heart. As if you're opening your heart, your home, making space, welcoming all sensations. And your awareness is so welcoming. It welcomes everything, it welcomes every sensation, feeling, whether they're pleasant, unpleasant, or neither, whether they're familiar, the sensations of the breath. Or notice for the first time, perhaps, differently, your awareness is kind, welcomes, welcomes everything. Opens the door, come, come, there's space for you too, come.

and welcome meeting a couple of fellow practitioners, yes, hi there's enough room in my Zoom square for a couple of you, come, hi welcome, so be a gracious host to each other let's try that on for Sai, that's when the rubber meets the road, so opening up, hi the sense of hospitality to each other, what if we meet each other as gracious hosts, our awareness meet each other as gracious hosts we're all welcoming each other into our spaces, you know we're all welcoming each other into our homes, in a way you know, with our backgrounds and it's a very intimate thing, we're not at a meditation center when everybody comes together we're all coming to each other's homes, so in a way it's like oh, take a moment when you go into small groups maybe go around first and welcome, just each person will welcome the other person, welcome to my home, welcome to my space and just go around and just the sense of welcoming, just welcoming each other and so that would be the first round meeting, meeting each other with welcoming, with a sense of kindness and see what might arise there might be playfulness, right, the playfulness of meeting the unexpected we never know what's going to happen in the next moment, and then go another round, again each person can share something, don't direct, don't ask questions just show up, show up with your kindness, with your hospitality hello, welcome and if you like, you can share something about how this practice was for you, maybe just a nugget maybe just 30 seconds and then the next person and the next person, that would be the second round, or you can say pass, so the first round you welcome each other to your space and have fun with it, this is kind of why not, I don't know if you've ever done that before on Zoom yeah, well welcome to my home I have a virtual background, but hey welcome, welcome to my space welcome to my virtual Zoom space so so have fun with it, how lovely it is to be able to practice with others so excuse me okay so I have created the room, the Zoom rooms, and invite you all to to take care of each other with kindness, and here we go opening all the rooms we have time for a couple of reflections, especially if you have not spoken recently, invite you to pull forward, if you've spoken pull back, make space for others so what was it like, the meditation, you can reflect on that, and the aha moments challenges, and also how was how was welcoming each, being a gracious host to each other, with kindness meeting each, greeting each other with kindness you can also put your reflections in chat if you wish if you type them to everyone, I'll read your name, if you just type them to me then I'll, it'll be private, Jamie says we had a love party, oh my god that is so sweet
