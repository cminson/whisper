How's the sound? Yeah? A little low? Yeah? A little low. 
A little low. 
How are we now? Okay? Okay. 
A little higher. 
No, it's good. 
It's good. 
It's good. 
I should not have asked. 
So welcome. 
Thanks for having me. 
Yeah, it's nice to sit with you. 
So this is a talk that Michelle McDonald gave, and she's describing this interaction with, I think it's her great niece, and Michelle has a meditation teacher in Hawaii and teaches a long-term teacher at IMS, and she has a bad back, and so the way that she described picking up her niece was that her niece would run and jump onto Michelle's back, because the gesture of actually lifting was too much, but if she jumped, it was okay. 
So this is Michelle. 
So she, the great niece, Brenna, is a little over 50 pounds. 
I don't really have the ability to lift her up. 
She's running towards me, and I don't see the backpack on her, just to let you know also to set the stage. 
It was pouring rain and really cold out, really pouring rain, and we were right at the doorway to leave the school, where a lot of parents and kids are running around, and she's running at me, and I say, jump, and I pick her up, and I'm like, wow. 
I always think I can do anything. 
Carrying her out, I open the door, and I have a moment, and it's not a moment of willingness. 
I feel that cold air, and I want my hood on, so I say, Brenna, why don't you put my hood on so I don't get cold? She puts my hood on, and she puts it on over my eyes like a kid will do, so I'm like, uh-oh. 
And I go out, and I get outside, and I don't know that the step is a gradual step, and I start to take this fall, and you know how everything slows down when you're taking a fall. 
The difference between everything going fine and everything not going fine is so thin. 
This is a Nietzsche. 
So I start to slip, and I really fell, swirling around, and we both fell. 
I got a pretty good scrape. 
I ripped my favorite pants. 
But what was worse was that I was worried she was going to be embarrassed. 
I was going for this fall, and I could feel all the places in her mind that she was going to go, and the worst part was embarrassment. 
So I decided to just act like nothing really happened. 
So I just jumped up with her, and I said, Brenna, that was a good job. 
And I really meant it, and she looked at me like my aunt is nuts. 
So I took her mind off the embarrassment, but then I really praised her, and I meant it. 
And I thought, if she hadn't completely flowed with that experience, I would have been in serious trouble. 
So she just trusted me and went with the fall so beautifully. 
She didn't get hurt at all. 
You know how you can protect a kid more than yourself. 
It was magnificent. 
Do you relate to your falls like that? Do you relate to the difficult times in practice like that? Is there some voice in you that says, wow, you did a really good job with that fall? So maybe 15 years ago, I was sitting a retreat with Shinzen Young, and we were in a kind of part of the retreat. 
There's a guided meditation followed by some dialogue, and somebody gave a very great report, like how her meditation was going, and it was like glowing. 
And as I'm listening, and it was, I think, a two-week retreat, and as I'm listening to this and I'm just hearing how well things are going, my heart is sinking. 
Like just unadulterated envy. 
And I really, you know, there was no sense of muddhita, of sympathetic joy, of like delighting in the spiritual flourishing of my fellow yogi, you know. 
It was just like the comparing mind was just the only thing in consciousness, really. 
And that was a function of the fact that there was this kind of longing for the Dharma, longing to understand my mind, to know what was possible, to know how deeply the heart could rest, how expansive the mind could be. 
There was a very sincere wish for that, but it was all bound up with a lot of egoic clinging, where I was trying to turn myself into this spiritual being, and in a certain way, anyone else's experience was a potential threat. 
And that's just the folly and the agony of the comparing mind. 
And so the kind of envy of that moment, it really is like everything in our practice, it's teaching us, yeah, in the sense that the envy highlights the architecture of self-view. 
To actually understand the places of clinging, the ways in which I get fixated on who I am and what makes me of value, the envy is a kind of spotlight on the structure, the architecture of that. 
And so I'm sitting there and it was intense enough that I don't usually raise my hand, but I've raised my hand and I reported on my experience, yeah? And so it was just like I gave, and I was quite settled and concentrated myself, so I gave like a blow-by-blow experience of the kind of agonizing, comparing mind and envy and all of this. 
And so the teacher said, with respect to the envy, to that experience, which is arising and passing in real time, his instruction was love that envy to death, yeah? Love it to death. 
So what does that mean? To love it to death. 
That might well be the mantra of Vipassana practice, actually, yeah? So elsewhere, Shinsen said, to have a complete experience is to love something to death and to know it to death, whether it's yourself or any sensory event, big or small. 
When you love it to death and know it to death, you're too busy experiencing it to make an object out of it. 
So in a sense, it's not there. 
But it's not there because you're so busy knowing it, so it's more there. 
It's both more there and less there than normal human experience. 
A kind of completeness and a kind of nothingness at exactly the same time. 
The things that cause us pain in this life, we generally try to hate them to death, yeah? We know that experience. 
And in a certain way, even with our own kind of spiritual evolution or psychological evolution, we're repeating that same pattern. 
So one of my friends, Vinnie Ferraro, says, like, you can't hate yourself into becoming a better person, yeah? How hard have we tried that one, yeah? So in spiritual practice, we want to look at how we turn ourselves into a kind of battleground, me versus my ego, me versus my emotions, me, the spiritual self versus my animal self. 
And this dynamic of hating something to death, it arises in a lot of different ways, and we turn awareness into this kind of battleground, but awareness has no enemies. 
There are no enemies in experience. 
And so we're actually moving the heart-mind in the direction of loving it to death. 
So I would hear, of course, you know, Matthew, you don't need to practice in this way. 
You don't need to turn your inner life into this kind of battleground and allow the clinging to kind of flavor the trajectory of practice. 
And I would hear that, but I really wouldn't totally believe it, you know? Like, I kind of believe it, but there was a part of me that just felt like somehow, unless I was doing some kind of battle, spiritual practice wasn't advancing, yeah? So we have to learn these lessons in our own time. 
We have to kind of cling and suffer our way into freedom, yeah? So some of what we're learning to do in this is to develop a certain kind of grace and patience and wisdom with respect to the peaks and valleys of spiritual life, yeah? And this is most evident on retreat, on silent, intensive retreat, but it can be discerned in our ordinary daily life, the peaks and valleys of practice. 
And it feels so much like the peaks are the point, yeah? The peaks are the point of practice. 
But the truth is that the peaks and the valleys and the ascent and the descent are the point of practice, yeah? That takes a long time to trust, yeah? And I'm so familiar with that feeling of the descent, yeah? There's some peace or clarity or goodness or love or the mind is open, life feels complete, nothing's left out, and then there's this slow decay of the mindfulness, yeah? The descent begins, and it's like, no! Please no! And we like scramble and grapple and try to claw our way back up that descent even as our like fingernails are like making marks down the side of the mountain, you know? And it's like there's no way this is the point of practice, there's no way. 
That's the point, yeah? That's the point of practice. 
But it's not. 
Each point on that kind of roller coaster ride of peak and valley and descent and ascent, each place on there has something to offer the heart, yeah? We have to actually open in a certain way to learn from every place along that continuum. 
Now sometimes nothing we do works, yeah? It's like we do everything we can to re-establish a certain balance or to open in some way to be nourished by this particular moment of practice and nothing, it feels like nothing is working, yeah? And that too, of course, is a Dharma experience, yeah? Namely the experience of helplessness, which we miss. 
We miss the moment, oh, this is what helplessness feels like. 
And in the pantheon of like most aversive human experiences there are, that's up there, yeah? And sometimes we won't have the energy to do it, but the kind of learning on offer in those moments is to actually, for the heart to be softened, humbled in a more radical way. 
Nothing's working, yeah? And a kind of a deeper love can grow out of this, yeah? When the ego's like all out of moves. 
Sajjan Sajjito. 
Many people have acceptance issues, sometimes very strong, but I would suggest that we all have acceptance issues, I have acceptance issues. 
Being a self is extremely busy, to my mind, uncomfortable. 
You really have to cultivate this intentionality above all just to have the deep loving acceptance of the mess of it all. 
Without taking it that this is something wrong with you especially, we're all in the mess on the self level. 
Some of us are better at handling it than others, some of us less deeply, tragically wounded by it, but we're all in that slightly fragile state and there's a sense of real loving acceptance. 
This is about as open as you can be right now. 
Okay, that's fine. 
This is about as grounded as you can be right now. 
This is about as quiet as you can be right now. 
Just keep sensing that quality of caring and loving. 
These resonances do keep washing through and they begin to reassure and calm. 
And we find, ah, here's the ground. 
The ground is in the quality of loving acceptance, not in myself or my strategies, but in the loving acceptance of myself and my strategies. 
The model of practice in this world of mindfulness of a Pasana has been alluding to these cycles. 
Michelle uses the language of purity and purification, peaks and then some kind of descent. 
And in a way, it's the peak, it's the clarity, it's the openness, it's the love that actually makes more room for what is unresolved in the heart to arise. 
And there's this kind of rhythm through which we kind of spiral down or up with developing grace with what the moment, what practice looks like now. 
What does practice look like now? And we have so many reference points of what that looked like last sit or yesterday or last year or the last breath. 
But instead, we're actually developing this kind of commitment to just learning being softened by life no matter what is arising. 
And this process of spiraling, it like keeps going until we're more and more free, until there's less and less that can kind of ambush the heart-mind. 
And in this process, of course, to love it to death, this is about love. 
Love in the spirit of Martin Luther King's spirit of non-violence directed inwards too. 
So in a way, we're investing love, we're beginning with love and growing love in the process. 
Jessamine Ward said, a spiritual awakening which does not awaken the sleeper to love has aroused them in vain. 
And love is said to be the kind of glue of the world. 
Like sometimes you're just reflecting on what it's like in the absence of love, the ways things disintegrate and fracture and harm is done. 
And so love is said to be the kind of glue of the world. 
And so to love something to death is, it's not necessarily to like it. 
We usually think about, there's like hating and liking and really liking and then we get to love. 
And it's all on the same spectrum. 
But we're not actually trying to re-engineer our preferences. 
What you like and what you dislike is, that's not a battle you want to pick, exactly. 
That's deep, but we can not like something but love it. 
We can not like the descent into some new phase of purification in practice, but we can love it. 
And this actually generates, this is the kind of the indirect path to love. 
Like to open with equanimity to difficulty. 
The kind of byproduct of that is more and more love. 
So what do we love to death? We love certain habits to death. 
So we see we're getting caught in some way. 
We want to do something the same way we always do. 
We want to tell ourselves the same story. 
We want to act out the same pattern. 
And just the willingness to stay is the beginning of the transformation of a habit. 
The directive, the kind of order from the habit is to do something and we just stay. 
And that requires a kind of patience with like this unfurling of a kind of tightly bound wire in our own body, mind. 
It usually means a kind of developing some equanimity with feeling. 
Because the habit, it kind of blackmails us into action and its trump card is feeling. 
And so we're actually learning just to stay. 
That's how we begin to love a habit to death. 
We love our past to death. 
Elie Wiesel from kind of recollections of the Holocaust surviving, but much of his family, Diane, wrote, in the end it is all about memory, its sources and its magnitude and of course its consequences. 
In some ways the present moment is composed of the past, the totality of the past. 
We sit down and all we talk about being present, but to be present in a certain sense is to have equanimity with the past. 
To make room in the heart for all of the kind of karmic streams to enter into this moment and to bless them with awareness. 
And so there's an important sense in which practice is this kind of transformation of the past, a transformation of the momentum of the past, and a way in which we come to a deeper sense of completion with the past. 
So psychiatrist Irvin Yellum said something like, I think you described therapeutic success as giving up hope for a better past, which is a good line. 
There's another way in which the past is not accessed but constructed and reconstructed. 
It's not like we reach into this file drawer and there are these perfectly encoded memories. 
In a certain way, how memory gets encoded is a function of our delusion in that moment. 
How we construe things and then how we reconstruct our past in part is a function of the level of delusion in the moment that we actually were not able to see that experience with the Dharma eye. 
That we perceived it to some extent through the prism of the Kilesas, of greed, hatred, delusion. 
And what this means is that it often feels like memory gets like a certain way in which it's locked in at that particular level of development in our own wisdom and love. 
And so there's this aspect of practice as we begin to actually bless our past with wisdom and love, that there's a sense of the past is actually being transformed. 
Philip Roth said, we don't just forget things because they don't matter but we also forget things because they matter too much. 
Each of us remembers and forgets in a pattern whose labyrinthine windings are an identification mark no less distinctive than a fingerprint. 
We acclimatize to our autobiography, this story we've told and retold, and it's so much like the water that we swim in that sometimes even just a glimpse, even just like a sense of that opening can be liberating in some way. 
Just a sense of becoming a little bit unconvinced by your autobiography, becoming a little bit more mysterious to yourself. 
And Dharma practice is a way in which we do, we come to be slightly alienated from our autobiographies and to actually begin to love our past to death. 
And in that process, the sense of who we are, of where we've come from, of what our past even is, changes. 
It's like, here we are, we're sitting, trying to mind our own business, and there it is. 
There's that memory, there's that habit, there's that very familiar autobiographical trope. 
And we love it to death. 
It's like blessing the past with wisdom and love. 
Because we couldn't have, we misconstrued the memories that really get lodged in the heart mind. 
They're sort of calling out for our attention. 
It feels like something undigested in the same way that we eat something, and it's too big a meal for us to digest. 
And our life in a certain way has been too big for us to digest. 
Just because any human life at times is more intense than we can handle. 
Just being human, in a sense, is a little bit more intense than we can handle. 
That's the first noble truth. 
And so we have this, things come up, and if we sit enough, if we actually get still and quiet, everything undigested comes up, pleading with us to be loved to death. 
And so we bless all our former selves with the Dharma. 
We forgive all of them. 
In this process we are, you could say, loving the self to death. 
So in Buddhism the self is not a thing but an experience, a process that arises and passes in the same way that sound arises and passes. 
And to love the self to death is to actually see what feels like the ground of my being, to see that as a rising, flowing experience. 
And then the philosopher described as self as the center of narrative gravity. 
The center of narrative gravity. 
And he said, like in physics or whatever, there's center of gravity is not an actual point. 
It's a kind of abstraction, useful for sure, but an abstraction. 
And he says, there's something very potent about that description, the sense of self as the center of narrative gravity. 
It's like the point to which it feels like the ground of our being, but it's actually experience, in nature, impermanent, but it creates the, when it's not seen with clarity, when it's not loved to death, it creates the sense of being outside of experience, of being a person. 
And the density of self varies dramatically. 
We start to get more still. 
We love the self to death in that moment with the eruption of envy that I began with. 
It's like, okay, to love it to death. 
So there's not just the envy, but there's this elaborate sense of self making of autobiographical debris that's getting kicked up in that moment. 
We love it to death. 
And so in this sense, there's a kind of continuum from self harshness that moves more and more towards something like self acceptance, self love. 
And then we just keep loving the self more and more deeply, and we know anatta, not self. 
Self hatred is a kind of friction and preoccupation. 
And we like start, okay, how can we love this experience? How can we love this experience? Love it to death. 
And we start to come into, over time, a more kind of gentle relationship with our own self. 
And the attention gets more precise and more quiet. 
And then the actual components, the experiences that create the sense of I amness, we love that also to death. 
No conflict between loving the self and forgetting the self. 
So offer that for your consideration. 
Thank you.
