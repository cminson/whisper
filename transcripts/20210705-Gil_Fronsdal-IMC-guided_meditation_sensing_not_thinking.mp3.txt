 Good day to everyone and good beginning of the week. Here we are to sit quietly, here we are to let the thinking mind become quieter so that we're less involved in our thinking than we are involved in our inner life, involved with subtleness and stillness, involved with a place where it's peaceful, a place of inner happiness, inner pleasure, that maybe is more available if we don't keep flowing along in the rivers of thoughts, the streams of thinking that we could spin out on. So to begin this journey to a more settled place, to assume a posture that allows you to settle, whatever works for you given your situation, and some people find it helpful to close the eyes or if the eyes are open not really to look at anything, almost as if the eyes are resting in their sockets and the eyes are looking backwards and down and then taking a few long slow deep breaths and these long slow deep breaths can be done leisurely, can be done in a way where if possible you enjoy it, it feels pleasant. So doing it at a speed and to the extent that it's nice for you to breathe in fully and to allow the diaphragm to do its full release. The work of breathing when the diaphragm, the work is done on the inhale as a diaphragm is pushed down and the exhale is a release, a letting go of that pushing down diaphragm releases and pulls itself upward. And on the exhale releasing other places in your body as well, relaxing, maybe a global relaxation throughout the body. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And ever so slightly can you adjust the normal breathing so that you are, so it's a little bit more pleasant to breathe. So to let yourself become attuned, sensitive to any form of pleasure or nice feeling that comes with breathing. Maybe there's a little section of the inhale that feels nice or a certain section of the exhale. And if there is any pleasure or comforting feeling with breathing, allow yourself to feel that in such a way that your thinking mind becomes quieter or allow the thinking mind to be quieter so you can better sense and feel the physicality of breathing. And whatever physical sensations that are enjoyable, pleasant. Breathing in and breathing out. As you exhale, relaxing more in your body, maybe almost as if you as you relax, you settle into breathing more. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Feeling the thinking mind and dropping into whatever is pleasant in your body. Just a simple pleasantness of being alive or vibrating body, the hum of vitality in your body. And breathe with that pleasantness. Even if there's other places that are painful, breathe with a pleasantness of the physicality of your body. Letting the thinking mind become quieter so you're in the stream of sensations in your body more than the stream of your thinking. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Being careful not to flow in the stream of thinking. Even the subtle background thinking that creeps in from the sides or from the back door. And if you are thinking very quietly, think about your breathing. Think about the pleasant experiences that are here and now in the experience of breathing. Not so you get carried away in thought, but so your thinking becomes simpler and simpler. And your awareness more and more attuned with the body breathing. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Noticing if you are flowing in the stream of thinking or if you're grounded in your body, in your breathing. With an awareness that might be aware that you're thinking, but the awareness is not flowing along in the thinking. Sometimes even the awareness, present moment awareness gets lost, submerged in the river of thoughts. And as we come to the end of this sitting, we can be submerged in the river of thoughts when we're with other people. So involved in thinking about what to say or what they're saying or our concerns about the situation. Or our awareness can be clear and present so that we can really offer attentive attention to our people we're with. So that our attention is more with the people we're with than it is lost, submerged in the flow of our thinking. And there's a way of offering attention, listening, seeing to really understand and be present for others in a fuller way. Maybe sometimes offering quiet so the other person can has a chance to express themselves and say what needs to be said. What we learn in meditation about not being swept away in thought can translate to be more present for others. And if we're more present, it's easier to care for others to feel their humanity, their suffering, their joys. And may it be that this practice that we do together allows us to offer the gift of attention to others. And from that gift, maybe other thing we provide other gifts, kindness, friendliness, care, love. May the benefits of this practice spread from us out into the world for the welfare and happiness of all beings. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. May all beings be free.
