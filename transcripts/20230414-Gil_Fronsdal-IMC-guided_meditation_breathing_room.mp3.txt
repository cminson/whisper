The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So good morning everyone and welcome. Good day. I trust that you can hear me.
And here I am the last day here at IRC and you know I haven't seen much of it
except for this the altar and me sitting here but I do feel very kind of
content and happy to introduce you to IRC for those you've never been here, kind
of have you here in a sense. So one of the wonderful expressions that I
like is the two words together breathing room and since I do a lot of my time
connected to my breathing meditation throughout the day as I go about things
kind of second nature for me to stay connected to breathing. The idea of
breathing room having room to breathe such a you know I think it's the sense
of relief that people can have and a space you know to have a lot more
personal space and we feel claustrophobic and feel really nice to be in a
large vast natural setting where it seems that the vastness of the setting
can hold all who we are without any judgment that maybe in some ways I've
been in some settings where it's vast natural settings where I felt
simultaneously very small like a small little piece of this universe and the
same time kind of acutely aware of being alive and the sensations and the body
being conscious being aware and being aware of it where there was lots of
space to be as I am and so meditation is a place to create space create room to
create time lots of time and maybe one definition of meditation is to give
ourselves infinite time as if we have all the time in the world as if there
is no time give ourselves all the space in the world as if there's no
limitation to the vast space in which we belong or which holds us or allows all
of us to be and one of the ways that Buddhism has kind of used this kind of
ideas is to liken awareness to space or to the sky and when birds fly through
the sky they don't leave any traces they don't disturb the sky the sky has
infinite room for the birds to fly through in a sense or if a rock gets
thrown through the air there it doesn't mind words go through the air the air
doesn't mind there's lots of space for it and so awareness is that way that
awareness is like space there's something about knowing sensing feeling
know that being aware that can be vast and open and lots of breathing room so
perhaps for this morning sitting there can be as we connect here and now to our
present moment experience maybe there can also be a sense of vast space lots of
breathing room for whatever is here in a sense not disturbed by anything not
bothered by anything not needing anything not wanting anything to be
different except to hold whatever is including desires and wants in vast
space so to begin
assuming a posture that maybe takes up more space than usual another way of
maybe saying being a little more erect and open in the chest and with an head
and neck that a little bit alert upright
gently closing the eyes and slowly gently expanding the torso as you breathe
in deep inhales making space becoming larger bigger lungs fill with air as the
diaphragm pushes down and the stomach out and releasing relaxing as you exhale
and letting the breathing return to normal
and as you inhale maybe you can see imagine that your awareness also expands
now with the inhale expands out to stretch and to meet wherever in your
body there is tension expand outward to touch caress tension tightness as if
it's no problem just being touched with the inhale with awareness and on the
exhale relaxing the tension softening in the body
breathing normally imagine that you have lots of breathing room in which to
breathe maybe there's a lot of space around your body and imagining that 2 3
4 5 feet distance from your body is a broad soft welcoming space into which
to breathe in breathe out
in exhaling exhaling and settling in relaxing in deeply into the body
in inhaling from the depths of your body outwards with the expansion of the
torso in the chest and inhale an expensive expansiveness that spreads
beyond the body even
sometimes the more the thinking mind relaxes quiet more space quiet
silent space there can be for the breathing room for all things that are
occurring in the present moment each thing allowed to be its own thing as it
comes and goes
wherever you're sitting now imagine the space around you between you and the
walls and the ceiling or if you're outside vast space beyond you and
however far away you can imagine the space in a certain kind of way that's the
distance how large the bubble of awareness is
in some movements of the mind contract the awareness sets limits on it boxes it
in and other movements of the mind open it expand it no limits the Buddha said
that greed box it limits the mind creates a limit about boundary to the mind
awareness generosity expands animosity boxes the mind in love expands it
without limit delusion narrows the mind wisdom makes awareness expensive
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to mention that the love the
compassion that can flow out of Buddhist practice is a love compassion that has
lots of room lots of breathing room so much room at some point it can hold all
the suffering of the world without being oppressed by it or troubled by it
and it's an amazing phenomena that the heart has the ability to be present for
suffering without being troubled it can be the opposite that if we practice and
mindful aware it's almost as if we're making more room all the room that's
needed and by not being troubled there's more opportunity more space in our hearts
to care to aspire to move into action to care and care for others care for
oneself to wish others well to love others may all beings be happy may all
beings be safe may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be
free and may those who can use companionship know that we accompany them
with our care good wishes our love they all beings be happy
you
Thank you.
Thank you.
