 Welcome, everyone, again. Welcome. Happy. So my first contact with Buddhism was through the Zen tradition, and I did many years of Zen practice. I first did the San Francisco Zen Center and at Tassajara, some of you might have been. And then I was ordained as a Zen priest at the Zen Center, and then I went to Japan, practiced in Japan for a year. And during that year in Japan, I spent ten weeks in Thailand where I was introduced to this particular form of Buddhist meditation that is called mindfulness practice in its most generic form. And the Buddhist word for it is vipassana, which is often translated as insight meditation. And I fell in love with this particular form of meditation during those ten weeks in Thailand. And partly because the mindfulness practice in Thailand seemed to me much more, had the tools, or gave me the techniques or methods or the understanding to help me bring a mindfulness practice, to bring in a practice of attention to all aspects of my life. And it wasn't so much certain aspects, it wasn't just about concentrating on one particular area of my life. But my full humanity was included within the spiritual practice. And that's what I was looking for. I was looking for a spiritual practice that didn't deny any part of me, didn't exclude any of it, saying this is unacceptable as a spiritual dimension of my life, but actually could infuse or apply everything, apply the spirituality to all areas of my life, or apply all areas of my life to my spirituality. Maybe it's a better way of saying it. So I really loved the mindfulness practice. And so then I went back to Southeast Asia and spent a year and a half training and studying in the Southeast Asian Buddhist tradition and doing the mindfulness practice there. And I came back to this country in mid-80s and continued some practice here. And then in the late 80s I was trained, in the early 90s, trained by Jack Kornfield to be a Vipassana teacher. And then in 1990 I became the teacher here in Palo Alto. There was a small sitting group in Palo Alto that met. And when I joined it there were about 12 people, 15 people who sat regularly. And since then we've slowly grown. And now our main meeting is on Mondays and there's often 80 to 100 people who come. And also, so I'm a Zen teacher, I'm also a mindfulness teacher at what I'm doing here, a Vipassana teacher. And I'm also, I don't know if it gives me more qualifications or less qualifications to teach you meditation, but I'm also a doctoral candidate in Buddhist studies at Stanford. And so I'm just finishing up there my dissertation. So that's my background. And I'm very delighted to see all of you here today. It's something I love doing. The mindfulness practice I'll be teaching you is something which I love very much. And it's actually a privilege and delight to be able to share it with other people, to share what I love. So I hope that some of my inspiration and joy in what this practice is contagious, or somehow is conveyed during these five weeks. So these five weeks will be spent giving the instructions for mindfulness practice systematically, kind of building one week to the next. And we could give the instructions for mindfulness very quickly. And traditionally in Southeast Asia, it's often given in half an hour. When I first came to a meditation retreat in Burma, they gave me, I showed up for instructions, and they gave me a cassette tape and a cassette player and said, go listen to this by yourself. And it had the instructions that in half an hour, I listened to this tape and got the instructions and off I went to my little room where I was supposed to practice in the monastery. And so it can be done that way, but I think maybe hearing it personally and orally is a little bit more useful. And what we found in America, it seems very useful to build instructions progressively over several weeks so that we get something very simple the first week, and we'll talk about the breath primarily. And then we build on that the next week. And then the second week we'll talk about the body, physical experiences. And then you have a chance to go home and practice with that. And then we build on that experience to give the instructions for emotions and how to include emotions as part of the practice. Then you go home and get a chance to practice with that. And then the next week, the fourth week, we talk about thoughts and our cognitive life. And with all that as a foundation, then the last week we'll talk about how to integrate the practice, apply the practice into our daily life. So that seems to work very well to have that kind of sequence and do it gradually. And that's what we'll do. If you miss one of the classes for some reason, Alison here, we've tape recorded this session, but also we've done a previous classes series. And she has them available. You can buy them from her. So if you've been in this one of the classes, you tell her which class you're missing and you can get... What? She doesn't have any with you, with her. So you have to kind of order them from her. And so like, if you're going to miss next week, which is on the body, you ask her for the body tape or the second week tape. And it varies a little bit from class to class, what I say. I don't have like a script, right? But it's basically instructions is basically the same. And it's a way of following along. I was a student at Stanford and I was at Stanford today. And I don't know how many of you know the Papua New Guinea, a sculpture garden they have there now. It's really a fantastic garden. And earlier in the day, I'd passed by the Rodin's Thinker that they have outside one of the libraries. And then in the sculpture garden, it seems that one of the artists from Papua New Guinea saw a Rodin's sculpture of the Thinker on campus. And he said, I can do better than that. And so he made his own Thinker. So now there's two Thinkers at Stanford. There's a French Thinker and there's a Papua New Guinea Thinker. And they have very different expressions. And in my years at Stanford, I've had this fantasy of having a third Thinker. Or actually, I didn't know about this new second Thinker until today, but another Thinker on campus. Because Rodin's Thinker is kind of in front of this long lawn. And I thought the opposite end of this long lawn. I wanted to have an equal sized statue, but not so up in a kind of pillar, but actually down on the ground, of the Buddha sitting in meditation posture. And I thought it'd be really great contrast, Rodin's Thinker and the Buddha sitting there in meditation peacefully. And usually a person might look at that and say, oh, this represents East and West. In the West, we're into cognitive thinking and figuring things out and programming and all kinds of things that we do so well right here in Silicon Valley. And in the East is about serenity and emptying the mind and being tranquil and all that. It's incredibly naive and simplistic to make that kind of East-West distinction. And perhaps rather, we should look at just different sides of human capacity that these two sculptures represent. But they have a Rodin garden at Stanford. And I realized one day that Rodin has this Gates of Hell. If you've never seen it, you should go look at Rodin's Gates of Hell at Stanford. And the top of the Gates of Hell is the Thinker. Have you noticed that? And I was like, oh, that's what a Thinker is supposed to be. And the Thinker is looking down at Hell, as far as I can tell. And I realized that the Thinker is not thinking about software programming or thinking about existential, real, I don't know, philosophy. But we just thinker, I believe. Now I look at him, he looks tormented. And he's not like that pinnacle of Western thought and philosophy. And it's rather the pinnacle of Western angst. I mean, we shouldn't talk about Western, but just the pinnacle of human angst of someone who's maybe now I imagine that guys who react with guilt and shame and unworthiness and fear of the future and hell and damnation and consuming, he's kind of lost in himself. He's kind of hunched over, he's sitting there and he's kind of lost in himself and unaware of the world around him. And I kind of see a statue and see someone who's kind of closed off in an inward kind of movement. And then the opposite, the Buddha then, is someone or that capacity we have within us, not to be closed off, but rather to be open. Because the Buddha sits there with an open chest, which something people usually don't look at when you see a Buddha statue. They look at the serene face or the hands. But the Buddha statue sits there with an open chest, an exposed chest, the kind of chest that we don't allow to be exposed when we feel afraid or vulnerable, when we collapse in or we hide ourselves or something. And so it's a phenomenal kind of expression, I believe, of a symbol of someone who's sitting open-hearted or open-chested in the way that the Buddha is kind of to the world. And the Buddha sits with a certain kind of serenity, a certain kind of peace. But the image for me that's more important than peace is the image again of openness. It's the open-heartedness, it's the open-mindedness. Open-minded in the sense that the mind is not preoccupied with concerns, but rather is open to allow whatever it wants to engage in to come freely and go freely, as opposed to having a mind which is locked onto something, locked onto fear, locked onto memories, resentments, planings, fantasies, shoulds and shouldn'ts. But rather a mind that is not locked that way, but a mind that where things can flow through in a creative way, in a freeway, in a way that when we're locked they can't. So I see these two statues as being kind of these two possibilities of each of us, the possibility of being kind of maybe cramped and constricted and full of existential angst, and the possibility of us being open, at peace with ourselves, at peace with our world, and free in our minds and free in our hearts. So that's what I thought of today. I don't know if it's a good idea or not. It was fair to kind of compare these statues, but one of these days I'm hoping to get a very wealthy benefactor and we're going to get this very big, you know, red-ass size sculpture of the Buddha, and we're going to sneak in, you know, midnight into Stanford and plop it there on the lawn, and no one's going to know where it came from, and no one's going to dare to remove it, and there it is. We'll know. But you won't tell anyone, right? So, and then we can put a label on it that says thinker. So we have three thinkers at Stanford, three models of how it can be. So before I tell you any more about what mindfulness is and what you're about to do and all this stuff, why don't I teach you first about the posture. Mindfulness meditation can be done at any posture at all, because mindfulness, very simply, is the capacity of the mind to pay attention, to attend to what's going on in our life, as opposed to being unconscious attention, being consumed, or preoccupied with what's going on, not really noticing carefully what's going on. When we do meditation, it's very useful to assume or take a posture that is a help for our ability to attend, to be present, to pay attention. We can pay attention to any posture, but some postures tend to be pragmatically more useful than others. Sitting on the floor is for most people, is kind of a universally wonderful posture for paying attention, for being open and for being relaxed and allow ourselves to kind of trust our posture, trust our body and trust gravity. It's not necessary to sit on the floor. Sitting in a chair is also a wonderful posture. But sitting in a chair in a way that lets us be a little more open-chested, more open, rather than kind of collapse in on the chair. So I want to take a little bit of time to talk about posture, and then we'll do a little practice before I've given you any real instructions, and then afterwards I'll tell you what you did. How does that sound? So if you're going to sit on the floor, what you want to do is sit in a way that provides some stability. And one of the most stable ways of sitting is to make a tripod to have three points that support you, and that's the cross-legged position. I recommend that to sit, especially for people who are relatively new, to sit with both legs flat on the ground, one foot in front of the other. If they're crossed, which is often a good way of sitting, there's a tendency sometimes that it kind of throws your body to one side. You kind of relax and you're like this. And then as you sit up straight, you have to kind of stretch one side more than the other, which becomes a yoga teacher's nightmare. If you want to bring your foot up like this, then yoga teachers say you should alternate legs, so you stretch both sides equally. But having both feet flat on the ground is relatively symmetrical, and it's relatively balanced, and it's also more comfortable for most beach people because there's not as much torque on the knees or on the hips. But in order to get the knees down, it's very useful to sit on a cushion. And the most common thing to sit on is a round cushion. These are called zafus in Japanese. And when you sit up, then your knees tend to go down. And the way to sit on the round cushions is to sit not flat in the middle, but to sit on the front third of them so that the slope of it tilts your hips forward slightly. Your pelvis kind of rotates forward slightly. And if your pelvis rotates forward, it's easier to get your knees down. Everybody can get their knees down if the cushion was high enough. However, gravity works against us because it gets too high, it becomes a slide, and we kind of slide right off. But some of you can more or less get onto the floor. Might want to experiment sitting on higher or lower cushions to see how comfortable you can get. So like you, you're sitting flat on the floor. If you're sat up on a cushion, you look flexible enough that probably you could get actually both knees down. And it's a lot easier to sit for a long time if both knees are down. There are other ways of sitting. Some people like to sit on these half boons, provide a different kind of support that some people prefer. And some people like to sit on benches and like this. And the idea of a bench is you don't sit cross-legged, but you sit on your knees when this kind of above your feet so that it takes your weight. And that's a nice way of sitting. It's not as stable as cross-legged, but for people who can't sit cross-legged or people who want to alternate, this is nice. The other option for cross-legged sitting is to take one of these round cushions and put it between your ankles and then sit straight down on top of it. And that works fairly well also. And Alison, also she sells these things, and you can order them, she can provide them for you. And I think she's probably the cheapest price in the peninsula, so it's a good deal. And if you want to experiment afterwards with these, you can come up and try them out. So there's nothing particularly mystical about sitting cross-legged, it's just a very stable way of sitting. And having stability is very helpful. But the most important thing of sitting meditation is to have a straight spine, to let your spine be alert and erect. So you want to sometimes, when you sit down, to be careful and mindful as you sit down. To have a balanced, have your weight balanced on top of your sitting bones. And then to feel your spine, feel up your spine, up your vertebrae to see if they're balanced so you're not leaning forward or leaning back. And so the weight goes through your spine and down into your sitting bones, you sit in a balanced way. You can have your hands in any posture that's symmetrical where they're both doing the same thing. And some people like to have them on their on their thighs or on their knees, up or down. The classic, the usual Buddhist way is to have your hands together. And that's kind of nice because there's a way in which there's kind of a gathering of our body or gathering of energy into kind of this area around here, below our navel, which is a place that if it really relaxes, it's kind of a settling of things into this area, kind of a concentration of attention. If you have your hands all the way down on your ankles, like this, for some people will find that it tends to pull their shoulders forward. It depends a little bit on how long your arms are compared to your torso. And some people then will get something like a little pillow or towel or something and put it on their ankles so that you can rest their hands a little bit higher. And that can be helpful for your shoulders sometimes. And the idea is to continue the straightness of the spine up into the through the neck. And it can be useful to tuck the chin back and down slightly. And what's explained in some of the classic texts is that if you do that, it tends to control the wandering mind. No one believes it. A different way of doing the same thing is, which is actually I think is maybe a nicer way of describing it, is to create a little bit of space between your last vertebrae and your skull. And in doing it, you kind of open that area a little bit, so there's a little space, spaciousness, and that kind of does the same thing, I believe. And you do see, I think there's this tendency when people think a lot of meditation for their chin to go up and out. And in our tradition, we sit with our eyes closed. It's not necessary, but it's what our tradition does. And so, you know, it's good to do what the tradition says, but it's not required. Gently, softly close the eyes. The mouth is also closed and the tongue is up against the roof of the mouth. If you're sitting in a chair, you want to sit also in such a way that your back is well supported. And your back is better supported if your knees are lower than your hips. If your knees are higher than your hips, then it tends to kind of push your back backwards, lower back, and then puts a strain there, and it's difficult to, you know, your back will go out at some point. And so some people who have long legs might want to actually sit up on a cushion, maybe much like this. You want to sit in a way that's stable and kind of firm, and having the legs kind of go straight out and at right angles down, so they're parallel to each other, with the feet both flat on the ground and not crossed, tends to provide more stability. If it's possible, it's recommended you don't use the backrest if you sit in a chair. Some people need to use a backrest because of back conditions, so it's fine to use it if you need to. But the reason for encouraging people not to use it is that there's a wonderful and intimate connection between our inner psychology, inner psyche, or inner life, and what goes on in our body and our posture. And to the degree in which Buddhist practice is about becoming self-reliant in an inner psychic way, it's a lot easier to find that if we become self-reliant in our posture, not using a backrest. So just sit out the way from the backrest if you can. If you need to use a backrest and you have a choice in the matter, then only using a backrest for your lower back is recommended. And maybe you take a towel or take something and put it into your lower back and really kind of push your back into that support as a way of getting some strength there so the rest of your back is kind of pushed up and easier to keep upright. And the same thing with the hands. They can be any way that is more or less symmetrical. That's the basics of the posture. So why don't we just take a comfortable alert posture like this. And those of you who have had instruction before, just forget all about what you've ever learned. Beginner's mind. And just notice what is your experience of yourself right now in whatever way, there's no right way or wrong way. What is your experience of yourself as you're sitting here? And the exercise is not to think about your experience, but rather to sit and sense or to feel from the inside. What is your experience of yourself? With a sense of curiosity or exploration, what is it to be a human being who's alive at this moment? And there's a big difference between having your experience and knowing what you're having, sensing and feeling it. There's a difference between thinking and then knowing, being aware that you're thinking. There's a big difference between being tired and being aware or feeling that you're being tired, sensing, knowing. There's a big difference between aching or struggling in your body and knowing that your body aches or itches. So continue for a few minutes, feeling and sensing whatever is happening, whatever presents itself to you as part of your experience. And your task is to hold it, contain whatever is happening in your conscious awareness. So in a simple way, you're present, noticing. So you're not noticing the difference between getting caught up in something so you're no longer aware. And then simply being aware as if awareness was a container through which your experience goes. So in order to do that, you can take a few deeper breaths so you can feel the connection to your breathing, to the way which your body experiences the process of breathing. And then having done that, let yourself breathe normally but maintain the connection with the breath. Let your attention, let your awareness explore what it feels like for the body to be breathing. And notice the tendency for the mind to wander off into preoccupations and concerns. And notice how that's different than simply resting in your breathing. And when your mind wanders away, just softly and gently, lovingly, let the attention your awareness settle in the body's experience of breathing. Feeling the expansion of the in-breath, the release or the contraction of the out-breath. So what mindfulness? Well, mindfulness is a capacity that we all have. It's a capacity to be attentive, it's a capacity to be aware, the capacity to know what's going on. And that's a capacity which all of us have all the time. It's not something Eastern or mystical or unique. In order to function in life, we constantly need to be aware of what's going on. However, what we're doing in mindfulness practice is cultivating and strengthening, developing this ability. So it becomes a much more present in our life than it usually is. And as we do that, it can have very powerful effects on our life. The movements of stress, the movements of psychological suffering that many of us struggle with, tend to be movements of preoccupations. It tends to be movements where we're kind of caught in things without really bringing a clear mindfulness, a clear awareness of this is what's going on. And to the degree in which you can be aware of what's going on, we're not preoccupied by it. We're not caught by it as much. And so it brings into the situation a certain level of certainly awareness of what's going on, but also it could be very subtle. Sometimes we use the word detachment, which is not the same thing as a loop, being a loop or non-attached. But it moves us a little bit from that preoccupation, being so tightly kind of caught up in what's going on. So what we're doing in mindfulness is slowly finding ways to strengthen our ability to bring careful attention, loving attention to our life as it appears to us moment by moment. One of the cardinal themes or axioms of Buddhism is that that which human beings find most precious, most valuable of being a human being or being alive is only available to us if we're in the present moment to experience it. And maybe you find arguments or maybe you feel differently for yourself, but experiences of love, of friendship, of joy don't really happen in the future in the past. As experiences, they can only happen in the present moment. To the degree in which we tend to kind of go off into the future of the past, we get preoccupied by them. To that degree, we limit the opportunities for joy and love and friendship and peace as present moment experiences for us. And there are very powerful forces within us that pull us out of the present moment. One of them is that for some people the present moment is uncomfortable. For many reasons it's uncomfortable. And so there's a kind of wanting to escape discomfort. And so we train our mind to be thinking about the future or fantasizing a lot or thinking about the past. And also we don't have to really be present so we can deny in a sense our discomfort in the present moment. We're bored with our work. We're afraid of our relationship we're in. And so it's better to kind of not pay attention to it because paying attention to it reminds you of the pain. So it's a powerful mechanism of avoidance or denial to check out, to not be in the present moment. Many of us are caught up in anxiety about shoulds and shouldn'ts, about expectations and about desires that kind of pull us very strongly out of the present moment hoping to get something fulfilled or something prevented in the future. And what's remarkable, I think for many of us, it isn't that some of us think that our thoughts about the future or thoughts about the past or our fantasies are as real as what's happening in the present moment. For many of us, I think thoughts about the future and thoughts about the past are more real for some of us in the present moment. And that's why we often get caught up so much in our anxieties about what's going to happen in the future. But our ideas about the future, the only thing they are are expectations. They might or might or might not really happen. To be able to settle, to find an ability, a strength ability to come back and be here in the present moment allows us to connect with ourselves and allows us then to better and more fully connect to the world around us. And what you'll find, I believe, I trust, is that as you kind of follow and do a mindfulness practice, your strength of connectedness to the present, the strength of being connected to yourself and the world around you as the present moment unfolds and develops, will get stronger and stronger, and the present moment will get richer and more pleasant. And not necessarily more pleasant because there are unpleasant things as part of the present moment, but more satisfying, richer and more diverse. There are... Once you start developing the capacity to bring attention, mindfulness, conscious awareness into the present moment, you'll find that there are levels and realms of consciousness available to you which are much richer and more diverse than what is possible to us when we're thinking about the future or fantasizing or thinking about the past, which is actually a very, very narrow band of our human capacity, where many of us, I think, spend most of our time lost in those kinds of thoughts and preoccupations. Mindfulness meditation and mindfulness practice is used for many people as a form of stress reduction. And one of the most powerful ways which is entered into American society is not in its Buddhist form, its Buddhist reincarnation, but rather in its pain and stress management reincarnation. And some of you might have read John Kabat-Zinn's book or have taken one of his stress reduction classes that's inspired by him. They teach them wonderful classes at El Camino Hospital and Redwood City Kaiser. And there's no hint that this practice originally came from Buddhism. And I think that's marvelous because I think that the mindfulness practice has so much to offer. It's nice to be able to offer it in a way that the religion or the religious kind of aura or whatever, and it seems so foreign to people, it doesn't turn people off. It's available in a very secular way. And it helps in stress reduction in a number of ways. It helps because if we can kind of learn to be in the present moment mindful of what's going on, to that degree, we're not caught up in our concerns as much. And if we're not caught up as much, then we tend to start unraveling the forces of momentum of being stressed out or being preoccupied. But also as we become more mindful, more aware, it helps our stress because we begin understanding and seeing the forces and motivations, the intentions, the reactions within us that tend to cause a stress in our life. And this is why mindfulness practice is sometimes called an insight practice that brings insight and understanding to those forces that motivate us and to think and react and feel the way that we feel throughout our life. So it allows us to go deeper into kind of the undercurrents of what causes us to think and feel the way we do. As a spiritual practice, mindfulness, we would say, the Buddhists would say, goes deeper because as the forces of reactivity, as the forces of preoccupation begin to abate, then the natural well springs of wisdom and love that are within us, that are found within us, have a chance to begin to kind of bubble up. And this bubbling up of love and open-mindedness and open-heartedness of this very deep sensitivity to life that's more than just stress-free, but is actually a deeper connectedness with life, we would say is a spiritual connection to life, a spiritual dimension when mindfulness becomes very strong. When I teach mindfulness, I tend to play down, I think, the Buddhist side of it, because I like it to be available to people who might not be turned off by another religion. But you should know that I do also talk about Buddhism and talk about it in the Buddhist context. So I would like to ask you now, we sat for ten minutes, first just very openly sitting with your experience, and then for a little bit longer, and then with your breathing. What was that like for some of you, especially those of you who are new? Was it difficult? Was it interesting? What did you notice happen to you? Yes? It was the first time I tried to do it. First time I tried to do it. I was thinking about feeling very good. You had a lot of visions. Yes. That often happens. So. Great. Let's see. Great. Let's see what else. Or you're shy. Yes. I noticed that I have a lot more attention and pain in my mind than I normally acknowledge or am aware of. And I also noticed that I went to a place that I do try to point a lot because it engenders fear. It's about getting deeper inside myself. This is the first time I've tried to meditate with all this sense. I can understand why the reason I'm here is to learn not to avoid that. I'll try to learn. Beautiful. In the context of pain, both physical and also emotional, the simple act of bringing awareness is actually healing. And maybe you understand the principle in the sense, in therapy, they sometimes say that 90% of good therapy is the fact that someone's paying attention to you. Someone's listening. And so in some way it creates a kind of accepting space where you can say what's going on with you and be heard tends to allow deeper understandings to arise, tends to release a lot of holding and fear and preoccupation. The same thing we can do for ourselves. If we just bring attention to what's going on within us, that within us, our pains, begin to process themselves, unravel themselves, begin to open up in a way they couldn't if we keep avoiding them. When we keep avoiding them, it's like we put a stopper on them. And they don't have really a chance to show themselves and for us to understand them and get the wisdom that's there and to let them unravel. Unravel in the sense of loosening up. So it's very powerful to bring attention to our pains. And then part of what this five-week course will be about is learning how not to avoid as you wish to learn. Who else? Yes. I'd like to add on to what you just said. I'm very much self-assaying as for me, the part to finally just connect from thinking about everything else around the world or just about my life and work and more. I was presently in my body. I did feel a lot more pain than I would normally feel. And it's almost like I didn't want to feel it, but it was very strong in which when you finally ran the time, I went, I need to do this part for two hours. It's going to be fully in my body. Thank you. What else? It's not a test and then no one's getting graded. I kept thinking about how hot it was in here. And I know the windows aren't being opened. We can open the windows, please. Someone wants to open the windows sitting near them. There's someone that he's gone to. I'd be happy to. When I was a kid, I used to lie out of the sun a lot. I always used to see yellow and purple-contented circles. I don't know if it was just a certain level of black thing. And since I've been coming here for just a few months, when I really can turn off the world, I see those circles again. And then it'll make me feel like I'm on the beach. Some people will find that with levels of calm and concentration, that certain patterns of light or patterns of colors or something, often geometric, often circular, will kind of appear in front of their sight. A lot of people, most people, a lot of people don't have it, but it's not uncommon. And what's important for a meditator is not to get too interested in those. Not to get fascinated, not get preoccupied in that and studying that. Because as soon as you get preoccupied with that, that interrupts the process of opening up your awareness and being present. Yes? Yeah, because one thing I noticed when I tried to meditate, I finally, you know, my mind finally clears. I get goosebumps all over. And it's kind of neat, actually. But the problem is, I sort of make that the goal of meditating. Maybe we caught it in the same thing. Yeah, unusual. Sometimes people have unusual sensations on the surface of their body as part of meditation. It often comes at a certain level of calm or concentration. And again, we'll talk more about that next week, because next week we'll talk about the body. But the principle in mindfulness meditation is we're kind of interested in our experience, but we don't get interested in the sense of getting caught up in it. This is really great. And let me, you know, what can I do with it? Or can I play with it? Or can I kind of really indulge in it and really enjoy it really well? Or it is just to kind of let it be there and be aware of it without getting involved in it. What we want is an uninvolved awareness. One of the metaphors often used for meditation is letting the awareness be like a mirror. And the mirror, objects in no way stick to the mirror. Rather, when something is in front of the mirror, it's there in the mirror. And when it's no longer there, the mirror is not thinking about this thing that was just there. The mirror is not anticipating what's going to come. And so we're developing a mirror awareness, a mirror-like mind. So when fascinating, sometimes very interesting things happen. Sometimes very threatening things or painful things happen in meditation. And what we slowly learn is how to maintain this beautiful thing called a mirror awareness that doesn't stick to anything. And what we find is that ability for the mind to be a mirror is the place we find our freedom. The opposite of being a mirror is something that sticks to things, right? And a mirror doesn't stick to anything. And that's where our freedom is. And this is a very important principle in mindfulness meditation that I was going to wait till next week to say it, but in mindfulness meditation, the experience, the point of mindfulness practice is not a particular kind of experience. And maybe that's the kind of strange thing to say. You think, well, isn't mindfulness meditation about having experience of calm or peace or joy or bliss or love or something? Maybe it is, or maybe it's not, but it's not an experience. Rather, it's the way in which we hold our experience, which is the point. And regardless of what the experience is, when we want to learn a way to hold it in an open-handed way, like hold it as a mirror that doesn't grasp or doesn't push anything away. And the movement of grasping or pushing away in all its varied forms is the common experience of human life. Liking and not liking, pushing away, holding on, wanting things to be different, but rather to have a mind that's like a mirror, that allows things to be as they are, allows for deeper well-springs of wisdom and compassion to arise in us, allows for freedom to be there. So what we're trying to find is not an experience. As soon as you're looking for an experience, which is the experience for meditation, guess what? You've lost your mirror. You've gotten sticky. You've gotten sticky. Right? So it's not about an experience. It's about how we hold the experience. It's not about getting rid of your headache, but rather how do you hold the headache? And you'll understand much better how this works as you do it, but your freedom is found, and a certain kind of joy and peace is found, not by getting rid of the headache, but by letting it be there in a spacious way, letting it be there without reacting to it or tightening up around it or contracting or hating it or whatever. And in the opposite way, with joy and bliss and all kinds of wonderful experiences, their tendency is to say, aha, I've got it. I'm a really hot meditator. I can't wait to show off, and maybe I'll get a medal, and I'll go with a meditation teacher, and I deserve it finally, and I better remember how this is so I can get it next time, and you sit down next time, and you huff and puff, and what exactly did I do? I wore that one particular sweater, and I was two hours after my meal, and maybe if I come towards myself just the way I can get that joy again. The point is when joy arises in sitting, it's insane to hold it in a way that doesn't either push it away or hold on to it. So how this mere mind is in some sense the development of the practice. Does that make sense? So some of you are probably disappointed to hear this, because the way you hold your experience, how can that be important? Give me some good experience. Give me another high. Yes. Mine wasn't a fair chance because I had Harold's stomach, and I kept thinking I wish I had a Tom, and I wish I had a Tom, and it was really, really one of those things. So then I thought, well, maybe if I can learn to be insightful enough, then some way I can learn to control this, and so it's still there. I never know what to do when you do. I'm trying to understand. Right. Very good. Well, that's one of the things that mindfulness will teach, is how when there is pain, how to hold it, how to allow it to be there, without adding any more suffering on top of it. I give the example in our newsletter that just came out. You can pick one of these up. It has a schedule of our events. But there's a famous parable of the double arrows, the two arrows that the Buddha gave. And the Buddha said to his students, if a man is struck by an arrow, is that painful? Does it hurt him? And his monks, they kind of look at him and say, yeah, that's painful. And then he says, well, if he gets struck by a second arrow, is that even more painful? And they say, yeah, that's two errors that's more painful than one. And the Buddha said, the first arrow is sometimes out of your control. You have a tummy ache, you have a headache, you break your leg, you get sick, you get old, you die, or whatever happens. To some degree, these things are out of our control. The second arrow is the arrow of the way in which we react to it. So if we're sitting here and our tummy aches, and we begin hating our stomach, there's a certain kind of pain of the contraction of hate, which is different than the raw pain of the stomach ache. It's bad enough to have a stomach ache, but to have the restlessness and the preoccupation, the concern, the planning, and the self-pity, and the self-criticism of why did I eat so much, and why am I more careful, and I've been trying to die for years, and why poor me? That's all adding the second arrow. So this ability to develop the mere mind is the mind that allows things to be as they are, whether they're pleasant or unpleasant, about adding the second arrow of reactivity. And that, the Buddhists say, is a very, very significant thing to discover. And that as this ability to have a mere awareness become stronger and stronger, our ability to be free in the world becomes stronger also. And, you know, American culture, maybe all human culture, has a tremendous amount of emphasis on avoiding discomfort. And on one hand, it's one of the blessings of living in our culture. We don't have to feel a lot of undue pain. We can take pain medication or whatever. But it's also, in some ways, undoing, perhaps, of our culture, because we've gotten to be such experts at numbing out alcohol, drugs, sex, food, you name it, we do it. So we don't have to be present for what's really going on in our life. And so we live kind of actually removed from ourselves. And I meet so many people in my capacity as a meditation teacher who come to me and are surprised after doing some meditation how much they've been a stranger to themselves, because they're constantly occupying themselves in many, many activities, often self-help activities. And they're so busy with these things that they've never really gotten to know who they are. They never relaxed in a very simple way, let who they are reveal themselves to themselves. So we have all these, we have this blessing and curse in our society of all these abilities to numb out. I have this, sometimes in this beginning class, I bring this Charlie Brown cartoon, where Charlie is talking to Linus and he says, oh, so you think my father doesn't know anything about repairing cars? Well, just the other day we were driving down the road and there was this terrible clanky sound coming out of the engine. And Linus said, oh, don't tell me. He stopped and fixed it. And Charlie said, no, he just turned the radio up louder. And that's often what we do, right? We find some way to turn the radio up louder. So mindfulness practice goes demetrically opposed to that. And it's great. Yes. Why is it a mirror instead of like Teflon? You know, really, that it's reflecting as opposed to not. Well, these metaphors, you know, don't work too well, but maybe a Teflon mirror. It doesn't stick, but a mirror somehow in a kind of sense of registers, a mirror is an obvious, honestly registers or reflects or states or recognize what's there. This ability to honestly and completely recognize what's there is the ability we have with the knowing capacity of the mind. But the mirror doesn't stick. So this capacity to know in and of itself doesn't have to stick. But often we confuse the sticking with the knowing. But mindfulness is actually very intimate. It's not actually separate. It's actually maybe like touching because it really be in full contact with our experience. It's not removed from our experience. It's not a loop. But anyway. Yes. Is it possible for this family to move a little more on the sticking part? I'm having a hard time crafting understanding what that sticking really means. Well, if you have, for example, sitting here and you have knee pain. Now pain in your knee is just a neutral experience in the universe. Just pain. It's no big deal. But if I start thinking about the pain and think, oh, oh, oh, maybe I have cancer, or maybe if I sit any longer, my leg is going to break and then I'm going to need to amputate it. And I don't have insurance and I better get insurance. And you don't have insurance. I can't afford insurance. Maybe I should get a job. And what kind of job should I get? And, oh, poor me. I never get a good job. And, oh, I'm so unworthy. And that's really sticky. Or a friend of mine who was a Zen student in the monastery. And when his knee hurt, he hurt his knee back by pushing at it. That's a very sticky reaction. It was so sticky, it ended up having to have knee surgery. Or there was a period in my own meditation practice where I, for some reason, decided that joy was a hindrance to my meditation. So, as a meditation deepens, as it matures, some people have experienced spontaneous feelings of great joy. So at some point it started happening to me. And I thought the joy was a hindrance. So I was pushing it away, holding at a distance, not allowing it to kind of bubble up until I got a headache. I mean, talk about dumb. But that's a stickiness. Judging the experience of the stickiness. You're sitting here and you're following your breath very simply. And you think, oh, my breath is kind of shallow and short. In California we've learned to have a long, deep breath if you really want to be hip. So I don't seem to be hip enough. So I'm not a good California kind of new age person now. And oh, I never can do it right. And what a bad person I am. Judgments like that are a stickiness. So there's a whole infinite variety of forms in which we get caught up in the experience. Does that explain a little bit? That's right. Thank you. There's a lot more. Yes. So when you get caught sticking this, where do you go there? Okay. It will take five weeks to really kind of... What I want to do this first week is to keep the practice really simple. And the focus for this first week is to sit with mindfulness with the breath, just to go back and be with the breath the best you can. And that does two things. To be aware of the breath, you need to be in the present moment. So it's cultivating a strength of ability to stay in the present, to help some concentration of being in the present, to counteract the forces which want to take you away. To the degree in which you can come into the present moment around something which is relatively neutral, the breath, to that degree, you're countering the forces that are sticky, that are getting preoccupied and reactive and getting wound up by other things. It'll still happen. But each time you come back to the breath, you're deconditioning yourself slightly from spinning out. And most of our lives, we never take the opportunity to kind of step back and decondition ourselves. And we can actually... You know, winding up into the mind gets tighter and tighter and tighter. One of the ways in which meditation works is we finally leave ourselves alone. We don't add any more reaction to what's going on. We just come back to the breath in the most simple way. Don't judge how the meditation is. Don't judge what's going on. Let whatever happened to be there, allow ourselves to wander away when that happens, but then come back to the breath. And leaving ourselves alone in such a simple non-judgmental way allows the wound-upness to unwind. One image I have of a meditation practice. It's pulling the plug from the full bathtub. And as long as you're aware of what's going on in the present moment, the bathtub is draining. But as soon as you lose your awareness of the present moment and get cut up in some kind of concern, you're winding it up again. So meditation is a process, it's a beautiful process of learning to leave ourselves alone. And so many of us, that's what our innermost selves is most asking for. Leave me alone. So just coming back to the breath is a training in leaving ourselves alone. Because when the breath isn't neutral, it's not kind of judging, it's not preoccupying, it's not planning, just very simple. And then over the weeks we'll talk more about your very question. So try to keep it really simple. What I'd recommend for you, we'll sit now again to give you a better sense of how the instructions is, but what I'd encourage you to do, to where this class works best, is if you meditate once a day, at least for this course of these five weeks. And if you're relatively new or new to meditation, I would recommend you start with 15 minutes of meditation and find some time in the day when it's relatively quiet where you're not going to be disturbed. Most people find it's best to do it early in the morning before they get caught up in the day's concerns. And go someplace that, you know, close your bedroom door or whatever it takes to be not disturbed. And sit for 15 minutes. And then each week of this five-week course, add five minutes until you get to maybe 30 or 35 minutes, and then you can kind of keep it there, or if it feels like you want to continue, you can go to 40 or 45 minutes. But to really have to have a commitment and really learn and really get a good sense of your own personal experience of what it's like to try this, then will help a lot to understand how to integrate the next level of instructions. So we want to keep the first week really simple. Nothing needs to happen. You don't have to have some kind of wonderful experience. All you need to do is slow, remember to come back to your breathing. So the basic instructions is to take an alert but comfortable upright posture and then softly close your eyes. And then in the beginning of a period of meditation, it's often nice to take two or three deep breaths. And as you breathe out, to relax, to let go of the shoulders, your tension, your concerns. And then breathe normally. And then also at the beginning of a period of meditation, it's nice to scan through your body. And if there's any obvious place where you're holding or where there's tension, and you might be able to relax, let go of those areas. So for example, sometimes the forehead can be softened or the eyes and the shoulders. And it's also nice to soften and relax the stomach, to let the stomach hang forward, hang out. And then simply, very simply, feel what it's like to have a body. Feel your bodily experience of sitting here. And then within the body, as part of the body, become aware of your breathing in whatever way the breath appears. And there's no right or wrong way to breathe. The point is to become aware of how your breath is experienced right now. And if you have trouble noticing or feeling your breath, you can place your hand on your belly, abdomen, and just feel perhaps the movement there. So you can notice how the in breath is differently experienced than the out breath. So you and sometimes a helpful idea is that of resting the awareness with the breath. So that as the waves of in breath and out breath move through the body, your attention is resting, surfing on those sensations, on those experiences. And if you find yourself caught up or lost in thought, that's fine. That's what minds tend to do. And even if a thousand times your mind wanders away, all you need to do is whenever you notice the mind is lost, is to carefully and softly reawaken your attention on the breath. Rest your awareness again on the sensations of breathing in and breathing out. Letting your mind become still, letting go of your concerns. So so so so moment by moment coming back to your breathing. Letting a simple experience of breath be your resting place. No need to be concerned about how well you're doing. One As you breathe out, breathing out is kind of a letting go. So, remember to stay present, to rest with the full letting go of breathing out. Not forcing it, but rather beings therefore it. And then for one last minute, entrust yourself fully to the breathing. Let your resting in the breath be as continuous as possible for one minute. And then for another minute, let your resting in the breath be as continuous as possible. The mindfulness of breathing, concentrating carefully on the breath, is kind of a universal practice. Many spiritual traditions teach it. And even in Buddhism, there are schools of Buddhism where the only meditation practice a student will do is just simply meditating on the simple experience of breathing. And it's said that you can become enlightened, simply meditating on the breath. So it's very, very significant, very useful. We expand the instructions beyond the breath, but I would encourage you to keep it really simple during this week. And if you've had the instructions in mindfulness practice before, the full set of it, and you're going along this course, start over again during this course. And just next week, keep your meditation practice really simple and just come back to the breath. Other things occur and other feelings. It's fine to feel whatever you're feeling, whatever thoughts you have. You don't have to criticize or judge them. Kind of have a mirror of mind towards them in a sense. But then whenever you notice, whenever you remember, come back softly and rest with the breathing, kind of maintaining the connection of the breath the best you can without straining. So the idea is resting there, but resting there as long as you can, letting everything else kind of fall away or do whatever it wants to do. If there are one or two questions about what I've said so far or about this particular meditation instruction, we could take that. Yes? Yeah, it's very much what we're doing and it's very powerful to do that. Even though it's such a simple thing. It's hard to believe it's so powerful. Yeah? Is it better to just breathe in through the nose or out through the nose or into the mouth? We usually say keep your mouth closed and just breathe in out through your nose. Different people will feel the breath in different places. Some people feel it just the air passing through the nostrils. Some people will feel it more in their chest rising and falling. Some people feel their abdomen rising and falling. So wherever you feel it predominantly, wherever it's easy to feel it, just let your attention rest there in that one place. Kind of cultivate and sensitize yourself more to one place where you tend to feel the strongest. Yeah, but in terms of your answer, it's best to keep the mouth closed and just go in and out through your nose. Yes? So the meditation starts out with the breathing exercise. Does it go beyond that after? Yeah, come back next week. Because sometimes when I meditate, sometimes breathing, concentrating on breathing kind of gets in the lane sometimes. They can. Sometimes I can just go without it. But you're supposed to start with that. Well, that's the usual way of starting, the usual foundation. There are other foundations. Some people, the breath is not a neutral place. They've had some kind of trauma in their life. They fell into the pool almost drowned when they were young. The issue of breathing is like for some reason an issue. So it's not so neutral. They get a little bit frightened when they pay attention to their breath. Then an alternative place as the kind of foundation is to do listening meditation. Bring yourself into the present moment just listening to the sounds around you, not reacting to any of them, just long become whatever they are, pleasant or unpleasant, but just opening to the panoramic play of sounds as they appear. But unless you have an issue with the breath, I'd encourage you to stay with the breath. But that's another alternative. Yes? How still should you try to stay? Because if I find myself yawning and my head starts moving, it kind of stretches my neck. Yes, sit still. So don't try not to move at all. Yes. The stiller the body can become, the easier it is for the mind to become still. When you start moving the body, there's such a close relationship between the body and the mind that a lot of fidgeting and a lot of moving will actually agitate the mind, steer up the waters in a sense. What if it's involuntary? Then it's fine. If it's involuntary, it's fine. So sometimes a cough or yawn or certain movements simply happen on their own. Then the practices just to notice it. It's fine. But stretching like this, oh my, itching, that's not involuntary. There's a lot of choice involved. Some people don't realize that until five minutes later, they've done it. We only have a tremendous amount of choice in our life, but we only have choice if we notice the choice, the ability and the power where freedom comes from in the practice is we see more carefully where the choice lies. Yes, but keep your body still. The last one, then we should stop. The distinction between paying attention to the breath and controlling the breath is something that I've difficulty with. As soon as they start paying attention to the breath, unconsciously breathing. Yes. I wonder if there's a way of paying attention without controlling. Well, there is, of course. If you cannot control, that's nice. You'll be more comfortable. However, the beauty of mindfulness practice is, again, it doesn't matter what your experience is. What we're developing is our ability to notice what's happening. In terms of being with the breath, just notice the breath that you have. If you're controlling your breath, become the world-class expert in a controlled breath. Just notice that, oh, this is what a controlled breath feels like. Don't make a big deal out of it. So the last thing that, a couple of things I'd like to say to end. One is the basis for teaching this kind of way is done on a donation basis, which means that we're continuing a tradition that this meditation practice is taught in Asia, taught traditionally in Buddhism, that we offer it as freely as we can to people so that anybody can do it, any kind of income, their finances, it doesn't get in the way. And also, there's a feeling in Buddhism that this practice is in some ways priceless, and to put a price on it doesn't make any sense. So we don't charge. However, there are two baskets out in the hallway if you want to make a donation. One donation, I think it says sangha dana, and sangha means community. And that's to help pay for the expenses of putting on this kind of event. And primarily it goes, we have to pay rent to the Quakers for using this room. And the only way we're going to pay it is that if all of you help pay for it. If each of you could donate a dollar for the rent, for the sangha dana, that would cover whatever the rent and other expenses we have. But that's a donation, it's up to you. The other thing you just mentioned, the Quakers have asked of us, because this is their sanctuary, is that we don't bring food or drink into this room. They have asked us for that, so we'd like to honor their request. The other basket is called, it says, teacher dana, and that is if you want to make a donation to me. And it's completely voluntary. And the feeling there is that if you would like to support my ability to continue teaching to be a teacher, this is your ability to offer the support to me. Ninety-five, ninety-nine percent of my livelihood comes from donations that I get for teaching meditation to people, which I do a lot of. And one way of thinking of it is that I can only go continue doing this because I'm supported. If I wasn't supported, I'd have to get a regular job. That would be very different, less demanding, I think. And so it's very interesting that we tried at Spirit Rock for a while to charge for these courses. And they charged, I think, sixty dollars for a six-week course. And what was very interesting was the dropout rate through the six weeks was a lot less when we charged than we didn't. And this is the same teaching. And it didn't matter who the teacher was. It's as if in our culture we respect or honor things that we pay for more than things that are offered for free, which says something about our values. A friend of mine had the same experience where he was teaching in a town, and this was in Australia. And hardly anybody came to his classes, and it wasn't really working. And then he switched from a donation system to a fee. And within a few months or six months, he was teaching seven classes a week, and there were waiting lists for people. And it was the same teaching, right? So you might just keep that in the back of your mind. Not so much about how much you donate.
