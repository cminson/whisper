 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So again, a really warm welcome. A warm welcome to everybody. So earlier today I read this sentence, and I had to pause a little bit to think about it. And I thought, well, maybe I would share it with you all and see how it lands or see what it thinks or whatever, what it elicits or what your response might be. And the sentence goes like this, there will never be a situation where being unkind to yourself, to others, or the situation that confronts you is going to make anything better. Better. Ever is the next sentence. And then choose kindness always. Like, wow, you know, usually we don't use or I like to shy away from these words like never and always. But I was trying to think about this, okay, are there any exceptions where we wouldn't use never or always? There will never be a situation where being unkind to yourself or others or the situation that confronts you is going to make anything better. So, and then the author says ever, choose kindness always. I kind of imagine this if you're being accosted. Maybe this goes along with something I talked about the last time I was here about setting firm boundaries, that loving kindness can help us to maybe make some of the boundaries porous between us and other people. And then maybe this is kind of saying the opposite. Can we set really firm boundaries, but not filled with unkindness but with kindness towards ourselves, with a very strong no, that may include a harsh language and may include biting and kicking or something if necessary. But I think maybe, well, I don't know this in Dharma circles, there's this story that I've heard from so many different people and I think part of it is because it's a powerful story. Apparently, Sharon Salzburg tells this story and many of you know Sharon Salzburg, she's the one who's kind of really responsible for bringing loving kindness to the West here. She tells the story of being, I don't know, remember precisely where she was I believe it was somewhere in India. And she was on a rickshaw, I believe, and somebody came and was trying to rob her, and she was with somebody else in the rickshaw driver and, and it was a, you know, scary frightening, they didn't steal anything. But it was a very unnerving right of course those types of things are really upsetting. And if I remember correctly Sharon was on the way to go see her teacher. I think was my name energy and Sharon asked, Well, what should I have done you know I tried. I'm appreciating loving kindness partners. What should I have done. And her teacher said, with all the loving kindness in your heart, you should have hit them over the head with your umbrella. And I kind of like that. So, it's not that we're supposed to be passive and allow people to walk all over us or take advantage of us. But it's about not, you know, letting our heart to be closed and dried up for something like this. And I think it's so common I know I certainly had this idea before that being kind meant being passive or being kind meant agreeing to things that I knew were not right or not correct or something like this. So, as our way to, you know, this is can be a skill to learn how to be kind to ourselves and to others without having hostility, but being kind with setting very firm boundaries, saying, No, no. No. And then maybe I'll just drop in this idea. Sometimes we're unkind to ourselves. So, this sentence again there will never be a situation where being unkind to yourself, others, or the situation that confronts you is going to make anything better. Sometimes we often slip into, or maybe I should say this, we allow the inner critic to become believable or persuasive or something like this. And you know it's not surprising many of us have been socialized this way and I'm certainly I have been not sure if I know anybody who hasn't didn't have times of their life in their life in which they had this idea that you know to beat ourselves up was the way forward. But I just invite you to consider this. Is there a situation where being unkind will make things better? Maybe we should think about you know better in the long term in the big picture. And so meditating regularly, loving kindness practice, mindfulness practice, whichever meditation practice we do can be in which a way in which we can, you know, not have our hearts collapsed or closed down and maybe have a way in which we have, it's easier to get access to kindness in the midst of difficulties. Think often we're unkind when we're faced with difficulties, things that are troubling or maybe our best selves don't necessarily show up in those situations. So maybe we can think about part of the practice that we're doing now, even if while we're meditating we don't feel anything in particular, it's part of practicing for those times in which difficulties rise and that we just, it'll be easier to have kindness for ourselves and kindness for others. Metta as loving kindness. Today I'm emphasizing the kindness part of that compound word. Okay, so we'll do a meditation practice. So, taking an alert upright posture. The posture that has ease and balance and some alertness. Just feeling into the body. Arriving with the body landing the body. And noticing that the body is breathing. You might notice that in the chest, in the belly, feeling of air going in and out of the nose, maybe the shoulders. Sometimes we can feel the breath in our back, this slight movement in the back. But without straining, is there a place in which the attention can rest and kind of ride the waves of breathing. And just hanging in there with an inhale. And exhale. And when the mind wanders. Just very simply, gently begin again. With the sensations of breathing. Can we notice the attitude or mode that the mind is in. Is there a way in which we might just give a little bit of a test drive of kindness. What would that be like to infuse our mindfulness of breathing with kindness. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Bringing to mind a lovable being. Someone for whom it's easy to have some warm feelings, some good will, warm wishes, care, respect, kindness. This can be somebody we know we have an uncomplicated relationship with or perhaps it's somebody we don't know, but somebody who has touched our life. Or maybe it's a pet or an imaginary kittens, puppies, babies. And connecting this lovable being by visualizing them or maybe there's another way she might feel connected to them. And then to support our cultivation development of loving kindness can repeat these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. Healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. And if you find yourself lost in thought or somehow not here with loving kindness, can you be kind to yourself and just very simply begin again. We don't have to make it a problem. When the mind wanders, we just begin again. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Extend our loving kindness to a good friend. Bringing them to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. And if you're not here with ease, may you be happy. If you're not here with ease, may you be happy. If you're not here with ease, may you be happy. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. And then to extend a loving kindness to ourselves. Of course we extend loving kindness to ourselves. Sometimes we forget. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Can we extend our loving kindness one more time? Our neutral person, somebody that we don't know. Maybe somebody on this Zoom call. Maybe somebody you see in your neighborhood on occasion. Maybe somebody you see in your neighborhood. Maybe somebody you see in your neighborhood. Maybe somebody you see in your neighborhood. Maybe somebody you see in your neighborhood. Maybe somebody you see in your neighborhood. Maybe somebody you see in your neighborhood. Somebody we don't know. Can we extend some kindness? Extend some metta. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May we extend some kindness. May we extend some kindness. May we bring into mind somebody that we care about, but sometimes they're a little bit irksome. Not the most difficult person in our life. They're a little bit irksome sometimes. You can say this phrase. I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. And then to end this meditation, feeling your feet on the ground. Gently open your eyes. This idea that being unkind is not going to make anything better. Including being unkind to ourselves if we discover that we've been unkind. We don't have to add an unkindness on top of an unkindness. We don't have to beat ourselves up. We have to get activated in these types of situations. Maybe learn from them. It can be helpful to talk with others about these ideas. That there will never be a situation where being unkind to yourself, others, or the situation that confronts you is going to make anything better. Ever. I mean, as part of a breakout group or have an opportunity to talk about this idea with others, that it won't make anything better. Being unkind. So, well, you'll be in groups of three or four and have an opportunity to discuss some of these ideas. And it can be helpful to just say one thing and then it goes to the next person and they say one thing and then it goes to the third person and they say one thing and then it comes to the fourth person and then back around to the first. So, everybody's doing more listening than speaking. And then it comes back around to the first person and then it can go maybe you'll have to make a few times around the circle. And in this way it allows everybody to have an opportunity to have something to say and kind of give a format other than, oh my goodness, we only have three minutes left. So, everybody else say something, you know, to kind of get so you don't have that. Where one person ends up doing most of this speaking. And let's go in alphabetical order. So by your screen name. And here we go. Does anybody have a question or comments something they'd like to share. How was that talk about this idea of kindness and being unkind won't make things better. Yes, Nancy. I'm sharing with my group that I had some didn't like the phrase as much as I did. The one where you talked about trying always be loving and if you can't be loving be kind. If you can't be kind, then do no harm. If you can't do no harm than do as little harm as possible. It seemed to allow more of a predation of how you can be kind or do to choose the wiser path phrase today seem more absolutist. And so I guess I just prefer the other one. Yeah, yeah. But can you say Nancy can you think of a situation in which to be unkind would make things better. I can't the only thing that I shared with my group is that I have had an occasion working when I was making an argument in court where we were going after somebody who we considered had done something very wrong. And I was very forceful in my advocacy and very passionate about it. And I wouldn't consider that kindness, but I, I considered it more of what you said about that not being a doormat for people and to go ahead and you can stand your ground. Yeah, so, yeah, it's hard for me to think that anything I said in that moment was kind. But it was necessary. I see. Thank you. Thank you. Anybody else have something they like to share question. So I was in Nancy's group and I had a much different reaction to the quote I didn't see it as like, you know, a command, you must be kind but more like an invitation to, you know, got to check it out that when I feel unkind to just ask is, is this helpful in this situation. I just see like what I think, because I have a lot of impulses that, you know, the bad, bad parts of me and other people should be corrected with unkindness. You know this kind of self righteous, you know, this, this should be corrected with unkindness so it's just. It's like an invitation to stop and say, could kindness, do more help than unkindness in this situation. Yeah, thank you, Christine. I find myself often doing that too when I encounter language this absolutist language never ever always try to feel like, well, wait, is there, is there a time that this would make sense. That's kind of what you're pointing to also is this inquiry like, would it make, is it helpful here, where would it be helpful to be unkind. Yeah. Thank you. Barbara. My group also brought up another way of behaving and that is avoidance. This is going to avoid this. Yeah, yeah, sometimes that's the kind thing to do for ourselves or for the person. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to start with one minute after the hour here so thank you. Thank you all for your practice and your engagement and kind of like, you know, thinking about these things instead of just letting them just wash over. I appreciate that very much. I can leave it behind. So, maybe we can unmute and say goodbye in a raucous way. So, goodbye and thank you. Thank you. See you.
