 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Arriving with yourself in this body. Sometimes I have the feeling of kind of a gathering. It just feels almost like coming together of various strands of my experience here in this moment. The mental, the physical, emotional, all kind of arriving together and being connected with, with mindfulness, awareness. The awareness is really what allows us to arrive. Also just in a simple way, perhaps acknowledging this body sitting here. The physicality, the weight of the body sitting or perhaps lying or standing for some. Any sensations in the body. Perhaps sensations of coolness or heat, moisture or dryness. Movement. Perhaps the movement of the breath. The body is often one of the easiest places to begin arriving with ourselves. Perhaps too we might be able to connect with within the body a broader sense of how you are. How that expresses itself in the body in this moment. Not an individual sensations, but the broad, all that is happening. Sometimes that experience is not one that is easily named. Sometimes it feels a little fleeting or vague, perhaps diffuse, sometimes pervading. And sometimes quite obvious, sometimes strong. Perhaps checking in with that, that kind of experience. It's almost like the internal landscape of the body. Connecting with that, if you have a sense of that, sometimes it can take some time to be able to sense that experience in the body. That broad sense of how you are reflected through the body is very often connected with the emotional mental realm. So perhaps landing with that broader sense and maybe having a sense of, or curious about maybe what emotion might this be connected with. Can the heart remain soft? The area around the heart remaining soft while receiving how you are in the physical and mental realm. Not judging, not even trying to understand it, but just feel it. Can you feel it? Be with it how you are right now. Just witnessing being seen by yourself without needing to change, figure out, fix, or hold on to. Because our experience does change. And so sometimes in connecting with this how we are in this way, it may feel kind of fleeting, like sand slipping through fingers. It's like an image I used recently, kind of like the way the northern lights shift and change. And just being with how you are. Allowing the heart and mind to relax and simply be with, receive. Just how you are. Just this. Just this in this moment. Just this in this moment. Just this in this moment. It's quite likely that the mind will wander out of the connection with how you are, get lost in thought. There will be some moment where there's a remembering. Remembering yourself again, remembering to connect with experience here and now. In that moment, maybe just the simple checking in with how you are now. Again, this moment. Receiving. There's nothing to get back to. Things may have shifted and changed. So opening again to the body. And maybe if it's available, the sense of all that, how you are as a whole. Body and mind together. Relaxed. Awareness. Receiving. Just this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
