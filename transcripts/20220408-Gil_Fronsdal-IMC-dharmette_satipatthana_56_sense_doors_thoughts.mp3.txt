The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, this week we're talking about the Buddha's instructions for how to practice with the sense
doors, and it's to be aware of each door, the object that that sense door takes in.
So, for eyes it's sight objects, for hearing it sounds, for the tongue it's taste, for the nose it smells,
for the body it's tactile experiences, and for the mind it's thinking.
The word for mind here is mano, M-A-N-O, which maybe is closely associated with the thinking part of the mind.
And so, if it kind of goes along with the other senses, the mind produces thoughts and that is somehow registered or known
by the mano, by this part of the mind that recognizes their thinking.
And then on top of that, in addition to that, there's a kind of mindful knowing, so it's not just kind of vaguely or somewhat
aware that there's thoughts going on, but this knowing of mindfulness is a clear kind of definitive,
like, oh, this is thinking, this is just thinking.
You don't necessarily have to say those words to yourself, but there's a way in which we step back or turn around
and look thinking directly in the eye and say, I see you, thinking, this is thinking, and observe it.
And I think this idea of being a naturalist of thinking conveys the idea that the thinking is natural, a natural phenomenon,
and we are observing it, but not necessarily defining ourselves or identifying ourselves with the thoughts.
And this is a fascinating and wonderful thing to allow a thought to arise, but to not place ourselves in the thought.
Some people live in their thoughts, their whole identity or their kind of feeling or sense of eminence, I am, I exist,
is somehow taken up residency in the middle of thinking, and so it's inconceivable to think about not thinking
because that's who I would be if I wasn't thinking.
It's also, some people feel lost if they're not kind of living in their thoughts,
but we don't have to live in our thoughts, we don't have to take residency in our thoughts.
We can have thought just be a phenomena that arises that's no different than going outside for a walk
and a leaf blows off a tree and blows down next to you, and you don't take the tree as you, you don't define the leaf as you,
you don't define yourself by the leaf, you don't maybe necessarily get involved with wanting to take the leaf home,
and deciding that you're a great leaf selector and you need to let everyone know what a great capacity you have of selecting leaves from the sidewalk.
You don't get involved, just the leaf just falls, and it's just, you know, it's maybe a nice part of the, just, just falls.
So the same way thinking, thoughts can just be the same relationship to them where we take up residency,
not in the thinking of the thoughts, but in the awareness of them, the knowing of them.
Now it's a little bit tricky because a knowing of them could be seen as a thought itself,
but this is a, we're talking about maybe different levels of thinking, different kinds of thinking,
and the very simple thought that knows, oh that's thinking, that's just a thought.
That's also a natural phenomena, but that's a natural phenomena that supports this freedom, supports this disentanglement.
As we begin to, so this whole thing about the sense doors is quite fascinating because the more and more we are able to kind of be present at the point of sense contact,
and recognize the not, the entanglement, the bias that we're leaning into or pulling back, we start seeing our bias, our prejudices, our desires,
the influences we bring on top of it.
And we are seldom innocent observers, we often have preferences, wanting and not wanting, and it can be very, very subtle.
I told this story before, but when I was a teenager, I went to Morocco, and I don't know how it is now,
but when I was there, the men wore yalabas, these gowns, striped gowns, vertically stripes,
and as I was walking around after some while, being in Morocco, I had this funny feeling that my mind was lighter, clear,
so there was a little different feeling in my mind, and as I kind of tried to understand what was going on,
I came to the conclusion that in the United States, I pegged people, I didn't just see people, I had a judgment about people,
because I recognized something about them, that was a jock, that was some kind of businessman, or this or that,
and I had little judgments about them, and maybe judgments were not exactly conscious, but they were there.
In Morocco, where all these men were wearing yalabas, I had no context understanding anything about them,
about their professions, what they did, their politics, all kinds of things,
and so my mind was lighter from not making any extra judgments,
so to not live in ordinary thinking, but to live in awareness, the awareness in which this arises,
and then be able to see the entanglement, the knot, and a big part of the knots, the entanglements we have, is in fact to thinking,
because if I see something, I don't necessarily automatically get entangled to that, I do have a thought about it,
and it's a thought that I get caught in, somehow the knot around the thing I'm seeing,
and so to be able to settle back and observe thinking, to be aware of thinking, to be quiet enough, still enough, open enough,
present enough to see the birth of a thought, to see a thought appear.
There it is, and it's just a thought.
And then are you entangled with it? Do you chase it? Do you then have a follow-up thought and a follow-up thought,
or do you just allow the thought to just be there like a leaf, the same single leaf that's falling from the sky?
Just a thought.
And then that kind of freedom that gives of seeing and not being involved in thoughts,
it gives us a freedom to then choose what we think. And there are things to think about,
and one of the things to think about is goodwill, is kindness, is friendliness, is support to others,
is to appreciate people.
I think that it's all too easy for people to have a negativity bias, and for all kinds of reasons,
and be predisposed to seeing what's wrong and what's not right.
But if we can choose what we're thinking about, maybe we can choose appropriately, appropriate ways,
to really appreciate people and see their beauty and their wonderfulness,
choose to think about how to support people and be friendly to people.
Maybe that seems like a lot of work and extra to do, a little artificial to do that,
but it might be better than the alternative.
If you're watching your mind carefully, choose the best alternative for the mind.
Don't choose the alternative, the option that is for your detriment,
thinking critical thoughts, judgmental thoughts, harsh thoughts, unkind thoughts.
It's not really healthy.
So thinking, thoughts, mano.
So this level of practice of this, talking about this week, where we are tuning into the knots,
we can begin to also start seeing the conditions, how we get knotted,
the desires that arise, the aversions that are there, the frustrations, the stresses we're living under,
the stress we have, that they're kind of the conditions for us to more likely get knotted up.
And knowing those conditions, then we can kind of maybe adjust those conditions
so it's easier to know how to let go of the knots.
We don't necessarily have to let go of the thought, but we let go of being involved in it and caught in it.
And this is a wonderful thing to let go of knots, to dissolve the knots, to untie the knots in the mind.
One of the reasons it's wonderful is that knots take up a lot of space in the mind, a lot of energy, a lot of bandwidth.
And when that bandwidth is not preoccupied with the knots, there's then much more room, open space,
for the factors of awakening, for some really also natural phenomena,
but natural phenomena that's really kind of some of the great treasures that are within us.
And those are the seven factors of awakening.
And that's the next exercise for the Satybetana text.
It goes from the six sense bases to the seven factors of awakening.
And then we make a transition now to looking at what leads to liberation to freedom.
If we get a hang of the aspects that keeps us from being free, the hindrances, the aggregates that we talked about last week,
and now the fetters, the knots that we get, we know what those are well, those are the things that keep us from being free.
And as we release them and free ourselves from them, then this new energy, this new possibility states can come,
ones that are onward leading towards freedom.
And this is one of the great kind of rewards for doing mindfulness practice.
When we get to the point in practice where we start flowing in these beautiful seven factors of awakening, mindfulness,
investigation, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity.
So that'll be the topic for two weeks.
Next week, Matthew will be here, and Matthew, Ben Silver, and doing the seven AM teachings while I'm away.
And then the following week, I'll be back.
I won't be here at IMC, but I'll be back on the YouTube, and we'll do the seven factors of awakening.
Thank you.
