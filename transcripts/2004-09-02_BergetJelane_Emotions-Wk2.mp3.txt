 Welcome to all of you for our second week on emotions. How many of you were here last week? A good number, yes. And a lot of new faces. Well, we'll do a little bit of review. But I'd like to start by asking those of you that were here last week what you discovered over this past week about emotions, your emotions. Did you check in with yourself? Did you find habitual patterns? Habitual reactions, perhaps? Did you learn something new about yourself, about your emotional life? What did you find? I noticed that the perspective on holding things has a lot to do with emotions that happen. And what I'm focusing on. And so if I'm thinking about the things in my life that I'd like to be different or better, and I have a perspective that, oh, you know, everything's just not quite right yet in my life, I have one set of emotions. And then I would encounter all these other people in my life. And oh my god, their problems are nuts and enormous and huge and terrible in a lot of ways. And then I look at my life and I go, you know, things are pretty good in my life. I feel completely different. Nothing has actually changed. It's just the way, the perspective I have on it. Yes. I'm completely different on my own. And when you recognized that, when you saw that, what was your response? Well, there was a mental part of that, which is, so I really am in control, in a way, of what I experienced just by shifting. You know, being mindful and being able to shift the focus of my attention, I actually do have a large measure of control over the emotions I experience, the experience that I have. So on a mental level with that, and on an emotional level, there has just kind of been ease of, you know, there's just all this stuff on the surface that just changes all the time. And it's kind of like where my mind tends to put it. You know, that all, you know, at another deeper level just doesn't really matter at all. And so then just kind of settling into a piece around that. It's nothing really that needs to be worried about. And as long as I'm not holding this perspective or that, you know, this sort of thought, you know, everything is probably pretty okay just for that. Wonderful. So a couple things come to my mind. One is, it seems to me it points out the unreliability of emotions. That as you say, they're not solid and fixed. But depending on where your attention is, they change. I think that can be both surprising and helpful. That they're not, they're not so solid. It makes me think of a saying that energy follows attention. So where our attention goes, that's where our energy goes. Yeah, this is sort of a little similar to what you were saying, but I was just noticing how the same thing can happen that would trigger a strong emotion for me. And if it's right after, say, I've just been sitting and my body is fairly calm and there's a real sense of presence and a kind of gravity to how I feel, you know, then a thing happens and there's no reactivity. But if it happens later in the day, say after a certain amount of nervous energy is built up, and there's like a subtle kind of buzzing going on in the body that I'm not tuning into, but it's almost like the same event can happen and it's like hitting an electric fence or something, you know, and it just sends off and starts a big reaction. And it's really a, just physical, different physical states seem to predispose into sensitivity. So both also point to the reactivity that emotions are reactions to something. And that reaction can be tempered, can be drastically changed by whatever our present situation is. Which is, from what you're saying, a very good reason for us to be mindful, slow our lives down, and keep that buzz low, right? Keep ourselves as relaxed, as centered, as calm as we can, because then our reactions, our emotions do tend to be very, very different. If we're going at high speed all the time, I think we can all feel it, you know, it just really revs up the body, and then the reaction is, you know, much different. Yes? Uh-huh, yes? I tried to experiment with your suggestion of being more mindful of where in my body I was sensing an emotion, asking myself, okay, am I stressed right now, am I happy, or is it in my body, so when a negative emotion just starts to happen in me, in my body, then I can detect it and say, okay, that's what it is. But what I found was that I was trying to work with it in my mind too much. Okay, I am feeling very frustrated right now, okay, that's what it is. But then I immediately wanted to fix it. There's something about it. What am I supposed to do with it? I found it very difficult to just view emotion. I wanted to do something about it or have a solution ready for it. So I would imagine that that comes in time, that you're able to say to yourself, okay, that's the emotion, and I can just let it be, and then to relate to it with how necessarily having to do something about it. I really don't know how to just be with you. I have to do something about it. You hit on the key point. I think it's quite difficult at first for all of us to just be with emotions. We're so used to reacting. We're so used to doing something, changing it somehow, getting rid of it or encouraging it, and the thought of just letting it be, or actually the experience of just letting it be. It's almost frightening. Yes. I don't know what to do. Yes, that's right. And that's exactly what we're wanting to learn, to just let it be. Yes. I found when I actually acknowledged an emotion that it made it less severe by the fact that it was something that was not... Give me a little second. You can stand back and say, okay, I'm anxious about this. I know I'm anxious. The effect was almost immediate that I wasn't as anxious anymore about what I was anxious about to begin with. Yes, yes. Doesn't always work. But sometimes it does, and that's very valuable. Yes. Going on that, I read through it. I read a couple weeks ago that a good friend of mine used terminal brain cancer. And before that, I was feeling a lot of anxiety, you know, irrespective of what I feel about the whole thing. I was finding myself wanting to fix his emotions. Not wanting him to feel a certain way or feeling uncomfortable around those strong emotions. And I somehow wanted to step in and take care of him and immediate that. And knowing that I can't and that he has to go through this. And it's easier to step back now. What made it easier? What made it easier to step back? A little time notation in your mind. Did you see, were you able to be aware of what the motivation was for wanting to alleviate his feelings? Well, some of it was selfish if I didn't want to come out. Seeing him panic and lose it and express strong emotions. That was one of my problems. Of course I wanted to alleviate him and make him feel better. It was also my distress at not being able to control the situation. Yes, I think that's so useful for us to see because that's so often the case. It's hard for us to tolerate strong emotion in somebody else because it makes us uncomfortable. And it might be that we have some of that same strong emotion that we have resisted looking at or as you say, it makes us uncomfortable that we can't do anything. That we can't fix it. You can't change it for him. It's a very important recognition. Yes? After last week was my first time doing it. I have a fear of flying to an airline pilot. I used some techniques. Breathing. I would look out the window or I'd start breathing and I'd keep my mind focused on breathing. Or something out the window that was you know like a star or whatever. So when we landed my husband said he was a captain and he said he didn't yell at me one more time. He'd tell him to build a turbine or whatever. And I said yeah I didn't. I said you're getting better. I couldn't do anything about it. But I think what I hear is you weren't struggling against it. You let it be. It's hard. Very good. I was just talking and reminding me of an experience that I had actually. There were times, the exercise was great because I consciously checked in to see what I was feeling. I don't know if I normally do that normally. It's like if I'm feeling it then I wake up and then I'm like I'm feeling it. So there were times when I kind of remembered to do it and I couldn't figure out just what I was feeling or it didn't seem like I was feeling anything. And then I got alarmed by that. And then there was another time when I was feeling anxiety and I didn't know why. And then I got more alarmed by that because I couldn't figure out why I was feeling and so there was like this secondary reaction where the mind wanted to know why or what. But then I did manage to because I thought okay let's just do the exercise. Followed, the anxiety was this tension and pressure in my chest and I stayed with it for about two hours and included driving and I was driving the mountains and I realized at one point that I had to see one tree. I loved this drive. I had missed most of it. But what I was noticing is that it moved down into my belly and then I got to the place and I was teaching a class and I was noticing it moved back up and then it moved down and then part of the class was the meditation and I noticed the end of the meditation. It was gone. And I figured out why I was there but what I did was I was in about two hours it left. It processed. But I did manage to stay with it was an interesting thing and also where was the body was something I hadn't ever stayed with that consciously before. Quite an exercise. Wonderful. Sometimes we find that we do hold things in certain places. Certain tightness in the chest or in the shoulders or in the back. That's a habitual holding and with that kind of attention and staying with it may relax and not continue. Mm hmm. I've been in the life of a lot of pressure and demands on me. I've been doing a lot of things. Some of which I am not sure I know how to do. I've had a lot of anxiety and fear around that. I'm very aware that if you're in the anxiety it makes it more difficult to do what I need to do because it's like I almost don't see everything that's in front of me and you can't find something because you don't see it. It's harder to get it done metaphorically as well as physically. This week I noticed and I've heard people say this before but this week the first time I noticed that while from day to day reality hadn't changed I still had to do the same stuff that I always had to but some days I felt good and easy about it. Some days I felt and it's much easier to cope when you're feeling okay about it than when you're feeling tense about it. I wish I could engineer this. I could just... Feel good all the time. I could relax. I got a little bit further than that but not much but just that perception is like beep. Yes. And that's what's so helpful to be able to see that and to recognize that all that is within us. As you said, reality hadn't changed one bit. But my perception or my reaction certainly had changed. Anybody else? I felt something similar to anxiety but it was the morning after last Thursday, 4 o'clock in the morning woke up with an awareness of anxiety. I didn't realize that had been numb and somehow probably this triggered more awareness. It felt like I was at a panic attack and I went to the other room and laid down and breathed into it and I felt it more in the abdomen and I tried just to stay with it and to breathe through it and it took me 20 minutes but it did dissipate and I became aware of what it was about and I just needed more information. And I did get it over the next couple of days and it felt a lot better. It was odd. I had never been aware that with anxiety for me it was in the abdomen. And so it felt good to be aware that it wasn't going to stay there forever. It felt in the beginning like it was never going to go away. It was a horrible thing that I couldn't handle. But it did move and shift and it did dissipate. And you learned you could handle it. Yeah. That's an important learning. I'm wondering whether I tend to run from the negative emotions and they catch up with me before going to the airport. And I think this would be a good practice to try and give my body permission to be aware, give myself time on a regular basis to be aware of it or come up so it doesn't come right after me when I don't have the defenses or the strength. Which can be good too. But it really helped your advice about being aware of where the body was in breathing too. Good. Anything else? I had an experience. Sunday night I thought I would share with you. I happen to be going through a box of memorabilia. Letters and etc. And at some point had the realization I have really been loved and appreciated in my life. And it was a little bit startling. It was a wonderful feeling. And along with that came this gratitude and sort of a vow that I would not forget that. That I would remember that and hold that. I have been loved and appreciated in my life and come from that. And then I had the TV on because I was also watching the Olympics. And some time went by and I don't know how much and I didn't catch the beginning. But at some point I realized the judge, the critic, was really running. Everything from how my house looked to the way I lived in my life or whatever. I can't remember the specifics. And when I realized that I was like, wow, where did that come from? And then at some point a little bit later I realized this not real strong sort of subtle sense of not deserving. And that was surprising also. It's like that again. So I was surprised and there was sort of the disappointment and I guess, oh gosh, I thought that was gone. I thought I had done that. That was over with and there it was again. And then a little bit later the recognition that I think is helpful because it's happened a lot in my life is that a very strong positive emotion will pull up the opposite. Will pull up the shadow, so to speak. Will pull up the negative. And time after time it's really caught me unaware. Finally, at some point I recognized oh yes, oh yes. Actually this is very good news because it's a purification. It's having that strong positive emotion then allows makes it safe almost for the shadow the negative to arise. And then when it's seen and held it can dissipate. So I offer that because as I say it has caught me unaware so many times and I get caught in the critic, the judge the negativity and then what's wrong with me. I've been doing this practice for so many years. I've been there, done that, I thought that the mind proliferates, goes on and on. And when I can recognize oh yes, it's like metta. We do metta practice and that pulls that brings up the non-metta the opposite emotion, which is fine. It just means it's working. It's purifying. It's bringing up the other side for those emotions to be seen and accepted and then they can be let go of or they can relax. So thank you all for sharing that. It's so rich and so useful. I think it's so valuable to hear each other's experience. And then we find that we're not alone. That we all have very similar experiences even though they may sound a little bit different. So I wanted to do a little bit of a review but time is marching on. So I think I'll not do that for right now but I also want to talk a little bit about the relationship between our thoughts and our emotions. Sometimes it's said that emotions follow thinking. We think certain thoughts and that creates a certain emotion. But I've also heard it said just the opposite. That emotions lead to a certain way of thinking. So probably it's both. I think I said last week that I think emotions in this culture are very very complicated. On the one hand in some ways we're told that we should be expressive, we should be open, we should acknowledge and accept our emotions. And then at other times on the other hand we give great adulation to those in our society who are very stoic and don't show their emotions. And I think it's conflicting. I think it's it can be difficult for us sometimes what to do with emotions how to handle emotions. But I think the piece of seeing the relationship between our thoughts and our emotions can be very useful. As I was thinking about it I came to see it at times as sort of a cycle. And in a way it doesn't matter where it starts. It can start with the thinking. That leads to an emotion. Say some kind of negative thinking, judgment or criticism, which leads to a negative emotion. A very strong perhaps whatever sadness or hurt or melancholy or whatever else, anger maybe even. And then the tendency of the mind as people have said is to explain it. Sometimes almost to rationalize it. And that tends to feed it. So then, or fuel it, so then we have more of the emotion which gives rise to more thinking more thoughts, which gives rise to a stronger emotion and before we know it we're really caught in this cycle. So I don't know that it matters too much which started but what is important is the mindfulness we bring when we see that. When we see how closely linked our thoughts and our emotions are. And then, then we can begin to interrupt that cycle. With our mindfulness, with our attention, we can interrupt the cycle. And if we see I have seen, as probably many if not all of you have seen, how the negative, that is what I mean by negative, the critical the judgmental, the comparing the thoughts of I'm not as good as, or I'm not as worthy as, or I'm not competent as, or whatever your particular strand of thinking is. How that proliferates and how we get caught in that and how then it leads to an emotion, a feeling. Sometimes like some of you have said, I find myself feeling kind of melancholy or lack of energy, down we might say sometimes even sad and not knowing why, not where did this come from what am I feeling this for? And sometimes not always, but sometimes I can trace it back and see oh yes, I was judging that I was comparing there, I was being critical here, and it all adds up you know, it's one thing here, one thing there, one thing there, but it adds up. And then I'm feeling this very unpleasant uncomfortable emotion, and I can see it's a result of all this thinking. It took me a long time I'm embarrassed to say, to really really get it, to really see what all that thinking, that judging, that comparing, that criticism was doing to me how it affected me, and how it affected my life, because of course I then acted out of that. And sometimes it was very subtle, I wasn't so aware of it, it would seem on the surface that things were going quite well my life was going quite well, and I wasn't feeling particularly down, or unhappy, or anything. And then at some point I would, or something would happen, something would trigger, and then it would become so clear, I became so aware of how I had sort of allowed myself to go down that slippery slope. There wasn't enough attention, there wasn't enough mindfulness to catch it, and the mind just went down that slippery slope of proliferating the negativity, the judgmentalness, the comparing, the criticism, etc. until at some point then I was down in the hole. And I had to really see the pain of that in my life. How painful that was time after time after time after time. Before at some point I was willing to say literally say enough, no more, I get it, you know, finally I get it. And that doesn't mean that I don't approach that slippery slope, you know, sometimes, not anywhere near what it used to be, but sometimes that comparing mind will rise, or the judgment, or the criticalness. Most often now it arises, I see it, and it falls off. It's like a part of me says, oh no, oh no, not going there again. But it took a long long time. And I say that partly as encouragement, you know, don't give up. You know, it wasn't all downhill, it was very much a spiral, perhaps. Sometimes it felt like I was leading parallel lives. There could be all this negativity, you know, this downer, and at the same time there could be great joy and wonderful things happening. Which made it a little bit confusing. But I could see that it was a spiral, that it wasn't exactly the same as it had been before. It was changing. But sometimes, you know, there's a lot of wounding. There's a lot of junk in there, and it does take time. And sometimes, some of us, I have been so good at covering, I learned somehow very early to cover. And I did it so well that I didn't even see it myself. I fooled myself. So it took a long time for all that that was underneath to bubble up, to come into my awareness, be seen for what it was, and then be let go of. Yeah. So, you said you decided enough, and now you'll notice it, and you'll say it's not going to go. And then, what is your process at that moment? Like, when you're saying not going to, what is it you're actually, internally, doing? There's a recognition. And then there is that mm-mm. So you're directing your attention away from it? I'm like, just letting go. And I would say bringing the attention back to whatever I was doing when it got diverted. So not redirecting it to something else, but more like it's sort of like the Buddha on the night of his enlightenment when he saw Mara, and he said, Mara, I see you. It's kind of like, oh, I see it. Nope. That's, like I say, after a long time. That doesn't just happen right away, but after a long time, now that's pretty much, pretty much, not always, but pretty much what happens. I see it and let go. Yeah, I've had such a similar experience to what you described about really just years or so, getting so much more clear in a lot of things. And it's like there used to be this illusion that this line of thinking was going to lead to some kind of satisfaction. Like, I'm right, you know, I'm wrong, or something. It had its kind of pull, and somehow, just from seeing and seeing and seeing, it's like the mind very quickly now knows that that actually hurts, that that goes to actual hurt. So it's not like you have to exactly do anything. It's just like over the years and years and years of just looking at it. It's like, it doesn't take much action. It's like it's doing it itself. It's like it's saying Yes, yes. It's like you don't have to, like the example of sticking your hand in a fire, you don't have to reason about it a lot once you've done it, once you really get it. It's like gradually the weight of the negative memories of what that really feels like, kind of come to outweigh the positive. It's just that you're going to get some satisfaction out of going that old way. Just kind of, don't do that anymore. Right. Right. And all that attentiveness and all that work in between. So it was years of just attentiveness to, oh, this really hurts, you know. Also noticing what, that you think it's going to, where's the satisfaction in these old habits? You know, these habits of thinking that lead you into misery. Right. It was really helpful to me to see that there was some perverse pleasure in it and to recognize that element. Yeah, I don't remember recognizing the perverse pleasure. I seem to get caught in absolutely believing it. That was my reality. That was truth. And there was some sense that before that I just had been sort of fudging. I hadn't been, you know, but this, you know, this critic, that was absolute truth. And I found it very hard to break that, to let go of that. I had a thought the other day, I think actually it was following this experience that I find very helpful. And that was, it came to me, what if all the beliefs, all the ideas, all the concepts, all that that I grew up with and had based my life on, what if they weren't true? And in that moment I knew they weren't. They were not true. They had some, I don't know, I was going to say validity, I'm not sure that's even true. They were the ideas, the concepts that my family had. And that's all. You know, they're not true. They're just ideas. Most of them actually quite useless. Actually not helpful, not skillful, at all. But I know it has taken over the years learning to feel quite comfortable with a not knowing or a spaciousness. Somebody said to me, you know, I feel sometimes like I'm out in the middle of the ocean around, no land in sight. Just that hanging out in the unknown, hanging out in the wide open. That for a long time was extremely uncomfortable. Very, very hard to tolerate. Over the years I've become more comfortable with that. In fact sometimes, you know, it's quite pleasant. I like it a lot. But I think it took the ability to be comfortable with that. To be able to say, all the ideas, all the beliefs, all the concepts I grew up with are not true. They may have some usefulness, but they're true. They're not the truth. They're just some idea. Some idea of how this is, how that is, how life is, how people are, how, you know, what happens. They're just ideas. They're not necessarily true. In fact, an awful lot of times they were not true. But boy did we hold to them. Anybody else? Have you seen the relationship in your life between your thinking and your emotions? Have you seen how certain thoughts lead to a certain emotion? I've been talking about so-called negative thinking. It can be the opposite as well. When I think, and I used to not believe it and I actually used to be afraid of it. I thought that if I thought good thoughts, that things would go well, that I would be accepted, that it wouldn't happen. It was almost like that was a curse or something. I dare not. I think that probably comes from a family that didn't know how to praise and think well. You're not supposed to think well of yourself. You're supposed to be critical. So there was actually this superstition that if I thought well, it wouldn't happen. Because that's like conceited or something. It was hard to switch that and realize that no, it's the opposite. That if, when I do think well, trust, assume that things will go well, assume that I will do well, that it will work out, that it's okay. It's more likely to be that way. Amazing. So let me do just sort of quickly a reminder of some of the things we talked about last week, partly for those of you that weren't here and a review for those of you that were and a way of sort of wrapping up this two week study of emotions. One of the most important things I think to remember we've talked about is that emotions are processes. They are not solid. They come and go. They change. We can be aware of several emotions in a very short period of time. I was thinking driving up here, we can have several emotions at one time. Probably that's not true. Probably they're sequential. But they may be changing so rapidly that it seems like we're experiencing them all at the same time. But we can be angry and go to sadness and go to hurt and go to relief and go to even happiness and back to anger again very, very quickly. And in fact in the case of death or a loss, that's very often what happens. Things, the emotions can change and cycle so quickly. It seems like they're all happening at the same time. Probably as I say they are sequential. But seeing that they're processes and that they do change and even in that process, in that change, there are probably moments of maybe no emotion. Just calm or quiet before the next one arises. And as I said, like with pain, when we recognize that pain isn't solid, it's constantly changing sensations. That helps us to handle it. Helps us to break it up so we're not so caught by the pain. Likewise, we're not so caught by whatever the emotion is. It helps us to know that all emotions are part of the human spectrum. Are part of the human experience. That there's no need to label ourselves as this person or that person or whatever. That all of us experience all of the strange of human emotions. Maybe in varying degrees, maybe at different times, but we all do. And that can help us not to take it so personally. That seems like a funny phrase, but it seems to be helpful. That it's not so personal. We all experience happiness. We all experience anger. We all experience frustration and numbness and compassion and love. And that's just how it is. So that can help us not to get so caught. Not to get so stuck in any one particular emotion. It's so important to somebody who reminded us to be aware of where in the body we experience the emotion. How we experience it. The body does hold emotion. And if we're not aware of it, it can lead to disease, to difficulties in the body. I think I mentioned that we're finding that trauma is held, the experience of trauma, the emotion of trauma is held in the body. And if a person isn't allowed to process, to talk about and process the feelings of that trauma, then those feelings get locked in the body. And in extreme cases, you can literally see people walking around that have a body posture or form that is so clear that they're holding something. You know, they're bent or, I can't think of a good example, but I know not too long ago I saw somebody, very strange body posture and I felt a lot of compassion. I thought that poor person is holding so much stuff. And over time, of course, that affects the muscles, the organs, tendons, and nerves, etc. And can be very painful and lead to very difficult problems. So part of the processing is seeing where in the body we experience the emotion. And also that helps us sometimes to recognize the emotion. If we're not clear what it is we're feeling, sometimes paying attention to the experience in the body will help us to recognize, will help us to see what it is that we're actually experiencing. And it keeps us in our bodies. It keeps us grounded and embodied, as we say. So we're not living in our heads. For a lot of my life, I was not at all comfortable with strong emotion. And I came to see that my defense was to go up into my head. So as soon as there was the hint of a strong emotion, either my own or somebody else's, I would go immediately up into my head, into thinking. And that kept me at a safe distance. I experienced for a lot of years in meditation, a lot of planning, planning, and nauseam. And when I looked behind that, often I could see there was anxiety or there was fear. So sometimes our thinking process is a way of covering or handling a very strong emotion. That judging, that criticalness can also be a way of handling fear, the unknown. So as you're experiencing a perhaps strong thinking or repetitive thinking, it's a good idea to ask and to look what's underneath. What might be feeling it? Very often there's a strong emotion that is fueling, that sends you up into your head and is fueling whatever that thinking process is. And it's important for us to learn to be with strong emotion. To just allow it and not have to react or act right away. We may act down the road, but many people will say one of the most valuable things they've gotten out of this practice is learning to tolerate strong emotion. To just be with it. Not have to fix it, not have to change it, not have to push it away, but just be with it. Allow it. I said last week, because I remind myself we can tolerate strong emotion. Often we think we can't. And we push it away or we refuse to recognize it because there's the fear that it will overtake us. We won't be able to handle it. Sometimes there's literally a fear of dying. That we won't be able to survive a very, very strong emotion. So it's helpful to remind ourselves we actually already have, because we're here. We're living. And we can in fact tolerate re-experiencing. We may need a lot of support. It may be over time. We may experience it and back away, experience it and back away, experience it and back away for a long time. But we can tolerate it. It will not harm us. And it can be a great relief to people to realize and to be able to practice just being with very strong emotions. Not having to act on them. Either positively or negatively. I've acted on both. And sometimes that's not skillful. But just allow them to be, allow them to process. And then when we get more clarity, decide what is the most skillful course of action. Or what is it that we need to do. I'm reminded of another personal example recently. For the last few months I've had a neighbor who has I was going to say taken a disliking to me. I don't know exactly what it is. But has been writing letters to the board of directors where I live complaining about me and my dog. Most of it is untrue. The fact that I was walking her off leash was true but everything else was untrue. And, you know, it has become somewhat unpleasant. So I at first thought the best course of action was pretty much ignore it. I did go and try to talk to him and that wasn't very successful. I wrote a nice letter which he told me was very stupid. And then there came a point. Because one Saturday a few weeks ago I actually found him coming over to the park where I was with my dog. Watching. Watching me. And driving around. Watching. And that I didn't like too well. And I decided that it was time to be fierce. It was time for action. That it wasn't going to work. Just being nice or just not doing anything. And somebody had suggested to me one time, you know, maybe you could scare him. And I sort of brushed it off. But after that I thought, yes. So the next time I saw him outside I approached him. And in my very angry voice, which I can do pretty well, I said, don't you do anymore. You know, I really, for a minute, I was very fierce and very angry. Don't follow me again. Don't write another letter. If you do, I will call the police. And you know, he didn't react very well. But anyway, I went home and I felt the anger, the heat, the energy. It wasn't real strong, but it was clearly there. And a little bit later, really not very long, I found myself chuckling. And I realized that I wasn't really holding on to the anger. That it was there. I think I used it appropriately. And then it was gone. And that was a wonderful recognition. That I could, I think, who knows, but I think skillfully use the anger and then let go. Not be attached to it. I didn't have to hold on to that anger. It was gone. And there are times I can do loving kindness for this man. And I think I genuinely mean it. And then I want you to know a little while later, up will come. I hate him. You bastard. You're making my life miserable. And at first it was like, whoa, what? I've just been doing loving kindness. And then again, I recognized, yes, of course, the loving kindness will pull up the negative. I don't have to get upset. I don't have to get caught in it. I can see it and, okay, actually both are there. I do wish this man will. For him and for me both. Because it would be a lot easier if he were happier he wouldn't bother me. And at the same time there's a noance that he's doing this. And I have to go through certain things to handle it. But that ability to experience the emotion, use it skillfully and let go. That's how we can come to appreciate and with awareness use our emotions so they don't run us. They're not controlling us. They're there and we can skillfully use them. So we're just at nine o'clock. Anybody have a burning comment or thought? Yes. I have a particular aspect of being fierce or not inverted, but sometimes people can say mean things and let go of it. And then excited on comfortably. I think I've run into people that are like that before a few times and I wonder if that is a wholesome act where it seems like what they want to do is to act out their emotions on you and then count it on you and they have been fine after that and they care less what happened. What is the effect of the words? I'm not sure how you would distinguish that from the more what you see as the more skillfully use of anger. Are there a fine line there? There's a difference for sure. I'm very glad you asked the question. Yes. Because for me there's a very big difference between being fierce and being mean. I did not in any way mean to imply meanness. Fierceness for me is just the skillful use of that energy. That strong for me at this point it was anger because I thought that's what was most useful at this particular point. Maybe it wasn't, but that was my take on it. That for me that was not dumping. That was not mean. I did not call names. I did not say anything that I thought was unkind even. It was just stop doing to me what you're doing. For me that's fierce not mean. And dumping I think as you describe I don't think that's skillful. Most of the time that is not skillful. But there's a difference between just pouring out an emotion just dumping it. And over time being aware and choosing to say something. To do something. To share something perhaps. Because that seems the most skillful at the moment. Does that clarify it again? Good. Okay let's sit for just a moment. . . . . . . So we end with dedicating the merit. Any merit that we may have accrued this evening by our practice together. May we share it with all those that we come into contact with as we leave here. May it be for the benefit of all beings so that all beings may live at peace be happy and be free. . Have a safe journey home.
