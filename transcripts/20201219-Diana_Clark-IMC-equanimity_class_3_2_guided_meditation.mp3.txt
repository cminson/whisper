The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, let's do some meditation together.
We can, if you'd like, move to a different location to
provide an opportunity for the body to have some ease
and taking a moment to settle in.
It can be worthwhile to, at the beginning here,
spend a little time with balance in the posture.
If you'd like to have balance in our meditation,
balance in the posture can be really supportive.
Maybe this means rocking back and forth, finding that place that feels
that there's some uprightness, as well as some ease.
And to feel yourself sitting.
Perhaps feeling the sensations of touch, of pressure with the floor,
the cushion on the feet, the legs, the back side.
Maybe the back, sitting in a chair, and bringing an aliveness of attention
and mindfulness, awareness into the body, into the bodily experience right now.
Inhabiting the body with aliveness, with presence.
Live to how the body is at this moment.
Maybe check in with those areas where we often hold tension
to help support this arriving to this moment.
The areas are in the face, and the eyes, the jaw, the shoulders.
Perhaps with the bringing of attention, there can be a recognition of some tightness.
And it might be that this tightness can soften, let go.
It might not be, also, and that's okay.
We don't have to insist or demand that areas of tightness loosen,
or just creating the conditions in which they might.
It's never possible right now.
We're not just sitting and tuning into, perhaps, relaxing the belly,
softening the chest,
being that to be just a little bit more open.
Can we be with the experience of the bodily life right now,
opening to it, allowing it, welcoming the bodily experience.
Okay.
Is it possible
to set the sense of direction, if you will,
for the next period of meditation is one of warmth, kindness, and openness.
This general orientation.
Holding yourself in a kind attitude, with care, with warmth.
Softening any sense of having to get somewhere, having to do something.
Instead of opening the tone of allowing, welcoming warmth and care.
And then feeling the rhythm.
The movement of the body associated with breathing.
If it's available to you, it can be helpful to notice the sensations of breathing with the nose, the nose.
It's a little more subtle than the movement, the chest, or abdomen.
But we don't want to strain, so noticing the breath wherever it's comfortable.
And maybe the place that encourages some little bit of settling or collecting.
Settling and collecting with a sense of spaciousness and ease.
Find a balance between having a sense of spaciousness and noticing the sensations of breathing.
Can we allow any energy or imbalances, this feeling of too much energy or not enough energy?
Can we allow those to fade? Sometimes it's helpful to expand our awareness.
Make room, if you will, whatever the energy might be.
In the same way, you can make space, so to speak, or maintain a sense of spaciousness that allows the sense of push and pull, or I want, I don't want.
Allow those to soften.
Allow those to soften.
Allow in the thoughts that are arising.
Of course, there are thoughts that arise, allowing them to fade into the background, not giving them as much attention.
And in this way, maybe the thoughts move from being book chapters, just single sentences or words.
Just single sentences or words.
And then we can bring our attention in a relaxed, gentle way, towards any sensations of well-being, any sensations of okayness.
We don't have to pounce on them, we don't have to search desperately for them, but allowing those experiences to come into the mind may not be the only thing that's happening.
It may be only a small amount about what's happening, but can we incline the mind that direction?
Touch into this experience of maybe a little bit of contentment, a little bit more quiet.
Allow those sensations, allowing them to get as big as they would like.
It's about allowing, not so much about forcing or making.
Maybe what was just a small experience of well-being is now a little bit bigger.
And maybe not too.
And then is there a way in which you might allow what is underneath the well-being to be known?
Maybe there's a really deep pool of steadiness, a spacious, open, easy experience.
It's a little bit deeper than the well-being.
Allowing that to be known.
Maybe that's not what's arising, can you be okay with what is arising?
Maybe even underneath the frustration or irritation, there still might be some contentment, some okayness.
And then to end this meditation, you feel your feet on the ground, feel the pressure, the chair, or cushion against the body.
And when you're ready, gently open the eyes.
Thank you, thank you.
