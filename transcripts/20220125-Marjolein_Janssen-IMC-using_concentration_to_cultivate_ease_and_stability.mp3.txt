The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
And I know Andrea started at the topic of right concentration in the past weeks,
so I'd like to add to that topic by offering some reflections on it, on concentration in general.
I won't really talk about the deep concentration states of Jhana that you might have heard of,
but I'll talk about it in a way that is relevant in our day-to-day lives and in our daily formal sittings.
So the Pali word, Pali is the language which some of the oldest scriptures were written down in.
And the Pali word for concentration is Samadhi.
Sometimes this word is also being translated as one-pointedness or collectedness.
And there's this monk, Buddha Gosha, who in the 5th century wrote a commentary to the Buddha's teachings.
And he says, concentration has non-destruction as its characteristic.
Its function is to eliminate distraction and it's manifested as non-wavering.
End quote.
In any given moment we are focused on something.
And what we do when we practice concentration is that we direct this focus towards one object
instead of letting it just go free our focus and that the focus just goes wherever it wants, kind of the wavering aspect.
And different teachers have different perspectives on concentration.
Some teachers say that developing concentration is actually necessary on our path towards awakening,
while others say that when we practice mindfulness we develop concentration in a natural way
without having to actively develop the concentration through focusing on one object.
And I think there is not a right or wrong viewpoint here.
I think that different methods might work for different people and that's why different teachers give different teachings around it.
We're all a little bit different in what we need and what is most helpful for our minds with our specific conditionings.
So I'd like to start with explaining a bit more in-depth the viewpoint of one of the teachers that has influenced my practice a lot,
which is the Burmese monk Sayadaw Utechaniah, and he's also one of Andrea's teachers.
And then I want to dive in deeper a little bit in what I found useful in working with concentration in my daily life and in my daily sits.
So Sayadaw Utechaniah is one of the teachers who says that concentration develops in a natural way when we are mindful or aware.
So in general, he doesn't really encourage to practice concentration in the way that we did it today.
He emphasizes that the practice of open awareness, which is what his method is being called nowadays.
I don't think he might not call it himself open awareness practice, but that's what we call it now in the West.
And he says that this open awareness practice leads to a form of concentration by itself.
So with open awareness, we open the minds towards all objects.
We don't pick and choose our object, and the objects just arise and they pass away in this open space of awareness.
One object after the other, we're not trying to make anything happen, we're not trying to make anything appear or go away.
So it's a very receptive, allowing awareness of present moment phenomena.
And if we practice this type of mindfulness meditation, then we will develop a certain degree of concentration in a natural way.
That's also my own experience.
And in the suttas, this is called moment-to-moment concentration, which in the language Pali is called kanika samadhi.
So in a way, we don't have to do anything extra, like focusing on one object like we did today.
And that might be one of the reasons that Saira Otishin here doesn't really encourage to do the concentration practice as a standalone practice.
He does make an exception of when it is useful to practice this way.
And that is when we are overwhelmed.
So when we are overwhelmed, we can't really be present for what is, but we're actually really caught in the overwhelm,
and it's hard to just be with that overwhelm.
So in these cases, Saira Otishin says, like, focus on a single object.
And he says, like, it doesn't really matter what object you choose too much.
It can be the breath, it can be the touch points of the body, like I referred to in the meditation.
It can even be something visual.
My own interpretation may be a flame of a candle or something like that.
So he does see purpose in concentration meditation at times.
And what actually happens when we do this focusing on a single object is that we distract the mind from anything else that is going on.
So if we are overwhelmed, maybe we feel very upset about something,
then we take our attention away from this upsetness and direct it towards something else that is more neutral,
like the breath, if it's a neutral object for you.
Please choose something else if it isn't neutral, if you have some sort of, you know, physical or traumatic experience around the breath,
and you should choose something else.
So this focusing on this one object distracts the mind, so to speak,
and it will allow the upsetness to dissipate in the background.
And one way of seeing that is that we don't feed this upsetness anymore.
We are actually putting in place something more wholesome,
because the cultivation of concentration is a wholesome thing to do.
And this will allow the mind to find some calm and ease and stability.
This doesn't always work, but if it works, it's helpful and can be very useful and skillful to try.
So that's about Saira Oteshaniya and how he approaches concentration.
And over the years I've reflected quite a bit about this topic also, because there are so many different viewpoints on it.
And then I started off with concentration practice and then went to Saira Oteshaniya.
And I felt like really in line with what he was thinking about concentration,
and I felt really at home in his practice.
But later on I started to experiment a bit more with concentration again,
both on retreat and in daily life.
And for the purpose of this talk I'll talk about our day-to-day lives and sittings.
So what I started to find was that the concentration, so the focusing on one object,
can actually be a useful tool in day-to-day practice.
So not only when I feel overwhelmed or anything, but just more in general as well.
And one of the things that I figured was that concentration is actually a wholesome quality of the mind.
So when the mind is, even if it's just a little bit collected, it already gives rise to more wholesome states of mind.
It might start to feel a bit more ease, a bit more relaxation, a bit more calmness.
And this is really wonderful and very beneficial states of mind.
So let's say there can be like a real difference, as you can imagine,
if we are in a place of stress and we act out from that in the world
compared to when the mind is at ease and calm and collected.
So it doesn't have to be like super collected, like being super focused on the breath or something,
just a bit more collected and not as much wavering and scattering of the mind.
So you can imagine that when you feel stressed and then a colleague criticizes the projects that you have worked on very hard.
You know, then in that case you might feel really triggered and like ready to snap at your colleague.
But if you feel more relaxed and at ease, then your colleague might express this same criticism to your project.
And then you can maybe see that, oh, maybe it's actually useful feedback to improve my project.
So it can be really different outcomes depending on what the mind state is that we have.
So the wholesomeness that comes forward from a mind that is not so scattered and it is not all over the place,
but that is somewhat collected and somewhat at ease that can ripple out into other areas of our lives as well.
And I want to dive a bit deeper into this relaxness and calmness that a bit of collectiveness can give us.
And therefore I have a quote from Sayada Otechania.
He says, feeling relaxed is really about being free of expectation and anxiety.
You can only be totally relaxed when the mind is free of craving or aversion.
End quote.
So craving and aversion are three of the unskillful roots of existence, the third being delusion.
So those three roots are the roots of all other unwholesome states of mind.
Like greed, like irritation, like frustration, anger, confusion, to name a few.
So we can interpret what Sayada is saying is that in order to feel relaxed the mind needs to be free from unwholesome states of mind.
Or I would add like somewhat free.
I mean we usually have a mixture of unwholesome and wholesome states of mind and it's usually not completely wholesome in our daily lives.
Maybe sometimes it is of course.
And one way of being free from unwholesome states of mind or diminish them a little bit is by focusing the mind on one object, like the breath.
And this way we collect the mind and we get rid of the distractions of craving and aversion and other unwholesome states that might arise.
And we focus the mind on something that is more neutral, like the breath or the body or whatever we've chosen.
So this can help the unwholesomeness to dissipate in the background.
And it's good to notice that it doesn't always happen of course.
It's sometimes it will and sometimes it won't diminish or dissipate.
But why does it, if it does, why does it happen?
Like what does this unwholesomeness, what does it make dissipate or diminish?
And Sayada does give us a clue for that.
He says that once the mind is moving in a wholesome direction, it will keep going and things will unfold naturally.
So what happens when we concentrate the mind is that wholesome mind moments come up.
Concentration, calm, the ease are all very wholesome.
And the not scatteredness of the mind is wholesome.
So technically speaking, we cannot have both unwholesome and wholesome states of mind at the same time.
It might feel sometimes like that, for example, we might feel happy and sad at the same time.
But in reality, what happens is that these mind states alternate really quickly.
The other day, someone told me that they will have to undergo surgery to take care of some medical issue.
And they were happy that their medical issue would be healed, but they also felt anxiety about the surgery.
So these mind states can alternate really quickly and I can see that they are there at the same time while they're actually just alternating.
And every one of these mind moments influences the next mind moment and the next mind moment.
So if we bring in wholesomeness on purpose, like we do when we concentrate the mind, that's one way.
We can of course also do like for example, metameditation or gratitude practice, whatever way we choose.
But if we bring in some wholesomeness on purpose, then we bring in more wholesome mind moments and those will condition the next moments as well.
So if we consciously move our mind in wholesome direction, then we are actively shaping the next moments to be wholesome as well.
So that is why I think that a tool like the concentration like we did today, like really focusing on the breath, works so well.
Because what we're doing is we are building momentum for wholesomeness and we are diminishing the momentum for the unwholesomeness.
And that's maybe also why the Buddha mentions in the suttas, and it's a direct quote,
whatever one frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of the mind.
And knowing all this, we can use this collection, collecting the mind as a tool in our daily lives.
So for example, we can become aware of the inclination of the mind, like Buddha says, what is the inclination of the mind?
Is the mind in any given moment inclined towards wholesomeness or towards unwholesomeness?
And if we notice that the mind is already inclined towards wholesomeness, then great, we can enjoy that and savor that.
And if we notice that the mind is inclined towards unwholesome states of mind, then we can use this concentration tool, it's one of the tools we have.
And we can use this on our cushion, if we do our daily meditation sit, if we have a daily practice, and we can also do it during our daily lives.
So on our cushion, we can start, for example, with like we did today, like with the first part of the meditation, it depends a little bit how long you meditate.
If it's half an hour, you can do five or 10 minutes.
And then in those first minutes, we can focus on the breath for a while.
And we can also do the whole sit, focusing on the breath, but therefore we feel works for us.
And then we open up, if we do it only a certain amount of time, we can open up to all objects at some point.
And during our daily lives, we can also use this tool.
And Gil Fronstal has a tool that he calls the three breath journey.
Maybe you've heard of it.
But we can maybe try it out right now.
And you can do this with eyes open or closed. It doesn't really matter because in our daily lives, you know, we have situations that we cannot close our eyes.
And maybe we're in a Zoom meeting or we're hanging out with friends or whatever we're doing.
But you can still do this three breath journey.
So what you do is, if you try it out, you can bring all your attention to the first inhale.
You can feel all the tiny experiences of the inhale.
Combs in the nostrils, pressure in the chest or abdomen, and so on, all these little sensations, we don't have to name all of them.
And then with the same interest, follow the exhale with all your attention.
Becoming aware of all the small changes that the breath produces.
It's about experiencing directly with or without right labels or words.
And then you do that three times, fully aware for in breath, fully aware for out breath.
And if you've done that, you can open your eyes again or leave them closed, whatever feels good for you.
And again, if the breath is not working for you, you can use those touch points that I introduced in the meditation to do a touch point journey, then you go over all three touch points.
So if you apply this in your daily life, like if you would only do this like a few times during the day,
you can feel the effect of calming effect, relaxing effects, grounding in the present moment.
Can be just this little nudge that we need towards a little bit of a more wholesome state of mind, a little bit of more ease and relaxation.
Another way that we can experience a bit more calmness and ease and presence in body and mind is something that Utechnia actually teaches, which is to focus some of our attention on our bodies and then some of our attention on the outside world,
like a 50-50 is what he calls it, especially useful when we are interacting with other people.
Like, we can have part of our attention on like our bodily experiences while we're also paying attention to what the other person is saying or what we need to say in the conversation.
So right now, just focus on an area in the body, maybe your feet or your breath or the body as a whole, as long as you just choose something and not go wave around in the body.
If you do that, also listen to me, and you could also do this while you're folding laundry or you go for a walk, so it doesn't have to be like in a social situation.
50% on your body and 50% on the rest of what you're doing.
You can try it out while I'll talk some more, see if that works for you and how you can stay grounded in the present moment if you do that.
So these two exercises, the three breath journey and the 50-50 exercises are some pointers that we can use during our daily lives.
And we can take just little moments of ease like this, like little breaks during the day.
And little ways of developing these beneficial states of calmness, ease and relaxation, which can help us just to be a bit more present, be a bit more collected, less wavering of the mind, less scattering,
a bit more wholesomeness in our lives.
And I already touched on it really briefly, but we can also do this with meta-practice, loving-kindness practice, because meta is also a Pali word, which means loving-kindness.
And the nice thing about meta-practice, loving-kindness practice is that it also gives us a warm and kind feeling in our hearts if it's available for us.
You practice this by sending some wishes.
The wishes could be something like, may I or you be safe, may I or you be happy, may I or you be healthy, or may I or you live with ease.
And then from our hearts we can express those wishes for someone we care about, or even just someone we see on the street, or our pets, or ourselves.
And then just, you know, a few wishes just during the day can already like ease the heart.
So meta is really about cultivating a friendly and kind heart through this expression of wishes.
And we do that not out loud so no one hears what we're doing, it's more like a personal private thing.
Each time you express a wish like that, it's like a benevolent intention.
And we don't know how our intention is going to work out, maybe it doesn't have any effect on the other person if we're doing it for someone else, but that's not really the goal of the practice.
Because the goal is more about cultivating this in our own hearts and minds.
It's loving carrying energy.
Each time we express a wish, it's like an intention.
And each intention is like planting a seed, a seed that will flower some at some point in the near or far future, something in our own hearts that will flower.
Interesting to notice that meta is also a concentration practice, if we practice this on a retreat, for example, we can also get quite concentrated by using meta, by using these phrases towards ourselves or others.
So it's just another tool we can use to cultivate some calm and ease, some stability in our day to day lives.
So cultivating calmness and ease through these exercises like the tree bread journey, the 50-50 attention on the body, or through the meta.
These are just some tools in our toolbox that we can choose to use or not use.
And there might be many more. Both the Buddhist tools, like just the open awareness that Saiyadha Uttesha Nia teaches, and Andrea also often teaches, is an amazing tool because we learn how to be with what is, without needing to change it.
Like these are tools more to change experience, and open awareness is more of a tool that we can use to not change things, but to just learn how to be with it, really learning the resilience of being with difficulty.
So that's very useful and very wholesome as well.
And maybe also have some tools that don't come from Buddhism.
And when to use which tool? Well, this is really dependent on our own conditionings and our own situation as well.
We are all a little bit different. We all get into different situations.
So in order to find the answer to this question of when do we use what, we will have to experiment for ourselves.
So we can just try out, like a tree bread journey, for example, we can try out sitting, starting with some concentration practice, or retreat and try out some meta, and then see what happens.
See how does it influence us? Does it work? Does it not work? Maybe in some situations it works. Maybe in other situations it doesn't.
Or maybe it doesn't work at all, or it always works. I mean, there's different scenarios possible, of course.
Sometimes for myself, when I sit down for meditation and my mind is all over the place, then I know, okay, maybe just starting with some breath meditation, really focusing on the breath, like we did today, might be really useful.
And then I feel my mind can settle down a little bit quicker than if I would only do open awareness practice.
Or sometimes when I feel like down in daily life, it's really useful for me to do some meta practice and bring in that hard quality, really brighten the heart a little bit.
And doesn't only brighten the heart, it also helps stabilize the mind a little bit.
So we can play with this and see what works for us.
