Sati (3 of 5) Observation  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on April 1 , 2020  
 
 
I am continuing the talks this week on the topic of 
mindfulness as part of the Five Faculties. I have given 
five talks on the first faculty of faith, five talks on the 
second faculty of effort, and now we are in the third 
faculty. Those of you listening to th ese series might 
have understood that these talks are offered somewhat 
progressively. This goes along with the notion that 
Dharma practice is onward leading. There is a way that 
it evolves and develops over time. It certainly can go in 
spira ls, or back and forth, up and down. It’s not linear , 
but overall , the pattern of practice is to move along in a 
certain direction toward greater and greater freedom.  
 
For this week on mindfulness, Monday ’s talk  was on the 
initial establishment of mindfuln ess – the effort it takes 
to begin the practice, to show up, to wake up if we’re 
lost in thought , and to begin again  to be mindful . Once 
we are able to be more present, then mindfulness has 
another quality that comes into play . Not only are we 
present and aware , but we can also begin recognizing 
what is happening. Recognizing allows us to be more 
anchored in the present moment , and have more clarity about what is happening. There is more momentum to 
keep us in the present moment over time.  
 
As we  become  more rooted in the present and have 
more clarity, then the practice can open up to a capacity 
to observe what is happening. We are not trying to 
make the effort so much anymore. The effort is more to 
stay observing, to stay present, to let go of interference , 
so that we can  settle back and just observe whatever is 
happening.  
 
This sequence is how the Buddha teaches in 
mindfulness as well. He talks about establishing 
mindfulness first. Then, a lot of the exercises the 
Buddha g ives for developing mindfulness have to do 
with recognition , and understanding what is happening. 
Once that is established, he then talks about observing , 
“the body in the body,  the feelings in the feelings,  mind 
in mind,  and dharmas in dharmas.”  
 
Observing has some characteristics. One is that when 
you look at something, the looking itself does not 
interfere with what is bein g seen. If you touch 
something, the hands might change it when it’s picked 
up. But eyes, in and of themselves, do not change 
anything that is being seen. Eyes just see. The mind’s 
ability to see, to perceive includes settling back, 
allowing things to be th ere, and knowing or seeing 
without interference  into what is known . Certainly we don’t physically interfere with it. But we also don’t 
interfere with our perception  via judgments , stories , 
commentaries , or attitudes of being for or against  it.  
 
These are all like pulling curtains across the window , 
obscuring what we’re seeing . We add these things on 
top, instead of just simply sitting back and watching. It’s 
not easy to watch without interference. That’ s why it can 
be useful to have the watching be 360 degrees. What 
that means is that everything can be included  – 
including our interference. We don’t condemn any thing , 
but just keep opening up the awareness, the field of 
observing. “Oh, this too I observe.  And I’ll just h old it all , 
as just one more thing to observe. ”  
 
Over time , this simple observation of experience 
becomes  a radical act , because of how much human 
minds tend to be  involved with fixing , doing , planning , 
and commenting. It’s a radical act t o be simple. It 
begins to loosen , dissolve , and unravel  all of these 
complex worlds we have of the reactivity , judgments , 
ideas, and stories  through which we see ourselves and 
our world .  
 
An analogy I like for this is to i magine that you are on 
the river’s edge leaning up against a tree, just watching 
the river go by. As it goes by, all kinds of things are 
seen – driftwood, leaves, the current , the waves . It’s 
very relaxing. Then along comes a wonderful recreational riverboat with a band , a dance sho w, and 
lots of partying . The next thing you know, you are on 
the boat. But it take s a few weeks to realize that you are 
on the boat partying.  
 
Then you get off the boat , and finally make your way 
back upriver to that tree, sit down  again,  and just watch 
the river. It’s calm and peaceful. But then downriver 
comes  a war boat shooting its guns in all directions. It’s 
a good cause. So you jump on the war boat , and you 
fight the war. It takes a few months to realize that you 
have been fighting a war.  
 
Finally you get off. This time it takes a long time to walk 
back and find that tree again. Then you sit under the 
tree watching the river go by. It’s peaceful , calm , and 
nice. Then comes along a decrepit raft, barely staying 
afloat. You feel pity for the raft and before you know it, 
you find yourself on the raft, and you’ve been on the raft 
for years. “Poor raft. Poor me. It’s so hard !”  
 
Then you are finally able to get off the raft and go back 
up the river. Th e next time , something very alluring 
comes along on th e river. But this time , you just watch it 
go by. You don’t get on.  Another boat comes by , and 
you just watch that one  go by. All kinds of boats go by , 
and you just watch. You realize after a while that you 
don’t have to get on those boats. The boats are doing 
their thing. They come and they go. There are endless boats. And you realize,  “I can just stay here, observe , 
and watch  – stay peaceful , and just watch them go by.”  
 
This example is like how we watch ourselves in 
meditation. All kinds of thought boats come along. All 
kinds of stories and ideas come down the river of time 
and experience. All too often , we find ourselves on the 
boats, on the thoughts.  We entertain ourselves. We 
fight the good fight. We feel sorry for ourselves. We 
think about  the great purpose in life, or the great 
fantasy.  
 
It might not be wrong to get on boats , but sooner or 
later, we realize that there are other options. There are 
other possibilities for inner growth and development – 
and for a real discovery of freedom that is not possible if 
we get keep getting into the thoughts, on to the boats. 
So the idea is to settle in, and j ust w atch the thoughts 
go by . Watch feelings go by . Watch sensations in the 
body go by . Watch the breathing go by.  
 
One of the great things about breathing is that it has a 
wonderful flow or rhythm , like the waves of the river , 
coming and going . So, just settl ing back , watch ing, 
observ ing. 
 
To observe. To e stablish mindfulness . To h ave a clear 
recognition of what is happening in the moment, so that  
the mind begin s to step back a little. It’s not so entangled and caught in experience. “This is an in -
breath. This is an out -breath. This is a thought. This is 
anger. This is contentment. This is sound. ” Whatever it 
might be, clearly recogniz ing it is to begin changing the 
flow of the mind  and what it’s involved in. To recognize 
our thoughts, rather than bein g caught up in them, i s 
the beginning of the movement toward freedom.  
 
As recognition becomes clearer and clearer, a time 
comes when it’s possible to just settle back and 
observe our experience in a peaceful, calm way. This 
creates the foundation for the next possibility of 
mindfulness practice  – how the mindfulness faculty is 
used , and how it unfolds. This will be the topic for 
tomorrow.  
 
In the time between now and tomorrow, you might be 
curious about this human capacity to observe 
experience. You might even go and sit somewhere  
quiet , and use your eyes to just watch the world go by . 
Watch nature. Watch the squirrels playing in the trees. 
Watch the clouds go by.  See what you can learn about 
what it is like  just to observe . Just observe  – not 
interfere, not react, not make stories. Just let things 
gently flow by. Stand in the middle of your river , and just 
let all things flow by  until such a time when everything is 
just observed , and there is no observer.  Even the 
observer is flowing by.  
 Thank you very much for being part of this wide 
community of people meditating together, sharing and 
appreciating the Dharma – and maybe spreading 
goodwill into the world as we go through the next day.
