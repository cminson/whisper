 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. This is about the practice. One of the really rich exercises for mindfulness, it can be fun exercise, almost like a game, but it's also serious, is to see how simple your mindfulness can be. Part of that simplicity of mindfulness is how much of your experience can you leave alone, to just let it be what it is while you are clearly aware that it's happening. Where there is a clear sense of, yes, I'm aware, I'm restless, I'm impatient for the end of the sitting. And okay, well, this too I have to allow. Well, the simplicity of awareness is this too, this too. Okay, what is that like? What is this simplicity? How to be simple, aware? How to stay aware, as opposed to some of the other things the mind might do. And over time, what you might discover is that the best alternative, the best option any moment, is to be mindful. All the other options you have, or how to be with something, maybe you're not as good as just being mindful. And that's fascinating. Then it's like someone asks, when should I be mindful? And the answer can be when it's the best alternative. If you have other alternatives that are better, maybe you should do it. So the idea being that, so this exercise of how simple can the awareness be and how much can we leave the experience alone, just let it be what it is. And stay present, really present, where this distance of awareness becomes special. So thank you.
