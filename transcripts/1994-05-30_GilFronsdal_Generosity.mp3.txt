 He wandered around India with only the patched robes he wore, and incongruously a golden alms-bowl gifted to him by a king who was his disciple. One night he was about to lie down to sleep among the ruins of an ancient monastery, when he noticed a thief lurking behind one of the columns. Here, take this, said Nagarjuna, holding out the golden vegging bowl. That way you won't disturb me once I fall in sleep. The thief eagerly grabbed the bowl and made off with it, only to return the next morning with the bowl and request. He said, When you gave away this bowl so freely last night, you made me very poor. Teach me how to acquire the riches that make this kind of light-hearted detachment possible. What I'd like to talk tonight about is generosity, giving, a theme which is very central to the Buddhist tradition and isn't talked about so much in the West, but talked a lot about in Buddhist circles in Asia. Some years ago I read an account, an anthropological account, of gift-giving, maybe a ritual of gift-giving in some kind of Polypinesian island area. They had a potlatch ritual there, where one island would give a tremendous amount of their goods to the next island down current, but it would always be down current. That was the direction it went. The anthropologists followed the gift-giving down the current, to island to island, and found that actually the current made a huge loop. Eventually, someone would give you the gift coming all the way around. It all came back in some wonderful way. I've been trying to substantiate this story, and I don't know if it's really true, but it points to a claim that's made by many religious traditions, including the Buddhist one, that there's tremendous returns to the giver. If you give freely, things come back to you. Maybe not in a direct way, but they certainly come back. The gift freely given returns the giver. In Buddhism, they emphasize the importance of instant karma. The acts that you do have direct consequences on your state of your mind, state of your heart, as you do them. The consequences of giving are so wonderful in the present that maybe you don't need to think about getting anything more once you've gotten what you get just from automatically giving. The word for generosity or giving in Pali is adhana. We use the word a lot in our culture, subculture. You talk about dana. In the basket there it says dana and things like that. Dana or generosity is a primary virtue, Buddhist virtue, and is also a fundamental practice in Buddhism. In the discourses and the teachings that the Buddha gave back in his time, many of his Dharma talks were graduated talks, they refer to nowadays as graduated talks, where the Buddha would start off always talking about generosity first, when he's going to talk to someone about Dharma, lead them into the world of awakening. He'd always talk about the importance and the benefits of generosity. After that he would talk about the importance and benefits of ethics. After that he would tell them about the importance of calming the mind a little bit. After that he would tell them the importance of paying attention to what's happening in the mind or what's happening. Then he would tell them what he'd go on from there. Some of these accounts talk about how at the end of the graduated discussion of this course of practice, sure enough the people would become enlightened, just listening to it. But anyway, he often talked that way. If you go to Southeast Asia, the monks, the teachers there, love to talk about generosity and ethics. I don't talk about it a lot because I've heard so many talks. Sometimes like enough. But in some ways maybe that's a disservice because it's taking things upside down. I think many of Western Dharma teachers, even the teachers coming from Asia to teach in the West, have somehow turned the Buddhist tradition upside down in the way that they teach. That's true in the Theravada tradition, it's true in the Zen tradition, it's true in the Tibetan tradition. Most Westerners, we want the highest teaching, or none of it. That's what the teachers intend to give. Partly we don't want a lot of religion, we don't want a lot of ritual, we don't want a lot of the paraphernalia that comes, we want just the real core basic teaching. Mostly we teach mindfulness practice straight out, not telling you it's an advanced practice. I have a friend who is Chinese, grew up in China, has moved here, and a very devout Chinese Buddhist and reads Buddhist scriptures, the whole life is kind of devoted to Buddhism pretty much, and now she's studying Buddhism at Stanford also. I asked her one day if she meditated, and she said, I'm not worthy yet, I'm still trying to purify myself enough to be worthy of meditation. I thought that was a pretty remarkable thing. None of us would think that way. She was doing all this work on herself, kind of preparing herself so she could do meditation, she felt worthy for this wonderful sacred thing. So we teach upside down, but anyway today I'm going to... So I am teaching upside down, so today is the most advanced teaching. And it's generosity in our school, here in Palo Alto. And there's two ways of understanding generosity or Adana. One is that it's simply the spontaneous or natural expression or response or manifestation of an open mind and open heart that feels connected wholeheartedly with others and with the world. And it's not a matter of deciding to do something, it's just kind of what flows out of you. And often the example of something like this is the generosity of a mother with her children. The other way is the practice of generosity as a practice itself. So it's not something that necessarily automatically flows out of you, but you take it on as a practice. And I'll talk about that a little bit. But first, the first type. Well, in relationship to the first type of a spontaneous expression of an open heart and open mind, it occurred to me to... It might be interesting for many of you for me to differentiate between awareness and self-consciousness. What we're trying to cultivate and develop in mindfulness practice is awareness. And what sometimes gets confused with awareness is self-consciousness. And in part, well, for example, if you have a habit of being self-critical, judging yourself and beating yourself up, mindfulness practice is a great way of getting more fuel to do that even better. And I think that's when you've crossed the line from doing awareness practice to becoming self-conscious. And I think it's very easy to go back and forth over that line. And how I understand the expression self-consciousness, to be self-conscious, is when we take whatever is happening to us and we relate it to ourselves, not to ourselves, but to some fixed image we have of ourselves. We have some fixed identity of who we are. So we have some kind of idea, and sometimes it's wishful thinking, that identity. We have some identity, idea of who we should be. And we want to protect it, we want to build it up, we want to enhance it, we want to... Many things we want to do. Defend it. And we relate what happens to us to this idea of who we are. And I think an example, for example, for a meditator would be you're sitting here and you have an unpleasant state of mind arises. Say that you get angry. And you're sitting with these nice people here and suddenly you have all this anger about something. A self-conscious response would say, oh shit, I'm angry again. Why am I such an angry person? You know, here I'm in a meditation group after all and I should be pure and saintly and I'm really lousy. But that would be relating it to yourself. For awareness, you just be aware that you're angry. Oh, there's some anger there. That's all. Oh, someone cut me off on the freeway. Isn't that interesting? Oh, there's a beautiful, what? A beautiful flower. That's really nice. As opposed to, that's a beautiful flower and I better have it. I want it for myself. To make myself beautiful so people like me or whatever it might be. And greed, which is considered to be one of the roots of suffering in Buddhism. Greed is to want something. Greed arises out of wanting something for this identity, for this fixed image of who we think we are. And the more powerful the greed, I think the more powerful the self-identity is, the more powerful your self-image is and you're living by that, the more powerful the greed will be also and the hate also. And in mindfulness practice, is a practice, awareness practice, is a practice in which we're learning to live with openness, with a kind of self-trust rather than a self-image, self-identity and with greater awareness. And perhaps, I was thinking today, we can maybe also distinguish between being ego-centric, ego-centered, self-centered versus being situation-centered. And by situation-centered, I mean situation where you as a self and the other around you, the people around you, you don't take any of these, any of them to be the center of the situation. You don't ignore them either, but you don't take them as a center. You rather try to take the whole thing as a whole. And the fixed identity we tend to get attached to means we're putting the center here in some kind of psychological, neurotic way. So to be more situation-centered, what does the situation want? And the situation includes you. It mustn't exclude you. And as we do that, as we're more situation-centered, as we're more aware of the situation around us and we have opened and developed our mind and our heart, I think generosity naturally follows. So in Western religions, in most Western religious traditions, including the Greek tradition, charity was understood or is understood as being virtually synonymous with love, or agape is the term. And that the manifestation of charity is benevolent generosity, giving, supporting of people who are in need. But it comes from love, or closely related. And I think also in many of the early Western traditions, like in Greek tradition, the care of strangers was an ethical imperative. The care of strangers. And in many traditional cultures, that's still the case. And in Greece, it was believed that if a poor person was expelled from your table, or even if the poor person was treated rudely at your table, if they were eating at your house or something, then you'd receive the vengeance of the furies. The vengeance of the furies would visit the heartless deviant. So Danna, generosity, is both an expression of open-heartedness and is also a practice that can be undertaken. As a practice, Danna is not just you do it because it's a nice, good thing to do. Rather it's maybe two things. It's a practice which helps connect us with others and with ourselves also. So we do it as a practice to help connect us with others and with ourselves. And the second function of this practice is not maybe so much directly connect us, but rather to help us understand where we're closed, where we're holding back, where our fear is, what keeps us from being generous. So we take on the practice in simple ways to see what the resistance is maybe to it. And there's all kinds of ways to take up this generosity as a practice. It can be done in very simple ways. For one day for 24 hours I'm going to give a dollar to every homeless person who asks for money. This is a practice. Or $10, why don't you try $10? Or take $20 bill out and say, during this week, this $20 bill I'm going to give to someone who I don't know. And see what happens during the week. A fascinating exercise. $20, that's a lot for a lot of people. What would you do? What kind of things does it bring up for you and what do you learn about yourself and the situation? Oh, Jack Cornfield likes to, I guess he's done it himself since he advises it, is for 24 hours you act on every impulse to give. No matter what. So 24 hours. So it doesn't have to be done, you know, you can do two small things experimentally, just a practice to see what happens. I've known people whose only Buddhist practice was generosity. Who for various reasons, because of very complicated minds, couldn't do meditation practice. And they were taught by their teachers to just practice generosity and to transform them. One of the reasons for Buddhists or people who do Buddhist practice to go to Asia is to see some of the aspects of Buddhist culture which are relatively poor under developed here in the West. And one of the things is to see the level of generosity in Asia, how Dāno works. And the tremendous amount of generosity that people exhibit, especially around Buddhism. And if you go to practice in Asia, actually your practice, you'll probably most certainly, especially in Southeast Asia, be the recipient of a lot of generosity. Because people really want to support people who practice. Practicing is one of the best things you can do with your life. And these really, for the world, and they want to help and support people. In the eight months I was in Burma, those of us who were there were literally the guests of the state. Well regardless what you think of the state in Burma. We were still guests of the whole country, in a sense. Not the military government necessarily. I probably didn't spend more than ten dollars in eight months when I was there. Anything we really needed to support us in our practice we were provided with. The best doctors would come to the meditation center, from the medical school, to kind of see us. Dennis would come to the meditation center and see us. The best, whatever we needed, they would provide us. And these people, this is a very poor country. People are very poor. There's a story of an Englishman who was in Burma. And he didn't realize that he was eating at a private home until he asked for the bill. And as we develop a subculture in the West, a British subculture, which we are definitely happening, Danna becomes generosity, becomes an important element of that. And I've talked very little bit about it, and I think maybe to our detriment. So they talk a lot about generosity in the Buddhist tradition. They talk about how to give and who to give. When they talk about who to give to, they have kind of a list, as you could expect. Interesting, the first on the list is family and friends. And partly, often when you're developing spiritual virtues in Buddhism, you often start where it's easiest, with yourself or with the people closest to you. And you start with what's close. What you do is rather than denying yourself or refusing yourself, what you want to do is you want to universalize it. So you take loving kindness, for example, and you start with yourself. And you develop it and extend it until it becomes universal. So you don't start by denying yourself to love everybody, but you start with yourself. So same with generosity. You can start with the people close to you and then broaden it up until it becomes universal. So family and friends. The second is the poor and the sick. And that's, I think, often forgotten in Buddhist cultures, where sometimes the priority is given to monks. And it's interesting, Aristotle said, poverty should not be tolerated, for it leads to the erosion of a democratic state. And it constitutes the basis of social revolt. That was Aristotle. I guess no one read him. And then the third area to give to is to give to the Sangha, to the community of monks and nuns, to the wider Buddhist community, to retreat centers, give in order to allow the Dharma to flourish, to allow the Dharma to continue. And it's inspiring and somewhat allowing to realize that for 2500 years, the continuation of Buddhism only happened because of generosity. That the act of generosity is what has, countless people's generosity, has brought us the practice we have now. It's brought us to where we are right now, today. And also, I think it's interesting to point out that as there can be self-consciousness, as opposed to awareness, open awareness, there can also be group consciousness, where many of the same things that happen with individual, self-consciousness, happens with a group. Where you might be very generous to your group, there's very sharp boundaries for people outside your group, your nationality, whatever, and you're not going to be generous there. Again, as I've already said now, Buddhist practice is not about rejecting our connections, but rather universalizing them. Then there's a question of how to give. And it said, we should give with respect, with happiness and joy. The donor's happiness should be greater than the recipient's. And so maybe you shouldn't give, unless you're doing it as a practice, maybe, where you're going to explore yourself. In other situations, maybe you shouldn't give unless you think it brings you more joy, or brings you a lot of joy, at least. If it doesn't bring you joy, you shouldn't give. It's also nice to give spontaneously, without any thought, of even getting any recognition. One of the, in some ways, pivotal experiences for me, my first retreat in Thailand, was not my own meditation practice, but amongst act of generosity to me. I had a little, teeny little cabin hut, and there was a little porch in front of it, and a little stilts above the kind of swamp, or whatever. And I would sit there and meditate most of the day. And I certainly had meditate in the morning, when the monks went out on the alms round to collect their food. And then they come back, still early in the morning. And one morning, I opened my door, and there on the step, some monk left an apple and some fruit and some cookies or something, little things there. So that was kind of nice. But I'd opened the door a little bit too soon, maybe, because I saw him walking away. And I realized, so I saw this guy walking away, and I realized that he was walking away, and he would never know that I knew it was him. He didn't care. It didn't make any difference to him if I knew who it was from. And that really, I thought that was pretty wonderful. Nowadays, there's a bumper sticker, even books, they practice random acts of kindness. And Buddhism, a Buddhist bumper sticker is slightly different. The Buddhist slogan is, practice secret acts of kindness. Try practicing secret acts. And Dāna, or generosity, as I understand it in the Buddhist tradition, is a free giving. It doesn't expect anything in return. It's a gift to which the recipient has no claim, and for which he or she renders no return. And a lot of giving in the West, I've read some of the anthropological studies of giving. There's a lot of discussion about how giving often is actually in exchange. And that's often what it means. And actually, many cultures. But in Buddhism, at least, this understanding is pure Dāna doesn't involve an exchange. It's made purely out of compassion or goodwill or the desire for someone else's well-being or to remove some human need. And perhaps Dāna in spirituality itself is more about how we are than what we do. And in relationship to generosity, what we do is we cultivate generosity, a generous spirit, rather than actually doing good deeds or doing generous deeds. It's more important to be a generous person than to have given. You can probably give if you're generous, but you can maybe see the difference between the two. And as I already said, I think it's been said that all practices in Buddhism can be accomplished through giving in various ways. And I think it's beautiful, the word giving in English, and how often it appears in our language. And you might become sensitive a little bit to how the word giving appears. I would use it a lot. And how maybe if we pay attention to it, we can see maybe there's something else going on. Or we can read into the situation something else. We say we give our attention to something. Isn't that a wonderful expression? We give our attention to the breath when we do a mindfulness practice. That's a lot different than willing yourself on your breath. You give yourself over to your breath. We give ourselves to ourselves. I think we also do this through this practice. We're giving ourselves to ourselves. We can give the forests to the forests. I think it wouldn't be great if we, you know, all this clear cutting everywhere. It's horrible pictures of clear cutting. I've seen some of it. What if we gave the forest back to the forests? Or we give our friend to our friend. We let our friend be our friend. Let our friend, let someone be who they are as a gift. Liberation or enlightenment is also a form of giving. And that people usually don't think that way. But I think liberation or enlightenment is actually a form of giving. And it's certainly not a gaining of something. You don't gain anything by becoming enlightened. Maybe you give. It's actually an act of giving. So you might, as an exercise, study the different uses of the word giving in English. Giving away on the freeway. What are you doing when you give away on the freeway? Give the right away to someone. So, you know, give it away generously, after all. But they're cutting you off. You know, an act of great generosity. And there's an expression of giving up. I wonder what that expression originally meant. Because to give up, I think maybe it originally meant an offering. Make an offering. I like to teach that at the end of retreats, like long retreats, people have a certain amount of calm or concentration or something. And it inevitably goes away, some of the strong concentration or calm that you have from a long retreat. And it's going to go away anyway. You're kind of feeling depressed about it. Give it away. Practice your generosity. Giving away your concentration. Giving away your calm. And then there's this wonderful expression that some of you have heard me talk about, of the given. What we learn to pay attention to also in Buddhism is the given. What is given? What is a given in any situation? That's what we pay attention to. And I love that because the given is also a gift. I believe that with the deepening of practice, there also becomes a stronger sense of gratitude towards life, because we realize how much is given to us. Then there's a list of what to give. The giving of material goods. And that's going to be kind of obvious, but it also includes the way we use our money and the way we work, how we use our work, our livelihood. Is the way we use our money and the way we use our work a gift or not? And then the giving of kindness is considered very important. The giving of a smile. And then there's a list of seven kinds of giving from a Buddhist sutra. The Dana of kind eyes. The Dana of a pleasant face. The Dana of affectionate words. The Dana of the body. It means treating people with good manners to show respect for them. The Dana of the heart, serving others with compassion, is both one's joy and happiness. The Dana of the seating place. This means sharing of one's seat or standing place and controlling one's desire will benefit others. I think the Quakers have done that for us. They've shared their seat with us here so we could sit here. And that's a wonderful gift. The Dana of the home. Everyone's home clean and extending hospitality to visitors and making them feel at home. Those are seven forms of Dana in one list. Anyway, the giving of kindness. Then there's a giving of fearlessness. You ever thought of giving fearlessness? One of the things that we develop and a deepening and maturing of our practice is we become fearless. We also offer as a gift fearlessness to others. Our fearlessness. Very, very important quality. One of the attributes of the Buddha is that he's fearless. You need to be a little bit. And then a fourth thing I think about, which I think is also often forgotten in the discussion of generosity, is we give our receptiveness. Receptiveness. We give our receiving-ness. We're receptive and are willing to receive other people's generosity. And for some people it's more difficult to receive than to give. But when you realize how beneficial and how joyful it may be to give, don't you want to give someone the opportunity? I took a friend of mine who was leaving the country, getting on the airplane at the San Francisco airport, and I offered a driver to the airport. And she was very self-effacing and kind of shy. And she didn't want me to trouble myself. No, no, no, no, don't do it. But I knew she had all this luggage. I knew it would be really hassle for her. I said, oh, I'll be happy to. No, no, it's okay. I can do it. At some point when she said that, I started becoming ambivalent about whether I really wanted to do it for her. So it was kind of sad because here I had this somewhat pure, spontaneous kind of wish to kind of drive her to the airport. And her kind of not receiving it made my kind of feelings, well, maybe I had better things to do and maybe, you know, whatever. All my ambivalence came up. And it can be a gift to allow someone to give to you. And then why give? Why should we give? I think giving is its own reward. The joy and contentment of giving is the reward of giving. And this I think is significant to remember because in Asia, some of the giving, significant amount of the reason people give is for the karmic consequences they'll reap, the benefits, the fruit that they'll receive. And like in Thailand, a lot of people, what they want is that they want to have a better rebirth or they want a better rebirth for their parents who've died. And so they do a lot of religious acts acquiring merit, including giving. So it's very heartfelt to giving also, but there's this added element. And I think it's important to recognize that giving is its own reward. It doesn't have to be for any other reason. So the given, mindfulness itself is a gift. Awareness itself is a gift. Can we receive our mindfulness? Can we receive our awareness as a gift? Can we receive and open to that gift of mindfulness itself? Rather than make it our possession. If you're in a world of self-consciousness, mindfulness is something you possess, it's something you relate to, and my mindfulness is poor today and I'm really bad and this is really terrible and now it's good and I'm really clear and I'm a good meditator or whatever, we relate it to ourselves. In the world of pure awareness, mindfulness is a gift. And all we have to do is, I believe, not all, but an important aspect of what we need to do is to open to the gift of mindfulness itself. Rather than cultivating mindfulness, we open to the gift which is always here. And how much of life is a gift? And if giving is a natural response of an open heart, I think gratitude is even more so because we are the recipients of a tremendous amount of giving. So I think I ran out of time. So now you've heard something about a primary Buddhist virtue. So thank you all and may you all be happy and content and may you all receive lots of gifts, including the gift of being a giver.
