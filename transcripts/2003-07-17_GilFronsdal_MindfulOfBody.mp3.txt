 In thinking about the body, the body's role in meditation, there are two very interesting concepts in many spiritual disciplines that come up from time to time. That's the idea of remembering and the idea of forgetting. They go some ways close together that we remember so we can forget other things. Part of a spiritual life, as I understand it, does involve a kind of remembering, recollecting, reawakening aspects of our lives, and also of a process of forgetting, dropping, letting go of. There's a very famous quote by the Zen Master Dogen that goes, to study the Buddha way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self, and to forget the self is to be awakened by all things. To paraphrase this, to study the Buddha way is to remember the self. To remember the self is to forget the self, and to forget the self is to be awakened, to be present for all things. Part of the process of remembering the body, remembering to be present, is to help us to forget our self-consciousness, the way in which we're consumed and caught by issues of self-identity, self-preservation, and being self-conscious. The word sati, the Pali word sati, which is usually translated to the English word mindfulness, has nothing in the word that relates to mind in and of itself. But in English we have, we said mindfulness. It tends to give greater value, greater priority to the mind as being part of the practice, something you do with your mind. You're full of it, you're full of your mind. It's fine to do that, but it does in a sense suggest maybe there's not much to do with the body in this practice. It's about mind, not the body. And I think you can just as well, almost as well, translate sati as bodyfulness, as you could mindfulness. Certainly because the body is so phenomenally important in mindfulness practice, it's really the foundation. Maybe we should for a while say bodyfulness. We're practicing bodyfulness, learning to be in our body, be present for our body to a greater degree. The word sati is one of the cognitive meanings of sati, Pali, and Smriti in Sanskrit, is to remember. And then there's a little bit, maybe too cute kind of thing you can do in English, where to remember is to remember, to bring the members back together, or to recollect, to collect yourself together. And this is a very important element of meditation practice. The meditation practice is meant to collect, to recollect the different desperate parts of ourselves, which are often not working together in some kind of harmony, some kind of unity, some kind of working together. And it's very easy for us to get disconnected, to be fragmented, and to have different parts of our psyche and our mind, body kind of going in different directions. One of the interesting things that happens is that it's very easy to become disconnected with the body. We can be disconnected to the body if we're too busy, running around too much, too many activities, too much stress of pressures or things to do. We can be disconnected to the body if the work we do or the activities we do is primarily intellectual or mental. And so it's fairly common for people, for example, who spend all day maybe at the computer. The computer is a fairly mental kind of activity, looking at a screen, and you're mostly processing things with your mind to lose touch with your body until you get carpal tunnel disease or bad back and you realize you have to pay attention to your body and how you sit in your posture. Another interesting way in which people get disconnected with their bodies is there's a very intimate relationship between our emotional life and our bodies. And it's been said that you wouldn't know what emotion you were having unless you somehow got the cues from the bodily expression of that emotion. You know, you feel hot and maybe some other things, and maybe it's the expression of being angry, or you feel afraid, the fear of tightening in your stomach. So many different emotions have a corollary in the way that what happens in the body, the muscles in the body, different parts of the body react. And because there's such a strong relationship between the body and the emotions, if a person doesn't want to feel their emotions, then sometimes it takes to form or requires shutting down or numbing, repressing or being disconnected to that part of the body where those emotions are manifested. So if a person has some great trauma in their life that's been very difficult and comes with a lot of fear or a lot of anger or something, and maybe that fear or that anger or that sadness or grief or whatever is maybe perhaps held in the stomach or held in the shoulders or someplace in the back. And so that part we kind of, okay, I don't want to feel that, I don't want to be there for that. And so we kind of numb or close down that part of the body. So there's many reasons why people kind of disconnect with their body, don't pay attention to it. And one of the things that I hope happens when people meditate is it becomes a kind of reclaiming or recollecting of ourselves in our body, bringing ourselves back into our body. And in order to feel like that's worthwhile or that's really work, you have to really feel that it is worthwhile to do it. You have to feel there's value in being in your body. I know there's a very powerful authority, unspoken, almost unconscious authority that we give to our mind, to our thoughts, to our stories. And many people are processing their lives, trying to understand their lives by thinking about their lives. And for example, if you remember something happened earlier in the day and you're reliving the conversation over and over again, trying to come back with a better rejoinder, better answers to better replies, or you're thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow and you're kind of going over the plans, planning and planning and planning and you're using your mind then, your thoughts to negotiate, to understand, to relate to your life. Some people spend a lot of time judging. And so they come into a situation and they're judging people around them. They're looking at them and thinking about, oh, that person is this way and that way. And I don't like people who have purple jackets and white socks and, you know, and so you're judging. And so we negotiated the world again through our thoughts, through our judgments. And there's a lot of ways in which we kind of negotiate the world through our thoughts, through our stories we make. And one story I like to tell of this is when I said a three month retreat, three month meditation retreat, which was done in silence. So I didn't talk to any of the retreatants for three months. And there was a woman on the retreat who I was attracted to. And, but I didn't have any way of talking with her or having any contact with her. And you're not supposed to make eye contact even. So I kind of, you know, I knew she was there. I was aware of her presence nearby, but I didn't make any contact or anything. But what I did do instead was I started having a fantasy life about who this person was and how wonderful it was to be at the end of the retreat to talk to this person. And of course, you know, we would make a good connection and how then the fantasy just went from there to, you know, dates and vacations and marriage and on and on and when children and divorce. And then they live happily ever after. And, and so, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't a very, I wasn't obsessing about this, but three months is a long time for various thoughts to kind of go through periodically. And then at the end of the retreat, there was a breaking of silence and people started talking. And I heard her talk for the first time and she had a really thick French accent. And at that moment, I realized how much I'd been living in a total fantasy because my fantasy was all based on her being an American and all that means, whatever that means, I don't know what that means. But I realized I didn't have a clue who this woman was. And all this fantasy was built on these thoughts and storymakings about this person. And, and I think that goes on a lot in our lives where we're making stories or sitting in meditation or some other situation and we have an itch. Uh oh, I think I've been too much in the sun lately. I'm sure it's melanoma. And then we start making stories. Oh, it must be. And if it's melanoma, then I know what's going to happen next. And, and, um, well, you know, hopefully the chemotherapy is going to help, but if it doesn't help, you know, I better start planning my will now. And, you know, and the mind goes off in a story and we, sometimes we sometimes are really, really, really, really, really, really, really compelling movement within us to take a, pick up the story, pick up the ideas to negotiate our life through the story, making ideas of what's going on. It's a, sometimes it's a wonderful thing to do at times, to use our mind and our thoughts and reflections. I don't want to knock the importance of it, but I think it's very easy probably for all of you to see in your own lives, the way to, to agree to which sometimes your storymaking, your ideas, your fantasies get an upper hand sometimes and it really kind of disconnect with, um, with, you know, actually what's happening in your life in reality. So to feel like there's real value in temporarily at least letting go, softening the hold, shelving the storymaking abilities in mind, the thoughts and ideas, so that the mind can begin to, or the attention at least, can begin pulling away from that absorption, obsession, thoughts and ideas. And the attention can go into the body, can flow into the body, start paying attention to what's going on in the body. So you really have to feel that it's a valuable thing to do, that the being in the body, paying attention to the body is valuable. Some people get bored very quickly when they start feeling their body. They feel, what's the point of this? The body's just a solid mass of stuff. It's nothing there. You know, it's not as fascinating as my thoughts and ideas and relationships and activities and video games. And, and, um, so it can feel very, very challenging for some people to start feeling their body. Or they can be very strong feeling, I don't want to feel my body because the body's uncomfortable. And when I feel my body, I'm reminded of how uncomfortable I am in my life, how painful it is. People have all kinds of ailments in their body, or we carry tremendous amount of stress in our body, or we feel that carry exhaustion in our body. And so to start paying attention to our body means to feel those kinds of things. And then I think the common sense thing for some people to make, make some sense to it is this is uncomfortable. Why should I stay here? I bet it might as well go someplace is more pleasant. And, and sometimes a more pleasant place and go back into the mind. Sometimes you can feel more secure to go back into our worrying. If we're worrying and thinking about things, then at least we're engaged in trying to protect ourselves and make things better. We're trying to problem solve. You know, that's where that we're going to fix our life is by worrying enough and figuring out just the right solution. And so we recoil from the body, perhaps I don't want to, or we have a message that somehow that it's not, we're not supposed to feel discomfort in our body. That's not, you know, that's not cool. Or that's not a spiritual appropriate. And so there's all kinds of reasons why people might not want to stay in their body because it's uncomfortable. Or people receive religious messages from certain some religions. I think probably all religions do this to some degree to corners of the religion. Buddhism does some places too, where the body is somehow denigrated, somehow considered to be second class, third class citizen. And it's not really where it's at. It's all about practice, spirituality is all about the mind. Or some, I know some religious traditions put a very heavy guilt trip of people about feeling joy in their body, pleasure in their body. You're not supposed to feel that at all. And so to drop down into your body means to feel parts of yourself, which maybe are considered inappropriate to wrong. I read an article some years ago, some place in the Midwest, I forget where it was. It was ruled that people couldn't do meditation in schools. Couldn't follow their breath. They're taking very simple meditations and following your breath, I think, because I was consorting with the devil. Somehow that being in your body, feeling your body is, you know, can go against the grain of certain religious kinds of teachings and practices. So that's another reason to pull back, because many reasons to pull back from the body. But I would argue that for the most part, doing that, you do a disservice to yourself, because a very important, if you want to be whole, if you want to avail yourself to the wisdom that's within you, you really need to be in your body to feel that. You need to be in your body to feel whole. And I remember a Zen teacher I had many years ago described the body as being an antenna. And I think it works very well. The body is a very sensitive organ that picks up a lot of what goes on within us and outside of us. I don't know if that's exactly accurate to say it picks up like an antenna, but somehow as whatever instruments of sensations we have takes in the world around us in our inner world and outer world, it somehow resonates or affects or has an impact on our body in all kinds of ways. You go into a situation where maybe the first indication you have that something's a little bit off is you feel a little bit tight and constricted or tight in your belly to, oh, you know, maybe here, maybe there's a reason to be afraid in this situation and the body is given you a cue. And sometimes that's really accurate. And sometimes if you're too much in your head, however, and projecting on the world, then you might not be really in a frightened situation, but you're projecting, you know, fear, a threatening situation in your body, then feels it. But the body can pick up a lot or seemingly it feels like the body because it's like an antenna. More important, I don't know if it's more important, but another important aspect of the body is that as you begin to be more and more in your body, the body becomes the processor for our life. The body in Buddhism is an activity. It's not a thing. And I think many times we think of the body as being a kind of thing. It's solid. It's what it is. But the body is an activity. The mind also in Buddhism, it's called an activity. It's a whole psychophysical being. We are what we are as an activity. We're not a fixed kind of thing that never changes, doesn't moving. We're an activity unless the activity of our life, the activity of the mind, the body is somehow frozen by our attachments, by our fear, by something, some kind of preoccupation that stops things. So for example, if a person is afraid, for example, the shoulders can go up. You get nervous. And it's an activity to make that happen. However, we then get freeze in that activity. And it's possible to go around for days, for months, for weeks, whatever, a long time years, tense. And that activity of tightening up when you're afraid has become rigid and solidified in the body. But the body itself wants to be a process. It wants to move. It wants to kind of relax. It wants to kind of, it's a process. It's not a thing. And so when we bring attention to our body and feel our body, then it begins to let the body move again. So back to the shoulders, if you can really feel your shoulders, it might feel really uncomfortable. And you can feel it. And you might feel, what's the point of feeling this discomfort? The point is, as you feel it, you're giving in a sense space to a constricted environment. So it feels more open, has more space which to relax into. And so slowly, slowly you'll find probably your shoulders will relax. People will feel, there's a lot of emotions that get held in some kind of way. And so for example, sometimes people feel grief and they don't want to feel it or they're stuck in it in some way. To drop into the body and feel the manifestation of the grief in your body is one of the ways to let the body help you as your friend to process the grief or to process the anger, process the sadness, the depression, whatever's going on. The body can help you process what's going on. The body can help you hold emotions that if the mind is only trying to hold, it can seem overwhelming because if the mind's holding it, the mind will start making stories. And the stories is what tends to make things overwhelming. But the body is not a story. So the body helps you to drop out of the story making capacity of the mind. And it helps you, if you drop and feel what's going on in your body, then the body will begin relaxing and softening around what's happening emotionally, physically, even mentally. And as you feel the body, these constrictions, these tightness, these begin to unravel. And it's really a marvelous thing to feel these things unraveling. And the deeper you go on meditation, the more subtle in your body you feel these places of the tightness and holding. Sometimes these are called in Buddhism the samskaras, which can maybe be translated kind of directly from the etymology of the word as complexes, formations, holding patterns. And there's all kinds of things. Sometimes meditation is very odd. Sometimes things get worse before they get better in the body. You know, if you hold your body tense for a long time, seemingly the muscles or the sensations in that part of your body go kind of numb. And you can go around feeling everything's quite fine because you're numb there. But then as you bring attention to your body and that part of your body begins waking up, then you can start feeling a lot of the pain of that tension because it stops being numb. And then people complain to, oh, I'm getting more tense through my meditation. The opposite is happening. But the process of doing that involves this kind of going through that pain, letting the pain unravel. Pain is not a bad thing necessarily. To let the pain begin to show itself so that it can unravel, unwind, and soften is part of the process that sometimes happens in meditation. The other reason to feel the body, to live in your body, is that the body, if you can experience some of the depths of joy and happiness, bliss that can come through meditation, I believe you can experience it much more fully and in much more healthy and useful ways if you experience it through your whole body, if the joy and the happiness of something that ripples and moves through your whole body. And so it's a holistic experience, not just kind of a mental kind of joy and pleasure that you might have. And I believe that the more fully someone is in their body, is at home in their body, feeling their body, the greater is their capacity than to feel joy and delight that comes at some point at times through a spiritual life. Joy and happiness is not necessarily the point of meditation. It's one of the nice byproducts that can come. The ultimate point in Buddhism is to release any holding, any tightening, any clinging in the heart and the mind. So the heart and the mind can be set free from the shackles on it. And the body turns out to be one of the very useful cues, one of the useful places to learn where it is you're still holding, where tightness is. In very, very deep, subtle meditation, one of the instructions people are given is to look around and see where is there still some holding, some tightness. And that might be somewhere, it might be the way you access it is through feeling. Maybe you feel really good in your body, very relaxed, but you feel, oh, there's a little bit of tightness in the center of my chest, or a little bit of tightness in the center of my head. I didn't know it was there. And then it gives you kind of the gate, or the cue, the signpost say, oh, pay attention here for a while, bring your attention there. So the body can be very helpful in pointing to you where you should bring your attention by showing you where the tightness is, where the holding is. So to live in your body, to be comfortable with your body. There was a magazine article many years ago that I saw, it was headlined, it was titled, The Body, Friend, Foe, or Total Stranger. And that's the attitude some people have. And what I hope is that through a meditation practice of learning how to pay attention to your body, being interested in being more embodied, exploring what it means to be embodied, and learning how to rest in an embodied presence with yourself, that you will find that your body is a really, maybe your best friend. And having a relationship with your body gives you a friend which you can perhaps keep with you your whole life. So those are my thoughts for today. And I don't know how sleepy you are, listening to all this in this hot weather. But perhaps if you have some questions or some comments or some thoughts about this, we could have a little bit of discussion now, or about something else. I started off topic in the back, particularly, I noticed I can try and use the concentrating practice. And so, when the whole bunch of stuff happened through the thought, I wasn't paying attention to the bodies again, I didn't think I might. But then I decided to go through one, it's real. And so I did that. And when you were able to start to come back, it was exactly half of the body. I noticed that I was pretty relaxed, and all the time I was saying, don't pay attention to that, don't pay attention to that, stay away from it. And then the benefit of it was you fell away pretty much with breath, a period of sex. And I was really surprised to see how much I had just settled down, relaxed while I was just taking a test of a few square centimeters of nostril. Beautiful, yeah. Part of the art of mindfulness is to know where your attention should be in any time in meditation. And sometimes the best strategy is to stay with a breath, and just get absorbed in the breath, stay with the breath. And the more fully the mind gets into the breath, and it's engaged in the breath, the less mental energy or mental attention goes into our preoccupations. And as less attention goes into our preoccupations, they begin to relax. And as our preoccupations relax, then our body relaxes, because our preoccupied mind will express itself often as a tense body in some way or other. So one of the functions of concentration on the breath is to begin shifting where this food of attention goes, and what it's feeding, what it's supporting. And if attention goes to feed our preoccupations, then we're feeding attention probably. But if the food goes into something very simple, like just being with a breath, then we're taking the food away from them and it starves it, and it relaxes, like, let's go. So sometimes that's the wisest strategy. Other times the wisest thing to do is to let go of the breath, and if you feel some very strong tension or pain or discomfort in the body, then to bring your attention directly to that and feel that, and be with that for a while. And sometimes just being with a breath is not enough for you. Be with a breath, and you really feel something really strong is calling you. I need to pay attention to this other part of my body, this tension. So I do that sometimes, sometimes very simply in terms of tension. I carry some tensions in my shoulders. So sometimes when I meditate, I'll just be with my breath, and I find, as you did, at the end of that sitting that the shoulders are much more relaxed than they were before. But sometimes that doesn't seem to be the right call. Sometimes I'll just do mindfulness of shoulders. Just be with the shoulders, feel it, kind of scan the shoulders, feeling this different sensation, feeling exactly where the tightness is in attention. And that's what's really called for, is that bring that careful attention, the friendly attention to that part of the body. And that's what gets it to relax and see what's going on. So it depends what, you know, there's no hard and fast rule about where to go, but both strategies. Is that an adequate response to what you said? Yes. It's a great question. The kind of spirit or the attitude or the approach, the approach of this kind of practice could be called a trial and error. So rather than me giving you the answer, this is the way to better, it's different from different people. Some people find that the labeling, the noting of the experience with tingling, whatever, is very, very helpful. And other people find it gets in the way from really feeling it. And it's more helpful to be silent about it. So I'd encourage you to experiment a little bit and see what you find to be most helpful. And you might find out that, you know, one way or the other. The only warning I would make is that people who are interested in meditation tend to be a little bit biased in favor of silence. And so they don't really give themselves sometimes a chance to really learn the value of what you suggested of labeling the experience. Very, very simple non-judgmental labels tingling. And like it's phenomenally, it can be phenomenally useful to label experience. Yes. I don't know of any particular Buddhist instructions around, you know, for children along those lines. So I can't, you know, the Buddha didn't have texts and that kind of experience. I do know, it's a little bit not answering question directly, that it's very common, I mean, very strong, too strong. It's common enough for adults who come on retreats. And do long retreats and really get into the mindfulness practice in that kind of context. Well, sometimes have to deal with, pay attention to, work through holding patterns in their bodies that are left over from trauma they've had as children. And so it manifests in many ways. Sometimes it's very strong memories come up. Sometimes very strong body sensations of various kinds. All kinds of things. Sometimes the tongue emotions might come, but suddenly they get really, sometimes they get really slowly. You're going to get an inkling what's going on. Sometimes it's suddenly pow, there it is. And so then how to respond to it as an adult is depends a little bit on what the person's, depends a lot on the person, pays a person's in with it and the relationship to it all. In a mindfulness context, the first thing would just be rely on mindfulness, bring very careful nonjudgmental mindfulness. We allow it to be there and you'll try to train yourself not to get caught in the stories about it, make more stories about it and all that. But just let it move through you and move through. You just feel it, bring presence to it. Sometimes in addition to that, it's very helpful to bring loving kindness to it, to actually bring a very friendly, loving attitude towards it. So to extrapolate from that, I would say then that if you're trying to counsel help a child who's gone through trauma, that they can't necessarily be told and taught those kinds of practices, but it's the role of the parent to try to do for the child. So to bring attention in an appropriate way, presence to the child, so that the child's psyche or body feels someone else's bringing, is holding the presence, holding what's going on there in a safe way, in a loving way. Or the adult brings love to the situation. And then the art of doing that depends on what the situation is and how the child needs to be held. But somehow let the adult do the holding. As when we become adults, then the practice would be to learn how to do it for ourselves. So those are my thoughts. I was asked three days of business off-site, and it was run by someone who had been traveling and showed up and said that she was very burnt out. So I would characterize the three days as the normal toxic. And so at some point I noticed that I had not had a fourth head, I had to call attention body. So I'll sort of take my practice and sort of like watch the film, watch my breath, get back to my body. And that sort of very interesting, some interesting feedback that's in the three days, which was your serenity was making you very uncomfortable, that was making you very angry. And that was how I was working. And so I guess I don't know if you have some thoughts, because I'm not sure how to digest. So it was often. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's one of the unfortunate things that sometimes can happen is that if someone else is really caught in some very strong reactive mode, that they can't or don't want to separate themselves from it, they can't, that sometimes people who are calm or not caught up in that can make them very, can highlight how bad things are for them, or they can then project, oh, that person is judging me, or I'm not living up to some standard, or there's all kinds of reactivity that can go on, and they see someone who's not that way. I had a conversation with someone today who has a very hard time with their family, because a very large family, because most, it sounds like everybody in the family is alcoholic, except for this person. And so somehow, the fact that this person I talked to today has separated herself from that alcoholic environment and better herself in her life, it's very hard for her to go back to her family, because they get very uncomfortable when she comes. And so it's true, sometimes this can happen, the Buddha even said some people got very upset around the presence of the Buddha, and got very reactive. So it can happen that way. Then the question is, you give up your serenity in order to make this person feel better. Or is there some way in which you're holding your serenity, which is not a healthy way? Sometimes there's ways of being too cool, which kind of a little bit stinks. Zen stinks, sometimes they call people too zen. And so there are ways of doing that. And I remember when I was hitchhiking around the country as a young man, it was this girlfriend, it was back in the hippie times, and I was staying in communes and stuff, and I was practicing being cool. Nothing really matters, right? It's all wine, nothing matters. And I remember she lost her flashlight. Nothing matters, it's okay. We don't have to go back and look for it. And she got angry with me, because look, we just go back and look for it, my flashlight. And I was like, everything is fine, just go with the flow. And years later I realized, I think she was right in being a little bit irritated with me. The other thing that occurs to me in response to you is, again, how do we take care of other people, I think is an important question. And so it's not just a matter of our own well-being and our own calm, but how do you take care of other people? And so maybe you were excessively taking care of yourself, and not really tuned into the needs and situation around you. I had a Zen teacher whose practice was, by himself, he was very athletic, very upright, and always stood very straight. But he told me his practice was that when he met with someone, he would always try to mimic their posture. So if they were slumping or leaning against the wall, or something, he would slump and lean against the wall. If they were sitting in a chair, kind of like slumping, he would slip in the chair, kind of relaxed. I guess it's a therapeutic technique, some therapists use too, I guess. But in order to make the person comfortable, so that he wasn't putting off different kind of vibes, or highlighting that he was different from them, highlighting how they were, or something, and then try to meet them as they actually were. So I hope that doesn't mean that you have to get burned out yourself in order to help the person, but maybe there's some way of doing what you need to do, but also tuning into the person so that, what does this person need from me here? So that this person can also be more relaxed. Is this at all helpful? It is. I think it's verbally boxed. Verbally boxed. What does that mean? So, I would like to characterize what happened is the serenity that sort of attacked, started from my work, you know, this person, I have a church person, and so at that particular point, my kingdom came out very sparring. I might use a sharp line during you, but really sort of show this person that would be sharpish. Oh, I see. But what was the relationship between your verbally sparring with the person and your serenity? But the person complained about your serenity, not your sparring, right? No, yeah, actually they were very comfortable with that. With the sparring. Yes, please. It depends on the person. It's a very old ancient technique to count the breath, and some people find tremendous value from it. I spent years counting my breath, and I found great value. Sometimes I occasionally still do it. So, I'm a great believer in counting the breath. Some people don't find it very useful to do it, for whatever reason. So, if you're inclined to count your breath, I'd encourage you to do it. It is more of a concentration practice. So, if a person wants to do mindfulness practice, at some point they probably need to stop counting the breath. But as a way of building up concentration and presence, it's really helpful. No, no. The usual way that I've been instructed, and you've seen instructed in many different places, is you count to 10. And then you get a 10, you start over again. And if you lose count on the way of 10, don't think about it. Just go back again to one. And if you get to 14 or 200, that means you've kind of lost your mindfulness. You're on automatic. And just go back to one. Go back to one whenever you can. And I had a friend of mine who practiced Zen in Japan, and his Zen teacher also taught people to count their breath. But he taught them to count up to one. And then start again. There's different ways of doing it. The way I do it is I count the exhalation. And I count the full exhalation. So, I kind of used the count to kind of fill the exhalation. And this way, I would say, I had to breathe in and then silently I'd go, as I exhale, breathe in, two. So, kind of rather than just, you know, one, two. And I know some people will, as they exhale, will count one, one, one, one, one, kind of repeatedly as a way of maintaining the connection. Some people will count the in-breath and the out-breath. The same count, one, one, two, two, like that. So, there's different ways. But I guess what I've done is the exhalation. One thing that maybe you could do to keep the continuity of the Zen one, and then you had it as an end. One, and two, and three, like that. You had to give your action. Those Buddhists got rhythm. Yes. Yeah. Thank you for bringing that up. It's really a wonderful practice. Can you talk about the relationship between concentration and mindfulness? I don't think of them as having a hard and fast... There's not a sharp line between them. So, we could talk about differences and how they're different from each other. But I think they overlap. And certainly they support each other, and they always work together in some degree. It's a matter of what degree they're working together. Concentration is primarily holding or fixing the mind, the attention, on one particular place. That's the general kind of definition of concentration. And there might not be any insight, understanding, or awareness of what you're paying attention to. So, for example, if you're with the breath, you might be aware that you're breathing in and breathing out. You're concentrating on that breath going in and out. But you're not aware of the subtle sensations, the various sensations that make up that experience. You're not really understanding, seeing, and feeling, and sensing in a very rich way what that experience is. Mindfulness has to do with understanding or seeing, being mindful, being cognizant of what's actually what you're experiencing. When you're concentrating, you don't have to be aware of what you're experiencing. You just have to hold your attention there. When you're mindful, you're actually becoming aware, awake to what that experience is. That makes some sense? Yeah, but there's one, can we be confident? I mean, should... Is it good? Sometimes you practice about it. You are... That makes me confident, maybe? You are... If a person's practicing concentration, there is going to be some mindfulness there also. You can't really develop your concentration without being mindful of some of the factors of what's going on and how to support that. So there's that, and you can't really develop mindfulness without some concentration, some stillness and ability to stay with the mind someplace. If the mind is scattered and is going all over the place, you can't be mindful very well. So they both come together. It's a matter of degree. Some people find it very useful to spend a period of time just cultivating concentration. And other people find it useful as a period of time just cultivating mindfulness. Some people will spend years on concentration practices, and some people will spend years, a lifetime, on just doing mindfulness practice. And it depends a little bit on the psyche, the mind, how individual minds works, and what is useful for that person. If a person has a strong ability to get concentrated, maybe they don't have to do anything to develop their concentration anymore when they do mindfulness. If a person has a very poor ability to get concentrated, then maybe in order to help their mindfulness, they should go do some concentration work for a while until the muscle has been built up strong and then come to do the mindfulness practice. So really it depends. And different teachers also have different ideas about the priority of concentration over mindfulness or mindfulness over concentration. So there's a whole slew of theories and ideas about how these play together. The tradition I was trained in, in Burma, had a very strong bias or teaching that you don't have to do concentration work. All you need to do in terms of letting your spiritual life unfold can be done through mindfulness practice. And it was very powerful for me, it was very powerful for a lot of people to go through that system. There are some people who want to do that, there are some people who went through that system and didn't quite work for them. So they found great help by then leaving that system for a while and going and doing concentration practice with a concentration teacher. So there's all these different ways. So I hope I didn't confuse you. Does this answer your concern? Maybe. One of my mindfulness Vipassana teachers came to him and said, I think I need more concentration. He said, oh, do the body scan. What I did, but much more systematically, much more carefully, because that is one way of developing concentration. And then I know other teachers who will teach breath meditation first as a way of developing concentration prior to doing the body scan. And that's the right way. So there's all these different ways. And so ideally, you'd either find your own way, or through the balance and how to work these together, or you would have a teacher you talk to and the teacher would help you guide you to what's appropriate at any given time in your practice. Yeah, this is interesting. I got a bad foot with counting the breaths. That's right. I had to fill a cap-flow book. And I did that for two years and thinking I had to be able to sit still. But as a result of that, because of the way I did it, anything that was synchronous with my breath, it took me away from the body and into the numbers. And that made noting harder, actually. So I kind of had this bad reaction against that. But then I kind of got reintroduced to it. Teachers suggested I do it. So what I'm trying, and here's what I'd like your reaction to, I'm trying to count in between the breaths. You know, you get full in and out. That's fully just knowing that you're paying attention to the sensations of the body. And then I just count. But I'm feeling what I'm paying attention to my sit-offs. That's what I count. I'm trying to kind of fiddle us around and find something that works. I was wondering if that's... That sounds great. That sounds great to me. Trial and error, right? Yeah. Sounds good to me. If it's working for you and helping you get still and centered, go for it. So I hope you appreciated a little pep talk on the importance of the body. And I hope that maybe for those of you who haven't heard this kind of teaching before, it sparks your interest maybe to take your body a little bit more seriously and drop into your body more and start paying attention to what's going on in your body. The sensations and what the sensations mean and what's going on. And just offering this really loving and healing attention. I think of attention as being a really healing balm that we offer to whatever we bring attention to, careful attention. And if you bring it to your body, I think you'll find it to great benefit. So we have about four minutes. What I'd like to ask you is we spend the last couple of minutes just doing a very short sitting so we can leave a little bit in that meditative mode. Taking one long, slow, deep breath. And as you exhale, dropping into your body. So may your relationship to your body develop to such an extent that you can call your body, your friend. And maybe some of you have already realized this today, that heat is a very helpful aid to being in your body. So appreciate that benefit that comes from the heat. Thank you.
