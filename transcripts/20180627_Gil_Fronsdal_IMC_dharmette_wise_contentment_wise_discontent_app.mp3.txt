Dharmette : Wise Contentment, Wise 
Discontent

The theme for this morning is contentment . It’s a very 
important part of the practice. The Buddha associated 
contentment with a certain kind of joy. It creates a 
foundation for a meditation practice. The Buddha 
sometimes  had a series of foundations, each one a 
foundation for the next. Contentment is the  foundation 
for being able to put aside the hindrances  – the five 
distracting forces inside of us. With contentment, we 
can put aside the distractions and settle into the 
practice.  
 
I don’t know how popular the topic contentment is. You 
don’t regularly  hear on the news that so -and-so 
experienced contentment today. It’s not usually news -
worthy. Maybe it should be , because content ment  has 
such a profound impact on people. Contentment comes 
with a feeling of being settled, a willingness to be here. 
Contentmen t is a feeling that some aspect of the 
present moment is good , or is enough. We’re not feeling 
agitated or inadequate. We’re not feeling that the situation is somehow less than ideal. It’s adequate, and 
we’re content with it.  
 
An important part of practic e is to reflect on contentment 
and discontent ment , and to l earn how to have a wise 
relationship with both. There’s a time for contentment,  
and there’s actually a time for wise disconten t. It isn’t 
either -or, as though you should have only contentment , 
and not ever be discontented again . But rather , there  
are wise forms of both. There are  also unwise forms of 
both, because certainly you can be content at times 
when you shouldn't be content.  
 
A place to begin understanding wise contentment is with 
what’s called the basic requisites of our human life. To 
be content is to have enough to basically be taken care 
of. We have enough shelter. We have adequate food, 
clothing , and basic health care. It’ s remarkable that 
many of us  in this particular corner of the universe have 
housing, food , and clothing , and medical care to some 
degree . But it’s still  so easy to feel discontented with 
what we have.  
 
Here we have  some of the best medical care  in the 
world. It may not be the best, but what’s available is 
pretty phenomenal in the history of humanity. Even 
comparing  what’s  available here with other places in the 
world, you can still be discontented : “There  must a 
better doctor . My doctor didn’t study the latest journal articles. ” It’s certainly true that sometimes it’s good to 
research and look further, but to have this discontent?  
 
The housing that people have! How many people are 
discontented with their housing? Maybe none of yo u, 
but there are people who want more , or bigger,  or 
something different. And clothing! How many  different 
pieces of clothing do you have? How often do you go 
shopping for more? The styles have changed, but do 
you really need it?  
 
The Buddha specifically t alked about contentment with 
the basic requisites of life , not as a form of asceticism , 
but as a way of emphasizing and supporting something 
different: a mind that is not agitated by those things . 
Instead  of being agitated by wanting more , we can get 
the b enefits of appreciating  what we have  – not 
because it’s Pollyannaish  to appreciate what we have . 
It’s just strate gic if you want to be a meditat or.  
 
If you want to settle and quiet your mind , to not have a 
distracted mind , it really helps if you cultivate a degree 
of contentment with what you have in life. You might 
want to assess the things that you have , that you need , 
and that you want to have . Are they really needs?  Is the 
cost-benefit analysis really in your favor if what you 
want is a contemplative life?  If you want to use this 
practice of meditation  to open up your heart  and mind in 
new ways , is it really worth spending your time feeling like: “I don’t have the latest gadget,”  or “I need 
something else, ” or “I need more of this,” or “I need 
more of that?”  
 
The food thing is just astounding. Ever since  I’ve been 
involved in Buddhism , for over 40 years, it’s amazing 
the discontent and neurosis around people’s food 
issues. Of course, it’s never neurotic  or astounding 
when it’s current . But in a perspective of forty years, the 
trends that have come through!  Every trend seems like , 
“This is it !” But if I go back over these 40 years and look 
at all the trends, it’s just a different content in which to 
not be contented. I love it that content and con tent are 
the same word. So you have to wonder , at least a teeny 
bit, whether the latest thing is rea lly the greatest.  Is it? 
Really?  Maybe it is, but are you sacrificing your 
contentment because you feel like you have to have this 
food?  
 
One of the interesting places we see this is on the 
weeklong retreats we teach. Some people have such 
concerns around their diet. Some  people do have to be 
concerned with their diet; it’s really important. But some 
people who are concerned about their diet  could  go a 
week and not have any dire consequences. But they 
come with all their stuff , and they  make sure it’s just 
right. I remember there was one person who was all 
about having no dairy fat  – that was so  important ! But 
now in recent years,  it’s “I have to have dairy fat  beca use it says so  in The New York Times .” It’s a whole 
new thing , but with the same passion  [laughter] . Yes, 
mistrustful lady looking at me  [laughs] , I’m sorry. Maybe 
I shouldn’t be talking this way.  
 
But what  are we sacrificing? Why are we willing to be 
discontented? Is there more contentment that we can 
be nourished and supported by , that can help us be 
settled  and feel adequate , or at least let go of 
inadequacy?  I would like to suggest that there are many 
more reasons to be content than most people avail 
themselves of.  
 
But it  can be overdone . You don’t want to be content 
with your suffering : “I’m suffering and content with it. It’s 
great , and I’ll just go on suffering.” In Buddhism , we’re 
supposed to have wise discontent  with suffering  – to be 
intolerant of it , but not aversive to it, or agitated by it . 
There’s  a healthy way of being discontented with 
suffering , which actually helps settle the mind : “I don’t 
have to live with this. I don’t want to keep suffering in 
the same way , or have the same anxiety or desperation. 
I want to address  this. And I want to address  it 
seriously, with integrity , and in a noble way. I have a 
path of practice . Buddhism is here to address it. ”  
 
To know that there is a path and a practice and you’re 
not going to put up with it can actually be very 
reassuring for parts of your heart and mind . There  is a way of having discontent with suffering. In some ways , 
the more mature people  become  in practice, the deeper 
they go, and the more they become discontented with 
their suffering  in a wonderful way . They ’re okay with 
having it. The more they practice , the mo re mature and  
relaxed they are. They  don’t have a problem with having 
some suffering.  It’s okay. But they’re also not content 
with it , thinking , “This  is how it should be. ”  
 
They say, “O kay, this is something to meet , to address , 
to be with , to work with, and find a way through. It can 
be quite inspiring. In fact , it can bring a lot of joy to know 
you have a practice that meets your suffering. You’re  so 
lucky ! And you can be content . Rather than being 
discontented  because of having suffering, be content 
that you are discontent. So what I’m trying to say is , “Be 
content you have a practice that addresses a healthy 
discontent with suffering. ” 
 
There’s  a range. Th ere’s a time for discontentment and  
a tim e for contentment. It’s helpful and healing to call 
upon contentment, to make it more a part of your life, to 
take times during the day when  you sit in a contented 
way, rather than always on the go , and always 
discontented . Are  there times when  you can sit and 
have a cup of tea , and use that time as an opportunity  
to be contented?  What begins to be nourished, what 
begins to open, and what begins to settle in you when 
you take some time  to appreciate your contentment?    
There are times  when  it’s re ally good to address 
suffering  – the attachments, clinging, and sorrows we 
have  – be discontented with just accepting it as it is, and 
meet it with practice and contentment. To have 
contentment with “Wow, I have this practice!” To b e 
content with being able to address it practice -wise, to 
not be in a hurry , and see how it goes .  
 
So may each of you be content in just the right way. 
And may each of you be discontented in just the right 
way. Good luck.  
 
Thank you.
