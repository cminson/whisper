So, this style of practice, as I mentioned earlier, the same instructions are given whether we are sitting in meditation in formal practice or in our daily lives. 
The instructions are no different. 
It's just what we meet that when we settle in meditation, what we meet tends to become more subtle that we see subtler things in sitting practice than we do in our daily lives. 
But there's no difference in the instruction. 
And the purpose or the main purpose of our time and our practice together is really to establish mindfulness so that we can learn about our minds, so that we can learn about understand the ways in which our minds, the mental habits and patterns that we have tend to catch us in struggle and confusion and reactivity, in wanting things to be a certain way and aversion. 
And so we learn about our minds through this cultivation. 
We establish mindfulness in a way that we can be interested in learning about what's going on in our minds to learn about our mental patterns and habits and how our mental habits and patterns actually pull us in and have us creating the conditions of suffering in our own minds that we start to cultivate through this practice. 
We start to cultivate the wisdom that helps our minds to recognize how we are participating in creating suffering and to the wisdom of our minds begins to help our minds reorient towards letting go of those habits and patterns that tend to constrict us. 
So this practice from my teacher Sayoda Utejnaya that I'm going to be offering for this retreat is really an emphasis on learning to explore the mind. 
And so sometimes it's called mindfulness of mind or awareness practice or receptive awareness is a way I often like to frame the practice that we are just settling back to receive what the experience is, not trying to construct anything in particular, not even aiming or directing the mind at any particular experience, but relaxing the body and receiving, recognizing that we're aware and receiving the experience that is already here. 
And through that that frame of receiving experience, having some curiosity about that experience, so it's not simply being mindful, it's not simply being aware, it includes or it needs to have an orientation of how we are aware, aware of experience in the present moment as experience in the present moment. 
And that sounds maybe like nothing, but it's a really different way of relating to experience than our usual way, we usually when we become aware of experience, we are oriented around how that experience relates to me. 
What do I need to do about it? How can I fix it or change it or hold on to it? Make it continue, get rid of it. 
And so there's a relationship, a habitual relationship to that experience that's oriented around my, the ego, the sense of self, me in relationship to that. 
And what this practice is encouraging is orienting towards just a simple recognition of this is what's happening and a curiosity about it in terms of is this, what is this experience? And so for instance, if we're noticing something like frustration, this experience, what is this experience of frustration? Not what do I need to do in order to fix the situation, but what is the frustration like? How does it affect the body? How does it affect the mind? What kind of thoughts does it produce? So a kind of a curiosity, a willingness to be with that experience of frustration to learn how does it impact or affect our system? So that's really the shift of emphasis in terms of cultivating awareness or stabilizing the awareness. 
We not only stabilize mindfulness, but from this perspective of curiosity about experience as experience. 
So the the practice, as I mentioned a moment ago is primarily a receptive practice. 
So we settle down, we will kind of start with, with a relaxation of body of mind. 
And as there is a relaxation of body and mind, you know, very naturally when the mind and body are relaxed, it's not that the mind, when the mind, when the body relaxes, it supports the mind to be relaxed. 
And when the mind relaxes very naturally, it's not caught up in thoughts of past or future or thoughts of present. 
It's just available to be with what's happening in the present moment. 
And so when the mind and body are relaxed, our system, our organism is kind of doing what it's designed to do, which is to be aware. 
And so the the activity of being aware is something that we can relax into, rather than trying to do. 
And so we use relaxation first as a support to kind of come into that place where very naturally there is awareness. 
And in that place where there is awareness, rather than choosing what to pay attention to, like, you know, often meditation, in some forms of meditation, we do allow our mind to relax. 
And then we orient or aim our, our mind towards a particular object, like the breath, for instance. 
And, and then we direct our attention there and stabilize on that in this practice, instead of doing that, we relax our mind. 
So there's the relaxation, that's the first piece. 
And as the body and mind relax, then there is the, the awareness that's there. 
And we recognize, can we recognize that we are aware, that is an important piece. 
That's a piece of the mindfulness, actually. 
And in terms of our daily life practice, that recognition is one of the keys, at least in my experience, the ability to notice, oh, I'm aware. 
And so just, and you may not know exactly what that means. 
But if right now, you know, it's like, do you know that you're aware right now? If you're listening to me, if you're hearing my voice, tracking what I'm saying, you're not lost in thought, there is awareness there. 
And so just acknowledging that, yes, awareness is here. 
You don't have to try to figure out how you know awareness is here. 
That can be a subtler experience that takes some time to land into. 
But just the acknowledgement, yes, there is awareness, simple, yep, awareness is here. 
And then what is obvious, what's already present in that awareness? So right now, I'm just going to take, take you through this just briefly here, relaxing the body, and maybe kind of scanning through the body a little bit, noticing where there might be areas of tension and allowing there to be a relaxation, maybe checking into the head and face and softening those muscles, relaxing the neck and shoulders, the arms and hands, softening the muscles around the chest and upper back, all those muscles around the ribcage. 
Sometimes I find as I orient to just attending to that area, naturally a deeper breath occurs that supports a relaxation of those muscles, the stretching of the muscles around the ribcage on the in breath and the softening, the letting go on the out breath, the relaxing of those muscles on the out breath. 
Relaxing the muscles across the stomach and abdomen, middle and lower back, hips, hip sockets, legs, feet. 
And sometimes there's also access to a conscious relaxation or just checking in and seeing if there can be a relaxation more deeply inside the body in the kind of visceral area. 
So maybe the inside of the throat can relax, maybe the heart, the area around the heart can relax, maybe the stomach, the intestines can relax. 
And then another way into relaxation sometimes, not an active doing of relaxing but once there is some measure of relaxation, whatever relaxation has happened through this process, then kind of dropping in a request, made the body relax and not trying to do it but just seeing how did the body and mind respond to this invitation. 
It's kind of like you're asking your body and mind to see, to show you if there's more relaxation that our system knows how to connect with, that our system has access to, that we don't have conscious access to. 
May the body relax. 
Just dropping that in and then seeing what happens. 
May the body relax. 
And then softening, relaxing the mind. 
And sometimes this is more easily done in a way just to request, may the mind relax because we don't often know what it means to consciously relax the mind and that can create some tension. 
So maybe just that request again, may the mind relax. 
Don't even think about what it means, just ask the system. 
Maybe the mind can relax. 
One analogy that can support this, because we often think about our mind as being somewhere located in our head or associated with our brain, a kind of an analogy that Gil suggests that sometimes can be supportive. 
Because if your brain were a muscle, maybe the brain can relax. 
In this relaxation, this process of relaxation has included awareness. 
We've been aware of the body, of the mind as we've been exploring relaxation. 
So this has been a mindfulness practice. 
We have been using awareness. 
And now as the body and mind have relaxed, see if you can just attune, recognize there is awareness. 
Am I aware? Is there awareness? Sometimes it might be framed as a kind of a recognition, oh, awareness is here. 
Or it might be framed as a question, aware? Is there awareness? And that question itself, is there awareness? Is kind of, it's more like that reflection or dropping in the question of, may the body relax? It's more like inviting the body and mind to show you, oh, this is awareness. 
Am I aware? And settle back and see that question can bring a sense of curiosity to this experience of awareness itself. 
Those of you who have done this practice and are familiar with that experience can land there and just kind of rest in that place of recognizing awareness. 
If you're unfamiliar with that, with this practice, then often the easiest way in to know that you're aware is to be aware of something. 
And so that's the next thing that we explore is, well, am I aware? Is there awareness? And what is awareness already knowing? What is awareness aware of? Whatever's obvious. 
What is obvious in experience? Awareness is awareness. 
That is some combination or collection of experiences. 
There's often body experience that's involved. 
So the sensations, physical sensations of contact of the body with the chair or cushion or pinch, sofa. 
So the physical sensations of connecting with earth or ground. 
Or it might be a more, in the physical experience, it might be a more kind of energetic quality of vibration or pulsing or tingling or pulling or pressure, contact points, maybe some experience of temperature, heat or coolness or even moisture of stickiness. 
So the experience of body is one area that is often available kind of naturally when we notice that we're aware. 
That is an obvious kind of experience that can be seen or felt. 
The experience of hearing also can be quite predominant. 
It's my speaking, the words and then the pauses, hearing and then silence, hearing and silence. 
Maybe in the silence, there's a moment of recognizing the silence and then the attention shifts to the body again or to a thought, moods or emotions, the emotional terrain, another area where there might be obvious experience such as what's naturally being received. 
So this is an aspect of receiving experience. 
Am I aware and what is obvious and how about now? In this practice, we are exploring a kind of a continuity of mindfulness through moment after moment, noticing what's here, what's obvious and that changes moment after moment. 
For a few moments, there may be the sensation of vibration in the body and then an itch and the attention is drawn to the itch. 
Then there's a thought that tends to pull the mind away but it's noticed and so we can let that go. 
Then there's a kind of an emotion. 
So just moment after moment, aware. 
That's obvious. 
The way in which we connect to this moment after moment awareness is also an important part of our practice. 
Thinking of it as receiving may help to keep the effort light because we're not aiming the mind at anything. 
We are simply settling back and saying, okay, mind, body, show me what's next. 
So we're not in charge that can allow there to be a little less kind of tightness around the doing of the meditation. 
And yet we do have to keep connected the effort in this practice, wise effort in this practice is how we connect moment to moment to recognize there's awareness and what's obvious. 
At the beginning, we can just remind ourselves to be aware. 
That is the effort. 
In a formal practice, particularly, am I aware? So recognition and attuning to that and then what is obvious? You can use those questions explicitly if you wish but also use them lightly, very light in the back of the mind. 
Over time, the need to use those questions recedes but at first it can be helpful as a way to connect, to kind of stay in the meditation. 
Aware, what? What's here? How about now? And now. 
It's not hard to be aware for just a moment. 
Just right now, just hearing the sound of my voice, just relax and just take in the sound of my voice. 
How hard is that? You don't have to work too hard to be aware of that. 
How about connecting with the experience of your hands, wherever they are, however they're disposed? Again, as I name that area, probably the attention just naturally kind of aims to it, connects with it for just a moment. 
That it's not hard to be mindful for a moment but what is more challenging is to sustain that mindfulness. 
But that sense or that touching in to just awareness for a moment. 
Aware now of the contact of your hips against the chair or cushion your bench. 
Touch points of your hands, a breath, hearing my voice. 
In a moment, it's not very hard to connect. 
And that level of effort that was needed for each of those, which is pretty light, pretty light touch, that level of effort is the level of effort to make in a moment. 
We connect for a moment, we're aware, and then we do it again. 
Just enough effort to be present for this moment. 
And being aware in this moment, we can kind of choose to say, okay, how about the next moment? Just a gentle light touch moment after moment. 
And now, and now. 
Over time, we begin to get attuned to how frequently we need to remind ourselves to be aware. 
At first, we may need to remind ourselves pretty frequently. 
Because there's the tendency to be pulled into our thoughts and our worries and concerns or reflections on what's happening next. 
And so a kind of a continual kind of recognition. 
And maybe it's a recognition of thinking or thinking about what's next. 
But at least then there's awareness of that. 
So at first, we may need to remind ourselves more frequently to be aware. 
But over time, we begin to get a sense of the momentum of the mindfulness. 
That we are aware and we know we're aware and we're just receiving. 
There's a sense of just a flow of receiving without needing to do too much to remember to do it. 
It's just the condition of the mind is receiving experience. 
We can get familiar with that. 
That state, that's the beginning of the experience of mindfulness getting established. 
And then we may begin to also then recognize of when we lose touch with that quality. 
And that would be when we would kind of reconnect, remind ourselves. 
And so as the momentum of mindfulness builds, we probably need to remind ourselves less frequently. 
Are you aware? That is obvious. 
When I first met Sayadaw Uteja Nia, the first instruction he gave to me, the very first thing he said to me is, the only work to give your mind is to remind yourself to be aware. 
That's the effort of the meditation. 
And we only remind ourselves to be aware for as long as this moment. 
And that reminding may have a short momentum or a longer momentum. 
But there's not like a way to remind ourselves to be aware for longer that coming into being of that moment of awareness will have its life, will have a kind of a momentum. 
And we arrive at that momentum and begin to recognize when that momentum wanes and remind ourselves again. 
The concentration in this practice builds through the continuity of mindfulness. 
It's a different form of concentration than stabilizing with the breath, but it is a legitimate and very powerful form of concentration that allows us to see into our minds, our habits, our patterns, understand how our minds participate in suffering and understand the conditions for moving it away from suffering. 
And so this is wise effort, wise mindfulness and wise concentration. 
In this very simple instruction, all together, all three together, cultivated together with this simple instruction. 
The mind is going to wander, of course. 
The mind will get lost in thought. 
A crucial part of the practice is having a skillful relationship to the moment when we recognize mindfulness returning. 
Because that's what's actually happening when we think about, oh, my mindfulness has been lost. 
What's actually happening is that mindfulness has returned and it's recognized what was happening in the moments before. 
So noticing that awareness has returned, that is a really helpful practice. 
When you notice the mind wandering or notice that the mind has been wandering, you're noticing awareness is back, aware again. 
I'd like to emphasize that recognition in the formal practice. 
Because it is a crucial part of how this practice translates into daily life. 
Recognizing mindfulness has returned in a moment. 
You didn't do that, it happened, it just arises. 
The recognition or the attuning to what that's like for mindfulness to return. 
It happens a ton in our sitting meditation, it happens all the time that we've gotten lost and awareness returns. 
So it doesn't matter how many times our mind wanders, each time we return we get this opportunity to notice this re-arising of awareness. 
Because we notice that re-arising of awareness, that's a great place to begin to get familiar with the quality of what it's like to be aware. 
Because there's a little bit of a contrast between what it's like now with awareness present and what it was like a moment before where the mind was a little caught in whatever it was caught in. 
So there's a little contrast between not being mindful and being aware. 
So we can notice that quality of awareness as it arises. 
So that's when we notice that we had been wondering, just seeing if there can be an attunement to, oh, aware again. 
Maybe useful to check in and see if there's been tension that's crept in to our mind and body while the mind was wandering. 
If so, it can be useful to reattune to relaxing the body, just using that as a way to reconnect, relaxing the body, relaxing the mind again. 
But it can also be very useful as the mindfulness returns to be curious about, sometimes we, in that moment when mindfulness returns after the mind has been wandering, we are almost thinking we should be starting where we were when we left off, as if that wandering mind had never happened. 
And yet that wandering mind has affected the mind. 
When the mind is thinking, planning, remembering, fantasizing, judging, reflecting, it constructs something in the mind. 
And so when the mindfulness returns, it can be useful to be curious about, okay, there has been thinking. 
What has been the effect of that thinking? What has been the effect of that thinking? And so noticing awareness, what's been the effect of thinking? Sometimes there is tension that's crept in, and if that's what's happened, allowing a relaxation can be supportive for the practice. 
Sometimes we can find, and way more than I ever would have thought when I first started practicing. 
The mind can wander into more calm, more ease, more peace than there was before. 
Sometimes our mind is actually in the wandering letting go of things. 
And when mindfulness returns, if we're not judging ourselves for having been wandering, we can touch into that letting go that has happened. 
Being aware of that, oh, actually there's calm here right now. 
There's ease, there's peace here right now. 
And letting that support aware, aware of calm, aware of ease, aware of peace. 
Are you aware? That is obvious. 
Gently reminding yourself moment after moment to connect. 
Just enough awareness to connect with this moment. 
That's enough. 
And then the next moment. 
The last piece I'll bring in for the instructions briefly this morning is, so mostly right now we've talked about relax, recognize awareness, and notice what's obvious, as well as the relationship with the mindfulness returning from wandering. 
And yet simply being aware, there can be things going on, even with practiced meditators, as we're being aware, there can be agendas about the meditation, there can be things going on behind the scenes that are influencing how we're relating to experience. 
We are exploring wanting to be curious about what the experience is in the moment with a relaxed, receptive quality. 
And so we're curious about how the mind is paying attention as well. 
So this is a piece around noticing the attitude or the relationship with which we are practicing. 
How are we in relationship to the experience? So there's awareness and what's happening, and then what's the relationship to what is happening? So I don't call this checking the attitude. 
What's the relationship? What's the attitude in the mind connected with what's happening or connected with the practice of mindfulness or connected with the meditation and agenda about what should be happening, that could be an attitude. 
There's roughly four kinds of attitude that we might notice. 
There can be an attitude of wanting something to happen, of greed, of leaning towards something of grasping or holding, clinging to something. 
There might be an attitude of aversion of not liking something, wanting something to go away, wanting to get rid of something. 
Can be flavors of frustration, anger, aversion, fear, those flavors of mind. 
Not liking, not wanting this to be here. 
That can be an attitude that's present. 
Not liking an attitude that's present, and I'll get to the other two in a moment. 
If you notice a kind of a wanting or a not wanting that's there as you check, you know, what is the attitude in the mind right now, you notice a wanting or not wanting. 
Basically what we're exploring is allowing that to now become, come into conscious awareness. 
It's like allowing it to come from behind the scenes to being in the field of what we are aware of. 
These attitudes of greed or aversion are potent and pull us towards their agendas when we are not aware of them. 
When we are aware of them, there is the possibility that they can simply be in the field and we don't have to be pulled by them. 
We can just notice them. 
This work of checking the attitude, it's not so much that there's anything to do other than allow yourself to let that now be something that you are aware of also. 
There's awareness and there's this pain in my back and there's a not liking of it. 
That's what's happening. 
That's what's obvious right now that I've checked the attitude. 
Yeah, not liking is there. 
Oh, and that not liking, wow, that creates a little tension around the whole area of the back. 
Oh, okay. 
Well, that's what's happening right now. 
It goes down the hip. 
Okay, that's what's happening right now. 
The checking of the attitude, there's not so much anything to do with it other than to allow it to be known as the next thing that we are aware of. 
And then what's next and what's next and what's next. 
So the attitudes of greed and diversion, those flavors are two key attitudes that we might notice. 
The third is a flavor of delusion, of not connecting or of being a little spaced out perhaps, or maybe having a view or an idea. 
If is a big way that delusion creeps in an idea about what the meditation should be, shouldn't be like this, should be like that, that may not have a flavor as much of greed or aversion, but it's not an agenda. 
So this is another kind of attitude that might be there. 
The fourth kind of attitude is what Saita calls wise attitude or right attitude. 
And that's a kind of attitude that is okay with what's happening in the present moment, is curious and interested about what is happening in the present moment, is not disturbed by what is happening. 
It is just there. 
We are aware of it. 
This is the direction that the whole practice begins to carry us towards this more ongoing attitude of wise mindfulness. 
We are aware and okay, no problem, just this, it's like this. 
Sometimes we may, in checking the attitude, not notice so much about what the attitude is, and that's okay. 
But you could check in, if there's nothing obvious, you could check in, am I okay with what's here? That may support your beginning to actually touch in, oh, this is, this is wise attitude. 
It is a flavor of equanimity, has many flavors actually, it might have a flavor of calm or peace or ease or it might have a flavor of curiosity or delight or interest. 
Might just be, yeah, no problem, or it's okay. 
We move in the direction of wise attitude by being curious about what's here and being curious about the unwise attitudes, being curious about the attitudes of greed, aversion or delusion. 
Oh, that's here. 
It's like, if we might be able to recognize, okay, there's that pain in my back and there's a not liking of it, oh wow, okay, so I noticed the not liking, that's okay. 
We can have wise attitude, we can be okay knowing not liking is happening, then the not liking is no longer the attitude in the mind, it's just an object, it's just an experience that is being known, not liking is happening, it's not, it's not leading the mind anymore, it's just being known, relax, are you aware? That is obvious. 
How about now? How about now? So, at the 10-15 time when we come back together, or when some of us come back together, we will not talk nearly as much. 
It will be much more of just the little gentle pointers are dropping in the reminders to support your learning how to practice with this form of practice. 
Now I want to talk just a moment about walking, walking practice and eating practice and actually everything practice because some of us are in our lives with families and children, teenagers, so that there's going to be other things going on in our day. 
And again, the instructions are very much the same in a formal walking practice which some of you may take some time to do during your retreat. 
We use the same kind of four, you know, basically four parts, we relax, recognize awareness that we're aware, noticing what's obvious and from time to time checking the attitude of the mind. 
So those are the basic like aspects of the meditation practice, relax, recognize that we're aware, notice what's obvious and from time to time check the relationship. 
How are we in relationship to the experience? And so we can do this whatever we're doing. 
We can do this while we're eating, oh, can I relax while eating and be aware and notice what's obvious, chewing and tasting or listening to a conversation between my kids or whatever. 
Can we be aware of just what's here, what's obvious and every now and then checking in. 
How am I in relationship to this? Frustrated, that it's not quiet or whatever. 
And so there's no need to focus on anything in particular, but in each of our activities and each of our daily activities, it can be useful to start by checking in, how can I be relaxed with this? That's a really useful doorway. 
How can I be relaxed while walking? How can I be relaxed while eating? How can I be relaxed while people are having a conversation or is there a way to have a little more relaxation? And if not, am I aware? Even asking that question of can there be more relaxation, there is some awareness and so here. 
Okay, aware. 
This is awareness, a reminder in my own practice in the last few days or last couple of weeks actually that's come up that I found useful. 
When there is awareness and I'm just wanting to be curious about the experience, a kind of a reminder that this is enough. 
This is what the meditation is supposed to be. 
It doesn't have to be any different than this. 
So if there is tension and there's people talking at over dinner and you wish it to be quieter, it's like, well, this is what the meditation is supposed to be. 
This is awareness. 
This is what the meditation is supposed to be. 
Aware of this and aware of the frustration that's here. 
And so that's a useful tool at times just to remind yourself of that. 
So in a formal walking practice, it's useful to begin to start with a, you know, seeing can you find a pace that feels relaxed, that's often a good place to begin the walking practice if you're doing a formal walking practice. 
Just start with a pace that feels really comfortable. 
So attuning to relaxation and comfort and ease, play with the pace. 
Maybe go a little faster, a little slower and find the pace of movement where the mind can relax with being aware with it. 
So that's the relaxation part. 
And then noticing that you're aware and what's obvious in the walking practice, there's going to be a lot of seeing and hearing going on. 
And in this practice, again, we're not restricting our field of attention. 
And so that's a great area to begin to notice in the walking. 
There's the physical movement of the body, but we're not necessarily attuning to that. 
That may be obvious. 
You can attune to that if that's what's obvious, but often seeing and hearing are what's obvious in the walking. 
And so knowing, seeing is happening, knowing, hearing is happening. 
An exploration in that domain around noticing, seeing and hearing is to be curious about the difference between the experience of seeing, which I would say is kind of a more receptive quality of not focusing on anything, just kind of the broad field, almost like you're just a camera moving through space, just not looking at anything in particular. 
So the difference between seeing and looking when the attention shifts and kind of orients to something. 
We don't have to preference the seeing, but it's really useful to notice when the mind shifts between seeing and looking, or from one looking to another looking. 
This is the factor of attention in the mind. 
We don't always do this. 
And actually, it's kind of interesting to recognize that when we look, when we pay attention to something, it's not always a conscious choice. 
It's something in the mind. 
It's a condition that has happened. 
For instance, something I see a lot is when I'm walking, and if I see something, if there's a movement in the field of vision, a bird flies across, or there's a splotch of color that is obvious, the attention orients to that without my doing it. 
It's very natural. 
This is a function of our minds to orient when something new pops up or there's movement. 
And so this is why in many times, why the attention would shift from seeing to looking, or from one looking to another looking. 
And so you don't have to preference seeing, but being curious about the shift, the shift of attention from seeing to looking, or from one looking to another, or the shift back to seeing. 
Just don't have to make any of it happen. 
Just be curious about what happens for you as you're walking. 
And also in the hearing, this kind of attentional shift might happen. 
You might be aware of a kind of an ambient sound in the background, and then something happens, a lawnmower turns on, or a car blares, or a bird screeches, and the attention shifts to that instead of just hearing, we're now listening. 
So again, the shift from hearing to listening, from one listening to another listening. 
This is helping the mind get curious about the factor of attention in the mind. 
And this aspect of shift of attention is one of the explorations, not only in seeing and hearing, but also in our body, in our physical experience, the shift from one sensation to another, or from the shift from a body sensation to the arising of a thought. 
When we become attuned to this experience of the shift of attention from one thing to the next, that can really help the continuity of the mindfulness, because it is often in the shift when the attention shifts from one thing to another. 
When we're not aware of that shift, that is one of the prime avenues through which our mind wanders into thought. 
We're seeing, we look, then there's a movement. 
We see it's a bird, and it's like, oh, what kind of a bird is that? Oh, I think it's a hawk, and then we're thinking about hawks and where it lives and where it, and we're lost. 
But if we notice the shift, oh, seeing, looking, then there's some possibility of maintaining the continuity of awareness. 
So that's an important exploration in the walking practice, that can be a really supportive exploration that can then feed back into the sitting practice, because then we can begin to get familiar with that shift of attention and learn to understand the different ways that attention shifts in the sitting practice as well. 
So again, in the walking, just relax, notice awareness, and what is obvious? If the body is obvious, notice that. 
Notice the shift perhaps from one field of attention to the next, from the shift from the body to seeing, and the shift back to the body, maybe a thought, just awareness of that. 
And again, the same thing around if the mind wanders into thinking, the mind wanders into thinking, and the moment of awareness returning, notice that, notice the awareness returning, and notice the attitude in that moment, because often we have a relationship, we have a relationship in that moment both to the fact that the mind has been wandering often, a kind of a judgment about that, notice that, just be aware of that, see if there can be a forgiveness for this and an orientation towards, oh, this is another opportunity to recognize awareness coming back. 
But we also can have an attitude or a kind of that has been created based on where the mind has been wandering. 
When the mind wanders into thought, it shapes things in our mind. 
If we've been wandering in a thought about an argument that we had with somebody a week ago, then when we return, that argument and the experience around that has shaped something. 
And if we're not opening to that experience of how am I as a result of the mind wandering, you know, that can create an attitude in the mind related to that memory or that whatever, you know, that argument, if it was an argument, that can create an attitude in the mind which can not be recognized if we're not kind of orienting towards, okay, I'm aware again, how am I in relationship to being aware again, what's the attitude, and maybe how has the wander and shaped the mind. 
So it's time for us to stop for this session. 
I'd like to encourage you to practice with this as you can. 
I mean, you all have different situations, but there is a 45 minute period now if you're interested in practicing with the walking, you know, you're welcome to do that or just go on with your day until we come back together at 1. 
30. 
And that will be a time I'll offer a few more reflections filling out the instructions a little bit more for things I haven't quite gotten to, and then taking questions. 
And you're welcome to fill out the questions either, you know, if you want to fill out the question using the retreat announcements, the form on the retreat announcements, that's fine. 
So I'm not going to take questions now, but there will be that opportunity later this afternoon and practice with this today, we'll have a discussion this afternoon, so thank you all for your practice and may this be of service for all beings. 
See you in a while.
