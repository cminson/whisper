 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Welcome and warm greetings to this time, these next 30 minutes for our meditation. Meditation has a lot to do with being local. Everything from the Dharma point of view, in a sense, is local. It's here. Local means in locale of this body, this time, here, now. And so it's possible to have a bird's eye view of something. I was struck by, I was in New Zealand in February during the cyclone. And the bird's eye view of the intensity of the storm was terrible. And the news was focusing on some of the great damage that was being done and people killed. And about what was not being shown from this kind of high-end view were all the people who were helping each other. Locally, a lot of people coming to the aid of neighbors and friends, a lot of people mobilized to try to help. So we got closer and closer to where we were. The people right there in the little place that I was staying and practicing was, they were so kind and so friendly and so supportive. And that didn't make the front news, that they were kind, supportive, helpful people. So we begin being really local. And here, the most local is here with ourselves. And here, we try to care, appreciate for the people who are most close, which happens to be you, you yourself. Not in some kind of sentimental way, not in some kind of conceited way, but kind of a straightforward, very simple appreciation and respect for the life that's being lived in this body, in this heart, in this mind. That this life too, if you come in close, is something to care for, support, and to appreciate and to respect. We come to our mind, we learn over time that everyone can be respected, including ourselves, deep respect. Everyone can be appreciated, a deep appreciation, including ourselves. Partly because the alternative of not having respect and not having appreciation is not very healthy. It's actually, in some ways, takes more work, takes more mental power, even though sometimes people have it as a habit and it's so easy to do. And the most local, most deep place to be is to be here, caring for, respecting, appreciating this life, life around us, people, people around us. And the most local of it all is here with ourselves. And with the eyes closed in meditation, it's a training ground of letting go of all that is not respectful, all that is unappreciative about yourself. And you'll find, you don't have to do appreciation or do respect if you let go of all that disrespect and non-appreciation, then you'll find that it's kind of like the appreciation is there, the respect is there, it's just there. The deepest respect is not something we have to muster up. So to assume a respectful meditation posture, that posture in which you're going to appreciate this body, this life now. So no, no posture that requires excessive strain, no heroic posture. Gently closing your eyes. And becoming aware of your body breathing. Your body has breathed many, many, many breaths in this lifetime. Breathing has been a companion, a support, a helper. In all the different ways, it cares for you the best it can. And deeper than the breathing is your heartbeat. Sometimes in meditation you can feel it, sometimes you can't. The heart's been beating for you for longer than you've been breathing. Some people consider the heart beating, the body breathing, to be the source, the origin, the beginning of this life we're living now, here. Breathing and heart beating and blood moving through the body are part of a vast physiological system, neurological systems, that are here to support you, operating often without any thanks or even recognition, here. And to have some modicum of appreciation and respect for this body, even with all its challenges. And rather than appreciating yourself, for now, appreciate that you can appreciate the body, be the appreciator, the respecter of this body, this heart, and this mind, appreciating it, respecting it. Even though they all have their challenges and difficulties, still close up, there's a lot of goodness, a lot of help, a lot of things that are working, a lot that's a miracle to be sitting here. In every breath, every heartbeat, every sensation in the body, even every thought, feeling, emotion, is a bit of a miracle that it should even exist, all part of a large cooperative effort on the part of this mind-body to care for you, and for you to care for, to appreciate, settling yourself into this breathing body with appreciation for all, maybe even a sense of awe that quiets and stills the thinking mind.
