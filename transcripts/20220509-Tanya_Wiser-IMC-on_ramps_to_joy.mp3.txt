The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
And there's lots of different flavors or ways of experiencing Dharma joy but, and
we'll talk a little bit about that, different kinds, but particular I want
to talk about dukkha and faith and their relationship to Dharma joy. And just to
kind of give you a little bit of a description and a simile of what I'm
feeling into through my practice around this is kind of imagine that the Dharma
joy, the Dharma gladness that I'm talking about is just that little those
little like many often many smaller moments of delight, surprise, connection,
that feeling of being fully present right of like wow feeling the sun on the
skin something really simple or a bird right landing somewhere where you can
see or just that somebody's eyes making connection with yours right just it can
be it's a really a moment of meeting, meeting our experience in the moment and
it comes with some degree of up swelling. And so I kind of have this image of maybe
a river or something that's flowing right the present moment of flowing this
movement and then there's all these little tributaries or kind of it's funny
in my imagination the rivers up higher than these other things this is just
because of the feeling of it right and sometimes we're more in the muck of
things we're more in the mind and worry and more in the dukkha of life and it
doesn't feel like we're gliding along and that sort of clean smooth feeling
joyous kind of presence but there can be this kind of weak might be kind of in
the muck a bit and something can happen something can come along something can
shift and we can feel this upwelling this upwelling and this lift and then we get
to be in that current of the moment and so this is sort of like the simile is you
know the slower muckier places can be where we get stuck in things and we're
having some degree of suffering or we're clinging and we're just not really in
the flow and as we're going along if we remember if we notice what's happening
if we have some clarity about what's going on if we see we're suffering the
first noble truth we might be able to recognize what we're clinging to what
we're holding on to and when we see we're clinging when we see with wisdom
that we're kind of stuck if we have been practicing and we've watched this
dynamic we know we know that if we keep clinging it's only going to get worse and
so we let go and then that letting go is that possible moment about swelling the
faith the belief that if I shift in how I'm relating to my experience yeah I can
move more freely so this is the little simile that I'll kind of come back to
and I'm gonna move through these three things this the dukkha the faith and then
the dharma joy and I'm gonna read you a little short quote about the joy and
then I'm gonna talk about the suffering and then the faith and then back to the
joy so tar brak says that joy arises when we are open to both the beauty and
suffering inherent in living like a great sky that includes all different
types of weather joy is an expansive quality of presence it says yes to life
no matter what so saying no to life might be the equivalent of suffering right
when we say no to what's happening in the Dhammapada there's a couple of verses
that kind of talk about the mind and happiness and they go like this the mind
hard to control flighty a lighting where it wishes one does well to tame the
disciplined mind brings happiness the disciplined mind brings happiness here's
another one the mind hard to control flighty a lighting where it wishes one
does well to tame the watched mind brings happiness when it comes to dukkha and
kind of seeing where we are caught in life sayadao uteshvaniya says we need to
learn our lesson there's no shortcut and we really have to find a way to relate
to our suffering in a way that you know helps us choose joy choose happiness
instead so watching the mind right learning to watch the mind and sort of
like watching your footsteps you know choosing where you're gonna place your
feet we can be like that with our minds we can choose what what trains of thought
we're gonna follow what rivers we're gonna choose to ride and as we watch
the mind and see kind of get to know its contents its habits its patterns that's
it's like you know in that boat down the river we become more skilled getting
more and more clear oh if I go down this tributary it's gonna be really sticky
which we can choose not to go that way the Buddha talked about five spiritual
powers or five spiritual faculties and that these are said to be incredibly
important for our practice to move forward and they are faith energy
mindfulness concentration and wisdom and they're progressive and we start with
faith it's necessary for us to step into the practice and it's like an on ramp
it's on the on ramp to the flow and yeah so what happens when we get caught in
our suffering you know why why don't we just if we know the way out why don't we
always just choose to be happy or easy or whatever not so not so simple but maybe
you think about like this idea can you think about a moment a very mild stress
suffering dukkha you might have experienced recently and just notice whether
you were aware of it and then notice if there was any tendency to either kind of
just resign or resist either just say oh well I was I'm gonna just do it wrong
anyway so I might as well just go for it and be you know suffer here or you know
no I don't want it to happen that way I don't want it to go this way I don't want
to feel the way I'm feeling the resistance very often when suffering
happens we either give up resign or get indifferent or we rebel or resist it's
very often our responses well mine is yours you notice is that familiar in
your practice to that sense of resigning giving in or giving up or resisting
trying to fight reality I saw one head nod yes does that mean I'm not not talking
I want to make sure I'm talking to all of you all of you I need to change what
I'm saying if I'm not getting you right right so okay so there's an alternative
relationship we can have which is this one that you know when when we see
suffering when we start to learn to see it as oh I'm holding on to something I'm
struggling I'm hurting it's like feedback it's that simple it can be seen so
simply as just stop wait look what's happening notice pay attention wake up
a simile for suffering that I really like is similar to the river thing but
this is on the side of a freeway or highway usually you ever drive down the
highway and you start to veer off the road and you hit those rumble strips on
the side that kind of like make your tires vibrate and your car bounce really
quickly I kind of think about suffering is like rumble strips it's when we're
veering off the course when we're moving you know moving off the path it's
like this natural feedback that we're going the wrong way and we can we can
resist and just keep trying to you know drive on the rumble strips because we
think we should be able to drive over there you know or we can give up and
drive off the road right or we can go oh this is really irritating but thank you
for waking me up thank you for like giving me feedback that I'm about to
drive off the road here doesn't mean we can think you know we have to feel like
it's a pleasant experience or but we can be grateful and we can have faith that
they're placed there for a reason that they're there to help us stay on the
road we have a choice
another way I like to think about the this relationship with suffering is very
from a very kind of a I guess a therapy minded position which is when we are when
we're hurt when we're you know in a situation where we're being harmed the
fight-or-flight response comes up right which is typically we either fight it
right so we're resisting it same thing or we're running away right those are the
two main responses to being attacked or harmed to fight or to run and then the
other responses to freeze right when we haven't been effectively able to escape
or fight back we tend to go into a neurological state of freezing and to
me this is kind of the same thing it's just that the duke that we're experiencing
in life or the stress is is not something you know like being attacked but
our nervous system responds similarly so if we can start to see suffering in a
different way maybe a radically different way we can see that it's like it could
potentially be that on ramp to joy it helps us see we have a choice and if we
know we don't have to suffer if we know we get to choose it's really natural to
feel a sense of faith and hope right when we recognize I can do something right
here I can shift how I'm relating to what's happening there's a wow like how
amazing is that and that can be like a that transition from the suffering with
the faith to that joy so the faith is what grows in us as we start to see
ourselves over and over again seeing how we make things life make life more
difficult for ourselves or easier for ourselves right when we engage with the
practice and we're paying attention to our lives we can notice what the practice
does for us that we can notice that it helps us be more present be more
connected be less afraid be less anxious be more open some of the things that
also can support our faith in the practice our reflections on the Buddha
the Dharma and the Sangha and so the teacher who got free and the Dharma the
teachings and the Sangha this is a Sangha look at this this is amazing here
we are you know entering our third year of COVID and we're starting to two years
almost of nothing here no people coming to this center and you guys are the new
foundation you are the the beginning of new roots for this place for us to
rebuild together to bring community back together again so Sangha can be a
source of inspiration aspiration support and can help us grow our faith
I think faith grows in when we we take in this kind of goodness take in the
goodness of the practice and said that in the Samyutta Nakaya it is faith that
is one's partner and wisdom that instructs and faith is one's greatest
wealth do you feel you have faith in the Dharma the Sangha or the Buddha do you
feel you have faith in your practice and that it can help you or you've seen
others does that support you yeah it's a precious precious thing for us and yeah
you know seeing even seeing somebody else in their goodness or seeing how
they've changed through their practice can grow our faith when we can't see it
in ourselves keep looking around so this faith is the supporting condition for
gladness for joy and helps us stay on the path stay present and helps us keep
choosing this radical act of turning toward turning toward turning toward and
Lamont she wrote she has a quote I'm going to read for you which I love she
says almost everyone is screwed up broken clingy scared and yet designed for
joy great I think that's just such the greatest quote just you know we've all
got this stuff going on and we're designed for joy it's right there it's
right in us the capacity to experience connect to feel and I don't just mean
like you know you don't have to be like fireworks going off just that that
feeling of that flow that feeling of presence that feeling of it can be like
wonder right ah appreciation joy is the heart celebration of life and Anthony
de Mello says that you know so there's this idea that we've got to say yes to
the joys and the sorrows right to connect life we don't get to say no to the
dukkha if we shut down to difficulty we shut ourselves down to joy as well right
we have to sort of learn how to be with it all so Anthony de Mello says when
there is absolute cooperation with the inevitable this is when we're really in
our practice absolute cooperation with the inevitable this idea that we're
we're not trying to resist that we're already depressed resist that we're
already anything we're here we're right here we're in our moment and when
there's absolute cooperation cooperation with okay here it is right this this
that is kind of like that on ramp to the freeway to the joy we can't divide the
present moment into good parts and bad parts disconnect one from one we
disconnect from both no I don't mean I don't mean we aren't discerning in our
lives I don't mean I mean talking about meeting that the moment this moment
that's already arising I don't mean don't be discerning about your plans or
your jobs or who you do things with discern discern discern choose wisely
but you know once we're here we're here this is it you know this is it this is
now this is what we've got so once we're right here we don't get to press
erase life is additive not subtractive so joy is that openness that includes both
the joys and sorrows aliveness and openness available to the whole play of
existence and the thing to remember is you know joy and gladness don't come
first right fearlessness follows fear practice follows forgetfulness seeing
follows not seeing peace follows truth you know it's like the gladness can
follow the suffering the faith and the suffering doesn't have to come first
right faith is there to help us remember help us see there's another way an
alternate route different way than habitually responding and reacting
there's a man named brass gay and he wrote a book called the book of delights
and he he decided to write this book and so he went about it like every day
going into life looking for little delights and of course it was a
wonderful experience for him because the more he looked the more he saw right
and he's just like tumbling into delight after delight but one of the
amazing things that he says that he puts together is that our suffering and our
our joy are not so separate and one of the things he says is what if we joined
our sorrows what if we joined our sorrows I'm saying I'm saying what if that is
joy well we really come to ourselves really come to this experience we join
it instead of resist it what what kind of a mindset would write such a thing
right what is he experienced that he could say that I wonder you know I was
thinking about this and I thought about being with somebody who was dying
actually somebody who I love deeply and being with them so present with them
right so here you know this is a sorrow right this is a loss and being with him
and being in that sorrow with him was a joy it was such a joy it was so alive he
was dying but what does that mean he was the most alive person I knew at the time
jocoback charlotte jocoback she has some nice quotes on joy and differentiating it
from happiness and she says joy doesn't mean the same thing as happiness happiness
is the up up up I like that up up up joy is the piece in what is the reality is
that when we experience a moment fully for whatever it is joy is revealed I'm
going to read that again yeah joy doesn't mean the same thing as happiness
happiness is the up up up joy is the piece in what is the reality is that
when we experience the moment fully for whatever it is joy is revealed
yeah so I like how do we have that mindset right what do we need to do to
support ourselves you know I like the quote right from from was it Tony Morrison
designed designed for joy what if we believe we're designed for joy that it's
right there that it's right there that it's accessible that it naturally arises
it's not something that we have to make happen rather we have to be available
for it willing to let go into it to receive it and there's something right
there friend was talking about giving a talk on Dharma joy and how everybody was
so resistant to feeling joy for me that's that negative negativity bias in
our brain right there's this part of our brain that's always more bias toward
the threat what might be negative and it just wants to pay more attention to
that so this is where I think we have to make ourselves available we have to
recognize that deeply ingrained survival strategy it's not doing us so good
anymore and step back and go okay yes yes to joy yes to gladness yes to
receiving a teeny tiny moment a sip instead of maybe 24 ounce or super size
me drink right it's it's it's a small bit maybe bit by a bit but how do we keep
saying yes all right
so I want to just invite you to take a moment close your eyes and just just
see if you can connect see if your mind can offer you a memory or the
imagination of an experience of this kind of Dharma joy that gladness or
happiness this aliveness maybe even might be a word that could be used
often feels spontaneous just sort of like a gift that pops up just connecting
with that whatever comes up and notice what does it feel like in your body as
you recall or imagine what do you notice how willing are you to sip it to breathe
into it to let it soak in to come in deep how quickly is the mind ready to
dismiss it and rewrite it or move on
maybe also take a moment just thinking about the rest of your evening tonight
imagine what it would be like if you really received the teeny tiny little
gifts of ease and well-being just a softness of a pillow or a blanket the
flavor of your toothpaste or the clean clean water that you drink clean water
what a gift what would it be like to really open to each of these little
sips tonight and lay down and put your head on your pillow and just feel it
flowing through you all these little gifts may it be so for you may it be so
I wonder if any of you would like to share anything about question or
reflection at this point we're winding up I have a few more quotes I can share
but if there's anybody that feels inspired to share anything right now I'd
like to create space for that Jim has a microphone so if anybody who wants it he
will bring it to you
okay thank you thank you tell you I think you're
right that when I'm meditating and I feel a moment of mindfulness or
awareness I think there is some joy there but I think that what happens is
that I I do tend to dismiss it and and to say oh well this is this is the most
that I can that I can feel and there's and there's so much more that I'm not
able to access rather than just appreciating the joy that is there thank
you for sharing that it's like a sort of again this image of this river and you
know you're skimming we get a little bump right and then it's like but I didn't
get all the way over there you know but it's that it's just like oh yeah feel the
bump feel the little bump and just be like sweet just oh thank you yes let me
say yes to you not no no no no and it goes like it goes like that no no no
you know back down in the muck and then it's back slow slow slow come back and
then you got another little bump and you know it's like this process right where
we just not good enough should be better yeah that I just appreciate you shared
so much thank you yes saying yes yes to the gifts yes little little ones are
good anyone else feel interested here we go thank you it's funny what came up when
yours became out joy was I always park about the same place when I go to my
office it's about five minutes from my office and I walk I don't know on this
nice residential street and there's something about I think like getting out
of my car and the busyness of listening to whatever I'm listening to and just
seeing the birds or seeing the sun often and just having those five minutes just
brings me right there yeah one of my most profound like I shouldn't call it that
but a very memorable retreat experience was just walking meditation right but
then a little bird was in the bush and it popped out and I just was had the gift
of a flood of like delight it was such a simple thing but you know here I maybe
was just practicing with trying to be present so I could receive the gift but
it was really profound really small little things very moving and helpful
right starting your day that way every day what a nice choice what a nice gift
hmm anyone else feel inspired
thank you Natalia thank you to your song I really appreciate you showing the
difference between happiness and joy because I feel like happiness is almost
like a semi-permanent or permanent expected expected state of being that
I've never been able to get to but I do experience joy frequently throughout the
day it's really helpful oh beautiful yeah Charlotte Joe go back has another
sentence in there about how you know in the West in America we're like so
conditioned we have so much you know we have so much material and access to all
this stuff and we're just kind of grown to have some sort of expectations that
we should be happy and we should just we should be happy because we have things
it's just not that's not happy that's not joy I'd much rather have joy much
rather have joy so I'm really really grateful you shared that thank you thank
you any other comments questions reflections no worries if not just
creating enough space for you to decide if you want to go for that microphone
just receiving just the delight of this sharing the space together
and see yeah maybe I'll just say to notice the flavors of gladness the shades of
gladness the colors of gladness of joy there's it's a huge range actually and
you know the mind because of its orientation toward the negative it it can
very easily skip over anything that is neutral to slightly positive even even
really like positive feedback or nice things that can happen if we don't
attend to them if we don't meaning give our awareness to them our appreciation
if we don't receive them let them come in they slip through they're just gone
they don't get committed to memory they don't get that attention they just slide
on but one trip one awkward moment gets a lot more attention a lot more of our
awareness we're much more inclined to tell somebody about something that was
hard even couldn't find parking I had to drive around the block for you know six
times and but then they got out and they got to walk for five minutes in this
beautiful neighborhood and they don't even mention that they just talk about
how they had to drive for you know too long to find parking it's just the way
the mind tends to operate it's how it's evolved and how it's been conditioned
it's not bad but we need to we need to watch the mind that's what brings us
happiness we start to learn how the mind operates and we then can start to learn
how to relate to it in ways that are on ramps to joy so I feel like that's
probably the last thing I should say may you all choose on ramps to joy thank
you for your kind attention and participation
