 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Before I begin this talk, I have an announcement. So there is starting to be plans. There are plans now to try to reopen IMC. Sometimes in the next few weeks, with kind of a COVID-era protocol of different types, including only being open for people who are vaccinated. And so there will be more announcements about this, and information about that will appear on the website. But the announcement now is that this Sunday, after the 10 o'clock Dharma Talk Sunday morning, we'll have a community meeting on Zoom to discuss the opening and questions, concerns, similar to what we did in, I think, in July when we were thinking about opening back then. And so if anybody would like to come, you're welcome to come, even if you plan to not relevant for you because you're not planning to come in person, but it might be interesting to come along. And the information for that is in the calendar. IMC's calendar. And also in the What's New section of the website, the homepage of the website, IMC website. There's on the bottom right, there's a section called What's New. And there there's an announcement about the community meeting with the link, the Zoom link. And it's password protected. So the password is there. But the password is META, M-E-T-T-A. So this week I'm going through the five mindfulness exercises that are taught in the discourse from the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And these are, I call them exercises, these are ways of practicing in order to develop a heightened sense of mindfulness. So that mindfulness is established. And so it's kind of a means. And the means to be mindful is, in a sense, to be mindful. But there are particular ways or emphasis that are given. And the fourth foundation is beginning to pay attention to either the way we get entangled in things, get caught up and attached, or the process by which we get free and liberated. And so there are three exercises around being entangled, being caught. And they're going from coarser, maybe, more activated, more conceptual, more story-centered, more complex world that we live in, to simpler and simpler. And so it started off with the complex world of our attachments to our desires and aversions and to the things where we desire and have aversions towards. And that could be anything, complicated things in the world and ideas and things like that get along. Once we stop getting so concerned in the world of objects and things, in a sense, including our own comfort, then we settle down. And there's a next layer I talked about yesterday, which is the ways in which we identify, the way we get involved with things based on me, myself, and mine. As we get quieter still, and there's less coarser, there's more subtle, and there's less baggage, less complicated ideas and concepts, no concept of self anymore, we're left with simple sense experience in the present moment. We're not thinking about the future and the past, we're just really present here. And we hear a sound, we feel a body sensation, we recognize there's a thought. And they're all considered very simple sense recognitions. And we don't usually think of the mind door as being a sense, but whatever ability we have to recognize, the simplest recognition of what's happening in the mind, before the complexities around it and reactions to it, is called a sense experience. And so with the eye, there's the object of the eye, that's the things we see. And then the Buddha talked about the entanglement between them, the knot that gets formed, how we get knotted up with it. So there are three things happening. There's the eyesight, there's the ability to see the eye, the eyesight that sees. There's a thing that we see. And then kind of imagine that between the object of sight and the eye, there's things get knotted up. Of course, the knot is in our brain and our mind. But we get involved, we get attached to, we get caught up in, we get sticky, we start thinking about it, wanting it, reacting to it. And it's not the complicated ideas of the world, like winning the lottery. It's just in the moment as we go about, it's something very simple. There is a sound, and then we recognize the sound as a car, and then we might get entangled with it. We might start thinking about the sound, or not liking it because it's unpleasant, or liking it because it's pleasant, and wanting more of it, or wanting less of it. And so getting knotted up. In most English translations, they translate this word as fetter. And I don't use the word fetter in my ordinary English life. I don't know if maybe some of you do. But the Pali word has the meaning of being knotted up. So I like just knotted up. And so it's now recognizing that there can be two things. There's the experience we're having, and there's the way that we relate to it. And that way we relate to it might be not free. It might be free of any entanglement. We can engage in it, we can think about it, we can care for things without being entangled. But we also can be entangled. There can be attachment. And it can be very, very subtle. If you just simply start meditation, simply start thinking about something that's happening, you've left the flow of the present moment, and you've now become... Maybe the word like not or entanglement seems too big, but it's gotten sticky. We got leaning into it, and we kind of lost something in the process of thinking about it. We lost our mindfulness and our present moment experience. So the Buddha says that talks about how in this exercise one is aware that there's seeing, one is aware of what is being seen, and then aware of what that relationship is, the entanglement in particular, how we're caught by it or reactive to it. And so we know when it's present, the fetter, the not. We know what it's like when it's not there. And this distinction between recognizing the presence of something and the absence of something is very important. In mindfulness meditation we often emphasize recognizing what's happening in the present, which kind of always gives a subject something is happening that we're aware of. But in fact, sometimes it's important to be mindful of absence, not all the time, but when we've been attached to something, it's valuable to take some time to experience what it's like to be unattached, the freedom that comes. So to be knotted up and then know the experience of being unknotted, the ease, we breathe more easily, there's more sense of openness, spaciousness, lightness, all kinds of whatever way it might be experienced. So that it registers and we kind of begin to, those channels to that kind of unentanglement starts becoming more available to us because we let it register more deeply. So the Buddha talked about noticing the presence of these knots, the absence of them, and then being present enough in the moment that we can see that a knot that hasn't arisen yet does arise. We notice the arising of it. Oh, here I get knotted up. And that takes a sharp mindfulness to really be here and say, oh, I'm going to watch the process. We don't wait until we find ourselves knotted up. We watch the process. And this is what benefit can come when the mindfulness gets established well enough in the present moment that there's a kind of a sense of flow in the present, a sense of rising and passing, appearing and disappearing, the river of experience that's happening here and now, that as we stay present for that, we notice when we leave the flow, when we get involved in something. And we can watch the beginning of that because it's part of the flow originally. And then, and he talks also about then knowing that the knot has been abandoned, let go of. He doesn't say to let go of it, but I think maybe it's implied. But we're aware of it and letting go of it as well, that it's gone. We let go of it. It's not there. So that we can benefit from experiencing the absence of it. So there is some, so I like to say that if it's easy to let go of something like a knot, let go of the knot. We're not necessarily letting go of things in the world. We're letting go of that entanglement that's between us and the thing. And then take time to be aware of what that absence of entanglement is like. If we do this regularly and strongly, special time will come where, in practice, where we have a clear sense that the entanglement is not going to arise again, at least not in this meditation, in this state of mind, this kind of presence we have. And this clarity and confidence, wow, I'm so settled, I'm so present, I'm so much peace and self-awareness, awareness going on here, that no way am I going to get entangled. That requires a kind of a coarser activity, a kind of choice and involvement I'm simply not inclined to do now. And to really feel that, wow, I'm not inclined to get entangled again. It's like now I'm safe, at least for this meditation, for this next few minutes. And to feel that possibility, to know that this is possible, can be life-changing because we know that life doesn't require attachment, doesn't require being entangled. So at first we're disentangling ourselves from the coarser, big ideas of the world, the things we want and don't want that involve stories and ideas and complicated concepts that are the hindrances. And then we do something more subtle, which is the whole way in which we attach to self. And then we get more subtle in just our relationship to sense contact. And it might seem uninteresting, it might seem not so valuable to be aware at this more base level of sense contact, but it turns out that some of the deepest attachments we have arise out of the attachment to these basic sense contacts. It sets the stage for all the other attachments and sufferings we have. So it's very powerful to kind of settle enough to really track it. And as we start getting more sensitive and aware of the entanglements and the absence of them, then we're poised to be aware of some of the benefits that come on the path to disentanglement, on the path to really becoming free. And that's a topic for tomorrow. And so for the next 24 hours, you maybe use this concept of a knot or an entanglement and go through the day recognizing as much as you can your entanglements, either while you're doing it, also afterwards. You might kind of reflect back over the day and say, well, where was I entangled and caught? Sometimes it's hard to see in the present moment, but sometimes retrospectively we can see, oh, I see. And see what you learned about yourself in that process. So thank you.
