Practice Note: Satisfying Mindfulness

I want  to say something about mindfulness practice, 
which might  meaningful or interesting for  you as you 
practice this morning . Some people have a sense of 
mindfulness as being momentary  – moments of being 
mindful, of recognition, of being present for something, 
or conscio us of something. For other  peopl e, their 
sense of mindfulness or presence is more expansive , 
and it extends  over a period of time . But in whatever 
way you are mindful , the hope is that this moment or 
this period of mindfulness , in and of itself,  can be  
satisfying for you.  
 
One way  to help  mindfulness to  become satisfying or 
meaningful is to distinguish between the mindfulness of 
or the presence you have  for something  – the way 
you’re conscious of somethi ng – and all the other 
attitudes  in your mind. What I mean by t hat is that if 
you’re anxious , and  that’s a primary state of your mind’s 
consciousness,  then there’s a strong tendency for the 
mindfulness to be flavored by the anxiety. Y ou don’t 
separate the two , so you’re anxiously mindful : “Oh, I’ve 
got to be mindful. It’s really important to be mindful. I 
better be here on my breath , and I better not lose that breath .” Or if the flavor of the consciousness of your 
mind is aversion , then you might not notice that when 
you’re mindful  of som ething , there’s a  subtle , or not so 
subtle , aversion : “Oh, that breath. I have to do it again. 
This is a terrible breath. I should be doing something 
else. Let’s finish this in -breath quickly , so we can get 
onto the better stuff, the out -breath.”   
 
Subtle  attitudes can  get mixed in . If there is confusion , 
then the mindfulness may include  confusion : “What am I 
supposed t o be paying attention to here?”  
 
Striving is another quality of the mind:  “I have to get 
somewhere. I’m supposed to get something with my 
mindfulness.” T he mi ndfulness is striving to get to some 
place else besides here.  
 
Another attitude  is when there is a lot of selfing involved  
– self-identity , self-representation, self -image  that we’re 
operating under: “It’s all about me , thank you .” So the 
mindfu lness is also all about me , as if it’s tied in with the 
self-image  or self-consciousness . 
 
Mindfulness itself  – or presence , or being conscious  – 
can be a lot simpler. It ’s not meant to be intimately tied 
to these other attitudes of the mind . One way to help 
make mindfulness satisfying or meaningful i s to 
experiment and find a way in which  the mindf ulness is 
so simple that it isn’t tied to these other attitudes. It’s not easy to do because some of  these other attitudes can 
be subtle . It’s said  that the fish doesn’t see the water it 
swims in , and sometimes  we don’t see the mood we’re 
swimming in.  
 
If a moment of mindfulness – the experience of knowing  
or being present  – is not satisfying , that’s a good  
indication that you’re probably entangled and not really 
independent with the mindfulness. You’ve s omehow 
been influence d by other things.  So look for h ow the 
mindfulness – being  present for something – has some 
aspect that is satisfying. This doesn't mea n that your 
anxiety , or your headache , or your aversion , or your 
selfing has stopped . That can continue , but the 
mindfulness is not influenced by it.  
 
An analogy might be that you’re in a crowd of friends 
who are having a tremendous argument about 
something  that t hey’re all anxious about , worrying  what 
to do . And they’re all huddled  over, bickering . At some 
point you become mindful of what’s going on in the 
room with your friends . Rather than hunching over, you 
stand up straight and  breathe deeply . You’re still 
concerned, interested , and involved i n what’s being 
discussed, but you’re not caught by it. Y ou’re prese nt; 
you’re mindful ; you have an  overview of the situation . 
“Wow ! A lot of people here are really caught up. I was 
caught up , but now I’m not. Now I’m present.”  I don’t 
know whether that analogy works for you.    
If the moment s of mindfulness are  not satisfying and 
other things aren’t satisfying, everything els e can be 
dissatisfying. B ut if the mindfulness is not satisfying and 
meaningful, then pay more careful attention , and see if 
you can adjust . See if there’s another way of being 
conscious . And i f the word ‘satisfying ’ is not meaningful 
for you, I’ll offer a different word : ‘settlin g.’  If 
mindfulness is not settling for you , not calming, or if it 
doesn’t help bring a little peace,  then see if you can find 
another way to be mindful.  Thank you.
