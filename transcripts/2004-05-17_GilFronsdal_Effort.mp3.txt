So last week I talked about faith or trust or confidence and I mentioned that it's the first of five factors, five faculties, which can be seen as the grammar of meditation practice. 
It's kind of the stuff that which often meditation teachers in Southeast Asia will use to measure how someone's doing in the meditation practice. 
They'll look at these five faculties, these five potentials, these five capacities that we have and see how they're coming into play in order to help with the meditation practice. 
And if one of them is in balance, they'll try to bring it into balance. 
If one is lacking or one is too strong, they'll try to make an adjustment for it. 
And these five capacities that we all have is the capacity for confidence or trust, the first one. 
The second one is the capacity for energy to make effort. 
The third is the capacity for noticing what's going on, that of mindfulness. 
The fourth is that of concentration, of stabilizing the mind, getting it concentrated, focused, set on what you want to pay attention to. 
And the fifth is discernment or wisdom, the capacity to be discerning about what our experience is in a way that's useful for the meditation practice. 
And it's been said that in all human endeavors that these five capacities, five faculties, in some way or other, come into play with those endeavors. 
And it doesn't have to be applied only to meditation practice. 
But the Buddha took these five and applied it to meditation practice in order to help the particular endeavor, the particular activity of meditation practice. 
There's a classic teaching that these five are sequential. 
They don't have to be. 
There's also a classic teaching that they all arise together and interplay with each other. 
But in the sequential model, it's you start with faith or confidence or trust. 
And with that, that gives you the inspiration then to want to apply effort or inspiration to make effort. 
And so effort arises out of trust or confidence. 
And that often happens in daily activities that the more inspiration, more confidence you have in some endeavor, the more likely you are to put good effort into it, good energy into it. 
So it's often said very important then to have a good foundation of confidence, of trust, of faith for your meditation practice. 
Today what I want to do is talk a little bit about the second factor of energy in practice, capacity, the faculty of energy. 
And I find that in thinking about it today that it's a difficult subject for me to talk about. 
I'm not sure exactly why. 
Maybe other people it's easy to talk about. 
And the first time I taught a class on what's called the eight fold path, the kind of classic Buddhist teachings of the Buddhist path, one of those eight aspects of the path is called right energy. 
So I did a series over many weeks, I don't know how many weeks, and I skipped right effort intentionally. 
I just didn't want to touch it because I didn't quite know how to talk about it or I didn't know how to relate to it or in terms of talking. 
I had made and I make a lot of effort in my meditation practice. 
When I've been on retreat I've made sometimes phenomenal amount of energy and effort in practice. 
So something I love doing, the effort part, the energy part, the engagement part with practice, is something which I have a tremendous love and appreciation for doing. 
Sometimes it's really fun, sometimes it's not. 
But it's something I really like doing. 
And it was odd that I didn't know how to talk about it. 
I couldn't find how to talk about it. 
And I feel like I'm still trying to find my way in talking about it. 
It seems like maybe odd thing for me to say since making effort or energy is pretty basic. 
If you want to sit down to do a spiritual practice, you have to apply yourself. 
If you get down, someone gave me the analogy recently. 
You can go to the library or bookstore and get books and exercise. 
And you can stay home and read them. 
And read them and read them. 
And it's very nice. 
I suppose they can be captivating and nice photos and stuff. 
But sooner or later you have to do it. 
You have to make the effort to actually apply yourself. 
You might be getting good reading skills by reading that. 
But the exercise books are not usually about that. 
So sooner or later you go to the restaurant. 
You can't just study the menu. 
You have to order the food also. 
So effort is really central to this whole thing I'm trying to teach. 
I'm trying to teach mindfulness. 
So it's a little bit embarrassing to say I don't know exactly what it is or how to talk about it. 
So with that as an introduction, we'll try here today. 
And I'll say also there's different words in the Pali tradition, teachings of the Buddha, that overlap with each other, that kind of belong to this general category of words, meaning effort. 
There are words for effort. 
There's a word for energy. 
There's a word for endeavoring. 
There's a word that sometimes translates as persistence. 
There's a word power. 
There's a lot of different words that kind of fit into that category. 
And they have nuances of meaning, but they overlap quite a bit also. 
And sometimes when Buddhist teachers or texts talk, they slide into each other different meanings on it. 
I want to give you one example from the discourses of the Buddha, a passage which is repeated various places in his discourses. 
They give you a flavor of how important effort or energy is. 
And you can find many other passages that are similar. 
A monk generates desire, strives, initiates strength, takes hold of his mind and endeavors. 
It's a very energetic thing. 
It's kind of an active, you know. 
So it generates desire. 
There were just chanda for those of you who didn't know it. 
And some people think that Buddhists aren't supposed to have desire. 
But in the teachings of the Buddha, there were certain desires that the Buddha saw as being problematic. 
There were certain desires which lead to suffering. 
But there are other desires which are quite beneficial to have. 
And they don't lead to suffering. 
They don't lead to delusion or inappropriate way of living. 
In fact, certain kinds of desires are considered very wholesome and helpful for the spiritual path. 
Being able to differentiate between those two is a very important part of Buddhist practice. 
And in order to apply effort in the spiritual life, there has to be certain kind of desire. 
And so the monk generates, the practitioner generates a certain kind of desire, a certain kind of aspiration maybe some people would like, a certain kind of sense of purpose, a sense of dedication, a sense of, you know, there's something that they want to do here. 
A healthy sense of desire. 
Even if the desire is to have no desires at all, that's still a little bit of a desire. 
Some people like to pursue that very energetically. 
I'm going to sit here and have no desires at all. 
And then they let go of all desires except for that one, until that's the last one. 
And then they kind of do that one. 
They wait until the last bit. 
And the idea of striving is something also that's often not appreciated very much in sometimes meditation circles because striving will often give you a headache. 
But striving is a word the Buddha seemed to have used. 
And striving is not meant to be something that's headache-producing or self-centered or kind of pushy or very willful. 
But striving, I think, means something very. 
. 
. 
Something you can do with great zeal or great dedication or great enthusiasm. 
Yes, I'm going to do this. 
I'm really going to make an effort here and really pursue this. 
And then here the translation is initiate strength. 
The word is virya. 
And initiates this very strong kind of energy. 
Arouses energy in order to then engage in this particular endeavor. 
In the discourse on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Buddha talks similarly about making effort. 
And he uses the word translated into English as ardent. 
And those of you who know Sanskrit or Pali, the word is tapas. 
She sometimes has this feeling of fire or priory energy or fire. 
And so this being ardent is the usual English translation. 
To be ardent in your practice. 
So in the ancient times, at least, there was a lot of effort, a lot of emphasis on making a lot of effort. 
And the word virya, which is word used for energy, is a cognate to the word vira, which means hero or warrior. 
And so the idea is to make heroic effort or kind of be like a warrior in your spiritual practice. 
And some of you might have met great practitioners like Upandita or someone who really has the warrior approach to practice. 
And I've noticed that among my colleagues, the Vipassana teachers at Spirit Rock and elsewhere, there's a phenomena where the only ones who seem to talk about making warrior-like effort in your practice are the women teachers. 
So I'll leave that for you to sort through. 
But they're certainly in line with the way that the tradition talks about, really putting your whole-hearted effort into the practice. 
So I would go on to say that there is no spiritual life without effort, without some kind of effort, some application, some engagement, something we do. 
There's a phenomena called nightstand Buddhists. 
And it's probably good, but it's like the exercise book. 
So one aspect of this constellation of things I'm calling effort energy is the energy factor itself. 
And energy is something which can vary from hour to hour, from day to day, from month to month, depending on many different things. 
Our health, how busy we are, it can also vary based on psychological factors, our attitude. 
When we feel discouraged by something, sometimes our energy drains out of us. 
And sometimes our energy can turn very quickly one direction or the other. 
Suddenly something really marvelous walks through the door, and suddenly you find yourself all the energy you ever needed. 
Or something really terrible happens, or you get a phone call that says, can you please come and we need someone to scrub the walls of IMC in the outside, and you've been volunteered. 
And then maybe your energy kind of, maybe you feel enthusiastic about that. 
But I can imagine, I remember when I was a kid, often having my energy level drop dramatically. 
And when I was asked to do certain things. 
Energy has a certain kind of, the energy in the system is affected by psychology. 
It's also affected by our other activities. 
We exercise a lot and keep our body in good shape. 
There's often a good energy that's available to us in the body, in the system, kind of coursing through us. 
And sometimes if we've overeaten, or we've just been staying up late, or locked, or we're ourselves down, we don't have the physical energy, the vibration, the vitality, that's available to apply in different directions. 
So one of the aspects of energy in practice is we need to have some importance, very helpful to have a good energy, good vitality. 
And so we take care of ourselves in all kinds of ways to have that in place. 
We get enough sleep. 
Americans are said to be a sleep deprived culture. 
And some Americans need to sleep more than they need to meditate. 
Maybe some of you need to sleep more than you need to meditate. 
And some people need to exercise more. 
And some people are trying to have meditation help them in their lives. 
But they just simply don't have good energy in their system to really get a lot of benefit from meditation. 
And they better off doing some exercise first. 
Maybe all kinds of things, what that might need. 
But they need to get the body back into balance, to have it balanced, good form of energy, to help their meditation practice be successful, be useful. 
The Buddha didn't teach exercise program, like push-ups and sit-ups and tai chi or whatever. 
But I think that if you lived in modern-day America, you probably have like a nine-fold path, you know, and probably the ninth or somewhere in there would be right exercise. 
But you know, the Buddha, he didn't need that because he spent all his time walking, not all his time, but he walked a lot. 
He walked long distances, he walked every day. 
He did a lot of walking meditation. 
I think when you walk a lot, walking itself is a wonderful, vitalizing exercise. 
It kind of keeps the body toned and going well. 
I learned recently, someone told me that Ajahn Man, who is one of the great exemplary monks of tai monks, who kind of started the whole lineage of tai Buddhism, very, very important meditator, meditation master, who spent a lot of his time meditating, even as an accomplished master. 
And apparently he spent something like four, I figure exactly the numbers now, so don't take me literally, but he spent something like twice or three times as much every day doing walking meditation as he did doing sitting meditation. 
So if you do that much walking meditation, it kind of keeps your body in good shape. 
So to somehow ensure that you have a good foundation of energy in your system so you can come to meditate, you have that available to you, to us. 
I've noticed a phenomena which, again, it's just maybe it's anecdotal rather than real. 
But 50, 60, 70 years ago, there was a stronger tendency when their backs were out or people were sick or something, people had the attitude, oh, you have to kind of strengthen yourself, build yourself up. 
And then I noticed kind of in my generation, when I was younger, when people's backs went out, the tendency was, just go rest. 
And I don't know if this characterizes different generations or different approaches to different eras of our society, but some people's focus when things are not going well, when they're stressed out or when they're feeling weak, is to rest. 
But actually what's better than sometimes is to build up strength, is to be active. 
My wife had a shoulder injury for a while, and she would do a lot of different things, including resting it and various things. 
And nothing helped until someone told her she had to exercise it. 
And that was kind of counterintuitive. 
And so she exercised it and that made all the difference for her. 
So sometimes, you know, we feel kind of lousy and depressed and bad. 
The tendency is just to kind of rest and kind of not do anything and lay really low. 
And what's called on is to do something very active to bring the energy up in the system so that the whole psychophysical system is a more useful instrument for, well, certain medical meditation practice, and any other things also. 
And the energy that's available to us, there's a certain way in which energy feeds on itself or grows on itself, develops with itself. 
As we apply energy, in some sense it also kind of generates energy. 
And I've seen that in meditation practice where I've been sleepy or sleeping in meditation or kind of, you know, collapsing my posture. 
And I keep putting effort in, keep putting effort in, and at some point that effort begins to kick back and the effort kind of gets aroused and awakened and kind of develops in a beautiful way. 
And that energy, sometimes it comes kind of crystalline or pure or beautiful. 
The energy that's available for practice. 
And you can kind of feel your whole body kind of come alive. 
You know, I wouldn't call it exactly relaxed, but I wouldn't call it tense. 
It's kind of energized in a wonderful, clear, restful way. 
And I think that some people who associate meditation with becoming calm and relaxed sometimes miss the value of meditation that goes beyond relaxation to developing kind of alert energy that is one of the most satisfying things I know, much more satisfying than being relaxed. 
So there's energy that's important in meditation and ensuring we have the right kind of energy. 
Then there's the issue of where we apply the energy. 
You know, it's one thing to have energy. 
It's something else what we do with that energy. 
And so that's amongst the category of effort, the kind of efforts we make with that energy. 
And the Buddha talked about four great efforts to make. 
And these again can be applied to any activity that we do. 
If you have something you want to pursue, just four things you probably do without thinking you're doing it, without thinking along these categories. 
But first thing maybe you're concerned with is avoiding doing those things which get in the way of your purpose. 
The second is you try to avoid the appearance or the arising of things which we could get in the way. 
The third in this list is you try to maintain or support or enhance those things which are helping you with your purpose. 
And then the fourth is you try to arouse things which could help you in your endeavors but are not present right now. 
For all of those things, those four? And in a very simplified formula that's given, they are abandoning, preventing, supporting, and arousing. 
Those are the four kind of efforts. 
We try to abandon those things which get in the way. 
We try to prevent the arising of things which get in the way but haven't arisen. 
We try to support and enhance those things which are there which are helpful. 
And we try to arouse those things which have not yet arisen but which could be really helpful for us. 
So if the purpose that we're engaged in is to wake up, is to get concentrated, is to practice mindfulness, those four efforts apply there also. 
We try to let go of those things which get in the way. 
So we might want to let go of a tendency to move our body a lot. 
Sometimes if you move your body a lot, fidget a lot in meditation, it's actually hard to develop a deep, stable, concentrated mind. 
So you let go of that because that seems to get in the way. 
Or you notice that if you spend a lot of time thinking about certain things, say you're reviewing over and over and over again, how are you going to get a patent on your wonderful invention on collapsible automobiles? People think about the most amazing inventions in meditation. 
And so you have this wonderful, it's not a very useful train of thought to think about patents for collapsible cars or something, I don't know what. 
But so you learn, oh, that's not very useful. 
I'm trying to wake up and be present. 
I think I need to let go of this train of thought. 
This train of thought, if I keep following this train of thought, it's not conducive and helpful. 
Certain attitudes are not very useful and helpful, and so we learn to let go of it. 
So the process of letting go or abandoning, it can be a very wise part of any activity, but certainly of any spiritual activity, knowing what wisely let go of because it doesn't serve us. 
And then arousing things, then trying to prevent things from arising, detract, which has not yet arisen. 
So you might have learned from experience that certain kind of things that you do end up standing in your way. 
So for example, say you meditate in the morning. 
And you really like meditating in the morning, but you also really like reading newspaper. 
And so the newspaper wins out first, right? So you get a jump out of bed, you're all excited, you run out to get the newspaper, and just like the best thing, right? You open it up and you read the paper, and it's wonderful or not. 
And then you go meditate, and your mind is filled with images and ideas and thoughts and opinions and judgments and maybe fear and anger and delight or whatever, you know, might be coming out the newspaper. 
And you notice that when your mind is filled by those images and reactions from the newspaper, it's very hard to sit down and get concentrated. 
So you note, oh, if I'm going to be a good meditator, I think I need to read the newspaper after I meditate, not before, to prevent the arising of things which get in the way of getting concentrated. 
The third one, the effort to support things which are helpful, they're already here. 
I think that one of the things that's very helpful in spiritual life is to begin appreciating the good qualities, the good activities, the good mental states, the good attitudes, the good intentions that we already have. 
There's often a lot of goodness within us, a lot of helpful qualities here that we often will overlook and not appreciate deeply enough. 
I think human beings, at least the ones I know, for the most part, seem to have an amazing capacity to be selective in their appreciation or their disdain or their criticalness. 
And you know, there could be 90, like my son, my little six-year-old son, he's going to suffer some in his life, I think, because he has this amazing ability to have a three- or four-hour play date, and he's having a time of his life running around, you know, just everything. 
And then at the end, usually at the end when they're tired, something goes wrong. 
The kid's kind of like, you know, do something, he'll snide or he'll mean to each other. 
And he will latch on to that particular thing and forget the four hours earlier having the time of his life. 
Oh, that was a terrible play date. 
You know, just two minutes of the little fight they had over something. 
You know, it's very selective. 
And I think what's helpful in a spiritual life is not to put, we don't want to put blinders on things which are not working or things that are off or unwholesome or unskillful. 
But I think it's actually very helpful to develop a habit of appreciating that which is already here, which is beautiful, that is wonderful, that's already working. 
And my suggestion to you is there's probably a lot more that's working, a lot more to appreciate than probably already that you're doing so far. 
So if you take that challenge of mine, you will just, you know, go and look, you know, what is it to be appreciated right here? So then support and enhance that which is already wonderful that's happening here. 
And then if you notice that something could be helpful and it's not here already, then arouse it, cultivate it. 
I know sometimes when I sit down to meditate that my mind is not very concentrated. 
Sometimes I decide that the wisest thing for me to do is to sharpen up my concentration, to arouse it and bring it up so that I can have a more useful mind so that my mind can focus and look and be engaged in activity in a more useful way. 
And so sometimes I'll do particular practices that arouses my concentration when it needs to be there. 
Sometimes I'll do practices that arouses loving kindness. 
If I feel like more kindness would be good in the system. 
Sometimes I'll do practices to arouse my energy because I feel the energy needs to be there. 
Sometimes I'll do practices which are more relaxing and calming. 
If I feel tense or feel too energized or restless or something, I'll do certain things which are relaxing because I feel like I need to arouse that factor in order to bring the body and mind into a certain kind of balance so that it's useful to engage in the practice of mindfulness and meditation. 
So those are called the four great efforts and they apply to any activity and they apply to spiritual life and to meditation practice. 
One of the reasons why I was hesitant to talk about effort in the past is that I had the idea that effort, my idea of effort in my definition of it seemed to imply something about self-centered effort or manipulative effort or effort to somehow get something to manufacture or create something in the future that was not part of what was already here and a huge part of my meditation practice over the decades that I've done it has been and continues to be practicing an acceptance of what is already here and it's a non-acceptance of what's here which often causes a lot of suffering for people and it's very radical to practice acceptance. 
You can pull the rug from underneath a lot of our difficulties in life and we'll just begin practicing acceptance and so for me, given who I was, that was a very, very important practice to practice unconditional acceptance of this moment here and so then I was confused between radical acceptance of this moment be mindful of this moment as it actually is an effort which seemed like it didn't involve that kind of acceptance it was like pushing or trying to make something happen However, when I try to practice this radical acceptance of the present moment I used to practice it with great enthusiasm I remember the story, you know, when. 
. 
. 
I don't want to tell it stories Sometimes I would be kind of like on fire like it was like the most important, most passionate thing I had in my life to do was to sit down and see if I could completely and fully accept this moment just as it was without trying to push it away without trying to make it different without trying to hold on to it just as open, balanced awareness, just here and maybe it sounds like a paradox to talk about making kind of almost heroic effort to be totally accepting of this moment here and sometimes I know like when my mind is really scattered in order to me to be completely accepting of this moment here I have to really work on my concentration I have to somehow really make strong, strong efforts like my breath, kind of stay there the more distracted the mind is the greater the counter-force is needed to work against that or to balance that sometimes and so to really kind of hold that mind it feels like sometimes physical labor to kind of be there, be there, be there, be there and that seems a little bit antithetical to the whole meditation process to make kind of a strong, strong effort isn't it all about being relaxed? but there are times when really strong effort is needed when I sat with a lot of physical discomfort in my meditation practice the practice of radically accepting unconditionally accepting the present moment with its pain required a tremendous effort to really apply myself to stay there, stay there, stay there because the mind was so powerfully conditioned to recoil from that and so I had to kind of work with it stay, stay, stay now, effort the other thing I was thinking about today about effort is sometimes in play human beings apply a lot of effort if you go to a playground and watch those kids and then if you try to mimic the kids follow right behind them and do exactly what they're doing you would be wiped out very quickly and they're saying, daddy, daddy, come, come but play often has, you know you put a lot of effort you play volleyball or something a lot of effort goes into it effort can be really fun effort is not something to be thought of as a problem or as a hindrance or something to hesitate to be engaged in I think the task in meditation one of the tasks is to make effort to apply ourselves in a way that's healthy for meditation that's appropriate for meditation and in a way that actually brings enjoyment and delight it brings us delight to sit down and engage in this activity this is great even when it's difficult, I really want to do this and sometimes it can really feel like play meditation sometimes can be actually a lot of fun for example, there's that there's that, I won't tell you everybody everybody has develops their own idiosyncratic ways of meditating and so, I won't tell you mine oh, you can do your own should I tell you? well, then I'll never live it down for a while I used to do this like a pinball approach to meditation you need this mental note you notice what's going on imagine I was playing pinballs and that was fun and it kept me very engaged and helped me get concentrated at some point I had to let go of that because it got in the way that kind of activity meditation can be fun in many different ways part of what's important with effort and energy is to monitor the energy and effort we're making to ensure that it's the appropriate kind of effort given the overall ecology of where we are at that moment there's kind of like a whole ecology of mind and body that's going on and it has to be the energy has to match that or be a match for that so there are times where energy needs to the effort and the energy is very strong and very powerful and other times the energy needs to be very relaxed and loose, maybe almost feel like no energy at all I think for people who live stressed out lives it's probably sometimes it's best not to make too much effort maybe sometimes it's better to make no effort at all and just sit back and just relax in my own meditation practice I find it's very helpful for me to make mostly a non-effort in the beginning of a meditation session just kind of just be there, practice just being letting go of the tendency of the mind to wonder just not doing it, just sitting there being very relaxed and almost not making any effort at all and letting the tensions and the distractions of the day kind of settle on their own just letting them settle on their own don't engage with it, don't try to do anything just trying to be very kind of still and then at some point after I've gotten quiet and calm enough then there's a different kind of effort and energy that's made and sometimes it can be quite strong sometimes it can be quite steady sometimes it can be quite sweet but it is to monitor the energy where the effort we're making so it's not too tight not too pushing or too hard but also not too complacent not too loose one of the one of the traps of certain kinds of meditation practices that focus on radical acceptance of the present moment or just being or like Shikantazo or things like that is complacency just kind of like everything's okay, just the way it is I'll just sit here, everything's okay everything's fine everything's fine everything's wonderful and it's fine to sleep, you know, it's wonderful but it's not really a meditation practice so that kind of complacent effort and energy is not very useful and so you don't have an effort that's too complacent you don't have an effort that's too tight or too pushing and what actually happens in practice is often a balancing a finding the way, kind of trying a little bit of, trying a little bit harder and it's like, oh, that was a little bit too much try it too hard now, I need to back up oh, now I've backed up too much it's like a pendulum that swings and you'll never actually or very seldom get to a place where you feel like you know, right in the middle because if you and the environment never changed then maybe you could find the middle after a while but actually, you're always changing and the situation's always changing and so the effort and energy that's needed is in harmony with the overall ecology of the situation so it's always going to be this little bit of kind of swinging back and forth and sometimes the swings are really big and sometimes we make big mistakes in meditation practice and I've gotten headaches sometimes from making the wrong kind of effort and sometimes I spend a long period of time sleeping and you know when I was at Zen Center, there was a period where I just slept and slept and slept bobbing back and forth and I still bob but not as much as I did and so effort, energy is a hard thing to talk about even though I've gone on and on now and I hope that that kind of aroused some interest in you at least to investigate, to study it to engage in it, to think about it more seriously to look and appreciate its role and its place in your spiritual practice and I had one more thing I wanted to say one of the ways that this this word Virya is sometimes translated into English is as persistence and one of the keys of making energy in a spiritual life is to practice persistence continuity regularity regularity, persistence constancy of practice is what tends to bring the greatest fruit over time, no matter what the practice is if you, and the analogy that's used in the tradition is, if you want to it's an ancient tradition is if you want to make fire about rubbing sticks together you don't rub the sticks together for a couple of minutes and then go get tea and then come back and pick it up and rub it for another minute and then go pee and then put them down and then go take a nap and come back, you know, it just doesn't work you don't build up enough heat to get the spark so you have to kind of be persistent and constantly keep going so the same thing with this inner energy this inner fire that you need to kind of have a constancy and persistence in the effort that you make and sometimes that means persistence over a period of meditation if you sit for 40 minutes but you just kind of make, be really persistent in that 40 minutes or in retreat and people practice on a daily basis in regularity that persistence takes the form I sit every day every morning or every day I sit and that regularity over time is very, very supportive of the overall energy and effort and development of a good quality of it and being of our meditative life.
