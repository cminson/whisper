The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Is this on?
Is it on? Yes?
Yes.
It's on now. It's on now. Okay.
So, hello everyone. Welcome.
It's so nice to see all of you and to see my dear
friends Michael and Kate. Nice to see you and have you here.
Yeah, it really makes my heart happy.
So,
I was here last week and I'm doing
three consecutive weeks while Andrea is
going to treat out in Massachusetts.
And while I didn't have a theme for the three weeks,
it's sort of turning into that a little bit.
So, I want to just give a brief review of what we
talked about last week and then that
really leads into what I want to talk about tonight.
So, what I want to talk about tonight, what I'm going to talk about tonight
is that quality of resistance
and inner defensiveness that generally
throws us off balance when we're trying to have
some clarity about the way things are unfolding in our lives.
So, what we talked about last week was
mental obscurations, the obscurations of mind
that keep us from seeing
the habits
that cloud
what's actually going on. So, these are called
defilements, but in
English that's kind of a loaded word. So, I don't like to
use the word defilement although that's exactly what
that's how it's taught in Buddhism or in classical Buddhism.
I like to call it obscurations,
mental obscurations that's been referred to as inner demons,
it's been referred to as torments of mind
and so on and so forth. So, we talked
about these torments that are habitual reactive
states and they generally
arise unconsciously
in response to some or reaction to some
object that's being known wrongly. So, that's
being seen wrong. Either thoughts, beliefs, assumptions,
etc, etc, etc. These thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions
that are rooted
in desire,
aversion or in just not knowing. So,
I talked about
how these are recognized when
they come in each of these different categories of
when they arise accompanied by ignorance or when they arise
accompanied by attachment and when they arise
accompanied by aversion. And then we talked about
different ways to work with the torments and I gave
you these different ways that I'll just mention again
for those of you who were here, you might remember.
The first is to recognize
what's going on. So, by recognizing what's happening
it helps to break the spell of enchantment
and the narrative about ourselves.
These things generally have a story
with them with us as the central
figure and player. It's all about me, me, me. There's some narrative
going on. There's generally some comparison going on
and
so it's important that we begin to recognize that
and then the next
suggestion is to relax and to begin to
accept that this is just the way things
are for me at this particular moment. It won't be like
this forever, but right now this is the way it is.
So, relax. Then
to practice some sort of
restraint. So, let's say that what
has arisen for us is a powerful
emotion like anger. It doesn't mean that
we have to act anger out. It means
that we have to see that anger is there
and we restrain from
acting it out and we don't indulge it. We don't go
down the rabbit hole with it. We simply see that that's what's happening
and so
this is how we don't indulge the story of it
and then this next one is to reframe
our experience and this is really important
because when we see anger or whatever
it is, fear or clinging or wanting
or whatever the obscuration is, when
we see it as an obstacle
it generally is an obstacle.
So, I'll give you an example. If you're trying to
meditate and you're trying to settle the mind down and let the mind
rest on the breath and the mind wanders off into some
thought train, you're just lost in thought.
When you're lost in thought, that's exactly what's
happening. You're lost in thought. You don't even know you're lost in thought because you're lost
in thought. When you're lost in thought, you're not meditating.
But the moment, the very moment you know lost in thought
you're aware again.
You see? So, if we can reframe
and so generally at that moment where we wake up
sometimes we don't like the fact that we were lost
we judge ourselves and so on and so forth and so
these deeper layers of obscurations begin
to take over. And so if you
reframe your experience as this is an opportunity
to practice being aware. This is an opportunity
to actually see with some clarity. And so
it's because we've been challenged in some way
and that we're uncomfortable in some way that we
either get lost or we can reframe it as an opportunity.
So when I teach the compassion program
it's
important or it's part of the
program to begin to
come to a place where we can see that no matter how
someone is acting that
everyone basically has the desire to be safe
to be happy to be safe and happy
and so if I'm in contention with you
I can just be
pissed off at you or I can realize that
your behavior and your action is in fact
at some level your
idea of how you're going to be happy and safe. How you can
best be happy and safe. So you might be
pushing back against me. You might be very aggressive. You might not
realize that I'm thinking you're a jerk
but that's what you do because you think
you're in a place of vulnerability which is what I want to talk about
a little bit later. And so
we can just see that this is what's happening
in someone else. We can also see that when we're
challenged with this within ourselves
that we can reframe it. So these experiences can be actually worthy
opponents if you look at them in that way.
And that changes the whole relationship that we have with
whatever is coming up as difficult to us.
So the next
thing on the list was to receive.
They all begin with ours. And I
was with a teacher recently
on retreat and he gave a talk that was built on
the same type of thing and I'm just
reframing, recycling his talk because
I found it so powerful for me. So to receive
so the nature of the torment or the nature of the defilement
can be observed with a kind of
relaxed interest. So what you can do at any point
is to simply say what is being known. Just with
curiosity what's being known right now. What's really true right now.
Byron Katie does something where is this
who do you know it's true and so on. I've never done Byron Katie work.
But it's a little bit like that. What is actually being known now.
Not what do we think is being known. What do we want to have
happen. What do we expect. But what's actually being known now.
You can also ask is awareness present.
And let me give you an example.
We're breathing
for a long time. But we're not always aware
that we're breathing. So I would speculate
that most of you might not have been aware of your
breath until I mentioned it at that particular moment.
I wasn't. So this is something
that you can begin to
get familiar with what it's like to be
aware to your experience. Because it's with awareness
that you can begin to recognize when the
obscurations are present. And then
to realize that the
characteristics of these
obscurations or these defilements are always
impermanent, unsatisfactory, conditional and insubstantial.
So they're
ever changing. They're infused with the quality of
insubstantiality. So you're not going to find
anything of yourself in there other than what you put
in there. And they
lead to suffering. So
that's essentially a very quick
review of what we talked about last
week. So tonight I wanted
to talk about
this kind of resistance and inner defensiveness that
is experienced as
an obscuration of mind. And in order to be
with this, we have to
cultivate the quality of mindfulness that allows us to see
what's actually going on. So to see
to meet our experience with awareness
is absolutely essential. Because
if we're not aware of what's going on
we'll always be caught sort of
like a rodent on one of those wheels that just goes around and around and around.
So through practicing
awareness, we begin to see how we build
our personal worlds. We begin to see how we
build our sense of who we are, our
self-identifications, how we self-identify.
You know, I'm a man, I'm a
meditator, I'm a friend, etc. etc. whatever
it happens to be. It also reveals
our habitual and historic patterns
of thinking and behaving, guarding, protecting, being
the different ways that we're in relationship to one another
and to ourselves, most particularly to
ourselves. So
we begin to discover
that as we look at this, it's a dynamic
process that's changing all the time. And because
it's changing and there's no stability
it can be scary because it seems
unreliable. It seems unreliable when we look at
what we're doing and what we're infusing
our
sense of well-being and stability on.
So what happens
well, I speak from my own experience. I can't say what happens
for the rest of you, but I can say for myself that when I
touch these places, I notice that there's
inner resistance. There's not wanting to be with
that place that's uncomfortable, that place that's
the feeling of stress inside. So I want
something and
it's not happening the way I want it and then there's this
place of stress. Does that
can you relate to this? Yes. Okay. So sometimes
this resistance is directed towards something
very specific and sometimes it's just a kind of general
place. I don't know what I'm resisting. I'm just resisting.
There's just a feeling of contraction.
There's a sense of being at odds with the way
things actually are.
So
what seems to be called for
here is the cultivation of
awareness to be present with this
feeling without meddling and with it
without mucking it up, without explaining it, without trying
to change it, to simply see it,
to simply be with it and
see it for what it is, not for what we think it is, not for what
we expect it should be,
not for what we want just as it is.
So
the question becomes how can we
be real in relationship to our present experience without
getting in the middle of it and
trying to meddle with it
and is it even possible for us to cultivate
the wholesome habit of non-interference
in order to counter this kind of inner conflict.
So before I go on
I'm not entirely sure that I've got everybody
connected on the same wavelength of what I'm actually
referring to in terms of this inner resistance.
So I want to just talk about it a little bit more
and if anyone has a question please, this is the time
to bring it up. But that feeling
when sometimes it's very
clear, sometimes there's something I have in mind
and you have something else in mind
and there's an obvious conflict
and so there's a feeling that comes up.
The feeling is underneath the story of the conflict.
You see, the feeling is underneath
the narrative and the comparisons that go on
in the story. The feeling is what
connects all of us as common humanity.
You all know what it feels like to be vulnerable, you all know what it feels
like to resist your situation, you all know
what it feels like to want to be happy, you all know what it feels like
when you want vanilla ice cream and you get chocolate
and that disappointment, you see.
So it's this feeling that
we're looking at. It's this
experience that
connects us as human beings
and not the story. So I work
with people one on one. I do grief counseling and I work with people
doing meditation practices
and it's interesting because I can
try to point people there and they sort of get it and
this is true for me. This is a big practice. They sort of get it
and then
literally within moments they default back to their
story. And it's because it's them I can see it.
But when I do it, I don't see it. It's lost in
thought. That's what I'm talking about. And so
when we keep going to the story of
whatever has happened
or whatever we thought has happened, we never
get out of it. We're always in story. But when we
go underneath that to what's actually real for
us, even if what's real is I don't
know what's happening here. I just don't know. I just know
something's unpleasant. I don't know what it is.
And what most of us do
have this feeling is that we abandon ourselves.
We literally bolt.
We can't be there because it's too uncomfortable.
And because we've been habituated
to respond in such a way as
to get away from that which feels dangerous.
Because really where we're going here
is to a place of vulnerability.
And what vulnerability means is that
we're opening. We wouldn't feel vulnerable
if we weren't opening. So when
we open, it's not just the beautiful sublime
qualities like compassion and love and friendship and
generosity and all of those wonderful things that comes up.
It's all the shadow. It's the greed, the hate,
the jealousy, the enmity.
All of those things are there.
And it's really important for us to
cultivate the
awareness that recognizes that within all of us
both things were complete
beings. We're not just light and love and beauty.
And we're not just darkness and fear and greed and sadness
and jealousy and all of those other
things. But we are both of those things.
Are all of those things. And
when we begin to notice things like
how we resist being with what is difficult
or even when things are wonderful, even when
things seem really, really fantastic and everything is going the way
we want. And then we think, I never want this to change.
Something's going to happen and it's going to take it away from me.
That's a form of rub as well.
So to be able to
be in this place is really
to be vulnerable. And to be
able to be with it honestly requires courage
and this is what compassion actually
is. Compassion is the ability to be with
things exactly as they are without
needing to, without
I won't say it this that way, needing to change, but without
them needing to change, without the circumstances needing
to change. You see? So
I may have said this last week and if I
did forgive me for repeating myself, but many people think
that these qualities
like compassion
actually mean that
whatever is challenging us
will be reconciled and resolved. If I'm having a difficulty
and I feel compassion, then
the situation will be reconciled and resolved.
Or if I feel like my mind is really wild
and I sit down and I meditate
and my mind is wild, I'm unhappy, I'm
stressed out at work, I'm just going to meditate and then the meditation is
going to make everything better. Well, it just
doesn't work that way. At least it doesn't work that way
in my experience. And so to understand
that the ability to be with things
as they actually are is really
a wonderful precious
capacity
because then we don't abandon ourselves.
So I almost want the theme of tonight to be
how can we not abandon ourselves? Why do we abandon ourselves?
And how can we change that habit
and not abandon ourselves?
When we're able to be with things as they are, even if they're difficult
that's the actual bridge to compassion.
Does that make sense?
Is everyone with me?
Many people think that compassion is the resolution
and the reconciliation of that which is causing them
or others to suffer. Sometimes
compassion will, you will experience
a resolution, but sometimes
the resolution that you want is not
what happens. But if
you can be with the situation that you're in, with the feelings that
you're having, and not
abandon those feelings, those difficult feelings, or abandon
the other person that you're with or abandon yourself in a situation
like that, then you've touched upon real
compassion. And it doesn't always have this quality
of a quivering heart. It's sometimes this knowing quality
that, so for me I
describe this as compassion arising through the wisdom door. It's known
directly because I've seen the suffering.
So
I will give you an example. If you're with
someone that you love who is dying
and they are going
to die and they know they're going to die and you know they're going to die
and all of the things that are involved and going on in their minds
and in your mind, you see, it
can be very disorienting and scary. And so
it takes compassion to
hold your seat and not abandon
the truth of that situation and not go over the edge
with fear and regret and all of the other things that are so easy
to do. It takes compassion to be there.
Now that doesn't mean that your loved one isn't going to die.
It doesn't mean that
because you're compassionate, the situation
is not going to end up with
the way it's going to end up. It simply means that you can
be there and not abandon your loved one or
abandon yourself in that situation, please.
A word that keeps coming up for me
seems like is acknowledging.
Talk right into it because I'm having, can you turn the sound up?
The word that keeps coming up for me is
you're kind of alluding to acknowledging what is
and then you'll find compassion or
say it again. As you're talking about compassion
I keep thinking, oh you're kind of referring to
accepting or acknowledging the situation
instead of saying, no I want it this way or I want it that way
I'm disappointed and just saying it is what it is.
Is that kind of what you're saying? That's kind of what I'm saying but
I'm saying it as there's a knowing
of it. Awareness actually knows what's
going on. When you bring awareness to
your breathing process, you don't have to
learn how to breathe. You don't have to teach yourself how to know
that you're breathing. Breathing is known. If I asked
you to bring your awareness to the contact of your feet on the floor, can you do
that? Yes. So you don't have to
learn how to know that you know that your feet are on the floor.
There's a knowing and it's the very same thing with these other qualities
and when we get to these places that are
open for us and raw and where we feel
vulnerable, where beautiful things come up
and where difficult things come up
the ability to be there and not
bold allows us to change our relationship
to our experience. You see
it really allows us to move into a place of equanimity
which is not where everything is just perfectly
even and it's simply that
however things are, we can accept them
and with compassion and with mindfulness we have
the tools
to stay with it. You see? But
compassion and loving kind of all those things move
towards equanimity and once we're in a place
of an equanimous relationship to
our experience then things begin to transform in
our life. They begin to actually shift and change
and so what I'd like to
point us to here is that
it's not so much a doing as it is a receiving
it's not so much that we have to
acknowledge that something is going on. It's more like
we have to just trust that we actually know what's going on
you see? So you can know when compassion is present
in you. You can know when fear
is present. You can know when anger is present
you just know these things you see? And when you can
recognize them as anger, fear, compassion,
love, so on and so forth, you just
are not as inclined to invest
me into it. You see? If I think
that anger has arisen and I think oh god
I am such an angry person I'm never going to get over this anger
you know? My whole life I've been angry I'm always going to be angry
you see? But
that's one way of looking at it and that's the narrative
that goes on. The other way is that there's just a
recognition that anger is there
and the recognition isn't so much labeling it. I mean
you can label it there's nothing wrong with labeling it but there is
a knowing of it. There's an awareness that knows
anger. There's an awareness that knows suffering
you see? You see someone
suffering and you don't have to
like go and get a degree from Stanford in order to
know that someone is suffering there's just a knowing of it. There's a
direct knowing and that knowing is what
gives rise to the quality of compassion.
In other words we can't make ourselves be a certain way. This is what
we've been habituated to do. We're trying to
make ourselves be happy. We're trying to
make ourselves be smart. We're trying to make ourselves be safe.
All of those things.
And we have to attend to business. I'm not
saying we don't have to do anything. But
there's just a shift of perspective
that really requires us. It requires
practice and it requires a kind
of trust that
we know how to do this. You see?
It's not, as I was saying
earlier, when we begin to look with
awareness and mindfulness at the habits of our mind
and we begin to see how we create our worlds
and how we create our identities then we
begin to see through those things and as we begin to see through
those things they begin to sort of deconstruct and fall
away and that process can be unnerving for people
it can be a little bit startling. So you have to
be gentle with yourself as you're doing this.
Because it will take us to this place of being vulnerable
and it will take us to this place of being
in resistance to what is being seen
and known. You see?
So
before you ask this question
I just want to say one thing too.
In terms of resistance
there's no ego without resistance
and there's no resistance without ego.
If there's resistance
you always know your ego is involved in some way
and it's not that we are
suggesting that you can live your life
without having a good healthy ego.
But what I'm talking about here is that
small self that clings and holds on to things
for dear life in spite of the fact that it always
turns out more or less the same way.
Please.
So I wanted to ask
what's the difference between compassion and equanimity?
Well
they're two different qualities.
Compassion is the recognition of suffering and someone else
are in yourself and they wish
to alleviate that suffering. There's an emotional quality to it
that recognizes it and really wants to do something about it
and then there's this intention to do something
if you can do something about it and so on and so forth.
So one way to understand
compassion is that when love meets suffering
the natural response of the heart
is compassion. So when love meets suffering
when love, this quality of love within us sees that
suffering is present either in ourselves or in someone else
that gives rise to compassion.
When this quality of love
meets acceptance with the
things, with the way things actually are
equanimity. Again it's rooted in love
but to be able to be with things as they really are
so going back to my example of being
with someone you love who's dying you see
it's compassion that gives you the courage and the ability to actually
hold your seat and not abandon yourself or the other person
and it's equanimity
that sort of absorbs the compassion
and absorb because once that happens
you're in a different relationship with your experience
and you can accept that oh I am scared
and I am sad and grief is present and all of these things
are going on and I'm not
I can be with it. I can stay here.
Is that clear?
Go ahead. So the combination of the two is what lets you
really stay to feel what's happening
and also to stay with it
to not take it personally. Let's not jump right to
equanimity. Let's start with loving kindness and
mindfulness. So it's
an awareness will allow us
to be with our experience in a non-judgmental
kind of just this is the way it is. It will show us
what's going on almost like a reflection in the mirror
but sometimes what's going on is really hard to
be with and so mindfulness in my experience
my personal experience it's sometimes
not enough you see
and it's like something in me is resisting
allowing myself to be vulnerable. I don't want to be vulnerable
because it doesn't feel right and I'm a man and I shouldn't be weak
and blah blah blah whatever the story happens to be
it's compassion then that
allows me to have the courage to be with things
as they are and when that happens I can sort of let go and then
I can see clearly then we can see clearly let me it's not about
me it's just this is the experience that
I'm pointing to. Does that
make sense? So you have to
be able to be with what's there but
you can't be with what's there if you can't see it.
If we're caught in the narrative the story
she did this he did that if it's that kind
of a story. That's
an unending kind of
you know dead end so
we have to be able to go underneath the story and the way that we
do it is there's not a person sitting in this room
that hasn't felt at that core level what it's like
to feel unsettled to feel like they don't know what's happening to feel
vulnerable to feel unsafe to feel
in love to feel alone to feel whatever
so in my own experience the way that I encountered this
was I'd often I experienced not a feeling of loneliness
but a feeling of aloneness
that was very scary very frightening
and I didn't want to be with that feeling
I didn't know I didn't want to be with that feeling but when it came up I would use my
meditation and I would use all my practice tools
and I would use may I be happy may I be free I would use all the
method I would misuse all of those things because I
didn't have the awareness to see that I
just didn't have the resources
to face what it was like to feel this aloneness
almost like I was in deep dark
space and there was nothing there
nothing not even me which scared me
so
whether it's something like that or
whether it's that you want a chocolate ice cream and you got vanilla ice cream
and this is important because
you don't have to be sitting on a cushion you don't have to be
informal practice all you
have to do is to begin to notice and not to run away
from this place inside of yourself which
probably shows up for people multiple times
throughout every day you know sometimes I get
out of bed in the morning and it's a beautiful day and I go into the bathroom
and I start to brush my teeth and there's a feeling
like oh my god there's not enough time in the day and I'm responsible for this
then the story spins but the feeling is there
and so I don't want this uncomfortable feeling
so I have things that I do
to not be with it these are the habits of mine
these are the calaces these are the
torments of mine that keep us from being there and this is
you see I discovered that in that aloneness
it was me abandoning myself
it wasn't someone else abandoning me it was me abandoning this place of being
uncomfortable
or afraid or alone in the universe
like on the brink of annihilation this type of thing
and sometimes when I want chocolate ice cream and I get finella
it feels like that so
does that make sense is it clear now and
you see when there's a
kind of a foundation you begin to realize
you don't make yourself be equanimous
with things you just move into a
space of equanimity because your relationship to
whatever it is changes so I made a commitment
to myself that when I felt this knot in my chest
and this is where I feel it that I wouldn't abandon myself
that I would you know even if I didn't know what it was
I would stay with it
okay
so
resistance
is a kind of an active mode of
inner coercion and
inner defensiveness is more
of a passive form of inner manipulation
so
this quality of defensiveness
is it implies
this need to protect to guard
to insulate and
this is how we put up our inner defenses
so each time we feed this habit of inner defensiveness
we're actually feeding the habit of self protection
and every time we do that we cut ourselves off
from other people and from ourselves
does that make sense every time we
feel that we need to guard ourselves and protect ourselves
we are actually it's like we're exercising
a muscle we're actually we're feeding this habit of self
protection and it disconnects us from ourselves and from others
and it's we actually
like thicken our consciousness and we wall off
and guard against perceived threats or real dangers
but basically what we do
is we cut ourselves off from being
able to be intimate with ourselves to be truly intimate
to be able to be in these places of
openness I'll just call it openness and
they feel tender and not necessarily raw but definitely
tender and delicate and
when we steal ourselves
against our experience or when we shut other people out
we literally cut ourselves off from being able to be
there and this
division and separation is the ego's
basic you know motive defense
this is what the ego does this is I can't
I have to guard myself against you because if I don't
I'm going to be vulnerable you see
so as I said earlier
there's no ego without resistance and no resistance without ego
and the ego doesn't exist without its defenses
so that quality of ego is what I'm talking about I'm not talking about
personality and so
ego defensiveness or this quality of defensiveness
can manifest in a lot of different ways
we can hide from our experience we can run away from it
we can isolate ourselves from others we can contract
around it we can just
not be willing to show up fully
so
so
so
all this practice
is to bring us to a place where we can
trust that we can open up and where we
can experiment with not
constantly trying to protect ourselves
and where we can stop hiding
where we can stop putting up walls
and
because when we do that
whenever we're activating those
tendencies in ourselves what we
are effectively doing is we're shutting off our
awareness we're no longer aware we're no longer aware
of what's really happening and if we're not aware
of what's happening
down the rabbit hole we're lost in thought and we're lost in anger
and we're lost in fear and we're lost in whatever those qualities
are those tendencies happen to be
we end up fractured disassociated partitioned
uptight all of those kinds of things
so somewhere along the line our inner
defensiveness actually became
a wall
against being against the feeling
of being vulnerable we
use this inner defensiveness and this resistance to avoid
this feeling of vulnerability
and
we need to somehow
come to terms with
this fear of being vulnerable
because
if we don't
we will just be partitioned
and closed down and we'll do
the same repetitive we'll engage in the same
repetitive behaviors that we've always engaged in
and this is really
important vulnerability the feeling of vulnerability
that scares us is actually a sign
of being open you see and if we cannot be
open we cannot touch these beautiful qualities
inside of us we just can't there's just
no way we think we can but it's just
we're only sort of
touching the tip of the iceberg so to speak we can never have
that quality of intimacy with ourselves or with anyone else
so when we close down
this place of vulnerability which is such a
natural thing for us to do because we're so
trained to not want
to be with things that are in any way uncomfortable
like that especially if the uncomfortable feeling
is really unpleasant and is scaring us
but even if
you can see that with awareness and then with
awareness you can accept that this is scary
and not abandon yourself
this is actually how compassion arises but
whether it's compassion or wisdom here
we're talking about
this is what's required
first we have to understand that to be vulnerable is to be open
so it takes practice and
it requires courage and in my opinion it requires compassion
I don't think that we can do any of this without compassion
and if I had more time I'd tell you why
we have to be vulnerable we have to be willing to be open
and we have to see
what it's like when we abandon ourselves and we have to
choose not to abandon ourselves and that takes courage
when we want things to be
other than the way they actually are
we have abandoned ourselves
when we hold to that
this is a sure giveaway that we have bolted
and it takes awareness
to know the way things really are
a perfect example is
I'm with a loved one
who's going to die and I'm afraid
and I feel vulnerable and I feel
my own mortality and I'm really distraught
and it takes awareness to see that
and compassion to be honest that that's what
what's going on and compassion can hold anything
and everything so
I wish all of you to
have open hearts and to meet
this place of aliveness
and intimacy with yourself with real kindness
and compassion and to move
into a place of equanimity and so
it's now nine o'clock I'm sorry I didn't leave time
for more questions but if anyone has a question
they can come up and see me afterwards
so thank you very much for your attention
and for coming tonight
and listening and maybe I'll see you next week.
