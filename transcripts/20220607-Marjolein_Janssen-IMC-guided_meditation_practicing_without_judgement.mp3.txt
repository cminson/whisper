 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodarma.org. So you can get comfortable, get comfortable with alert posture. If it feels right for you, you can close your eyes. It's also fine to meditate with eyes open, gazing in front of you. I want to take a moment to notice that there is a body here that we're sitting. The body is sitting. It's useful to, at the beginning of a meditation, to relax a little bit. And we can do that by doing a short body scan. Starting with the head. You feel the head as a whole. Maybe you feel that certain areas are a bit more tense than others. Maybe the forehead or the eyes, jaw. I'm just gently paying attention to those areas. Just being there with our awareness usually shifts already if we do that. Down to the neck, the throat, shoulders, arms and hands. Just a gentle attention for the area. And just notice if it maybe relaxes a little bit. And if not, it's also okay. Just an upper back. It's like going through the body with this caring and gentle attention. Care for all the parts of the body. Now lie the lower back. All of the pelvic area. Up relax. Knees. Lower legs and the feet. The attention on the feet, you can also become aware of the contact with the earth. You're on a higher floor. Connection is still there to the building that you're in, to the foundation of the building and to the earth. Groundedness, support of the earth. Become aware of the whole body. Again, sitting. And whenever you feel ready, you can open up to whatever is present for you right now. Whether it's something in the body, something in the mind, sounds. Maybe it's the breath. Maybe it's thinking. Maybe it's discomfort in the body. And when we are aware, we don't have to judge our experience. Sometimes that automatically happens. And if it does, we don't have to judge the judgment. We can just let the experience be there in whatever way it wants to be here right now. Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant. And when we train like this, we build up a tolerance for the whole range of experiences that we have as human beings, from the super pleasant experiences to the really unpleasant ones. We practice in just being aware of what is here right now without judgment. And as I said, if there is judgment, maybe we can cultivate the attitude of, well, judgment arose because judging is very natural as human beings. We'll all be judging ourselves in others. And we can be mild for ourselves and kind. There are no right or wrong objects. They're all just objects worthy of our attention. Object meaning the thing that we're aware of. So also if there is something difficult, maybe a difficulty motion or discomfort or pain in the body. Also that is a valid object for meditation. Something we can learn to just be with. We can train ourselves. We'll continue in silence. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sometimes when we get lost in thought an awareness comes back, we judge ourselves for being lost in thought. Maybe you can become aware of this judgment, just noticing it. Maybe you can cultivate the attitude of happiness when awareness comes back. And gratitude. This is the moment that we're aware again. It doesn't really matter too much that you're thinking. Because in this moment, awareness is back. We're cultivating the muscle of awareness. We're reinforcing it with gratitude and happiness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What is happening now? Is there a simple awareness of this present moment? The end of the meditation, we can take a moment to reflect how wonderful it is to be sitting here together, to be meditated together. We can be grateful towards ourselves. We've taken the time for the meditation today. We can be grateful towards each other. We can be grateful for the meditation today. We can be grateful for the meditation today. Every time we meditate, we generate wholesome and beneficial energies, also called merit. We generate this whether we had a pleasant or an unpleasant meditation. And these beneficial energies can be shared with people you love, with this group, with all beings everywhere, whatever you prefer. May the beneficial energies generated today benefit all beings in this group that I've chosen. May it contribute to their peace and well-being. May it contribute to their freedom, freedom from suffering. May it contribute to their freedom from suffering. May it contribute to their freedom from suffering. May it contribute to their freedom from suffering. May it contribute to their freedom from suffering.
