 Here we go. Okay. Great. So, hi, and welcome to today's happy hour. So, for the theme for today, I'd like to invite us to explore a theme we were exploring last week from different aspects, different dimensions, and today, again, from another aspect, another dimension. And that is putting down what is extra, what is not needed, what is not needed so that we can make more space for ease, for peace, for love, for care, for confidence, for trust, putting down what is extra. So, one simile that can come up is, say, if it's in the summer, it's already hot, and you don't want to be wearing a wool coat. That is extra. It's not needed to put it down. Or the idea of wind drag, how if you, well, you're going through, we're all going through life, through life, and it's nice to have ease, freedom. Nibbana is another word for ease, for freedom, going through life without wind drag. And when we add what is not needed, for example, hatred, extra, self-hatred, the hatred of others, extra, adds wind drag, adds wind drag, or lack of confidence. Oh, I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm not good enough. Wind drag, wind drag. How about we just bow to it and gently put it down? It's not needed. So, some of the invitations I'll make tonight during the guided meditation is, while if you notice, what's things that are extra coming up? Oh, I forgot to do blah, blah, blah. Oh, in this moment, that is extra. In this moment, it's wind drag. Let's put it down. Or, oh, I'm a terrible meditator. My mind is all over the place. I can't do this. It's wind drag. Thank you. Ah, relax, relax, soften, allow it to drop away. Just sit. Just sit. And you might need to put down wind drag, what is creating wind drag, this extra stuff, these extra layers, many, many, many times. Do it every time joyfully, putting it down joyfully, joyfully. So, I think that's enough for framing. For now, I might say more later, but let's begin. Let's just sit. So, let's choose to, ah, land in your body. Ah, landing, landing in your body in this moment. Arriving, arriving as best as you're able to. Inviting this body to relax, to land. In fact, let me suggest something. Raise yourself up a little bit if you're sitting, tightening as if raising your shoulders, tightening, lifting, lifting, lifting a little bit, and then drop, drop your body, relax. Ah, drop, and now really drop another level into your sit bones. Really taking your seat on this earth, in this body. This is your seat in this life, your unique seat. Relax into it, inhabit it, inhabit this seat fully. Both relaxing and sitting tall. This is your seat. Letting the lower body sink into the earth, the upper body, the torso, rise up with the breath, with integrity. You're both well rooted into the earth, connected, deeply connected, gravity pulling you down, enjoying sense of well rootedness. In your chest open, ah, feeling uplifted, filled with breath, with air. Your chest and your abdomen, your whole body. Spending a few minutes in your own time feeling well rooted, your feet, your legs, your sit bones connected to the earth, and enlivened throughout your body with breath, calming, soothing, settling. The The releasing, putting down, when the hair comes up, it's extra in this moment. Sensations are just sensations. Breathe is just breath. Sounds are just sounds. And thoughts could be seen as just thoughts coming and going, not getting entangled. Not getting entangled. You notice any entanglement? It's extra. It's wind drag. Smiling, we're noticing it is that. Relaxing, softening. The body. Noticing that without the entanglement, without what's extra, there's more ease, more peace. You can just sit. Just be. So much easier, less tiring, less exhausting for the body, for the mind. To just sit and be. Releasing, letting go, putting down. What is extra? Entanglements, self-doubt, I can't do this. My mind's distracted. I don't like this. All the commentary. It's not needed. It's like a warm coat in the summer. Don't need to wear it. Don't need to wear it. Your heart, your mind is naturally calm, naturally peaceful, naturally loving. The natural state is a free state. You know this, you know this, deep down. Just sitting, putting down what's extra. To make space for peace, for care, as self-care. You know this, you know this. You know this. You know this. You know this. Just noticing if judgments are coming up. Extra, not needed. Smilingly relaxing the body. Just allowing this extra layer to drop off and feel the ease of space, extra space created for peace. As a way to care for oneself, for yourself, for ourselves. So much more nourishing, so much more loving, such ease. The best protection we can offer ourselves. From the arrows that can cause harm when dragged. Just sit, just here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Especially when we're put down, any enmity, any self-criticism, self-hatred, self-doubt, or judgments directed towards ourselves or others. When we put those down, especially when we release them, we make even more space for love, care, ourselves and others. Pali, the language of the Buddha, dosa, ill-will, hatred. All dosa, the opposite of ill-will, hatred, synonymous with loving kindness. So when you put any of these unhelpful, unprofitable attitudes of the mind, doubt, release them, you're making more space for peace, for love, for friendliness. Thank you. Now I would like to invite you, as a bridge between this practice and the cushion in our daily life, to do a little visualization, if you would. As you feel embodied, sitting, feeling your feet on the floor, your sit bones, contacting the earth, your hands, your breath moving through your body. Bring to mind, if you would, a situation from today where there was something you were to do. Could be sending an email or washing the dishes or anything going for a walk, whatever, but there was some wind drag in the mind. Resistance. Either judgment, inner judgment, I can't do this, not good enough, I don't know what to do. Doubt or external. Any situation where there was wind drag, feeling your body, feeling your breath, as you feel into the situation where there was wind drag. I don't feel like doing this, wind drag, wind drag. Feeling your body, what does your body feel like? With this entanglement, with this wind drag. Do you notice more tightness, more fatigue, more exertion, more stress, more dukkha? And now, imagine you're putting it down. Releasing, just putting down whatever this extra winter coat is in the summer. Putting it down and giving your heart to what needs to be done, what's calling you and just doing it. Just being with it. Know wind drag. Imagine yourself doing this, just simply doing it, whatever it is immersed in it, becoming one with it. Thank you. Just simply immersed, without resistance, without wind drag. Thank you. I'd like to read a poem, let it wash over you, this reflection. Let it drop in, so your body is sitting embodied. Let it resonate in your heart, in your body. Poem is called, in this passing moment, by Hogan Bayes. In the presence of Sangha, in the light of Dharma, in oneness with Buddha, may my path to complete enlightenment benefit everyone. In this passing moment, karma ripens and all things come to be. I vow to choose what is. If there is cost, I choose to pay. If there is need, I choose to give. If there is pain, I choose to feel. If there is sorrow, I choose to grieve. When burning, I choose heat. When calm, I choose peace. When starving, I choose hunger. When happy, I choose joy. Whom I encounter, I choose to meet. What I shoulder, I choose to bear. When it is my death, I choose to die. Where this takes me, I choose to go. Being with what is, I respond to what is. This life is as real as a dream. The one who knows it cannot be found. And truth is not a thing. Therefore, I vow to choose this Dharma entrance gate. May all the Buddhas and wise ones help me live this vow. Thank you. Thank you. When sitting, I choose to sit. Thank you. Thank you. When sitting, I choose to sit. That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For the last moments of this practice. If any thoughts are coming up of judging your practice, considering it not good enough, not worthy enough. These self judgments, these thoughts of ill will towards yourself are extra, are extra. Not needed, putting them down. Ah, releasing, letting go. You did your best. You showed up as best as you're able to. By letting go of self judgment of dosa, you make space for a dosa. You're fully synonymous with metta, loving kindness, the opposite of ill will. Choosing, choosing simply just this, letting the extra, letting the wind ride go in this passing moment, in this passing moment, just this, just this. Thank you all for your practice. So for today's practice, I was weaving a few different themes, as you probably noticed. One theme was this theme of what is extra, putting down what is extra, especially what is put down the extra that's put down, if it is ill will again in poly dosa, D O S A. The opposite of that in poly, ah, do so you add an A and it becomes the opposite. Ah, do so synonymous with meta. So when you put any ill will down all this extra and special when you put those down. Ah, making small space for peace for ease for love for self care. It's the most important protection meta, we can offer ourselves, may I be safe. Well, may I be safe from all this extra stuff that I keep hurting myself with and hurting others with. Ah, body can relax the mind can relax. Another theme I wanted to bring in is this the simplicity of justice with this beautiful poem called in this passing moment. By Hogan Bayes be a YS, it's pretty easy to find for those who want to find it later, and probably Neil is going to send it to the Google groups. Yes, thank you. The theme here is no conflict, just this, just this, just this if you're sending an email, all the same story she Washington dishes are just immersed in it, just immersed with what is no conflict. No wind track. Again, making more space. Have you noticed the days that maybe you got the same amount done as another day but if there was a lot of wind drag a lot of doubt a lot of internally externally you're much more exhausted by the end of the day, as if you've been on the mountain. But it's all wind drag wind drag lack of freedom lack of freedom, whereas putting down what is extra what is not needed and recognizing what's not needed. So I've said plenty I would love to hear from you. What did you notice what did you discover. You can type in chat, if it's typed publicly I'll say your name, if not, just to me then it'll be private reflection, I won't read out your name can also raise your zoom hand. As an act as an access to simplicity and space. Beautiful, beautifully put out a beautifully put. Yeah, I want to read this part again. But the begs the question, where am I not choosing in my life where where is when drag where is. Beautiful. Thank you for offering this beautiful reflection that I will set. Other reflections, please you're welcome to raise your hand also. I think it's a question if you haven't spoken in a while, love to hear from you. Where if you have a question or if this was challenging or confusing it's all okay. It's all welcome. And then I see your hand. I usually I don't see people's hand because I see a small strip but here you are. Yes, Nikki. Thank you. I'd like to say how much I was relating to the, to the breath you know to let go. I just wanted to say the power of the breath you know to once I connected with my breath I do everything else went away you know as far as my worries and my stress and whatnot. Yeah. Thank you. And that is really powerful that that insight of connecting with the breath really it's so as if, again this image, I have this image of wind drag when you kind of riding the breath you connect with the breath and it's, oh it's so full and it's delicious and it's just putting down other things. What's extra can become so easy. Beautiful. Thank you. In fact that reminds me I just started to, I got a pointer to this book called breath by James nester, which I've just started to listen to and it's about breath about physiological psychological research that is just amazing this breath. So, yeah. Breath. Thank you, Anthony. So, dear ones, how about we turn to practice and community and we'll leave some minutes on the other side, when we come back from groups for reflections and maybe what comes up when you hear and hold with community. These three themes, how do they work for you what do you observed benefiting from other people's insight and wisdom, it's always interesting, even if you feel like you have nothing to say, hang in there, just listen with with metta for your own benefit and others, it's all okay. So, so I will create the breakout rooms and as always let's start by 15 seconds of metta silent metta for one another, just silently before you start speaking just holding yourself holding others with metta. Then you can say as much or as little as you want to say. Okay, here we go. They are open and enjoy.
