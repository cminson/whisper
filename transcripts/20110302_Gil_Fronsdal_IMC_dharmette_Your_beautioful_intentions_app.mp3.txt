Dharmette : Your Beautiful Intention s

As many of you are aware, Buddhism is reluctant to 
make any claim as to what is the self. However, you 
have to make something the self, and I think that the 
best candidate is your intention. It’s not really your ‘self,’ 
but if you absolutely need to have a  self, let it be your 
intention, because your intention is such a powerful ly 
conditioning aspect of your life. If you really care for 
your intention well, it will bring you down into the depths 
of your heart – into the essence of your life in some very 
important way.   
 
An key part of Buddhist spirituality is to pay attention to 
intention, to notice what we’re intending as we go 
through our li ves. It involves our intention in the very 
mundane activities of life , which could be as simple as 
the intention you  have when you open a door, or when 
you put your shoes in a shoe rack. What’s the intention 
there? You can do these things mindlessly, without 
really taking in what the intention is.   
 
There are  also levels of intention. You have  to get 
through the door  – that seems obvious . But are we 
intending to get through the door as quickly as we can, before everyone  else, and maybe cutting someone off, 
or are we intending to open the door so that o ther 
people can get through first?  How can we open the door 
so that it expresses an intention t hat we want to base 
our lives on? If we’re just mindlessly go ing throug h the 
door, it’s probably fine , and perhaps  it’s not going to 
cause any harm. But what if we open the door with the 
intentio n to do so in a way that conveys p eace or 
generosity?  There’ s a huge difference between just 
open ing the door casually , and opening the door in a 
way that’s generous to the other people who are trying 
to get through.  
 
There are the intentions that we have for our ordinary 
activities . We sit down to eat, drive  our car. What are 
the intentions when  you drive your car?  Many people 
don’t’ think about it , but the re are all kinds of motivations 
behind how we drive, where we drive, and how we ride 
the foot on the gas pedal. Many people don’t reflect on 
them.   
 
Then th ere are  bigger intentions that are , in a sense , in 
the back ground of our lives. What do we really want our 
lives to be a bout? Do we have a larger intention, a 
sense of purpose or motivation for our lives? Part of 
Buddhist spirituality is to be mindful of intention – to look 
at it, to be interested in it , and to look at all the different 
levels of it. The intentions of daily  activities are one 
thing. But then there is also looking, taking reflective time t o go off and have a cup of tea , or go for a walk , 
and reflect ing on what are the deepest , most important  
intentions  around which we want to organize our lives. If 
you’re a young person and you’re starting a career, 
what is the intention that goes behind  the career that 
you want to do?   
 
When I was 50 years old, I spent five days backpacking 
alone in  the Sierras . One  of the things I did was to 
review my life , and rea lly reflect deeply on the intention 
that I wanted to live my life with at this juncture. It felt 
like an opportune time to reflect , and to spend some 
careful time thinking about the orientation of I wanted to 
do, and what was important for me to follow thr ough on.  
 
It’s easy to live a l ife with superficial or unknown 
intentions , or intentions that are not really the ones we 
would choose if we really spent  time deeply considering 
them . Or it’s easy to have powerful intentions that w e 
want to base our life on, but then other intentions take 
over, and we don’t really follow through on what is  most 
important for us. Sometimes this happens because of 
fear. We’re afraid of following through on our deepest 
intention , because m aybe it’s not  going to work out, or 
our parents are going to disapprove of it, or there’s no 
financial s upport for that kind of life. P erhaps we’re  not 
afraid , but we’re distracted from our deepest intention 
by being so busy  – we get caught up in all kind s of 
things.   
A very useful aspect of Buddhist practice is to spend 
time looking at what motivates  us, at all the different 
levels of motivation  that exist, and then sustain the 
attentio n and reflection on this. It involves sometime s 
actually thinking about what  really are the intentions, 
motivations, and purposes , both  in the small details , and 
in the big picture of my life . Is this  really what I want to 
be behind, and how I want to live my life?  Is there some 
other intention that is more mean ingful or valuable for 
me?  
 
If you get quiet , and listen to your heart in some deep 
way, what do you really want to do? What’s really 
important for you that you want to follow through on , 
and organize your life  around ? One of the reasons  why 
this is impor tant is that the intentions that you live by 
and act on shape, color and condition who you are and 
what unfolds for your life. That’s why intention is the 
best candidate for who you really are . It’s what  shapes 
who you are and what you become . It’s what shapes the 
joys, happiness , and sorrows that you experience in life.  
 
To have really beautiful intentions and to take refuge in 
them , or to have really beautiful intentions and  to act on 
them reconditions  us, and gives us something that we 
can be glad about . To find happiness, satisfaction or 
peace in knowing about the purity  of your intentions is a beautiful thing. It is so  beautiful that sometimes it 
doesn’t matter whether you succeed in your intentions.  
 
A beautiful aspect of the Buddhist teachings on intention 
is that the  intention is what count s, and whether  you 
succeed or not, that is a different issue. Sometimes it’s 
unfortunate if you don’t succeed. But even if you don’t 
succeed , you can take refuge in  your intention. That is 
so beautiful. Acting on your intention , and the way that 
conditions and shapes your heart , might actually be 
more important than how the success shapes your heart 
and mind. The success of your intentions actually might 
not help you , and could even be detrimental to yourself. 
You have this really g reat intention to be of service ; you 
do it; and then you latch onto it , and it becomes  another 
source of conceit . In the big picture, t he success of 
being a service person wasn’t so good , because of the 
conceit that latched on. But if you didn’t succeed, then 
there would be no  conceit , and you would  just be left 
with all the good intentions that somehow were there in 
the background, knowing, and taking refuge in that.  
 
Motivation , intention, and sense of purpose  is a huge, 
beautiful topic . Sometimes Buddhist teaching s, 
especially in our  tradit ion – the mindfulness tradition – 
where they emphasize just be ing in the present 
moment, see ing and be ing mindful, and not think ing 
about  things too much  – sometimes  this shortchanges 
the practitioner. This is b ecause when you  really reflect and get into the heart of your intention and purpose , you 
benefit from reflection and thinking  – maybe  not on the 
cushion , but when you’re having a cup of tea , or talking 
with a friend.  
 
For some people , it’s very hard to find a deep intention 
for their life. Some  people never find it. Their life is not 
about having a deep intention , but about the small 
intentions they live  with throughout the day. It mig ht be 
the intention to live in this moment , in this activity in a 
way that brings more peace, happiness , or compassion 
to the situation , or the intention to avoid living in  the 
small ways and details of their  life that cause harm to 
them  or to other people . That’s a powerful  life. You’re 
not Mother Teresa;  you’re not doing this big, bea utiful 
thing. But in the moment -to-moment details of your life , 
as you go shopping for groceries, clean your house, 
walk down the street , and say hello to your neighbors – 
in all the little things , your intention is to live your life in a 
way that alleviates suffering , or doesn’t add  more 
suffering to the world . Your  intention to be of great 
kindness or happiness in the small , ordinary thing s of 
life. I’ve known people who have done nothing 
spectacular with their li ves whatsoever , but were  
peace makers in the world – dramatic , inspiring people 
just in the ordinariness of their lives. I’ve also known 
people who  have had huge, beautiful, majesti c 
intentions , and they just made a mess of things [ laughs] . 
 What is your intention? Sometimes I think that the  
emphasis on coming back to the present moment  can 
shortchange us , because we don’t look at and reflect on 
the bigger picture. But o ne of the benefits  of coming 
back to the present moment is that it encourages us to 
let the building blocks of our life start with the small 
things. Don’t  overlook the importance of the intention 
that you bring in how you open a door, how you eat you r 
food, how you go shopping , or how you drive your car. 
You don’t want to bypass those t hings and be blinded to 
the small details by the big, beautiful goals that you can 
have. Rather,  let the engagement with the details, the 
presence and connection to yourself that that can come 
with that – let that help you find the deeper and deeper 
intentions that can motivate your life.  
 
Your intention, motivations , and sense of purpose are 
among  the most precious resources you have.  They are  
worth tending to and reflecting on. Once  you have some 
sense of what it might be – whether it’s the small things 
or the big things of life  – then act  on it, and remember  to 
act on it the best you can. It’s not good enough just to  
have it. You have to star t living from there. As you act 
on it, then you’ll be surprised at how it supports and 
benefits you , as you continue through your life and your 
practice.
