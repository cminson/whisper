 What's on my mind today, as empty as it is today, it's kind of empty, I mean that's why, but is the topic of joy. And joy is a very important quality or aspect of the Buddhist spiritual path. And there's an expectation that as a person moves along the path sooner or later, some people sooner and some people later, that joy is a part of that path. Joy can coexist with other states, it can coexist with sadness and pain, and there doesn't have to be just only joy. But joy is an integral part of the path. And because of its intimate connection to the Buddhist path, perhaps, you find in the kind of technical language of Buddhism, a lot of different words for joy. And probably not anymore words that we have in English, but you find these wonderful words. And so you find words like happiness and joy, gladness, delight. And then there's a kind of words that describe different kinds of joy that are translated into English as things like minor joy, uplifting joy, pervading joy, cascading joy, just to get little nuances of differences of how they are. And they can be quite strong. It's cascading joy, it can be quite strong, meditators can feel sometimes. I've had it on retreat where I left session of meditation to go to lunch. And it took me a long, long time. I don't know, I was the last person in dining room still sitting there. Because every time I picked up the fork to eat, somehow that movement sent these waves of joy to my body. It was so intense, I couldn't continue to put the fork down. And then I try again. Cascading, big waves, kind of swashing over one. And you find in the early texts of Buddhism, there's stories and poems of the Buddha and other kind of enlightened people from the time of the Buddha, disciples of the Buddha, a lot of different, what's called peons of joy, expressions of joy. And some of these contain expressions like feasting on joy, we shall feast on joy. Another one is drinking joy, we shall drink joy or drinking the joy of the Dharma is one expression. So Dharma joy is an aspect of the path. I read recently that there was a survey done of people from around the world, different countries, where they were, I guess they were raiding or how happy people were in different countries. And I was surprised as probably many people were about which country got to the top of that list who had, you know, as a country is going to score highest in the happiness factor. Anybody want to guess? What? India, there was one guess. Bali, Thailand. That's all very interesting. Yes. Bhutan. Well, India and Bhutan are close, because the one that scored the highest was Bangladesh. And, you know, Bangladesh has a lot of difficulty, a lot of problems there, you know, a lot of poverty. And I don't think they were happy because they had, you know, DSL lines, or the equivalent. The, so as you know, often been pointed out that people can be quite poor and be filled with the light have a lot of joy and people can have a lot of material goods, a lot of wealth, and they'd be quite unhappy that material goods is not. The similar kind of survey was done of Norway many years ago when I was back there. I'm originally from Norway. This is about 20 years ago. And the vast majority of Norwegians 20 years ago felt the quality of their life had gone down over the last 10, 15 years. So from the 60s and 70s, that somehow they had more things than people, more people had cars, more people had homes, and more people had all this stuff. And people actually felt they were happier before. Enlightenment in Buddhism is sometimes called the great happiness, the Mahasukha. And the Buddha sometimes is called, he has a lot of epitaphs, the name of the Buddha. And one of the epitaphs for the Buddha titles he has is, he's a joyful one, the happy one. And so joy. So that's enough of an introduction, because what I'd like to do this evening is to have you guys break into small groups of about six people. And then just go around the circle. You don't have to speak if you don't want to, but you can just sit quietly and wait until this is over. Or just join a circle, I prefer. If you don't want to talk to you, sit and listen to what people say. And again, the group is about six. And then just go around the room and talk about what your experience or connection or understanding is of spiritual joy. And so not the joy of having DSL lines, but something that's somehow either directly or indirectly or somehow belongs to this somewhat vague category of spirituality. So if you don't use that word, just pretend you do or something. Something more or less fits that domain of life. And talk about your connection, your experience of spiritual joy, your understanding, what kind of joys have you had in your life that somehow you would call spiritual joy. And you just go around the circle. And perhaps we'll take about 20 minutes or so for each group to talk amongst themselves. And then we'll reconvene here. Is that okay? So if you could express your appreciation or whatever you need to do to close up your group, and then reform as a large group. Silence is joyful. So, you know, the word spiritual is not a Buddhist word. The Buddhists who speak English will often use the word. But probably when the closest things to that word spiritual is those qualities, those aspects, those elements that connected to the Buddhist path, the path of practice. And so part of the one aspect of walking the Buddhist path, all the different elements of it, doing all the different parts of it, is each of those parts are meant to, including other things, are meant to bring joy, or joy producing, happiness making kind of things. And then the thing is to avail ourselves of that happiness. And that's often hard for people to do is so people can practice generosity, do something generous, and then not really take the time to or the space in their psyche, to really let that generosity nurture, nourish, enhance their sense of joy, their happiness. So there's the happiness of generosity, it's the happiness of ethics, there's the happiness of developing the mind, happiness of having good qualities, happiness of love, compassion, there's the happiness of letting go of renunciation, which we talked about on Friday, the joy of renunciation, renunciation is supposed to be joyful. Most people you know, don't want to get close to renunciation. But it's one of those great joy producing practices in Buddhism. And there's a joy of the concentrated mind, it's one of the most really joyful thing. There's a joy of a pure mind, and the mind has some some some purity in it. It's really a beautifully joyful thing to feel that experience and to see it. There's a joy of liberation of freedom. There's a joy of an empty mind. I'm really struck how often, you know, that a certain kind of high quality of empty mind being empty in the mind comes along with a lot of joy. So empty doesn't mean you're emptied out completely. But you know, we were emptied of our thoughts, our preoccupations, our concerns, our worries, that we burdened the mind. That's a kind of emptiness that that somehow it's almost as if there's just innate quality of joy or delight that's in the emptiness of the mind or the natural function of the mind, the mind which is not burdened by its own thoughts. And then there's a joy of seeing all these things in other people. And seeing other people who are generous and have some ethical purity or practicing or have experience of love or delight or freedom, ease in their life and joy. It's just really great to see it. It's, you know, I feel a lot of joy coming sitting here with all of you just to sit here. It's amazing. I think it's really, you know, awesome and amazing thing that a group of people, this many people would choose on a Monday night to come and spend 45 minutes in anything together. I mean, that's amazing to me. I mean, that's, you know, we're doing it for Monday nights for 14 years. And I still kind of amazed that people want to do this. It brings me a lot of joy that this would be the way this would be the case. So there's the issue of availing ourselves of the joy, taking the time to feel it or let it in somehow. A lot of people don't let in the possibilities of joy in their life because we're really busy. We have really important things to think about. And we can't, you know, much more important than, no. And so part of the art of learning happiness and joy is to really understand well what gets in the way of it, what stands in the way. And that's a kind of a basic principle of Buddhist practice that is very, I think is very important is that Buddhism has a lot of ideals. And rather than going for the ideals directly, trying to hold on to it, trying to make yourself joyful directly. One of the ways we deal with Buddhism, ideals in Buddhism is to look in what gets in the way of them. And that's a healthier approach sometimes because then we're kind of clearing the dust, you know, cleaning up the scene so that what's inherent there can kind of shine forth. And so in terms of joy, what gets in the way of joy? And each of you have a lot of different answers for that, what gets in the way of your joy. But I'd like to suggest that you look and see if investigate in your life, whether one of the things that gets in the way of your capacity to feel joy and happiness at times is not allowing for it. Not creating a little bit of space, so allowance or permission or, you know, doing a very simple kind of reflection that might bring a certain kind of joy. It doesn't mean you have to stop being depressed or stop being, you know, you know, it's very important to say so people don't feel left out of this exercise. But, you know, certain little simple reflections about, you know, the world around us or our experiences and, you know, ourselves and kind of let ourselves be happy a little bit, little hints, little, you know, just little hints of modicum of a little joy and delight that wouldn't be there because you didn't take the time to experience it. You see, you're driving on the road and it's really important to get to where you're going, right? You see someone help someone across the street. You can just keep driving, right? But you can also kind of keep driving, kind of like to take that in. Look at that. Someone just helped someone, isn't that something? Imagine that there are such people in the world who will help someone, strangers across the street who need help. And just kind of like, just, you don't have to have any more reflections than that. Sometimes just saying it in your mind again, oh, look at that. Someone just helped someone across the street. You know, see what happens. If you let your mind be empty with that kind of resonating in it and probably it would be a little bit of joy or happiness or something. So are there ways then to kind of condition or improve the chances that we can experience joy and happiness in our lives in ways that don't require us to do things, you know, like, you know, to change our life so much. The idea is that there's joy and happiness which is available in everybody's life, much more than it tends to, than we, than we avail ourselves of. It's right there. It's available. Maybe not great cascading joy, but minor joy, simple joy, this simple joys of love life. And those simple joys of life, taking them in using, bailing yourselves of them, letting them kind of condition the heart and the mind are really important parts of the Buddhist spiritual path, spiritual life. They create the right conditions, the right soil in the mind, in the mind, in the heart, so that, for example, meditation practice can proceed and do its work. So those are my thoughts. So may the path that you walk be one that brings you and others more joy. Thank you.
