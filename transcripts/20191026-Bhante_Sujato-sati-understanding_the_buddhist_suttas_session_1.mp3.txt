moment and driving over the bridge you can see the haze and of course this is
climate change climate change is not a theory it's not a fantasy it's not
something that we're messing around with it is the reality of our lives it is
every breath that we breathe it is in every cell of our body and it will be
with us until we die and it will hate to break it to you and I know I'm starting
this off in a very serious note but I want you to know this is serious and
this is something we all have to take very very deeply and we can't forget it
will kill our children and I was on the march in Sydney recently with more than
50,000 mostly children on this march and you look out at them and these poor
kids the world that we have left them you know most of the people here like
talking to my mom the other day she's like oh well I'll be gone I'm like you've
heard of this we've got this thing called rebirth in Buddhism and you think
you're gonna escape and it's not quite that easy and we have lived in a way
that has forgotten the wisdom of the past and it's forgotten about how to live
with nature and we've forgotten how to live simply and we've got all of these
big shiny new toys and we've gone wow hey let's go and do what we can with
these toys and we've ruined the world and it's shocking so one of the things
which is a of urgent importance for me as a dharma teacher is to try to speak
about this to speak about my own anxieties and so speaking yesterday with
another senior monk about this and I'm like you know I've been a monk for 25
years and I'm freaking out he's like I've been a monk for twice as long as that
and I'm freaking out as well and how do we do this how do we talk about it how
do we communicate about it in a community it's too much isn't it it's too
much you can't take it in and the reality is you know I travel these days I
travel the world and I see people in different places and everywhere you go
there's something when I was in Singapore I sat down at the very nice
down a very nice mealtime and there happened to be a civil engineer there
and the they've been heavy rains that night and the flat we were in had been
flooded and I was talking about this with the civil engineer he said well
actually these apartments were built for a hundred year floods right I mean these
have been engineered for hundred year floods now they flood every four or five
years and I said what is Singapore doing to mitigating its climate change he
said well where you know where they want to build a one meter high sea wall
around the whole of Singapore all right but the sea level is going to rise more
than one meter so it's going to be completely useless he said well yeah
you're right there they're talking about building a floating airport right so
these are happening in Singapore Jakarta I don't know if anybody here is from
Indonesia but Jakarta they've already planning to move the capital city
because Jakarta will be flooded Bangkok there's already talk about moving
Bangkok that too will be flooded my region in Southeast Asia there'll be a
hundred million displaced people before too long 25% of Bangladesh will be
underwater Colombo will be gone the Ganges Delta is gone the Mekong Delta
is gone Perth is gone and we have no capacity or no plan to deal with anything
even remotely like this I've spoken with prime ministers I've spoken with
environment ministers I've spoken with CEOs and all of these kinds of people and
everyone is out of their depth everyone's out of their depth and so I'm not
immune to this by any means and I feel the fears and the anxieties and a few
days ago staying in a house with a family very nice family in LA and the
Sun was deeply traumatized deeply traumatized suffering from serious
psychological breakdowns because of his anxiety about climate change 18 year old
kid so what are we going to do about it now what are we going to do about it I
don't know I don't have any answers and I am a bit suspicious of anybody who says
that they do have an answer and if anybody says well this is how we solve
it I'm like well if that's how we solve it how can we haven't solved it if we
know how to do it so I'm not here to tell you what to do all right I'm not here
to tell you you should do this kind of activism or that kind of activism or
anything like that I'm not I haven't got a solution for you maybe there's a
solution maybe there isn't but what I am interested in doing as a spiritual leader
and spiritual teacher is finding some way where we as a spiritual community can
learn to live with the truth so it's not for me it's not a question of what do we
do how do we find a solution there are activists and engineers and technicians
and politicians and so on who are doing that our job is as spiritual people how
can we live with the truth how can we live with honesty and integrity and I
think most importantly how can we acknowledge that no matter how anxious
and how freaked out we might be how lost and how confused how ignorant we might
be can we still be a refuge for others at the very least we've got something of
the dharma at the very least we've got something that can give us some stability
some compassion some ability to reach out so these are some of the themes that I
want to address through today's session and I apologize if I'm being very
confrontational but frankly time's running out and I've been part of I've
been part of I was an activist long before I was a Buddhist since I was 18
years old I was a member of Animal Liberation and we knew all of these things
then this is not new greenhouse effect was common knowledge in the 70s the
environmental impact of meat eating was well known the rising of of swine flu
and bird flu this is all this is all common knowledge that these things would
happen the nefarious I was from Australia one of our least least how could
I put this least fondly remembered exports from Australia is Rupert Murdoch
and Fox News and I am so so sorry I apologize to you all for that all I can
say is during the 80s I was part of an anarchist group in the 80s who was
leafleting and tried to warn people about how dangerous Rupert Murdoch was we
did we tried to we tried to tell people but obviously we didn't try hard enough
and we didn't do enough and look that's just my little bit of experience and I'm
sure you know there's a lot of experience in this room and there was a
lot of people who have done a lot of things over the years and it's one of
the things which is frustrating for us is to think we knew and we've known about
climate change the first presentation to the oil industry on climate change from
scientists was in nineteen I think 1958 and they've known since then I mean the
science was known before then but that was when it was explicitly presented to
the oil industry we've known and as one of my great contemporary spiritual
inspirations said so memorably how dare you how dare you how dare you just sit
there and do nothing and just let all of this happen and we've seen Greta
Thunberg schooling the so-called leaders of the world and by golly they
need it so for today we get the chance to sit together to discuss some dumber
together and to hopefully find a way to be able to live with the reality of this
change which is affecting all of us in everything that we do and I mentioned
before that I was at Singapore Singapore the wealthiest most developed
city in the world and also six months ago I did a retort a retreat in central
Australia the the kind of the exact opposite the most remote region one of
the most remote regions in the world staying on an aboriginal community just
a very small community maybe a dozen people living there and we were shown
around by one of the one of the men who is in the community who is maybe in his
30s or something like that he showed us around the community told us the stories
and we got to learn a little bit of what it was like to live in a life where
your being was intrinsically connected with the soil and one of the things that
kind of really struck me on that retreat I'll be sitting there giving a
dumber talk and I gave a dumber talk on the four elements and when you talk
about the earth element you can pick up the earth and you realize how beautiful
it is it's so beautiful it's just dirt and when we live in cities we train
ourselves to think that even a speck of dirt there's something wrong with it
right it's so weird someone put someone puts a muddy footprint inside your
house you're like oh that's bad that's wrong there's something wrong with earth
nothing wrong with earth the earth was here first yeah and we've made it into
something dirty and when you're there and there's nothing but earth all around
you you realize that it is so beautiful and the world is such an incredibly
beautiful place like those of you is today we were driving out across the bay
and I mean it's so beautiful right in the dawn and you see the sunrise and the
light on the water it's so incredible but of course you can see the haze today
right very noticeable now one of the things that I first noticed when I went
to Asia I went to Bangkok and the sky is this murky pea soup yellow off yellow
color and in Australia of course you see the stars even if you're in a city you
can see the skies are relatively clear and you can see the stars so I've grown
up and it's normal to be able to see the stars of course if you go to central
Australia then it's even more incredible right the stars are just amazing
compared to even Australian cities and even so even so normally the stars are
so incredible one night when I was on this retreat I was walking back we had
the dumber sharing and gathering around a campfire and then I walked back I was
at that retreat we slept in swags which is just like a canvas sheet with a
thin mattress and I put my swag down on a creek bed just FYI in Australia
creeks mean a dry piece of and rivers and lakes is like dry sand that
historically at certain points may have had water in it so anyway so I put my
swag on a creek bed and I'm sleeping there a couple of miles out from where
we were staying anyway and I was walking back and as I walked back I glanced at
the sky even knowing how clear and how pure and how beautiful the air was I
literally staggered and almost fell over the sky the stars were so incredible
it was just like this three-dimensional array of multicolored billions of lights
just pouring down from the sky and it was like why am I even bothering to put
a torch on there was no moon or anything like that but it's so bright you can just
see everything around and when that morning I came back to the camp the
next morning and even the local Aboriginal people were saying well it's
really clear last night but no why some atmospheric condition you just see it's
just so amazing and so we're in this place which is so remote and so beautiful
and we're looking out on the pristine untouched wilderness of Central Australia
or what I thought was the pristine untouched wilderness of Central Australia
and the Aboriginal leader there said you know this has changed so much since I
was a boy what what do you mean he said when I was a boy all the grasses were
different these are all African grasses they imported these to feed the cattle so
Australian grasses grow in clumps quite separated from each other and not so
much food for the cows so the cattle ranches bring in these African grasses
that glow grow closer together they can feed more cows with them then when the
fires come they burn hot the after the Australian grasses burn cool and they
regenerate the seeds and the African grasses grow close together they burn
hot and they destroy all the seeds and so when a fire goes through 100% of the
native seeds are gone and this is all across Central and Northern Australia he
said we used to see all of these wildflowers all of these different
species none of it's there anymore we used to hear the dingoes howling at
night we can't hear them anymore we used to see the kangaroos would come
around we can't see them anymore and so for me this is so devastating to be in
Central Australia in this most remote wilderness area and to realize that even
here so much has changed and so much has been lost and so in the world that we
live in the world we live in we are just losing every day while I'm talking I've
been sitting here talking to you for the last 20 minutes or so on species are
becoming extinct
millions of tons of co2 are pouring into the atmosphere it's not as if we're
stopping this we're still doing it and we're still doing it at a faster rate
than ever we're not slowing down the amount of co2 we're putting in the
atmosphere we're accelerating the amount of co2 we're putting in the atmosphere
right now
so we have this we have each other we have the Dharma we have a chance to live
and we have a chance to love each other and we have a chance to be free and we
have a chance to let go and it's up to us to take that chance
so for today I had expected to have a projector so we could do some suttas and
discuss some suttas but apparently the projector has manifested its intrinsic
emptiness
so so so so that's wonderful that we have less technology to deal with and the
world is probably much better for that because well I mean I don't mind using a
projector sometimes but it's usually nicer to talk to people than to talk to a
screen so let's do that instead so what I'd like to do for today if it's okay
with you then let us take this theme of impermanence is take this theme of
connection with nature let's take this theme of living and being able to to be
alive to find some joy I mean let's assume everyone's dead in a hundred
years if you're the last man or the last woman left alive what would you want
would you think back to a hundred years would you think all those people I hope
that they suffered probably think well I hope they had a good time while they
were there so we don't know what's gonna happen we do know however that we do
know I think one crucial thing which is that all of this all of this destruction
is driven by greed by greed for material things it's driven by stupidity
people not knowing what the consequences of their actions are and to a degree that
perhaps I think I am only just becoming to an aware of it's also driven by hate
and one of the things that I've been in Australia I've been part of a group
called Australian religious response to climate change and we have
represented on this issue for more than a decade to the Australian government
with a rather cataclysmic lack of success and one of our core messages has
always been that this is a deeply moral issue because those who are most
affected are the poor people in developing nations people who are
disadvantaged they are the people who will be the most vulnerable whose homes
will be first to be flooded away who have the least backup the least resources
the least food the least water and they will be hurt the most and we've seen
this in contemporary times with Puerto Rico and the tragedy that unfolded there
we've seen it with Mozambique a million people displaced we've seen it so many
times happening all around the world and we took this message to our politicians
and we tried to raise some spark of moral sensibility in them looking back I
realized that we misunderstood the problem that this is not a bug it's a
feature the fact that it's hurting the poor and the brown and the over there
that's how the system is designed to work and the Buddha always said that the
three drives greed hate and delusion and we know that these things are caused by
greed it's obvious we know they're fueled by delusion but also that element of
hate and cruelty I think is really important to understand and when we
understand that we know that these things are human things that they are
inside us that those same things that have hidden you know we can we can
complain about Fox News and say all these so much lies and so on there and all of
these kinds of things but we also have been hiding the truth from ourselves and
we also have been afraid to face the reality and we also are sometimes okay
with things as long as it hurts someone over there who isn't us you know so this
is what the practice of compassion is about is what the practice of morality
is about is what the practice of wisdom is about so by extending our Dharma
practice we should become kinder more loving more understanding I hope that's
the case and if the Dharma is working well then that should be the case I'm
not convinced that it always is the case I think sometimes we do Dharma practice
to hide our problems from ourselves to convince ourselves that we really are
full of love and to surround ourselves with the aura of being a good person
and when we surround ourselves with the aura of being a good person then we
can't be somebody who would do these bad things or would endorse these bad
things and yet obviously that isn't always the case so as these these times
come up remember that the Buddha always encouraged us to confront reality and to
confront reality in a way that was courageous recently on my forum we've
been discussing how to translate Nibbana and of course you know Buddhists like to
argue about Nibbana just like we like to argue about Jhanas I'm not sure if the
argument about Nibbana or Jhanas is ever conduced to actually realizing these
things but anyway that doesn't stop us we've got to entertain ourselves somehow
and so people have these many different translations of Nibbana sometimes
people translate it as quenching or as other one's extinguishment or sometimes
people leave it untranslated or unbinding and these different kinds of
things now the thing with Nibbana is that when I was doing my translation I my
thought was in my the guiding principle for me doing the translation was the
most important principle that I always bore in mind was what I call I call to
myself the principle of least meaning the principle of least meaning which
means that when you translate something that you translate it according to the
thinnest meaning possible all right you translate it very directly as as just
what the basic ordinary every day meaning of something is why because when
we come to a spiritual realm and dealing with ancient spiritual texts there is an
almost overwhelming desire to load words with meaning and we have whole
exegetical traditions that heap up these great burdens of meaning on words and
these poor little words have to struggle under this whole burden and it's not
fair right we should have compassion for the poor word it's just trying to it's
just trying to say its thing right the Buddha was just talking ordinary
language and he was using the words in his language that best described the
thing that he's talking about and so when we we sort of put layers of
philosophical assumptions and traditions and things like that on top of words we
kind of obscure what the basic point of it was now the basic meaning of Nibbana
is pretty straightforward it means extinguishment and a flame goes out it
comes extinguished and that's what Nibbana means it's not particularly
controversial actually from a linguistic point of view but then the real
issue is that people don't like it people get scared and people are like
hang on you can't say it's extinguishment because then people freak out
right that's the point you should be freaking out if you're not freaked out
by Nibbana you don't get it yeah and you know plenty of examples of that in the
suttas themselves you know how can Nibbana be pleasant if you don't feel
anything there what people say right they freaked out by this idea how can
Nibbana be pleasant if there's nothing which you feel there and the answer to
that of course is letting go because when you let go you feel happy and when
you let go again you feel happy again and when you let go more you feel happy
as still now that's not necessarily gonna happen in every case right I mean
you might think well I'm just gonna let go of my job and you're not gonna feel
happy when they drag you off to jail because couldn't pay you mortgage right
so you have to have a bit of common sense in how you apply this thing but the
basic idea is there a couple of years ago in Sydney I went to a house
invitation with a young Sri Lankan couple they had just bought this new house
and they invited me to have the meal and to do a blessing for them in the new
place and they told me a story that when they had settled the mortgage for the
new house the husband went to work that day and told his boss he said oh you
know just we had some good news we settled the mortgage for the new house
and the boss laughed and said ha ha now we've got you Australian sense of humor
and he got home from work that day and told his wife this story and his wife
said oh my god my boss said exactly the same thing that's how they get you they
convince you that this is freedom that this is happiness that this is what you
want and Buddhism says exactly the opposite we say it's freedom to let go
of these things freedom to not have these things and I'm going to now show off
okay what I'm allowed to I'm the teacher you see it's my ball it's my monk's ball
they're all the nuns here you have your balls yeah yes that's it when I and I
travel I have my ball I have my bag that's it and my my extra robe and my
laptop so Buddha said these are the five records didn't the Buddha say the five
requisites something like that full robes house food medicine and laptop
something like I'd have to go and check the comparative study of the Chinese
versions to that one but so you know we make some we make some some some
adjustments but that's it and when I when I got off the plane once so teaching
in Austria got a plane Vienna these things always these things always drift
around maybe I've got maybe I've got weird shaped ears that right is that a
good okay okay so get off the plane and they're like oh you don't have to collect
your luggage you know this is this is all you you know it's so nice as a monk
you only travel with one bag and I said to them no no you don't understand that's
not what I travel with that's all my possessions everything that I own fits
into that bag and you know what the crazy thing about that is I was thinking
about that the other day when I'm traveling around with this bag and
thinking I'm gonna get home and half of these things I won't use literally half
of these things I or if I do use them I could have easily gone without them so
how much do we need how much do we have and this is that wisdom that we've had
for humanity has always had and you know I talked before about their aboriginal
traditions and about the wisdom that they have but you know I mean sometimes
we romanticize this you know but it's not just sort of aboriginal traditions or
anything like that I remember when I was a teenage boy 15 or whatever it was
14 or 15 or something and I started shaving and I had a disposable razor
disposable razor blade and my grandmother looked at and she's like I don't
like those things they're so wasteful my grandmother wasn't a greenie she wasn't
environmentalist but that was the way she was brought up you don't waste things
you don't just you know have a whole razor and throw it away you have a blade
and you sharpen the blade and that's the way that people have lived for
thousands of years and we are the weird ones we are the ones who've decided we
can have whatever we want and just throw it away and somehow that's going to be
okay because it's someone else's problem and then we we literally ship all of
our crap off to some other country I don't know if America does that but
certainly Australia was doing that yeah America does the same thing till China
said no we're not having it anymore good on your China think it's it's it's it's
just and every year it seems to get worse you know at the monastery I was out
in Perth in Bonyana monastery they had in the the retreat center somebody had
given us a very please come in someone had given us a very nice coffee machine
and so one of these coffee machines that has these little pods they have to put
in I'm like I hate these things like I load them with a passion and you know
bring it up at the same committee meeting and say can we please get rid of this
thing and they're like well what do we do do we give it to someone you can't give
it to someone because as soon as someone has it you have to keep buying those
pods to use it that's how they get you right this is what it's all about I
said no no no we take it up to the workshop and we smash it to pieces with
a sledgehammer that's what we do with things I don't think we ended up doing
that but that's what I certainly wanted to do that it would have been very at
least you have at least you have like a moment satisfaction in doing that now we
have to make a stand against these things we can't just sort of drift along and
think of that it's okay and so in when we do dharma practice when we meditate we
sit down to meditate and please come in you are just in time when we sit down to
meditate the weird thing about meditation is I don't know if you've noticed
but the weird thing about meditation is that there's nothing there and then we
kind of fill it with stuff now let me just see if this is familiar to you okay
you sit down to meditate right you've made it everyone here has meditated
before right is that correct if we anyone new to meditation it's all right if
you are but I just want to make sure everyone to meditate okay so you sit down
to meditate okay cross your eyes whatever close your eyes and then you try
to you try to watch your breath is that right something like that you try to
concentrate on your breath or some other meditation yes more or less then when
you try to concentrate on your breath then you try to concentrate your breath
for two or three breaths and then your mind goes wandering right something like
that and then all of these thoughts start coming into your mind that right and
you're trying to get rid of all of these thoughts that's really hard and it's
really hard to keep your mind steady and to concentrate on the breathing so is
that correct that sound more or less like your meditation this is I mean this
is something which is like I've heard so many times I've heard this story and
it almost seems like every time I talk to people about meditation they tell me
something like this and you know a few years ago when I was in sit in Perth I
arrived home from Perth and I got a taxi in from the airport and chatting with the
taxi driver he's a lovely guy name of Chris and you know he's like he
meditates as well I said how's your meditation going he says well he sits down
he tries to concentrate on his breath but then it's really hard and all of these
thoughts keep coming in and distracting him I'm like oh yeah so even Chris the
track taxi driver has the same problem what if I was to tell you that the
Buddha didn't teach meditation in this way at all that nothing in what I've
talked about meditation has really any it's just not how the Buddha spoke and
what if I suggested that the language the ideas the concepts behind meditation
shape what we do when we close our eyes to meditate and that if we if we change
our approach then none of these things are a problem anymore would that be good
do that sound good yeah an example okay I will get there I will get there okay so
first of all see how this has occurred to me like you know doing the same doing
these practices talking to people at meditation for so many years and also
working with with Pali texts and with the Buddhist suitors and look I'm very
thick okay I'm very slow it takes me a long time to figure stuff out and took
me like more than a decade to work this kind of thing out and then despite the
fact that I have very good teachers who are actually saying the same thing but
you just don't quite get it but what when the Buddha was talking about let's
just take breath meditation as an example the Buddha's talking about breath
meditation so Satva assasati Satopasasati introduction to breath
meditation repeated countless times throughout the so Satva assasati
Satopasasati sits down tries to concentrate on the breath and then
all no actually he doesn't say anything about that there's no trying there's no
concentrating there's no the breath these things and these concepts are not
found in the Buddha's teachings of meditation at all what it says is
mindfully one breathes in mindfully one breathes out can you hear the difference
there's no such thing as the breath the breath is just what we do it's a verb
not a noun right you're breathing mindfully many years ago I heard somebody
at an interfaith event talk about this and they they used the phrase God is an
advert God is an adverb God is not a thing God is how you live and God is
how you do things how you manifest your love and your being in the world I
thought it was really beautiful so the same thing met my friend was meditation
mindfulness meditation you know it's not something that you do it's the way that
you do it you're all breathing already there's nothing special about it but
it's the way that we do it with mindfulness let me come back to that I
want to make this more clear because it's something that okay I'll tell you
this I've taught this many times and usually what I find is when I teach like
this at the end of the talk somebody will say okay that's all very well but
when I try to meditate I try to concentrate on the breath and all of
these thoughts keep coming in right now sometimes I teach this and then I say
that I say that people say that and then people still get up and say that at the
question literally I'll say people say I've tried to concentrate on my breath
and all these thoughts keep coming in and somebody immediately afterwards say
yes but when I try to meditate I try to concentrate on the breath all these
thoughts keep coming it's so deeply ingrained into how we think about and
how we approach meditation all right now I'm not going to go into the
historical background obviously this has a history to it and I think it's
important to acknowledge this meditation has a history I wrote a book called the
history of mindfulness and that's conditioned by texts it's conditioned by
geography it's conditioned by culture is conditioned by events and we can go
back as historians and look into that and if you're interested we can talk
about that a bit later but I don't want to go into necessarily the history of
that right now the important thing is just to simply acknowledge that the way
that we think about it is conditioned and we don't have to think about it in
that way we can approach it in a different way and the way that we think
about it shapes what we do and what we do shapes what the outcome is or to put
it another way none of you would have meditated if you'd never heard of the
word meditation and so we have this kind of conceit that when we meditate that
we're going beyond words but it's only words that have directed us to go beyond
words and what we experience is still shaped by those words in some way even
if they're not directly and even if you're not thinking them at the time so
let me let me just go into this about meditation a little bit okay so here we
are I'm here I'm going to watch the breath right the breath is there the
breath is my object we use this word object of meditation would it surprise
you to learn that the Buddha never used the word object that there is no word
for object in that sense in the Pali Canon or at least in the early parts of
the Pali Canon so when we talk about a meditation object we're already using the
kind of language that the Buddha avoided and after studying the suttas for 20
years I learned to pay attention to these things because the Buddha was very
very precise in the way that he said certain things and then didn't say
certain other things okay I'm here I'm watching my object which is the breath
I'm gonna try to focus on that and then all of these thoughts keep coming in and
disturbing me and you've got this is kind of please come in I bet you're
just in time we're just about to get to the good bit and it's all complicated
right so start to ask yourself these questions what is this object that's
the breath I mean the breath isn't something that's different from me is
that the breath is something I'm doing it's not a physical thing and I'm
staring at this object but somehow in order to create this idea because we've
heard of the word take the breath as your object pay attention to this like in
the future if you listen to people talk about meditation when you read dharma
books and things like that pay attention to the way that they're using
language they say take the breath as an object once you've done that you've
already separated the breath from yourself your your internal subjectivity
your awareness is separated from the breath then people say all of these
thoughts keep coming in and bothering me where do they come from whose thoughts
are they that guy over there they've been beamed by the government whose thoughts
are they will be your thoughts dummy usually I think hopefully right your
thoughts but what does that language tell us right these thoughts keep coming
in what that tells us is that we've divided ourselves from our thoughts we've
disowned them somebody once gave me a simile in meditation they said it was
meditation sometimes you know you have to be mindful of your thoughts like if
you're standing on a railway station and you watch the train of thought go past
after I realize it's completely wrong it's like you're riding the bicycle of
thought you can't just sit there and watch the ride the bicycle of thought
ride itself by you're the one who's riding it you're the one who's pushing
the pedals so this is all getting very complicated I'm in here I'm watching my
breath which is an object out here all right exist objectively all right and
then these thoughts who aren't really mine they come in and they start
distracting me next question which is when it gets really creepy who is this
my god I'm obviously not my breath because that's out there I'm not my
thoughts because they're coming in from outside who am I well who am I in that
scenario who am I is the good one I'm the pure one I'm the meditator I'm the
one who's mindful and is aware and knows right that's why these thoughts can't
be mine because these thoughts are nasty sometimes and they're evil and they're
bad or the very least they're annoying so that company I'm in here I'm pure
and good right I'm sitting here meditating you see I've got a nice smile
on my face and I've got a good posture and I'm very virtuous because I'm doing
my meditation I'm looking forward to you know telling my partner that I've done
my dating meditation or something like that right I'm pure and good because I
have this pure and good motivation to do meditation so I can't own these thoughts
because these thoughts are not pure and good so this is why we distance ourselves
and cut ourselves off from these things and so because of the way that we've
approached meditation we've created a divided self and then we say to ourselves
let's unify ourselves right let's find a point of oneness and that's why it's
hard work and it's hard to find that because we put all of that effort to
divide everything up actually it's natural for these things to come together
and if we understand how the mind works then this whole process becomes a lot
less like hard work our minds are complex and they have many different facets
and it's true we divide different parts of our mind off from each other sometimes
in more healthy ways right I mean sometimes we have this parts of our
mind we might use at work other parts you might use if you're you know whatever
with your family or something it's okay it's okay to have different parts of
your mind that you use in different ways but it's when those walls get too strong
and the doors get locked and you can't find your way from one to the other this
is where things become problem so in meditation all of those things start to
relax and they start to dissolve this is a natural process and so you don't have
to do anything about it so I'll give you a bit of a simile and this is a simile
that works in Sydney I don't know if it will work here but I'll try it anyway in
Sydney when I was there in 2013 I think it was February the 13th on 2013 we
have we have what we call the angry summer and bunches of temperature
records broke all over the place and in Sydney where I was in the Buddhist
library in Kampadam it was 47 degrees 47 degrees is a lot I don't know if you've
ever been in heat that great but essentially when it's 47 degrees the
people wander around saying oh my god it's so hot and that's the only thing
that you can do and we were very lucky in Sydney that the city came through
fairly much okay but around that temperature cities start to break down
roads start to melt train lines buckle electricity grids collapse emergency
services collapse in Sydney one of the things that they were afraid of it
didn't quite happen then but if it was maybe a degree or two warmer which maybe
that'll be this year Sydney has colonies of hundreds of thousands of fruit
bats that nest in the trees in the parks around Sydney and at around 47 48
degrees they just dropped dead and this and this is happening throughout the
forest all in Australia and Central Australia northern Australia that the
little creatures they just drop dead of heat stress and you can imagine the city
the size of Sydney with like hundreds of thousands of just large animals just
dropping dead out of the trees you know it's a huge health risk and health has
it so these things are a great threat anyway so it didn't quite happen that
year anyway so I have this this they've had this simile or this parable about
two people who are working in an office on a day that's really hot like that at
the end of the day they've been so stressed and so you know so much so
so oppressive they decide to at the end of the day one of them says well why don't
we just go go down to the beach say okay let's go to the beach and just relax so
I drive down to the beach and they go for a walk it's just sunset and there's a
few people around not too many people but you know enough people down there
enjoying and the cool breeze is coming in off the ocean and the last light of the
Sun is just disappearing and the waves are coming in very gently not to not be
crashing waves nice gentle soothing waves coming in and you take your shoes
off you walk down the beach enjoying that cool space and then the two of you
earn your friend to sit down on the sand and enjoy that cool space unfortunately
one of those two people is a meditator and so when they sit down they think
wow this is so nice and peaceful how can I make myself even more peaceful I know
I'll count the waves one wave coming in one wave going out one wave coming in
one wave going out hang on it's that two or three where oh hang on I'll start
again all right one wave coming in one of going out oh look at that ship over
there I lost my concentration again okay one wave coming in after a while
their friends like oh it's so peaceful here and the other ones are I just can't
get my mind to be still so peace peace yeah peace what we're all looking for
peace is natural the Buddha said it's only natural it's only natural that if
you live a good life and you don't know harm then it's only natural that you
won't feel any remorse and if you don't feel any remorse it's natural that you
will feel joy and if you feel joy it's natural that you feel calm and if you
feel calm it's natural that when you meditate you feel pleasure and when you
feel pleasure it's natural that your mind will go into deep samarit and if
your mind goes into deep samarit it's only natural that you'll see things as
they really are and if you see things as they really are it's only natural that
you become free. This is how the Buddha taught meditation. Where is the bit about trying to
concentrate on your breath and being worried about all the thoughts that keep coming in?
That's not how the Buddha taught meditation. One of the curious little details or curious
little features about meditation on the suttas is that the word sukha or pleasure or happiness
may have many different meanings. So it's used as ordinary happiness, karma sukha, sensual
pleasure and so on. But by itself in certain contexts the word sukha can also just mean
meditation. Sukha is just used as a word to refer to meditation. This is the sukha that we
have. And when the Buddha was criticized by one of the other, someone from another religious path
at the time, they said, your monastics, your followers, they just indulge in pleasure all
the time. Because in those days they had these kind of hardcore ascetics who are doing all
these self-mortification practices and things and saying, your followers, they just indulge
in pleasure. And the Buddha said, too right they do. They indulge in four kinds of pleasure,
first jhana, second jhana, third jhana, fourth jhana. And as a result in indulging in those four
kinds of pleasure, they enjoy four kinds of fruit, stream entry, one's return, non-return and
narrow hardship. So the path of letting go is the path of pleasure. It's not to say that we
don't experience pain and dukkha and suffering along the way, because of course we do. And the
path is still conditioned. The path is still dukkha. But it's a path towards sukha. It's a
path towards pleasure, towards happiness. And one of the, one of the deep truths of the
Buddhist path that we learn in our experience through meditation is that pleasure gives birth
to itself. And pleasure is something that is intrinsic and natural and normal. It's not
something rare that we have to seek outside. We've been persuaded that happiness is hard to find.
And something I use often as an example when teaching dhamma is that in America they say you
have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, right? And it's very noteworthy that
you have the right to life, you have the right to liberty, you don't actually have the right to
happiness, you have a right to the pursuit. And it's the pursuit of happiness that takes you
further and further away from actual happiness. Because you think of happiness as something
which is out there that you have to get, entertain and have. So the Buddha is teaching that
happiness is not something out there that you have to get, entertain and have. Happiness is
something that naturally arises inside yourself. And the hard work is not the hard work of making
yourself concentrate and making yourself do these things and all of that stuff. The hard work is
the hard work of denying ourselves happiness. The hard work that we've been doing is building
those walls, creating that suffering, cutting ourselves off from what our real nature is. That's
the hard work and that's the work which is fueled by delusion. In Buddhism we have this
word moha meaning delusion and delusion is a very active force. Delusion is at work in our minds
all the time and delusion hides the truth from us. We want to know, we want to realize,
we want to be free, but delusion is there tricking us and turning us away from the truth.
That's the hard work. Finding happiness isn't the hard work. Do you believe me? You've just
been too credulous. Maybe shouldn't you be more skeptical? Fair enough, fair enough. Okay,
good enough. So why don't we do some meditation? Would you like to do some meditation? Okay,
now so what I would like to do for the meditation, should we do some breathing meditation? Does
it sound like a good idea? No? You're all kind of nervous now. You think this is a trick?
Yes, yes, you're starting to get to know me. Okay, let's do some breathing meditation.
All right, let's do this breathing meditation with beginner's mind. Okay, let's forget the
fact that we've ever meditated before, forget all the retreats that we've done, forget who
you are, forget any method that you've learned. I don't want to criticize any methods. If
you learn any methods or whatever, then keep doing them. That's fine. But maybe just, it's
not all the methods are fine. But just like have it like a different slightly different
attitude towards it. I'm going to teach you a bit of a method now, but not too much. The
goal of a meditation method, the purpose, the real purpose of a meditation method is
to distract you from your meditation. It's to give you something that will convince you
that you're actually doing something. So you don't go and interfere too much in the actual
meditation, which is what happens when you're not paying attention. I don't know if you've
ever had this experience where you're meditating and you're doing this meditation and you're
like, oh, my mind's distracted and you can't focus. And then after a while you realize,
hang on, somehow I feel peaceful. It kind of snuck up on me and I wasn't looking. And
I turned around and I said, I did feel peaceful. How did that happen? So this is why we have
a meditation. It's to give ourselves something to do because we can't just switch to like
a complete letting go. Then it's something to sort of lead us towards letting go. So
I'm going to teach you like a bit of a meditation method for breathing meditation. And then
hopefully we can use that for letting go. How long would you like to meditate for? Half
an hour. Half an hour? We'll do a half an hour of 40 minutes or so. Personally, I think
that there's not, if you're not on like a long retreat, there's probably not much point
in meditating much longer than that. I think most people after half an hour, 40 minutes,
they're just minds to the center, fall asleep or drift or something. So we'll do that and
see how we go. All right. So if you're not comfortable meditating, then just don't worry
about it. Just sit there and do nothing. So I'll do a little bit of guidance in the meditation
but not too much.
As we sit here quietly and take a few minutes to just relax and settle back and feel the
mind. Just calmly go back into the body. Feel the body settling back into the chair or into
your seat.
Okay.
And you can feel the energies that are sparking and moving in your body as we're sitting
here in the present.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, so how was that?
Was that alright?
Enjoyed?
That's good.
Now, I believe we're going to break for lunch at 11 o'clock.
Is that correct?
Yes?
Okay, 11 o'clock.
Before we do that, I want to do a little exercise with you all.
And we're going to do something, and I'm going to ask you to trust me.
So, are you all happy?
If we do an exercise in a minute, are you all happy to go along with it?
Are you sure?
It depends.
I'm hearing the voice of wisdom.
Okay, so what I'm going to do, if you don't want to do it, then that's alright.
But what we're going to do in a minute, we're all going to get up.
We're all going to go to the other side of the room, introduce ourselves to somebody
that we don't know, and then we're going to give them something.
Okay, a gift.
So everyone here will give each other a gift.
You want to do that?
Okay, that's it.
That's the exercise.
Let's do it.
And it's for reals, right?
If you give them your car keys, that's it.
If you have them in Essex, you have to think to even find something.
Find a seat to give away.
Go to the other side of the room.
Okay.
