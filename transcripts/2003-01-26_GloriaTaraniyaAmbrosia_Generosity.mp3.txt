 Nice to be here again. This Sangha has a particularly good feeling, very mature feeling. And I think we saw a lot of that expressed the other night with that wonderful dedication for the statue to Mahatapatthi. And those of you who are here, wasn't that lovely? It's just very inspiring to have this beautiful, really museum quality image of a woman renunciant teaching in the teaching pose. Very beautiful. So I hope that that inspires you and all the people who come through here in the months and years to come. I'm already asked if there's any plans to make copies of it. I think that would be fabulous to have them to give to other people. So I wanted to offer some thoughts today on the topic of generosity giving, this beautiful quality of heart that takes us, the cultivation of which takes us from very self-absorbed modes to very other-oriented and very selfless modes. It's a very, very pivotal part of the Buddha's teachings. It's foundational. The Buddha talked about it really when he was speaking for the first time to a group of people who hadn't heard the Dhamma. You may well know in what's called his gradual teaching or gradual training, he would always start with this teaching, with the teaching of Dhan or generosity offering for the goodness or welfare of other people. And it figures as the first one in the list of the 10 power means, which are the beautiful pure states of mind that we want to cultivate. They're the states that actually distinguish, say, an Arahant from a Buddha, the quality of the purity of the mind. And Dhan is listed first among these and said it's said that that's done because without this quality of generosity, you can't cultivate any of the others. I remember one of the most frequent quotes of Ajahn Chah when he was here in this country was that his meditators, he thought it was interesting and really couldn't be any other way that in the United States we were really taking to the meditation practice. That that's the door or the window, if you will, that Buddhism came through for us. But that at some point we would realize that our meditation wouldn't develop very far if we didn't have a good sense of the practice and the experience of generosity and seela or morality, good moral conduct. I think about that a lot. I think that's very, very proving to be quite true. There is definitely a great interest in this teaching and understanding it more. I think we've been putting it out there a lot and but not really taking it into our hearts, maybe not really reflecting on it as much as we could. So I thought it might be helpful just to look at it a little bit this morning. It's said to be a very, very important human quality because it has this expansive heart opening characteristic. It's the antidote, if you will, for the sources of suffering in our own hearts and in our lives, greed, hatred and delusion. If you look at your heart in the act or the experience of being generous and kind towards another person, towards a situation, whatever it might be, you can see that in that moment there is an absence of any kind of greedy, self-absorbed, I-me-mine kind of thinking. It just can't be there at the same time. Greed has this contracting, pulling in energy, doesn't it? It's about me and what I need and what I want. This other energy is one that is completely going out. It's an absence of that in the heart. One can get an inkling of the value of it just in that because this state is a highly suffering state. Greed is very, very painful. This constant longing for other, this perpetual incessant discontent with the way that things are, with what's happening right now. You can feel the experience of generosity or offering, giving, however you want to talk about it, as a freedom from that. It's actually in the moment when that is in our hearts and especially when we are acting out of it, there is a freedom from suffering. Whether it's giving a gift of great value or maybe just holding the door for somebody or a gesture, those little moments where you go, there is somebody else in my world and reach out and do something for somebody else, deferring to another's needs, giving time, giving of our time and our energy. This gesture and experience of giving in this way is very soft. It's cushy. It's light and a very happy state of being. It also is a great antidote for that contracted energy of hatred so that in the act of giving we're free of that other form of self-absorption, the wish to push things away because they aren't going the way that we want. Also very free of the experience of delusion. The primary delusion that we talk about in the Buddhist teaching is this sense of security, this sense of having things the way that we want them to be, a self-absorption that is always expecting things to be the way that I want them to be. These delusions, you can see, when you understand generosity, the more that we understand it, they can't hold a seat alongside of it. In the act of giving we're momentarily concerned for another. This whole ignorance and delusion of self-view, of me being the center of my universe, is gone as well. The invitation with this teaching is really to reflect on the quality of generosity. I like to look for it first. I really like to invite people to look for it in your life. I think that because we're so heady, so caught up in the way that we think about what we're doing, the way that we think about experience, that we're actually more often than not missing the experience itself. Even in the act of giving, you can be thinking about giving and not actually connecting with what it feels like. That's the objective. That's what we want to do. The idea here is just to begin to tune into it, to look for those moments. I think you'll be surprised to find how kind you are, how generous, and how much this energy is alive in your daily lives. You have to slow things down a little bit to do that and look a little bit more closely and just begin to create a habit of noticing more precisely just exactly what it is that you're experiencing. There are many times throughout the day that just in ordinary occurrences you'll begin to notice it. Particularly like if you have children, we get caught in the duties of life and the responsibilities of life. That's a concept. That's an idea. That's a notion. Even in the moments when we're yet again caring for the needs of another person, we can be in this head trip about responsibility or duty or off thinking about other things and not really tuning in to the fact that, my goodness, I'm dedicating my life to this person. I'm doing so much for this person. I had a good example of this not so long ago when we were in a circle asking my teacher, Ajahn Sichito, a lot of questions. One fellow was asking about, he was actually asking this from a different angle, he was asking how do I, his work becomes rote. His work is not, it was okay, it's not a bad job but it wasn't all that inspiring and yet he had to keep doing it. He wanted to know if Ajahn had any thoughts on how he could keep his energy happier and lighter while he was on a job. So Ajahn just asked him simply, why are you working? He said, well I've got kids and I want to be able to provide for them. I want them to go to college. I don't want them to worry, like I had to worry about money and be paying off school loans 10, 20 years after school's out. I want to be able to do that for them. So Ajahn said, well that's beautiful. Tune in to that. What about tuning in to that? And when I talked to this fellow later on, he said, oh it just had an incredible effect on him because he realized that he would get to work and then just, you know, you get in a driven mode. We're not even paying attention. We're not really present to what we're doing. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. And so that's why we're doing it. Just because we get, he's in his head about what he doesn't like and what's not going right and getting it done and getting over with it. You know, getting through the day. All of that stuff. I'm sure you can overlay. You know, we do this. So just to notice in those moments of giving or connecting with the reason, the intention of generosity in the heart, how there's such happiness. You smile. Makes us very happy. Yeah, I get, I experience a lot of this, as I'm sure a lot of you do, when you're connected with the monastic community. And it's so fascinating to me, a constant source of study, how and why it is that the Buddha set up this relationship of lay monastic in the way that he did. You know, because we're in relationship with them that is constantly calling forth a giving, a generosity. You know, let me do this for you. Let me support you. And I have to say for myself, some of the happiest times in my life have been when I've been offering a meal. You know, it's somehow, it's actually taking off. It was just noticing that when serving the monastics initially. Now I'm beginning to notice it all the time. You know, just fixing a sandwich for somebody, you know. Just that spirit of, oh, here, let me give this to you. You know, the, the, the, the, the, I think it's interesting to me. You know, the, the, the Buddha's wisdom comes through it just, it's, it's a ideal form of relationship for us to cultivate this quality in our hearts, or even not so much to cultivate it, but to actually see it. It's there already, you know, just to see it come forth. And some of the happiest times, as I said, have been when, especially when I was one on one with them, I have had a few occasions to support one monk, one nun for a period of retreat or something like that. And to be so focused on, you know, taking care of their needs for that period of time. Beautiful. You know, beginning to see the goodness in my own heart. One of the things that I've often noticed, especially on retreat, is that, you know, somewhere in about the third or fourth day of even a nine day retreat, or especially longer retreats, you start to, like every time you go to your cushion, you get a little, you have a little Hershey kiss or some eminence or something like that. These gifts start to appear, either at people's doors or on people's cushions, you know. And it just seems to be that you can't keep this innate quality down. You know, once you get still, once you get quiet, it's very, it's because very apparent, it arises quite organically. The teachers are always saying, now don't do this kind of stuff, you know, it's like, you know, just stay focused, you know, that's a distraction. But you can, you know, you can't keep it down. It's like this new economy begins to develop in retreat. It's an economy of giving. And I remember talking to somebody one time, and she said that it wasn't so much the receiving that would make me happy when I would see a Hershey kiss on my zaphu, you know, but it would be the realization that, oh, now I have something to give, you know, because often, we didn't, we wouldn't even need these things, you know, it'd be just to turn it around and say, oh, I'm not going to do this. It's just to turn it around and be able to give it to someone else. So just tuning into these things, I think we, as I said, I think we miss a lot of this. Giving is primary. And I would go so far as to say it's innate. It's almost instinctive. It is instinctive. And it can be purified. It can get purer and purer. I think, you know, in the Buddhist teachings, we say that, you know, that our actual, our nature, our true nature is good and kind and generous and compassionate. But it's just that it's clouded over by self absorbed thinking. And that the habit, it's so interesting to watch this meditators, isn't it? It's like the habit, you begin to see that the habit of mind is to attend to the overlays, attend to what comes in and has something to say about these more innate or instinctive things, or the just a simple ignoring of them. And so a lot of practice, I think, is just tuning in more clearly and more fully to the, to the fact of what's already there and kind of, you know, fanning the flame of it a little bit. The whole idea is to get unobstructed. You know, these are obstructions, defilements, overlays. They're in the way. And they don't make us happy. And yet our tendency is to attend to all this kind of self absorbed thinking. The effort is instead to get to the heart of the matter, get to the goodness and the kindness and the generosity that's underneath it all. So just one more word on that. I think it's important when you notice this in yourselves to linger with it a little bit. You're just to feel it. Can you feel that? And there's a, there can be a little bit of a rub there. We think, well, you know, I'm not supposed to do that. That's conceited, you know, or something like that. Like it's, you know, I'm not supposed to actually think of myself as a good and kind person. But we're not talking about thinking of yourself as a good and kind person. We're talking about experiencing the fact that you are. It's very different. The Buddhist teachings are trying to get us to direct experience. You know, not to heady stuff, but to the actual reality of what arises and what it feels like, what the experience of that is. So, I mean, this stuff, generosity, it's a, phew. It's goose bump material, you know. It feels very, very good. So to tune into it and to feel it and don't be afraid to actually linger with it for a moment and investigate it, examine it. What is this? Wow, what is this? Ooh, this feels like this. It feels like that, that kind of thing. So there's also this effort to actively cultivate it. Once we begin to see it, to actively cultivate it in the heart. And there's a lot of different ways we do it. Lots of it's just tuning into seeing what it feels like. And that experience right there starts to move us in the direction of more of it because it's very nice. And there's a leaning. You know, the heart leans towards things that are so pleasant. And so it's actually using the experience of pleasure and even displeasure when we're not being that way to facilitate the growth in the heart. Can you feel that? It's like you feel, oh, this is nice. I think I'll do this. No, this doesn't feel good. No, I think I'll avoid that. You know, and it's actually happening at sort of an unconscious level, but that's how it plays out. So what the teachings tell us to notice the motives and notice the impulse to give and notice the motives and the reasons for giving, to bring those into our conscious awareness more. And there's this whole litany of reasons for giving that are offered in the canon. And I thought it'd be interesting to go through this because you can see their value as a reflective tool. Sometimes he said, we give with annoyance. It's like we're irritated. I think it's important to say too that all of this is in the definition of giving. So even giving with these less, less pure heart is still giving. So it's not not to have any judgment about what we see, but just to kind of tune in and see what are the qualities of heart that are going on at the same time. So sometimes it's like with annoyance, you know, it's like, take it, you know, that kind of thing. And yet we're saying, take it. Yeah, okay, it's yours. You know, there is this quality of giving in moments like that. Sometimes we give out of a sense of fear or shame. And I know I've seen this in my own heart. One time when I was on a retreat in another branch of Buddhism and I didn't, I didn't like the way that they were dealing with the offering of money, you know, there was, we were all given an envelope and told to go up to the teacher and bow. And give the offering. It was all very public and, you know, it being a hardcore Theravada, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Besides the fact that we had already, supposedly our registration fee had included the generosity, the dhana. So I remember feeling very annoyed by this and irritated. I didn't, I didn't like the whole feeling of the nature which it was being handled. And yet, you know, I did it, you know, because everybody else was doing it, that kind of feeling. And I was ashamed. I would have been ashamed. I even had the thought of going up there with the envelope with nothing in it, you know. That's a way to have it both ways, you know. Let everybody think I'm generous, but I can, you know, keep, hold on to my heart the way it was feeling. So just, you know, that sense of being pushed or motivated by fear for what might happen to you or shame, you know. Lots, what's very common, I think, in our culture is sort of giving in return for a favor. You know, like, you have me to dinner, I have you to dinner. That kind of thing. You did something for me, so I do something for you. And it's still giving. You know, it's quite possible somebody could keep giving to us endlessly and that wish to return that might never arise. So we want to take that into the heart and realize it's still a very good thing. But I think, you know, you can see, the idea is to see how that feels, you know. And I think some of the giving we do at centers and things like that can be like that. Even the giving to teachers. I know I've done that. It feels like, oh yeah, thank you. It feels like payment. And the idea is to mature out of that kind of giving. We can give with a hope of getting, you know, that sense of scratching my back and scratching yours. And sometimes, this one I thought was interesting, is that sometimes our views and our ideas come into play. And we give because we think it's a good idea. So this is an interesting one to watch. Because obviously that can motivate us. Oh, that's a good idea. Let me do it. But then I think it's also saying, tune in and see where that experience lives. You know, it's very much here. You know, it's not being, and it's not actually being internalized. It's not kind of being given the opportunity to rise up from deep within us and come forth. I'll give you a good example of this. I saw myself do recently where I was out to lunch with a number of people and I was visiting some friends in North Carolina. And in the South, they have this fabulous dessert called peanut butter pie. I don't know if you've ever had it with this really great stuff. And so one of the gals and I ordered a piece and decided to split it. And so she had her half and I had my half. And then she took her half and passed it around the table so that everybody could have a bite, you know. And then by the time it came back to her, she didn't have any left. So I looked at that and I went, oh my goodness, you gave yours all away. You don't have any. Would you like some of mine? And I'm watching myself with this dish with the peanut butter pie on it. It's always like I was going, would you like some of mine? It's like the idea, I really like the idea of giving it to her, but everything in my body language was telling me, you know, no, you know, hold on to it for myself. So you could see the difference between it being an idea and the actual experience of it. These two are quite common in lots of religious institutions and communities. Giving to gain a good reputation and giving to gain heaven in the afterlife. I know I certainly saw a lot of this myself in my youth as a Catholic. There was actually occasions on the big days of collection that they publicized. They ran a list of who gave and how much they gave, you know. It's very interesting. As a motivator, you want to be high enough on that list so that people think good of you, you know, or so that you think good of yourself, you know. It's an interesting practice. Even the idea of gaining heaven after death, Ajahn Chah speaks a lot about this because the merit system in Thailand is so much a part of their culture. There's so much of their giving to the monastic community so that they'll gain a happy rebirth, you know. He talks a lot about this in a way so as to invite people to purify their motivation in that, you know, not to put it down because giving is good, but to realize the nature of that, what they're doing. Giving out of altruism ranks high, ranks very high on the list because the intention is to serve the needs of other people. But even this, it's said, can have a quality of, it can be contaminated by our ideas about what's right and good, you know, and not really being pure and unattached, you know, so that one needs to know that. And that's what I've noticed and endeavor to purify even this quality. But the highest, the highest on the list, and this has become a major part of my practice just to begin to get a sense of what's being said here. The highest purpose for cultivating generosity is to beautify one's own mind, to purify and beautify one's own mind. You know, there's a wonderful story in the canon where there's a woman who was a great benefactor at the time of the Buddha and she wanted to give enough cloth to make robes for 500 of their monastics. And, you know, she asked the Buddha and it's his characteristic style. He didn't answer the first time, he didn't answer the second time, and she asks again the third time, and he says, well, tell me, Risaka, why do you want to do this? Why do you want to give this? And she says, well, when I give it, then the robes will be made and I'll be seeing the monastics come into town on alms round and I'll recognize the cloth that I gave that's been made into their robes. And when I see that, it'll make my heart very happy. I'll feel really good. And out of that joy, I will develop a concentrated mind. My mind will be very focused and one-pointed. And at that point, the Buddha says, yeah, okay, you can give. That's a good reason, you know. Really bringing home the point that, and I think what one's saying here, just contemplate that, reflect on what's being said, that that quality of offering, making the heart happy and focusing and purifying, clarifying the mind is like, it's just what I was saying earlier, where greed and hatred and delusion can't coexist with that. So what happens is that that impulse in the mind to constantly be going off to other things, especially things that are associated with I, me and mine is not happening. So what is a mind that isn't doing that like? Very beautiful, very beautiful state. So this is the most excellent motive for giving, to purify the mind. So the other, it said that the other forms, all of the other forms, contain some kind of intention that has to do with either material gain or being comfortable in our own lives or feeling better about ourselves. You can feel it, can't you? It's all this self-absorbed thinking. So we want to see that true generosity, through this process of just kind of observing what's going on in your heart, you begin to see that it's a complex teaching. And it may not be as easy as it appears at first. It's a matter of tuning in, and this is where the meditation practice can be so helpful because you know how in the training, in the meditation practice where we're saying, notice when you're not here. And don't have an opinion about that. Don't judge yourself, don't criticize, don't be annoyed, gone again, that kind of thing. But just to notice that you're back and fan the flame of that. Be present, be present. And so that what's happening through the meditation practice is a very precise training that's helping us to recognize when we're caught up attending to distortions and what it's like to be back. And to actively train the mind to keep coming back when it's off. So it's the same practice that is being applied in cultivating generosity. You begin to notice what it's like to be caught in self-absorption. It's so painful. And what it's like to be caught and be established in a state that doesn't have that. And the heart begins to incline gradually over time. So it's said to, what also can be very helpful is to try to tune into the impulse, just that impulse to give. Because lots of times it doesn't get beyond that. The impulse will be there, but the tendencies to change that in some way, to alter that through thoughts of me or mine, will come into play very, very quickly, don't they? It's like, how many times have you thought, well, let me do this, oh, no. Well, okay, well, nah. It just comes in like this. And so the idea is to try to get more precise even in your awareness of that impulse. Be aware of that movement of the heart that wants to do that. I did this game one time with some friends of mine that was very, very helpful, just for this kind of training. I invited, there was seven women and myself, and I invited them over for a little get together. And it was going to be on a Friday night, and I think I called them on a Monday or Tuesday or something like that. And I said, okay, so here's what it's about. If you can get behind this, this is my idea. Think about something that is very precious to you, that you really love. And then come to the party on Friday night and be prepared to say why it's so precious to you. Be prepared to tell the rest of us why it's so precious. And then we're going to draw names and you're going to give it away. And that was the exercise, would you like to do it? And they said, yeah, okay, that sounds good. And actually all initially thinking about Friday, oh, that'll be fun. But then every single one of us reporting on what happened in those intervening days. In that moment when we knew what the item was, we all knew it like this, what's a precious item? And yet what went on in the heart, the battle that took place in the next few days about whether or not to give that away, and what would go on. Just like one gal said, well, they don't mean something. It's not valuable. She doesn't mean something that's not valuable. It should be something expensive. But really it was the thing that she went to wasn't valuable, but it had a lot of sentimental value. So she didn't want to give it up. And then another gal was saying, well, nobody will know. Nobody will know that I didn't actually give the thing that... I thought of first, you know. It made me think of Ajahn Chah. That's the one point he keeps pointing to. He says, you know, you know. So that's the point, the point in purification of the heart. So implicit in this is the encouragement to follow through on tuning, when you tune into this impulse. You know, just noticing that planning to give but not actually giving, or giving and then regretting it afterwards, that kind of activity. Very famous quote from the Buddha where he said that whenever the... We should give whenever the impulse to give arises and not change the course of our actions. That's pretty powerful stuff, you know. Not change the course of our actions. And he went on to say that, you know, if we noticed that, if we knew how important it was, how valuable it was in our spiritual development, that we wouldn't let a single meal go by without offering something to someone. So the methodology here, just as it is with morality or developing good conduct, you know, the methodology the Buddha gives is very simple. He says, tune in before, during and after the act. Before, so that you're tuning into that impulse and getting a sense of what's going on there and learn from that. It's a practice. There's not any right impulse. It's noticing what is the impulse and what it feels like going from there. And during, noticing what's happening as you're doing it and how it feels when you've done it. That's the main methodology for getting the value of this into our hearts. There's a lot to be said about it. I learned a lot about that, particularly when I'm at the monastery and we're just offering meals, you know. There's a lot goes on in that practice. Any of you who have ever prepared a meal together, you know, just the changes of heart, the incredible states of mind that one can get into in that process. Certainly we can see ourselves wanting to kill each other during the course of cutting carrots and things like that, you know. Just over the right way to do it, you know. So you have a lot of that. But I've also noticed just the sort of subtle attachments to the things that I've prepared and the wanting. There's a, it takes a certain development that certainly one works with in practice to just, you know, just offer it and let it go. Let it be there and not be constantly watching to see if they're taking your dish, you know. If that's the one, if that's the one that certainly there's a wish to make people happy and that's driving that. But you can see that what else is contaminating it, right? You know, it's very, very, very interesting practice. You know, one time I carried a whole bunch of ingredients even from the United States to the monastery to England. I like to cook muffins and they don't have the proper muffin tins and everything there. So I brought all this paraphernalia with me to cook muffins for the monks and nuns and that day that I did, I was just so happy to be doing it, which was lovely and great. But what often happens at the monastery is right at the last minute, just when you're getting ready to put the food on the table, 16 cars will drive up, you know. And they'll all have food. And so your plate, which was going to be the centerpiece, you know, it was going to be the main dish. All of a sudden it gets, you know, it's way in the back and dwarfed in the presence of all this other food. And at the end of the meal, you might notice that nobody even took any of it. You know, it could actually get put on a refrigerator top somewhere or something and totally get lost, you know, in the process of all this giving. And what happens to your heart in that, you know? It's powerful, powerful. Keep it clean and keep it pure. So just in closing, reflecting for a moment on the, it's very important to see the spiritual significance of this quality of generosity. You know, he said that it's not a mere moral virtue to be practiced, just out of some sense of what I think is right. It's so much more than that. It's not an obligation, like in tithing, like in giving to the Dhamma Center, giving to teachers. It shouldn't be held as an obligation. But rather to, you know, any of that kind of giving just diminishes it. It makes it mechanical, doesn't it? It's just, oh, here, that's what I do now, you know. But actually to contemplate and to think about it as one of the primary activities and experiences that we have to overcome self-absorbed tendencies in the heart. To see and to overcome self-absorbed tendencies in the heart. Training the mind to be pure. See it as a means to recondition the mind, to train the mind to be more pure. And also it's very linked with compassion, as a means of expressing compassionate concern for the welfare of other people. So just some thoughts. I hope these will be helpful for you in your own practice, contemplating this very, very valuable state of heart and see how it develops for you. Does anybody have a few questions or comments? It's a good one, isn't it? Yeah. It's important to remember when practicing generosity, the Buddha talked about generosity starts with oneself, being kind to oneself, taking care of oneself, physical generosity. Yes, lovely. Just liking it also. Lovely. Yeah, thank you. One of the issues that I struggled with is being asked for something by someone who I sort of don't think doesn't deserve it. And working with them. Can you say anything about that? It's a good one, isn't it? Yeah. There's a reflection that has to do with recollecting the value that it would have for the person, instead of, you know, like to contemplate, to focus on the fact of what this offering would be for them, to support them. And to just bring that more fully into the heart in the moment like that. Because it's like everything, all of the less wholesome or less skillful mind states are coming center stage and taking over. And so much of practice is about what it is that we attend to. And we don't, I think it takes a pretty mature practice to realize that it's just a matter of attending. It's not me. It's a matter of where my attention lands and the habit of it attending in less than skillful places. So that a lot of it is just literally, a lot of the restraint and the pulling back in practice is designed to interrupt that habitual response. So that, and one of the things that you do is turn the attention someplace else. So turn it towards something that is more skillful in relation to that very act. Do you know what I'm saying? I guess what's confusing is like I'm not really sure that the effect of it would be a positive effect. Like they're asking me for something, I think something specifically, and I'm not sure by giving it to them, you know, I mean they'd be really happy for a moment, but it would kind of might, maybe also supporting something that isn't really good. Right, okay, well that's different. And then, well, that's where I'm sort of stuck. If I can you for sure, then I would, you know. Right, right. And doubt's an interesting one, the confusion that comes in in moments like that. You know, I find that, I've actually made a practice to not be driven to perform the act necessarily. That it might be the case that this is the voice of wisdom speaking, and you don't know that. And the confusion can be really based in a genuine confusion about not knowing what is the best thing to do. You know, like, you know, people say they experience this a lot, like say giving to people on the street, you know, who they think are going to use it to drink or, you know, take drugs or something. So what do you do in that case? It might not necessarily be helpful. You might not actually be offering. So that in that moment, I think it's fine to just say that I don't know I'm not going to and be with what it feels like not to, and to learn through that. And then on another occasion, maybe if the heart is feeling a little bit different, say, I don't know what I'm going to, and I want to see how that feels. And learn through the direct experience of both. Because I think what tangles us up in knots and moments like that is we're trying to do the right thing. And there isn't a right thing. There's only what's coming up in your heart in that moment, you know. So like that, not to get caught in the tangle of being correct, doing the right thing, but just noticing what you are doing and how it feels. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. One more. Yeah. Can you comment on giving versus giving in, and the feeling that you can have that giving, not necessarily the monetary or physical thing, but giving in to an idea, for example. You think your position is the right position. And I think that one form of giving is to be generous and say, I'll relinquish this position. But then, you know, in our workaday world, there's competition, there's people going after your position, your color, your influence, this and that. In the sense that to give in to something like that is, well, generous, but you're actually going to be perceived as being weakness. And sort of diminish your own position. Yeah, it could be perceived as weakness, but I think that's such an interesting statement on our culture, you know, that that would be weak and surrender kindness. Creating a sense of spaciousness would, you know, would not be desirable quality. I found that in those, in lots of situations where there, I may think that the cultural more is the one that's going to be perceived the best and that I should follow that. That actually, when I've had the courage to go with my heart and to be clear on what's going on in my heart, I've been amazed at the feedback. And the fact that, and it's actually encouraged me with regard to human nature, you know, that people, when they see kindness, when they see surrender, when they see generosity, when they see somebody backing off in the interest of not going to war over something, you know. That the right people, the people that you want in your life anyway value that. You know, so it takes, I think, lots of things going on with practice, we're actually taking on the culture and taking on our own belief in cultural values and tweaking them. Because I would venture to say that you don't believe that anyway. You want to go with the surrender. You want to, you know, that there's a part of you that is in conflict because it seems like the culture is demanding you to behave a certain way that you think is off. There wouldn't be a rub if you didn't think, if somewhere in your heart you didn't think it was off, you know. It's interesting, huh? Yeah. So, dare. You know, it's a lot more adventuresome life anyway. So, thank you. If anyone else has some questions, I'll be glad to stay for a little while. Thank you.
