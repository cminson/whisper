Thanks for that correction.
So, actually, maybe you could turn my mic down a little bit.
That's a little reverberate. That's good. Okay, great. Thanks.
And just for those of you sitting in chairs in the social hall, there are plenty of chairs in here.
If you're comfortable there, you're welcome to stay, but there's also plenty of chairs in here
if you'd like to come in into the main room.
And I'm going to make an announcement right now, so there's a little time for you to filter in.
I just wanted to mention that in the first week of August, I'm going to be offering a non-residential
daily life practice retreat. Usually we don't announce things until a week out,
but sometimes with something like this, it's helpful to know about it in advance.
And so I just thought I'd say a couple words about that and what it's like and what it's about.
It's a week-long non-residential retreat where the emphasis is on mindfulness in your daily lives.
And so the retreat is structured not to be a retreat from your day,
but to support an integration of the mindfulness practice right into your day.
And so we start with a half-day on Sunday afternoon here from I think it's 1 to 4.30.
And I'll give instructions about working with mindfulness in daily life during the week.
And then during the week, every morning and every evening, I'll be here, 7.30 to 9.00 a.m., 7.30 to 9.00 p.m.
to basically facilitate a group discussion about what you're practicing with in daily life
and how that's working for you. It's not required to attend every day or every time,
although some people who have attended it in that way have really talked about the support that it gives
to practice morning and evening, kind of bracketing the day with the mindfulness discussion really.
Monday and Thursday evenings are, as usual, with the Dharma talk.
I'll be here giving the Dharma talk on those evenings.
And then on Saturday at the end of the week, there'll be another day long to kind of cement some of what we've learned in the practice.
And so that's available. It's the first week of August, and I believe there's already flyers out there for it.
If not, they'll be out in the next few days.
And so if that's of interest to you, you might just look at your schedule and see if there's a way to work some of it in.
I do ask if you attend during the week, if you want to attend in the mornings and evenings during that week,
that you attend on Sunday afternoon, because that's where I give the instructions for how to work,
and that's how we kind of create a shared practice community in that Sunday afternoon session.
And so that's the piece to block off in your calendar if you're interested in the non-residential retreat that week.
Is it already recording?
In our being alive as human beings, we meet so many different experiences.
Some are joyful, happy experiences. Children, grandchildren are born, and there's a lot of joy and excitement and happiness in the arrival of new beings.
And sometimes the arrival of those new beings is joined with sadness as there's a still birth or illness that's detected in the child.
And so happiness turns to sadness.
There's illness and aging in our friends, our loved ones, death, jobs that are acquired and lost.
And we go through this flow of our lives so much with our habitual way of going through the many, many things that happen in the world.
And even reading the newspaper, you read the newspaper and you really get a sense of just how much struggling and suffering there is in the world,
how much the conditions in the world are painful in so many areas of the world.
We're quite fortunate here to not have war right at our doorstep.
We're fortunate not to have too much in the way of famine here at our doorstep.
So we have some fortune here and yet, you know, just a glance at the newspapers really shows just how much struggling goes on as a human being.
And the Buddha looked out at the world. He saw this similar kind of thing in his day 2600 years ago.
And asked the question, is it possible to be free from suffering? Is it possible?
And the Buddha went off on his journey searching for the answer to that question.
And what he discovered and taught for us is that not possible to be free from aging, illness, death, impermanence,
being with what one likes is generally considered happiness, being separated from what one likes.
These things happen. And yet what he recognized in his own heart and mind is that peace is possible in the midst of all of this change,
in the midst of all of this chaos, in the midst of all of this confusion,
in the midst of all this separation, loss, it's possible to be peaceful.
And that his recognition of that peace comes from basically exploring and recognizing that it's our relationship to the situations in life.
That keeps peace hidden from us, that keeps peace distant from us.
That we typically react to loss with aversion.
We typically react to having something with trying to hold onto it and perhaps a fear of loss of it even as we acquire it.
This is our typical response to our lives or confusion where we're kind of checked out and not really meeting the world.
One of the habitual responses at least in my mind before I really met the practice was like,
if I don't pay attention to it, it's not going to hurt me. It's like it's not there. I can ignore it.
And that's also a form of reactivity to not really being willing to recognize this is the way it is.
It's not a mistake that people are born and people die. It's the way it is.
And the Buddha talked about, there's a term in the Pali that I like, it's yatabhuta.
It means things as they are.
And one of the insights that we open to as we begin to practice and explore our experience here and now is this insight into things as they are.
A non-reactivity to things as they are.
Other translations for this term, yatabhuta, very subtle versions of the translation I've seen.
Things as they actually are. Things as they have come to be.
And so around this things as they have come to be, things as they are,
the exploration is to what the Buddha discovered in his own heart and mind is when there is not reactivity,
when there's not greed, not aversion, not delusion around what is actually happening, then the mind is at peace.
The mind is at ease. Non-greed, non-aversion, non-delusion to what actually is the mind is at peace.
A way that we sometimes frame this, a word, two words that we sometimes use.
Accepting things as they are or allowing things as they are.
A different framing of the word non-reactivity, acceptance or allowing.
And those words can be especially acceptance sometimes.
We think with the word acceptance somehow, at least the way I first met that word.
It's like, well, things as they are. And if it's something that's not just quite the way I want it to be,
to me what acceptance meant is like, I have to figure out a way to like it.
I have to figure out a way to kind of convert my dislike of things as they are into liking of things as they are.
And this is the terrain I'd like to explore today because what acceptance is and allowing gives us a better sense of it.
Allowing something we can recognize perhaps that we don't have to like it in order to allow it.
And so I'd like to explore this terrain and this distinction between these two words I think can help us to look at
what allowing means, what non-reactivity means and our habits really around when we meet things as they are.
Our habits of reactivity and what we bring with the agenda when we start to practice, oh, I'm supposed to not be reactive.
That means I'm supposed to be, I'm supposed to like this or something. We bring a kind of a misunderstanding of what the meaning of non-reactivity is.
So allowing or acceptance or non-reactivity, meeting things as they are, meeting things as they have come to be.
This is kind of a way of aligning with truth what is actually happening right now.
It's like what has come to be is what is happening now. It's already happening.
There's already this experience happening in the mind and body.
It's essentially at this point resistance is futile. It already is.
And so the alignment, the acceptance, the allowing is kind of about non-delusion, about willingness to meet this.
What's already here without that kind of pushing away or holding on to.
From the place of non-delusion, of wisdom, we can be non-reactive to this.
What's happening in this split second and yet another misinterpretation I think that we have around acceptance, allowing,
means that, well, we hear non-reactivity, you know, so I'm not supposed to react to this.
But so much of the way we do live our lives is through reactivity.
And it's almost like we cannot conceive of what it might mean to not react to something that we don't like.
And if we are not reactive, then that means we do nothing.
So that's our typical exploration around reactivity to things that are unpleasant.
If we're not reactive, that means we don't do anything.
Well, wisdom also acts. Compassion also acts.
At this point, I will hopefully out of compassion, not reaction, check in and see, does somebody have a hearing-assisted device, an ear?
Is it somebody who has a hearing aid that's maybe buzzing?
If you have a hearing aid on, you just might check and see. There's a very high-pitched tone in here.
So I don't know where it's coming from, but...
Sometimes low batteries or...
Yeah. Okay, it stopped. Great.
So out of compassion for us all. Thank you.
So that's kind of an example in a way of saying, okay, it's an unpleasant situation, but to try not to be reactive about it.
And yet we do act. Non-reactivity doesn't mean non-action.
This is also part of our exploration. What does it mean to act out of compassion, out of wisdom?
And the best place we can find that distinction between acting out of reactivity and acting out of compassion and wisdom
is when we can meet what is already here, what has already come to be in this moment, what has already come to be,
if we can meet this without contraction or fear or aversion or holding or gripping,
if that's possible, then wisdom can understand how to navigate, how to take the next step.
Another example around acting with wisdom or compassion.
If you're watching children play, sometimes children can get very excited and start running in ways or in places where they're headed into danger.
And in that situation, being with things as they are doesn't mean, oh, things as they are.
Child running into the road, knowing child running into the road.
It means taking action out of compassion for and out of the sense, the danger of that direction that the child is headed.
So that compassion and wisdom can take action.
We, I think, have this, it's hard for us to understand this distinction about action and action out of habit, out of reactivity,
versus action out of wisdom.
I was listening yesterday afternoon to a little section of this American life, if any of you heard this yesterday.
And the little section was a description of two women who had taken a bike ride across the country.
They had very different personalities, very different ways of meeting situations.
And they met a couple of different situations in which things weren't going the way they wanted them to go.
And one of the women, her response was generally, just be quiet, you know, basically things will be okay.
And basically non-action was her mode of being.
The other woman had the mode of being of, no, we need to fix this.
We need to, you know, and she would go off and yell at the people that were not doing things the way she wanted them to do.
And she'd get really forceful.
And at the end of the segment, and I won't go into the whole details of what went on, it's quite an interesting story.
Some of you might, you know, it's there available on the internet so you could listen to this story.
But at some point there was a, so there were two particular incidents.
One incident, the woman who did nothing felt completely embarrassed.
And like, you know, the person she was traveling across with, she said,
I thought I was like with a crazy person because she was so reactive to the situation.
And then in another situation, the similar kind of thing, only the, you know, the woman who's non-reactive is just basically,
it's kind of, it seems like a maybe possibly subtly dangerous situation.
And the woman who's non-reactive basically is kind of like, maybe if we don't say anything, it's not going to get worse.
You know, and the other woman just kind of jumps in and it's like, you know,
she possibly put herself into some danger but actually she ended up diffusing the situation.
And the woman who was the non-doer said she kind of had a conversion experience
and said, you know, I just don't know how to stand up for myself.
I don't know how to, you know, take charge and your way is way better.
And that woman is saying, you know, my way is not way better.
You know, I end up alienating my friends.
Your way, your way keeps relationships.
My way breaks relationships.
And the moderator Ira Glass says, well, which way is better?
And they both said, I don't know.
You know, this is our dilemma in our usual way of approaching experience.
We either think it's non-action or action out of that reactivity.
The Buddha says there's a middle way.
I almost feel like writing a letter to Ira Glass, you know.
Because, you know, it ended with this dilemma and no kind of pointing to a middle way.
I mean, I actually had to turn it off.
I think the segment ended.
Somebody might have listened later.
It was ultimately confusing.
This place where there's like a retreat center with no host.
And they're with a man and a woman.
The man is sort of like, alternatively religious and then accepting.
And then the woman who's reacted, like, had a encounter with this guy.
At that point, I couldn't even figure out what was going on.
Yeah, and that was so interesting to see, you know, that they basically thought it's these two choices.
You know, that was the outcome.
It's like, well, there's these two choices.
And it's like, there's actually another choice.
And that's action with compassion.
Not action from reactivity.
So this is a challenge for us because habitually we act out of reactivity.
And actually a lot of what we react to.
We don't actually need to act on, you know, a lot of what's going on out there.
You know, we react to things and it's like, you know, it doesn't really, it's not really that important for us to act on many, many things.
And so choosing our actions wisely and acting from wisdom, from compassion, from kindness, from generosity, from wholesome movements.
And so in this terrain of accepting, allowing what is one of the challenges.
I mean, so far I've been talking kind of about the ideal of the possibility, you know, expressing, exploring the possibility to be non-reactive.
Putting it out there that that's possible.
Sometimes just hearing about the possibility, hearing about an alternate course can shift our relationship to the world and alter maybe how we choose to act.
And yet what we find often is when some things are rising that's unpleasant, we don't like it.
We don't want it, we resist it.
And so the resistance then, the not liking then, is actually part of what is.
And that too then needs to be open to.
Something I've seen in my own practice quite a bit, and I mentioned this a minute ago, a little while ago about how we sometimes feel like around with the word acceptance.
We feel like we have to convert something that we don't like.
You know, if something's unpleasant is happening, we're feeling, you know, non-acceptance.
We feel like, well, in order to accept it, I have to convince myself that I like it, that it's okay that it's happening.
And so it's like we from that place of resistance try to do something, use energy to convert our opinion to something else.
And I'd like to explore another middle way here, which is rather than trying to convert that opinion.
Can you recognize, okay, there's a situation and there's resistance.
We somehow seem to think that accepting things as they are means that we have to get rid of resistance.
Sometimes accepting things as they are means accepting, opening to, non-reactivity to resistance.
And paradoxically, you know, what's usually happening there is if something's happening, we see the something, some unpleasant thing, an argument or something going on.
We see something unpleasant.
We resist it and then through our practice lens, we think I'm supposed to accept things as they are, meaning I'm supposed to accept the situation here somehow.
But the resistance, that's somehow like not in the picture.
And so opening to that resistance kind of takes it from being behind the scenes, takes it from being, you know, somehow we somehow believe with resistance.
Like we either have to fight through that resistance, perhaps there's something that needs to be done.
You know, we either have to fight through that resistance in order to do the thing that we're resisting, or we have to convert that resistance into wanting to do the thing that we're resisting.
I'll say that again, just because.
And I'll give it what's an example, a real life example from my own practice.
This is something I've been exploring in particular this past week.
I go to the gym about three times a week.
I've been exploring my resistance to going to the gym for a long time.
And this week I kind of saw a couple things, a couple interesting things about that resistance.
And, you know, initially one of the things I was playing with in things like I would, I would notice the resistance and it's like, okay, you know, I need to go to the gym.
This is for the health.
And so some part of my mind knew that going to the gym is a good thing to do.
And so it's like, okay, we'll go to the gym.
And yet there's the resistance.
And initially in the exploration is kind of like feeling like, okay, it's like, like there's that resistance and I have to like push through that resistance.
The resistance is there.
I wasn't trying to convert it to wanting to go to the gym.
I knew better than that.
But, you know, it's kind of like, well, there's that resistance is like, you know, we're going to do this.
Forcing through that resistance.
So I knew that, you know, one of the other options might be trying to convince myself, I want to go to the gym.
You know, it will make me feel much better.
And I know that I stay much more flexible and my health is much better.
My cholesterol has come down.
My blood pressure is kind of really good for me to go to the gym.
I like going to the gym.
You know, I like going to the gym.
It really is a good thing.
You know, that's another thing that we would tend to do with resistance.
So often around our something, in this case, something we need to do and a resistance to it, we either think we have to push through the resistance or convert the resistance into wanting.
So that's our usual approach.
And what I have been exploring is the possibility of just knowing I'm going to go to the gym and there's resistance.
Okay, resistance, I see you.
Yeah, I see you don't want to go, but we're going to go.
It's way less energy to relate to resistance in that way.
It's much easier actually to get to the gym fully acknowledging, yeah, I'm going to the gym and I don't want to go to the gym.
It's way, way easier.
It sounds paradoxical, but the acknowledgement of resistance, rather than being, you know, so it's acknowledging it.
It's like putting the resistance into the room, putting the resistance into the field of what we know, rather than letting the resistance subtly be in charge.
So this is one of our, this is a way to explore, you know, when there are things happening that, you know, what's going on in this moment.
And I don't like it.
I don't have to convert that not liking to liking.
So much energy, so much suffering happens around that, either pushing through the resistance and not liking, or trying to convert it into something else.
And the wisdom of things as they are, of meeting things as they are, kind of can begin to also, like begin to tease apart.
Sometimes when we resist things, there's a really good reason for that resistance.
Sometimes when we don't like things, when we're aversive to things, there's a really good reason for that aversion.
We're in a situation, perhaps, where it's like the mind and body recognize this is not a healthy situation.
This is not a good place to be.
And there is the resistance, the aversion to being in a place that's not a healthy place to be.
So when we begin to open to, what's the whole situation?
There is this situation and there's the not liking of it, the aversion to it.
Fully opening to the whole thing begins to help us to see what part of the whole experience that's happening now is this reactivity and what part actually contains a little bit of wisdom.
So the willingness to acknowledge, recognize rather than immediately acting out of our aversion, okay, there's this situation and I don't like it.
Okay, yep, that's happening. Both of those things are happening.
And yeah, this situation, kind of like with the sound earlier.
It was painful on my ears and so it's like, I could see I don't like it.
And yet the, the, the recognition of that is like, it's hard to speak with that.
It's hard for other people to hear with the sound.
And so from that place, speaking and acting, rather than from the place of, gotta get rid of it, gotta get rid of it.
So the opening to things as they are begins to help us to tease apart the reactivity from the, the, the place where, yes, there may need to be action that happens here.
We may need to step forward and we can step forward with compassion, with wisdom, with kindness.
I'll just open it for comments or questions if there's any.
Yeah, and we'll use the mics.
This resonates with me.
I'm not sure it's on. Let's see.
Can you hear it?
Is the light green?
The light's green.
Try again.
Is that working?
Yes.
Okay.
This is very timely because I just took a tour of Mount Rushmore, Yellowstone, Jackson Hole, and it turned out really to be a week of being on the bus where every now and then they let you out.
And I purposely asked before the trip, how much time are we gonna be on the bus?
And they said, oh, not that much.
So I spent the week deciding, going, watching my process, like, oh, I'm just gonna watch these feelings come and go.
But then I thought, well, maybe I should say something.
And the end result was that I got angry at one point.
We're going through Yellowstone.
We were watching, driving by every amazing site.
And I said, you know, we really want to get out and look at these waterfalls.
And they said, oh, well, they made excuses for why we wouldn't stop.
And then I got really mad and I said, you know, this is a bus prison.
And then I felt really bad that I said it.
But as it turns out, I wasn't the only one feeling this way.
So they changed a little bit of the tour and they started letting people get out after that more often.
And then people started commenting, you know, their backs were killing them.
And so, you know, I was sorry that I said it in the way I said it, but I was, in the end, it was good that I listened to my body to say, like, you know, this is really unhealthy.
And I'm sure most people in here, you know.
And this is a really helpful thing to recognize, you know, that you did speak out of anger and, you know, that it had an impact.
And so, you know, sometimes that's one of the things that feeds back to us and gives us the idea of that's the way to get the results.
You know, it's like, you know, it's like people are just not going to listen unless you come at them with this aversive, angry energy.
And, you know, in some cases that might be, you know, a possibility.
And it's possible, I've seen people really skillfully actually, it's very interesting, express something with a kind of a very firm energy, but without aversion.
You know, so there's, it doesn't have to be, oh gee, you know, we're really having trouble here.
It's like, you know, there's a lot of us back here who are really in a lot of pain and we need to get out, can you hear that?
You know, to be very firm, but with the firmness being not from aversion, but from, so sometimes firmness is required.
Sometimes even, you know, at one point, you know, talking about kids in dangerous situations, you know, I was watching my nephew and he was headed towards a very dangerous situation
and I was in a place where I couldn't actively, you know, touch him or stop him.
But the, so I used my voice with a very firm, stop, you know, and it brought him up because of that, you know, the strength.
It was kind of like I felt like I was lassoing him with my voice.
And so sometimes you have to use that kind of strength.
And again, we associate that strength sometimes with the energy of anger, you know, so is it possible to connect that strength with wisdom?
It is actually possible.
And so that's a co-on for us and we won't do it every time.
But look at that distinction, it's like, again, those two women, it's like either it's like say something, yell at somebody out of anger,
or, oh, I'm so sorry, my friend, yell at you, you know, it becomes those two differences as opposed to there's actually some place in the middle.
Thank you for sharing that.
Yeah, Arthur.
Yeah, passing the mic up.
So I've had several times an interesting experience.
Something comes up.
I don't like it.
I know I don't like it.
It's also true.
I feel like I ought to say something about it or do something about it.
And there's this conflict that goes on, which is really interesting to watch and be with.
And then go ahead and respond.
And this has happened a number of times.
In some cases, the response means saying something to somebody.
And I say things in a kind of neutral way, but stated clearly.
They take it as a criticism.
Get very angry.
We can't control the result.
Right, I can't control that, but my next reaction is the really interesting one.
Because sometimes their reaction gets me really angry.
And sometimes I respond.
And if I don't respond, I get just as angry.
I just walk around with it for the rest of the day.
So there's a description.
Yeah, I think it's a pretty common description that we do say something.
And it's kind of like it almost flares worse because it's like, I worked so hard to be so neutral and so low.
And here this person is exploding anyway.
So it kind of like, it might show actually there was just a touch of repression in the first place.
So that's something to notice.
And also just to see the cause and condition.
Anger feeds anger, whether it comes from inside or outside.
So it's a place we have to take care.
It's a place we definitely have to take care.
And when we act on anger, it tends to reinforce the anger.
As in the situation just a few minutes ago, you act on the anger, you get the result you want in the moment.
You get the result you want.
It's like, oh, that works.
And so the similar kind of thing possibly, it's like you express your anger.
And maybe one of the things that happens there is you feel better.
The anger isn't kind of reverberating inside, but you put it out into the world.
And we don't know when those consequences of that anger will come back on us.
We've had an immediate hit of the release of that anger, but we don't know what's going to happen.
How that anger kind of filters out into the world and is then responded to.
And at some point will come back to us.
So the fact that you stay angry for the rest of the day, that's an exploration.
Again, if it's possible to say something with firmness rather than anger,
one possible response would be, I think you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.
My perspective is this.
This is how I tried to say it.
I did not mean it as criticism.
So it could be that kind of approach.
But this is a very common situation, and we wake up where we are.
Things as they have come to be is that anger has arisen after somebody else is angry.
Okay, here it is.
What does it mean to be with this?
What does it mean to be with this without reactivity and without buying into it?
This is our practice.
This is exactly our practice.
We don't get it right the first time, or the second, or the third.
It's a long exploration, and it's a slow process of letting go,
of beginning to understand how that kind of reactivity doesn't ultimately serve us.
That wisdom slowly begins to grow over time, and we need to stop.
Thank you for your attention.
