1 Dharmette:  Right Now , Nothing Needs 
to Happen

To support mindfulness practice  and the Buddhist 
path, one of t he great teachers is simplicity – to think 
of simplicity as teaching us something. So to be 
simple first. To find situations where we can just be 
simple with the circumstances that are happening. 
Simple with the conversations, simple with the activity 
that we ’re doing, simple just being alive . Keep it 
simple , and then see what happens.  
 
It can be very hard to keep things simple. There can 
be a lot of momentum in the mind, a lot of activity in 
the mind about things that need to happen, that 
should happen, that shouldn ’t happ en, important they 
don’t happen. A lot of desires , fears and ambitions can 
operate . And so with that reference point of just being 
simple, you can start seeing all these other voices and 
beliefs in the mind , and start questioning them. It ’s 
sometimes hard to question them if we’re already 
living a complex life and running around doing a lot of 
different things. But rather,  keep it simple.  
 
Simplicity is  also a teacher because it is one of the 
ways that the heart or the mind can come to rest. One 2 of the great goals of any spiri tual life, is the 
experience of being at peace. And peace is something 
which is simple. If it ’s not simple, it ’s not going to be 
peaceful. Even though our life around us might be 
complex, the experience of peacefulness that we can 
have in our hearts and mi nds and bodies  comes with 
simplicity of being . And so one way that simplicity is a 
teacher is it points us back to the possibility of being 
at peace with what is, some inner peace.  
 
There ’s a great practice to ex periment with – it’s not a 
practice to use i n all times and places , but you could 
use it in certain circumstances . Maybe you ’ll know 
when to use it. And that ’s to use the concept or even 
the phrase, the idea, that “Right now nothing has to 
happen. ” Try that.  
 
I once taught this many years ago and said, “For the 
next week find a situation, where you can just be in 
the situation , and approach it as if nothing needs to 
happen. ” There was a  couple in the class . He was a 
photographer and had a very expensive camera, and 
they were somewhere on the cliff s by the beach, 
climbing over rocks . Their child was holding the 
camera , but then it  dropped and broke on the rocks . 
Then  his wife turned to h im and said, “This is the time.  
Nothing needs to happen .” He told me this story with 
great gratitude  because it saved all kinds of difficulties 
and problems in his family life.  
 3 Nothing needs to happen. Try it out in different 
circumstances and see what happens to you. See 
what happens with what  can feel like an addiction  that 
something needs to happen. Or maybe the f eeling is , 
“Yes I know nothing needs to happen,  and that means 
nothing is supposed to happen. Stay away from me. ” 
Maybe it ’s better to say nothing needs to happen 
means nothing needs to happen in any particular way. 
So just allow things to unfold , and see what happens.  
 
You might learn a lot about being at peace with how 
things are. You might learn that, more often than 
people realise, we don ’t have to be in control , or to 
figure out , or fix , or make things fit some idea about 
what we want it to be . The whole dimension of peace 
that is so nourishing and meaningful for the inner life 
belongs much closer to that realm where we ’re not 
trying to fix or make things happen. That n othing 
needs to happen  is a very profound thing.  
 
Also from that perspective  of nothing needs to 
happen, if you ’re relaxed about that , then you might 
be surprised that you find other sources of motivation 
inside of you , rather than the surface motivation s. 
That place in the mind that has judgements and ideas 
and expectations and d esires and aversions, that ’s a 
complicated world . But if the mind is relaxed , you can 
find motiva tions that are deeper than that:  motivations 
of compassion or freedom, which are much deeper 
than the surface of the mind.  
 4 A lot of people don ’t trust the depth of their motivation. 
They ’re afraid that if nothing needs to happen, they ’ll 
be a couch potato. They ’ll just sit there , and nothing 
will happen; they won ’t do anything;  they won ’t be 
able to take care of themselves;  they won ’t be able to 
respond to life ; and, heaven forbid, no -one will like 
them , or whatever their concern is.  
 
But to be simple, at peace, and to really be able to 
rest with “nothing needs to happen, ” you might be 
surprised at what does happen. That may make space 
for something deep inside to come forth . And it  might 
be different from what you expect . But chances are 
that what comes forth from that place  will be 
significant . I use the word ‘significant ’ in a careful way 
because it might not necessarily be beautiful . But 
whatever comes from the depths of us is significant , 
and it needs our attention. It needs our care;  it needs 
to be faced and dealt with , and worked with.  
 
Once you start with “nothing ne eds to happen ,” you 
see what does happen , and then you might have a 
better understanding of what needs to happen after 
that. “Oh I need to address this deep fear. I need to 
address this deep beauty, this beautiful joy that ’s 
somehow deep inside, the  love t hat I feel or 
something. ”  There ’s a variety of things that might 
speak or come forth when the heart or the mind is at 
rest and at peace.  
 5 I think one of the fears that many people have, 
implicitly, is that their quiet, natural, deep motivations 
are not going to be adequate to get through this life. 
The surface part of the mind that has some sense of 
self, tries to fit everything into categor ies and boxes,  
and tries to know, ahead of time, how everything ’s 
supposed to be. The world of fear and anxiety, the 
world of desire and ambition, the world of hostility and 
aversion – that’s how we make ourselves safe, how 
we make everything okay. But if you put all that to 
rest, you can have  a very strong sense that nothing ’s 
going to support them anymore;  nothing ’s going to 
come forth. One of the reasons for that is that when 
the heart and the mind are deeply at peace, when it ’s 
simple, the place of sup port and motivation, and 
response to the w orld is not going to be visible . It’s not 
like a thing or place. It ’s invisible because it ’s not there 
until it ’s there.  You may  not going to know what you ’re 
going to say until you say it. You don ’t know how you 
feel until you feel it. If you look to see how you feel 
before you feel , it’s invisible. If you look to see what 
you’re going to say before you ’re in t he conversation, 
it’s invisible;  it’s not there.  
 
So perhaps you can  have a deep trust of your innate 
intelligence – that the innate response is adequate to 
take care of ourselves and get through life. It doesn ’t 
have to be brilliant. It doesn ’t have to make us the 
most popular person on the block. It just has to be 
enough. Our personality just has to be enou gh so that 6 we can live in this world peacefully and wisely and, 
hopefully, in a way that helps other people as well.  
 
I think of these mornings here, at IMC on 
Wednesdays, as being simple mornings . If you come 
back on another Wednesday, this might be a goo d 
place to experiment  with this little practice of “Nothing 
needs to happen, ” and see what happens when 
nothing needs to happen. So thank you.
