The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

The pleasure that comes from Dharma practice.
And one of the principles that I'm going to offer is the principle that sometimes
what is unpleasant can be overcome by what is pleasant.
Sometimes pain can be overcome by pleasure or dealt with through pleasure.
But not just any pleasantness or any pleasure, but what can be called dharmic pleasure.
So what is that?
There's a story in the sutras, teachings of the Buddha.
It's possible it's the Buddha's cousin who is a lay person who comes to the Buddha and he says,
I have this preoccupation that is getting in my way.
And I can't really make progress in the Dharma or something because it's preoccupation.
And the preoccupation is overly attached to sensual pleasure.
Sensual pleasure is an obstacle because I'm constantly thinking about it or imagining it or wanting it or something concerned with it.
And the Buddha says that's the way it is, that if you're preoccupied and caught up in sensual pleasure,
it's really hard to make progress on the Dharma path.
And back in ancient India in the Buddha's time there was other religious traditions that saw this as well,
that sensual pleasures of all kinds were an obstacle to some kind of spiritual progress.
And they advocated asceticism, sometimes a radical denial of all pleasure.
And all that sometimes actually intentional taking on a pain.
There are some people who believe that you can only overcome pain with pain.
So get into it.
So the Buddha agreed with the man, there can't be an obstacle in preoccupation with sensual pleasure.
And then remarkably the Buddha said that before I was enlightened,
I also was preoccupied with sensual pleasures in a way that interfered with my practice and interfered with things.
So he knew intimately for himself how this could work.
And then he says the only way, something like this, the way to overcome this preoccupation concern is through pleasure,
is through what I'm calling dharmic pleasure, he doesn't use that term, dharmic pleasure,
that there is a kind of pleasure you can cultivate that has an antidote to the preoccupation with sensual pleasure.
And one way to see this is that there is another kind of pleasure,
a feeling of wellness, of goodness, that is a reconditioning factor.
And we're very, very strongly influenced by the conditions in which we live in.
And then we say that we can be conditioned by them.
There are lifelong kind of conditioning.
So people who live with constant threat growing up can be conditioned to be afraid and anxious.
And wherever they go, they kind of have their eyes open looking and how to be safe because they feel that's what they've learned taken in.
There are people who have been horribly wounded, scarred emotionally by what happens to them.
And that creates a conditioning, that creates a kind of an influence that leads to a lasting impression
and a lasting perspective in which to look at the world.
Like the world is a dangerous place because people are threatening or something.
And there's all these series of conditionings we have.
Some people receive the conditioning that you're successful if you have a lot of pleasure.
And so you should really, and you get rewarded for having sensual pleasure.
And so you want to have lots of pleasure because that's how you feel rewarded.
You feel good and you feel like everything's okay in the world.
And that's been the conditioning though.
Over and over again, that's been reinforced in different kinds of ways.
And these kinds of conditionings can lead to an intensity around the pursuit of sensual pleasure of all kinds.
Certainly it can be sexual, it can be the pleasure of alcohol and drugs.
It can be the pleasures of the intellect, pleasures of adventures, pleasures of a dear devil
who just engaged and fully absorbed in some kind of thing that brings their attention
fully into the present moment and clears out everything else.
It feels so alive and so connected.
Some people fear in doing things that are frightening.
It brings a kind of aliveness.
They don't have any other time in their life.
And so it feels so good to have that aliveness.
I told this story a few times, many years ago.
I saw a little documentary about a man who had spent his early part of his adult life
spending a lot of time, like on the weekends, riding his motorcycle all over.
That's how he cleared his mind and got ready for work
and enjoyed just driving his big motorcycle around.
But then his wife had a baby
and he couldn't spend the weekend away on his motorcycle.
So he had to find a quicker way to clear his mind
and be ready to start fresh and everything.
So he took up the sport of paragliding.
You can apparently, I don't know if that's the right word,
but he could put it into a backpack.
And then early in the morning at dawn,
he would climb up in these skyscrapers that were being built in his city.
So he was still kind of open and everything,
but he would sneak into the building, climb up to the top,
and then he would jump from the top into the street below
where there's no traffic yet, just as dawn was happening.
And he had a friend with a car, a getaway car waiting down below
to drive off, drive the Hickmoff.
And that's how he cleared his mind.
You know, and that's how, you know, he's something good happening.
He felt alive and good and present.
So there's all these ways in which we are pursuing
some kind of feeling of, feeling alive and good
and that sometimes involves pursuit of pleasure
having an experience in life, good things.
And sometimes those kinds of pursuits don't really fill us,
don't really meet some deeper need that we have.
And in fact, we almost need to repeat the same pleasure
in order to be distracted from some deeper wound,
some deeper loneliness, some deeper angst,
some deeper depression, some deeper something.
And so people then repeat the same thing,
whether you're yearning for more and more and more.
So the Buddha said that what's, you know, that they said,
yeah, that way doesn't work.
But in order to kind of not have this pursuit of sensual pleasure
be an obstacle, you have to experience a non-sensual pleasure,
a pleasure that's not of the physical senses
and a pleasure which he used the word unwholesome,
when it's not unwholesome, unskilful.
And so, and then what he used as an example for this
was the certain kind of pleasure that comes from meditation practice
that a certain kind of joy and well-being and happiness
that can well up from the inside.
And the city of welling up from the inside
is a very different source for a sense of well-being
than the sense of pleasure or even well-being
that can come from getting stimulated by good experiences
from the outside in.
So it might feel really good to have a really good meal,
tasty meal, your favorite meal.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
But if you're simply taking in the pleasure of it,
that's what you're being, then it's only of the senses.
If the person who made the meal for you
did it with a lot of love
and it touched something inside of you like,
wow, this feels, I can feel the generosity
and the goodness of this person who's doing something,
that could touch something that's not of the senses.
That might touch your heart in some way.
And that has a very different impact on us
than the conditioning that comes from just the senses,
just the pleasure of the food.
It's not the food that we're benefiting from the most,
it's rather the goodness of it.
So a story I'd like to tell is my, you know,
a lasting impression that's still with me.
It probably was, at the time, I didn't know it was,
it conditioned me, it had its lifelong influence on me.
But it was staying at my grandmother's house
when I was, like, maybe somewhere between 7 and 10.
And waking up in the morning, it's beautiful light
and staying in bed with all wooden rooms in Norway
with a Norwegian comforter
and this bright Norwegian light coming in through the window
cozy reading Donald Duck magazines in Norwegian.
And she would bring in a tray with toast,
butter and cheese on it.
And it was nice, I would stay in bed eating the toast,
you know, with reading the Donald Duck magazines.
But somehow, unbeknownst to me at that time,
I was taking in the goodness, the safety, the warmth,
the love of that situation of my grandmother.
And I still carry in with me that feeling,
that memory of that goodness.
So certainly the toast with cheese was pleasant,
sensually, but it was some deeper feeling,
well-spring from inside.
Something deeper was born, it was awoken, it was allowed.
That did something special, just a simple thing she did.
And so to awaken this well-spring,
something that can, goodness, a pleasure,
that can arise from the inside out
and not continually looking for it in the world
is the path of the Dharma.
Certainly it could have been my lifelong pursuit
is to find someone who was just like my grandmother
and make sure I had got the right kind of comfort
or the right kind of wooden bed
and make sure that they brought the toast and butter
and every morning at the right time of day
when the light was shining through,
just to get everything set up
and have someone who was just like my grandmother
and so that somehow.
But that's just, I think in a strict way,
that in Buddhism is just trying to get the world
of the senses just organized around you
to try to replicate something.
But what is it to, but in Dharma practice
what we're doing is we're not looking at external world for this
but we're looking to see how could we awaken something inside
that becomes a reconditioning
that dissipates any kind of attachment to comfort,
sensual comfort, physical comfort,
any kind of attachment to sensual or physical pleasure,
any kind of attachments to physical or sensual stimulation
of any kind at all including intellectual stimulation.
So the Buddha said,
you can't really overcome this addiction
or preoccupation with this kind of physical pleasure,
sensual pleasure without this dharmic pleasure.
And one of the ways he talked about this dharmic pleasure,
more his language, he called it a pleasure,
not of the flesh, near amisa sukka.
So not of the flesh,
meaning nothing physical was being stimulated.
And so have you had any experiences
where there was enough sense of well-being, of safety,
of quiet, of comfort or something,
the environment was just right,
that you felt something not so much nourished from the outside
but allowed something inside to settle, to open,
to be at ease, to feel safe,
so that there was a wellspring within
that began to flow and move through you.
It requires being in a different way
than most people are, I think, in their ordinary life,
where maybe we're just keeping ourselves busy.
We have a to-do list.
We're doing this and that.
We're trying to maybe just be busy
or keep ourselves entertained.
Like, you know, some people have, do what's called,
there's a term I only learned a few years ago,
binge watching.
And, you know, there's some kind of TV program
that just, like, there's all these series.
You can watch, like, ten series in one day,
it's the Apple Night.
So that might be physically pleasant.
Buddha would call it kind of a pleasure of the senses,
but it doesn't create the environment, the situation,
the context that awakens something from the inside out.
Probably not.
And so what, so meditation for the Buddha
was he presented that as the means
for this deeper healing pleasure that's possible to have.
And, you know, he didn't have Netflix.
He didn't have all the things we have in the modern world
that people use, you know, to try to assuage
how they're feeling uncomfortable.
And so the Buddha said,
Buddha did not teach that you overcome pain with pain.
He taught you overcome pleasure.
You overcome pain with pleasure.
He did not say you overcome pleasure with pain.
He said you overcome pleasure with pleasure.
And overcome here means overcoming our attachments
to our preoccupation or fixation.
So whether things are,
the fixation has to do with things that are pleasant
or the fixation has to do with things that are unpleasant.
Both are kind of healed
through feeling this dharmic well-being, this dharmic pleasure.
And so the art of discovering
a way of feeling a certain kind of inner pleasure or well-being
and letting that be the context in which you experience your life.
So I'll give you an example for me.
It's not dramatic, but maybe you can fill in a way
that's meaningful for you.
There's probably something like this happens to many of you.
Like sometimes I sit down, I've had a busy day
doing a lot of things or something
or a lot of feelings, a lot of something going on.
And I sit down to meditate
and I discover that my breathing is not relaxed.
I'm contracted in the chest a little bit.
And if I sit and feel that, it actually feels unpleasant
on the top of the inhale.
But what I do is I relax a bit around it
and I feel it doesn't have to be dramatic,
a very subtle sense of well-being or pleasure
in the wider body, the global body.
Part of it's a pleasure that comes from just a pleasure
or the goodness of being conscious of things,
just being aware of things.
It feels good for me.
And then as I stay focusing my breathing,
I just contentedly feel the discomfort of my breathing
without making it a problem.
I feel the discomfort in this wider field
of pleasure, of pleasantness, of goodness that's there.
So I can end up feeling very content
feeling the discomfort
because it's not the whole picture.
I'm not fixated on it.
Early in my meditation practice, many years ago,
I would have gotten so caught up and preoccupied,
oh, I shouldn't be breathing that way.
This is a problem. I'm a bad meditator.
What do I have to do to stop having this discomfort?
I'm not supposed to have it.
I tied myself in knots around these kinds of things.
And because of this kind of negativity bias, perhaps,
or this idea that I'm supposed to deal with these problems,
everything's supposed to be different.
And now I just, oh, look at that.
I guess that caused the conditions of the day.
My breathing is a little bit uncomfortable.
And it's okay.
And I feel that discomfort
in this wider field of pleasure.
And that has healed my tendency to be preoccupied,
the shoulds, the judgments, the idea that I'm wrong.
Something relaxes that way.
And so this idea of there's a dharma pleasure,
a pleasure not of the senses, not of the flesh.
Something that kind of belongs more to the wellspring
that we allow for, that we open up to.
And then we allow ourselves to be conditioned by it.
There's an art of allowing ourselves to be influenced by that.
And perhaps in your daily life, there are moments,
situations where you feel something like this.
But maybe you don't linger long enough in it.
You have your to-do list.
Okay, let's go to the next thing.
You jump in your car and you're tense driving.
But the fact that you just were in the park with a friend
and going for a nice walk and feeling kind of peaceful,
that's besides the point once you get in your car
to go to the next important thing.
But what about lingering or staying with these feelings?
Some of these dharma pleasures can be benefited the most
if we allow them to take them in.
We let them, oh, this is good.
In spite of the fact that I feel unhappy right today,
there is also this goodness here.
If we get preoccupied with our unhappiness,
we're going to be probably more likely influenced
by the unhappiness in a negative way.
But if we allow ourselves to be unhappy,
but feel it in a wider field of something
that feels easeful or pleasant or open,
then that can be an influence that heals some of unhappiness.
So what are some of the things that we can feel?
Some of it is a global awareness of the body
that's bigger than any particular place
where we feel uncomfortable or feel pain in the body.
It's not always available to us,
but there might be some feeling of subtle vibration
or subtle energy flow or subtle tingling
or subtle spaciousness.
One of the things that's happened to me
over the years of practice,
I have a lot of space in my body now.
At least that's what it feels like to me.
It looks like a very spacious, beautiful, big place
and there I close my eyes.
And I was so surprised when I went to...
Some years ago, I started going once a year
to a community college nearby
that has an anatomy lab where they spend time with a cadaver.
It's all cut open.
You can see the inside.
And I was so surprised.
There's no space in there.
It's just packed with organs and everything.
It's like, wow, they don't have any space.
I have lots of space.
The space is not real space,
but it's the space that of...
Just somehow I feel the space.
I feel spacious, very inside and around, very spacious.
And that spaciousness feels nice.
When I was younger, I didn't think that space,
like that, was something to focus on.
Now I feel that it's kind of like
you go into a big, big, sacred space
and it's a space in the highest ceilings
that somehow makes the place feel kind of sacred
or quiet or peaceful.
And so to feel the spaciousness within
for me has a positive conditioning force.
Sometimes it's...
Some of the things that we do
that has a positive influence
because of the goodness of doing it,
is being generous.
Not giving,
but giving which is generous.
Or giving that has a feeling of love with it.
Or honesty.
Not the honesty that's a duty,
but the honesty that sets something free inside.
You're not hiding or contracted.
It's something that decontracts us.
And to feel the goodness of honesty, of truthfulness,
the kindness, compassion.
That kind of kindness and compassion, again,
there's not a should, not a duty, not a...
I'm a good Buddhist.
I'm supposed to be this way.
I'm going to kind of buckle down to be kind.
But rather to discover how to open and allow
for a softness, a tenderness,
where of course you want to be kind.
Of course that's not good.
And all these things, learning how to do these things in a way,
discovering your way, not someone else's way,
we're doing, living, going through life,
you do things, you speak things,
you act in ways
that feel really good for you on the inside out.
Some people, sometimes they, in Buddhism,
they talk about actions which are beautiful.
But I think the beauty is not the external grace
in which you do things,
but rather the feeling of beauty from the inside out
as you do it.
And what does it take to do things in a beautiful way?
I don't think you can do them in a hurry.
I think hurry interferes
with any of this deeper well-being
that can recondition us and heal us
and show us something different.
So it requires something of us.
And one of the things it requires is non-hurry
to feel, to be present.
One of the forms of, primary forms of
the karmic pleasure that the Buddha emphasized
for this purpose, this reconditioning purpose,
this way of overcoming preoccupations
with central pleasure,
was the kind of well-being that arises
when we get, our attention becomes unified,
organized in a unified way
to be fully engaged, absorbed in one thing.
I say that very carefully in all those words
because I could have said
when we just get concentrated on one thing.
But to say concentrated,
some people then get fixated, this tight attention.
They bear down, they narrow down
to really stay and be present.
And that is not the unified,
composed attention with which we get organized
around being absorbed in one thing.
And so some of you maybe have felt
a wonderful feeling of maybe well-being,
being absorbed and really getting good novel.
Just feel so good just to be left,
the world around you falls away,
you get pulled into the novel.
Some of you might have the craft you do,
where you could say, yeah, I'm absorbed in the craft,
but you're not fixating on any one part of the craft.
It's the whole phenomenon that feels good.
You might be idly thinking about things,
but your mind hasn't stopped thinking,
but everything is organized around the craft
or playing a musical instrument or doing art
or going for a walk sometimes in a natural setting.
So in meditation, that's the kind of absorption
that is possible that the Buddha was emphasizing
that gives birth to a deeper sense of well-springing
of well-being, of joy, of happiness, of delight,
and that we're allowed to feel pleasure,
dharmic pleasure, we're allowed to feel good.
In fact, to be fixated on what's uncomfortable,
what's difficult emotionally, physically in the world,
the fixation is a bad influence on us.
The fixation is stressful.
We don't have to ignore the difficulties we have,
but we can hold them in a different context
than one that's held by being fixated on it.
Using meditation to begin relaxing the fixations,
softening the way we get preoccupied by things,
opening up, developing a soft, receptive, floating awareness,
and awareness because it's not fixated
can start being aware of the peripheral context
of our situation.
And the peripheral context, what I mean is
if we're involved with our breathing, for example,
that's the primary center of our attention, meditating,
we're not only taking in the breathing,
hang on for dear life, but we're also,
the peripheral attention takes in the goodness,
the subtle, very subtle, perhaps, pleasure, well-being
of the situation we're in, maybe physically,
to feel where it does feel good.
And there's often more goodness, more pleasure
than most people take advantage of.
And here's an example that I find kind of fascinating.
If I feel tense in my body, it feels uncomfortable,
I can relax attention.
And then notice that I'm tense somewhere else,
and you try to deal with that, or something else is a problem.
But what happened was that I ignored the fact
that as I released attention,
there was a feeling of subtle pleasure, relief,
in my shoulders as I relaxed.
So what should I focus on?
The tension, the painful tension
that I'm glad went away,
or the pleasure that replaced it?
It's the same relaxation happens,
but am I keep focusing on what's negative,
or can I focus on the positive side of it?
So there's many situations where I learn to relax, for example,
and feel the goodness of the relaxation
that I wouldn't have done early in my life,
because I'm just going barreling ahead
with one preoccupation concern after the other.
Check that off, relax the shoulders.
What's next to do?
What's the next thing to worry about?
But again, this idea of not hurrying and taking the time.
And chances are there's more non-sensual pleasure,
dharmic pleasure,
that's available in any given time that you allow,
that you recognize.
I've sat at meetings and been impatient,
and the impatient didn't go away,
but by somehow settling into my body,
I could feel that it was wider in my body.
There was, in fact, a sense of feeling a little bit alive,
nicely vital, relaxing,
that created a different context for feeling the impatience.
And earlier in my life,
I would have just kind of been caught by the impatience.
Now I know better.
Now I think, oh, I'm impatient.
What's going on here?
And could I feel that larger context?
Just the pleasure of just being alive right now.
And now breathe with the impatience.
Now be with it.
So I'm not fixated on it.
It's being held in a wider context.
So I call this the peripheral attention.
And to float the attention between the central focus
and the peripheral to be focused on the central focus,
what needs attention,
but to hold that with the peripheral attention
of what feels good, what feels pleasant,
that supports this ability to get absorbed,
composed, gathered around unified about something.
And then, lo and behold,
this kind of staying very, very still and quiet
and absorbed in something,
breathing or other things.
I can start producing this deeper wellsprings.
I keep using the word wellsprings
because the Buddha in talking about this kind of absorption
uses the metaphor analogy of an underground spring,
underwater spring in a lake,
a wellspring of water that flows into the lake from below.
And I think he uses that metaphor purposefully
because that's how it can feel inside of us.
That this wellspring with us flows from someplace within
and flows outward and through the body.
This vibration, this energy, this tingling,
this warmth, this glow, whatever it might,
I don't know how the right term for you is.
And so to allow ourselves,
give yourself time to feel,
make room for some other way of feeling.
They take the time and room to feel dharmic pleasure.
And in this way,
pleasure overcomes attachment to pleasure.
Isn't that convenient?
And the Buddha was very specific about the context of ancient India
that we don't use pain to overcome pleasure.
We don't use pain to overcome pain.
But for him, we use pleasure to overcome the preoccupation
both with pain and pleasure.
And so how might this work for you?
I suspect that probably for many of you,
I probably didn't speak about this very well
in a way that was specific enough for you.
But I hope what it did was at least turn the mirror back to yourself
to see what is some way that you know,
in your terms, in your experience,
what I've been talking about,
something that would be useful for you
to take more time with and make room for
and not be in a hurry for
and not be tricked by the mind's preoccupations
and the mind's to-do list
and the mind's previous conditioning
that maybe gets you kind of constantly on the treadmill
of doing things which actually continue
being a poor influence on you
but being able to shift in gears
to allow a healthy, appropriate new influence,
new conditioning
that allows you then to
take in and benefit
from the deeper and deeper way that mindfulness
can gather you together to be really present
for your experience.
So just there's more and more nurturing,
there's more and more healing, there's more and more
goodness and pleasure
in the practice.
So I hope this is something
that you can identify on yourself
and find useful and thank you for being here today
and we have a couple of minutes.
Would anyone like to ask any questions about this
or clarifications or anything else?
You're behind you, Bill.
Those of you online, I'll try to look at the chat
and see if you have a question.
This question may be somewhat unclear even to myself.
What are the gray areas between
dharmic pleasure and sensual pleasure
where you can't tell the difference
which one are you now engaged in?
Yes, so where is the gray area
where we can't tell the difference
between dharmic pleasure and sensual pleasure?
Sometimes they come together,
that's part of the reason why it's not so clear
and so it takes some time to be able to
allow for both to be there,
not assume that it should only be one or the other.
There's nothing inherently wrong with sensual pleasure
and so in Buddhism we're not dismissing sensual pleasure
offhand, it's the attachment to it.
And as we feel this, so dismissing it
or feeling that sensual pleasure is wrong
doesn't allow us to see how they can operate together.
They can both be there.
Thank you very much, blessing.
Gil, I remember a quote that I think
is from the verses of the elder nuns,
I'm not sure.
The part of your talk reminded me of,
I take delight and attention to all suffering states.
I take delight and attention to all suffering states.
That's how I remember it.
Well, that's a great one.
Yeah, that's a good one, fantastic.
So I think it's a common assumption
by people that if you're suffering,
that's suffering by itself,
that's all that's going on.
Because of this negativity bias,
because of the preoccupation with it,
because of the ways which our thinking
gets so pulled into that world
that we're just thinking about it all the time.
But to learn to not be caught in thoughts,
to learn how to open up attention into a wider field,
and just the idea of discovering the preciousness
of being conscious, of being mindful,
of being aware, and how awareness of something
can feel pleasant, enjoyable, or just a rightness to it,
there's freedom in the awareness of it.
So it's possible to be aware of suffering states
and actually feel joy.
Like when I talked about feeling my discomfort
with my breathing sometimes,
when I kind of turn towards it with the spacious mind
and body and feel it,
just my ability to do that,
I sometimes get a little smile.
Oh, look at that.
It's so good to be mindful.
And whereas in the past, I wouldn't have noticed that.
So I suspect there's something like that.
So say it again.
I take delight and attention
toward all suffering states.
Yeah, it's a lot better than alternative.
Anything else?
Is everyone asked here online,
are you speaking about leaning into the pain?
Leaning into the pain.
Well, you know, that might be fun.
With the right kind of mindfulness and attention,
that could be fun.
So I wouldn't rule it out,
but I'm not really encouraging people to lean into the pain.
But if you have pain to begin with,
you want to be wise about it
and you want to have lots of options
and be able to find your way with it.
And one of the ways to find your way with it
is to hold the pain
in a wider field of pleasure,
well-being, or freedom of attention,
or something, just hold it in awareness
without being caught by it.
And one of the things that does
is it allows us to see the pain more clearly
so we can be wiser about what to do with it.
And there's lots of options.
So it might be that we should take an aspirin.
It might be that we should ignore it.
It might be that we should really bring
careful attention to really feel it
closely and intimately.
There's so many choices.
But you first have to stop long enough
to check it out.
So anyway, that's my response to that question.
So okay.
So maybe that's enough.
You know, I kind of feel like
I just gave you a hot potato.
And now you have it to practice it.
And I'll play you.
Get darmically warmed by it in a nice way.
Thank you very much.
