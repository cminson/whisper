Practice Note: The TouchStone InsideTranscribed and edited from a short talk by Gil Fronsdal on February 2, 2018 A brief thing about the meditation practice. You might associate meditation with something like being calm or being peaceful or being mindful, maybe being somehow contented. There's many kinds of emotions or feelings, attitudes that people associated with it. If you have this, one of the things you might do is search around in your body. 
Is there any place in your body that you associate with those states or those feelings? Is there some place in your body associated with the calm or with being a stable or steady being grounded with being, clear and alert to what's happening? We're feeling contented. Don't look for all of them, but you might see if one of them might be accessible as a small, maybe even a small little tiny location where that feeling resides. And then as you meditate, have that as a reference point.  
Almost like you're breathing through it or as you stay mindful with your breathing. It's almost like the bellows are blowing a gentle wind across the embers of that place. Or if you're walking meditation, you might just stay connected to that. Then again, as if the walking is somehow massaging it and supporting it . It can be helpful to do this is when people have a strong tendency to view the world and focus on what is wrong, but there's a whole diﬀerent way of being present for the full range of who we are.  
If we have a kind of an anchor or a touchstone in some place inside that feels kind of like a nice place. And maybe for you, it would be diﬀerent than the kind of things I listed there. But see if you can ﬁnd a nice place, even if it's a teeny little square centimeter of a place inside. That's a nice place to kind of be rooted, anchored, tethered, connected to. And maybe that supports the mindfulness and makes it easier. And makes it a little bit more opening and relaxing than it is to when your mind is tethered to all the problems.  All the diﬃculties and things like that. So I hope you enjoy the morning.
