 So for today's talk I'm going to introduce you to the refrain of this Satipatthana Sutta, this discourse that we're talking from. Some translators call it a refrain, some translators call it a title, this section that's repeated in insight. It's insights that can come from doing this practice. And what I'll focus on in particular is that part of it that has to do with change. And Buddhism in general is a wisdom tradition, a tradition focused on liberating wisdom that puts a lot of emphasis on the value of noticing change and all the different ways that change can happen. And change is something we celebrate, something we dread, something we grieve over. It's something we look forward to and something that we hope will never happen maybe. And change can also be liberating if change is seen in a particular way. And part of what we're doing with mindfulness is creating the capacity, the ability to live and see the world of change so that we're not victims of it, but rather discover how to live free in this world of change. So these four foundations, these four ways of establishing awareness, four bases, the four areas through which we establish our capacity to be aware, to stay, to clear away. We're also celebrated or emphasized a lot in the Buddhist teachings. And there's two that I find particularly inspiring or meaningful. One has to do with understanding. In a world of change, which is full of dangers, challenges and difficulties, we would like to have a refuge. We would like to have something that would help us be safe, protected. And the Buddha, near the end of his life, when he knew he was dying, and what he had to say then was particularly kind of say things there. We're going to, you know, what he most emphasized. He said, make yourself, make of yourself an island. Make of yourself a refuge. Make the Dharma an island. Dharma a refuge. The island means in a place you're safe from the floods of life. If there's a big flood and you find an island that's high enough, then you're safe. And so the floods that the Buddha talks about often is the floods of greed, hatred and delusion. The way that we are somehow swept away, distracted, caught up in, drowned in, sometimes in our greed or our hatred, our delusion. But this powerful statement, make yourself a refuge. Make of yourself a refuge. So rather than looking for the safety in the changing world, in the world, the idea is not to find it in oneself necessarily, but to kind of make it in oneself. To do what it takes to become that safety for yourself. So then he says, and how do you do that? How do you make yourself your own refuge? Your practice, mindfulness, observing the body in the body, hardened, clearly comprehending and aware, having put away covetousness and distress for the world. By observing feelings and feelings, ardent, clearly comprehending, aware, having put away covetousness and distress concerning the world. Then he goes on, the same thing for the mind states and for the dharmas. So these are the four areas we're developing this awareness. And so the practice of mindfulness that we're focusing on today is important enough for the Buddha that practicing this practice brings a refuge, brings a quality of safety. And how does that work? How is it that simply paying attention, waking up our capacity to be aware in some clear, lucid way? How is it that that makes us safe? Some people would say it's the opposite, because if you really pay attention to what's going on in this world, wouldn't you realize how dangerous it really is? So Buddhism is the opposite. There's something about these four foundations, these four areas of developing awareness that bring safety. So the second little kind of a simile metaphor that I love around these four is that Buddha talked about... He grew up on the foothills of the Himalayas, so he kind of saw the range of the different elevations of the world. And so there's the plains, and then you're the foothills, and then there's the steep mountains very roughly. And apparently there are some monkeys that live in the wooded areas in the foothills. Some are going up the mountainsides. They weren't steep enough that hunters can't get to very easily. But if those monkeys come down from those steep places and out onto the plains, they can get caught by hunters. It's dangerous for them. But if they go further back higher up in the Himalayas where there's steep cliffs and crags and all kinds of things, and snow and ice and whatever, it's also dangerous for the monkeys. But so the monkeys are safe if they stay in their ancestral homelands. Isn't that great the word? In their home country. But the Palis, more like their ancestral homelands, you know, where the ancestors have been for a long time. So it's like they're, you know, it's their, Andrea talked about home. And so the place where we most feel home, the ancestral homeland maybe, then you are safe. And so then the Buddha said, well, how do, what's our ancestral homeland? So that's an interesting topic. Where's your ancestral homeland? And so with the Buddha, that's these four areas for developing awareness. Again, the practice of mindfulness, practice of developing awareness through the body, feelings, mind states, and these dharmas, these processes in the mind. So both these kind of examples show how central this these four areas of culturing awareness is for the Buddha. And again, this idea of safety, they help make us safe. And we find a lot of that in the teachings, that's understanding this is a dangerous world we live in. There are dangers. And this practice is not just to become liberated, but to discover a kind of a radical, perhaps unexpected way of being safe. So in this practice, these different exercises, 13 ways of cultivating, 13 ways of waking up the awareness, stabilizing the awareness. And in the exercise on the body, there is mindfulness of breathing, then relaxing the body, experiencing the whole body, the first head thread of Anapanasati. And then there's a mindfulness in the posture, standing, walking, sitting, lying down. Clear comprehension. There is awareness and comprehension, understanding, as we go about our ordinary daily activities. So if the Buddha had been discovered his awakening in the 21st century Santa Cruz retreat center, he would have said, as you walk down the steps, know you're walking down the steps. When you're opening the front door, know you're opening the front door. When you're washing your hands in the sink, clearly know that you're washing your hands. Be there for the experience. When you serve yourself food and the buffet table, clearly know that's what you're doing and be there with the serving of the food. So all these simple activities through the day are seen as completely valuable places to develop and cultivate this what's going to become hopefully a lucid awareness, a clear awareness, stable clear awareness. And so we start doing that in our lives. Being present for experience, something begins to grow in us. Something becomes more stable, more present. We're less likely to wonder off and get lost in thought. Hugely important for me in learning to do this, before I learned really about mindfulness was when I was in the Zen student, the Zen monastery, and I was assigned for a whole year to the Zen center kitchen. And I didn't want to be there. But I learned... Just before I started in the kitchen, I was at a bookstore and I looked at the spiritual bookshelves and I just pulled some book down randomly and opened it. And it said something like, the problems people humans have is somehow resisting reality or pulling away from reality or something like that. So that was like I closed the book and I went to the monastery. It was literally like on the way to the monastery. So we stopped in Carmel Valley and went to a bookstore and I opened it, closed it and went to the monastery. So that was kind of in my mind. And then it put me in the kitchen. But this idea... I retranslated this phrase for myself. And then rather than looking how I held back from reality or resisted reality, I realized, how do I participate in reality? So I had lots of chances in the kitchen, if I'm chopping vegetables with it, a lot of, how do I really be there for those carrots? Me and the carrots. Those carrots were my teachers because I learned so much about how I didn't want to be there. And how quick my mind would go and get lost and react and get grumpy and all kinds of things. And I learned how to not give in to that or how not to have that. I learned the pleasure and the joy of just really being there for just the activity of chopping a vegetable. Something delicious about not so much maybe chopping a vegetable in and of itself, but offering myself to the chopping. Being really there. This activity is important enough for my whole self to be involved in it. And now slowly over the months, I had a whole year of doing this. And slowly over the months, I discovered that when I offered that kind of presence to what I was doing in the kitchen, that sometimes we'd be in the kitchen and we have to go right directly into the meditation to meditate. Like you had to throw off your apron and we had robes. I had my robe hanging right next to the kitchen door. And I would throw, you know, take off my apron and put on my robe and go up to meditation and sit down to meditate. And depending on how present I was for my chopping, it was how quickly I sat down and got quiet and concentrated. And if it was just me and the carrots, that was the whole world, I would meditate and I'd be still and quiet. And we'd already concentrated, already settled and present. So as we go, you know, that's going down the steps, opening the door, washing your hands, serving your food. These are all opportunities to daydream and think about the future and what you'll do in retirement. It's also an opportunity to give your life force, your life attention, your precious ability to be here, to just really be here for this one activity and let go of all those thoughts. So this kind of clarity of awareness has a chance to really be there. And then it goes on with all these exercises. And I think there are six of them, I think. And one of them has to do with the four elements. I said earlier, I'll tell you a little about using the imagination. And so here the Buddha is kind of calling upon the imagination of the four elements, that the earth element, the earth is hard and solid and the earth supports us. And so he talks about becoming aware of the earth element inside of us, where we feel where there's a structure, where there's hardness, where there's support, that part of the body that supports the other parts of the body. So if you feel your butt against your chair, your cushion, that contact is the earth element, the hardness, the weight that's supporting you. If you can feel up your vertebrae, your spine, and feel that kind of solidness and strength there of holding yourself upright, that's the earth element there, that hardness or that strength or that firmness. There's the water element and then water is fluid and you can put your hand through it. It kind of doesn't really resist you. You can go through it pretty easily and water moves and adapts itself to whatever the shape of the container that it's in or the shape of the river, the river banks as it goes down. It just comes fluid and moves and maybe it's the original Akito players that just moves whatever is going on. And so in us, we can feel the movement in our bodies and sometimes it's very subtle. You can feel subtle always. The body's always ever so slightly shifting and moving and the body's kind of fluid. Sometimes I imagine my body to be like a bag of water and somehow when I think of it as bag of water, it's like all the little movements in the body. It feels like the undulation and the waves of water going through a bag as you kind of, you know, push it when you want a little corner of it or something. And it's our feeling the fluidity of the body. And then there's the fire element where it brings heat. And so you can feel heat and cold in your body and it's dynamic usually. And it feels a dynamism of the heat. If you step back from your ideas of the hot body or the cold body and feel all the little particular places in the body where the heat or the coolness is felt, you might feel that it sparks. It comes into being. It passes away. It comes and goes. And even though you might more in a broadway feel like you're hot or cold, to really connect to the direct details of that experience, it can be fascinating to watch how it's shifting and moving and sparking and coming into existence and passing in little, you know, micro places. And then there's the air element or the wind element. And for me, I like to feel it as whatever is spacious and light in my body. And just the lightness that can be there in addition to the heaviness or the solidity that's there, the earth element. And when I went down to, took some students here once, we were staying here, and we went down to community college to a cadaver lab that they have for the teaching anatomy to students there. And we got to look inside a cadaver. And I looked inside and I said, well, I'm not like that. There's no space in there. Everything's all the organs. It's all scrunched, packed in there. When I look inside, my body, it's a lot of space. What does that mean, looking inside? You know, I don't feel all my organs. I don't feel all that. I just feel like it feels spacious in there to me. And it's not really, but I guess it has to do with the nerve endings are or something. Maybe there's not enough nerve endings for me to feel everything there. But it's wonderful to kind of feel that spaciousness in my body when I sit and meditate or the spaciousness or the lightness that can be there. And that also has a fluidity to it, the coming and going. It feels very nice. So I don't know if you followed that, but that's one of the exercises to experience the four elements. So here, the imagination of how the elements are externally is a support for understanding us internally and maybe help us that imagery of stability, of fluidity, fire and cold. It's a little bit of imagination that maybe helps us to feel something comparable to that in our body as a way of maybe doing the same thing as chopping carrots, just being there for that. Just the simplicity of those elements, those particularities. That's very different than sitting there and thinking about being preoccupied with my body. That, you know, I wonder, should I make my hair purple? That would be interesting. And maybe if I worked out more, I'd be more buff. And that would be great, wouldn't it? And, you know, it creates all these kinds of self-image things people are talking, thinking about often, which is often a huge preoccupation in a big financial industry. So it's important for people, apparently. But what we're learning to do here is to step away from self-image concepts, advertisements, beliefs about what, how we're supposed to be, interpretations, judgments about it all, to just feel the body at its elemental level. And as we do that, awareness begins to show itself. We start becoming, we're developing and cultivating this ability to be aware here. As awareness becomes stable enough and strong enough, then there starts to be some kind of, it starts to be insight. There starts to be what is described in the refrain. And the refrain is kind of very valuable. And some people can get a sense of it right away. Some people can get a sense of what it talks about. Sometimes it evolves and develops and this practice kind of continues. And there's four steps in the refrain. And it can be interpreted as being a sequence, a deepening of the practice or unfolding of the practice to greater and greater places of insight, eventually to freedom. And one of the, I think, characteristics of the Buddha's teaching is very much a process thinker. Everything is a process. Everything is unfolding. Everything is a journey. Everything is moving and changing. But change is not random. Change is in response to the conditions that influence the change. And so as we begin to practice, we're changing the conditions. And so we're creating healthy conditions, supportive conditions for change to happen in a certain way. And so one of the ways that change unfolds is we start a process that moves deeper and deeper, fuller and fuller, into a kind of liberation and freedom. And there's many descriptions of that process. And this four-part description in the refrain is one of many descriptions of a process moving towards liberation and freedom. I don't think it takes a lot of reflection to consider how in your life you already have experiences that might be similar to a process that evolves over time that's similar to what I'll describe. So I like to go walking up in the hills. And when I first begin, and I might be out of shape, and I go to a new place, then my attention is very much focused on my out-of-shapeness and finding my breath and walking at a pace. And I'm kind of a little bit preoccupied with my body to do it well because I'm a little out of shape. But also it's a new place. I'm also concerned with what's going on around me. And so I'm kind of navigating, negotiating this inner world and my body walking in the outer world. But as I get along and I find the right trail to be on and my body starts getting into better condition because I've been walking for a while, I'm not so focused anymore on the process of walking that same way and attracting myself so carefully about my breath. And I know the trail now. I'm on the right trail. I'm not thinking about where I am so much. And then I start being present in a different way. I'm settling in. I'm relaxing into it. There's a softening. There's a getting into a flow of the walking. And then I might also start, because I love this thing about change, that's been such a key aspect of Buddhist practice, is to be sensitive to change. And it almost kind of comes by itself sometimes. I start becoming so attuned to how much is always changing as I walk and get a sense of it for you. I do this sometimes where I imagine that even though I'm walking, I imagine I'm standing still and the whole world is moving. And in a sense the whole world is... Because I'm walking, everything I'm seeing, the angle in which I see things, changes as I walk, new things pop up, things that I have been seeing disappear. And sometimes it feels like I'm standing in a river of the world and the trail just kind of coming towards me. In this meditation I'm standing still. And I feel like, wow, everything is shifting and changing and so fluid. This world is so fluid. It's just flowing. And in a sense it's not flowing, but what's flowing is my perception of it. And then I can let go of that imagination that I'm standing still and I can walk and I become highly attuned to just how shifting and changing all the sights are and the sounds are and my sensations on my body, everything is flowing and moving and changing. Wow, it's pretty cool. And sometimes I get distracted and start thinking about something and then I'll come back into that flow. It's so nice to have that flow. It's usually more relaxing than whatever I'm going to think about. So I'll have some incentive to kind of just stay in that flow. And then as I will keep walking sometimes, the effort or the attention needed for that kind of experience of everything is fluid, everything is changing, quiet is down, I get calmer, I get more settled and more peaceful. And I'm just there very simply. There's kind of simplicity of being. One of my favorite ways of being is having a simplicity of being, just being. And some of you have heard one of the great teachings I received from my Zen teacher was when he said, just to be alive is enough. And so there are times when just being there, walking and the simplicity of it all and just to be alive is enough. I'm just there, I know where I am or I'm available to know where I am. I'm just there and I know just enough to know where the trail is or where my foot is going to go. And I haven't shut off my intelligence so if I need to figure out where to go I can call it. But I don't need to. I'm just walking and just know I'm here. And I just appreciate how clear my attention becomes and peaceful and relaxed. Nothing needs to happen, nothing needs to become anything. I'm not defending myself or figuring anything out or planning anything. It's just here. And then if I go in that kind of having a nice hike like that in the hills, then sometimes I pick, at some point I pick just appreciating how unattached I am at those moments. Unconcerned. I'm not really grabbed by anything. There's a kind of freedom that's there. And I'm just kind of going along, freeing it. And the mind, my heart, my being is not dependent on anything in those minutes, those moments. And so it feels really good. And then I come back for my hike and I look and I have a flat tire in my car and then everything changes. Maybe. Or something. Or maybe not. I just look, oh look at that, change. Of course. That too changes. So anyway, so the refrain follows little bit that sequence. So it goes something like this. That one dwells observing what's internal. One dwells observing what's external. One observes observing what's internal and external. And exactly what the Buddha meant about this internal-external is either not so clear or some of the explanations for it are not so inspiring for me. So I kind of made it my own little bit. So I apologize if I'm the US tray. But what I found useful with it is to see this internal-external to be two different perspectives we can have of how we use our awareness, our attention. We can be very intimate with experience. I think Andrea talked about this the other day. Very intimate with experience and that for me is being internal. We can kind of step back and get a panoramic view and see it from a distance. We can be almost like so intimate with it that there's no subject-object distinction. If you press your finger against your thigh, the sensation of pressure you feel is happening in the same place as where the sensing is occurring. The sensing and the sensations are non-dual. There's no difference. So for me that's like real intimacy and to be right there in those feelings, in those sensations, that's being almost inside. But I can also step back and I can set this and make the feel that pressure against my thigh and I can look at it from a distance and get a big view, a panoramic view, just as pressure and lots of space or openness. Sometimes when there's pain, I have physical pain or emotional pain, sometimes I find it useful to get inside of it and really be close and intimate. Sometimes I find useful to pull away and kind of look at it from a distance. And so we have this ability to shift the perspective. So that's one way that I find it useful, this idea of internal-external. Another way I like it to understand it is that as we relax and settled into our awareness, there's no basis for making a distinction for where we pay attention, no prioritization, internal or external. We're equally available to be aware of what's happening within us as we are what's happening around us. So the traffic on Glen Canyon is just as valid as for mindfulness as the inhale that you have. And sometimes we're aware more of sounds and sometimes more aware of what goes on inside and we're kind of equally available to that. And this kind of freedom to be equally available in all directions is a wonderful way of being aware. So that's the first step of the Four. The second step is to become aware of the changing nature of things. And the changing here is described in a particular way. And that is to become aware of the experiences, the sensations. The word is dharma. That means many different things. This word dharma. But the processes, the immediate, the sensations, the experiences that happen and the particular experiences, to be aware of the arising of them, how they appear, their appearance of them. Not how they appear, but their appearance. So if we sit here quietly, I hear the arising of traffic. I hear a deeper thud of a car, a thumping of a car. I'm aware of my hand being held up in the air. I feel the tingling in it. I'm suddenly aware of the light in the room. It just appears in awareness. It's here all along, but all these things appear and then they disappear. Something that you've had all kinds of thoughts this week already. Most of them have disappeared. When they were in the middle of a thought, it might seem like the most important thing to think in the whole world. But there was a time before it arose. And there'll be times after it's passed. Knowing that it's only temporary, that it's something that arises and passes, is seen in Buddhism as a way of not being so glommed on or locked on to our thoughts and ideas. It's just an arising phenomena. It's a passing phenomena. Things come and they go. And part of the art of this mindfulness meditation is to be able to make the paradigm shift in the mind that allows us to see how things are coming and going all the time. And in particular, to do that, we have to be able to become wise about our thinking. Because, you know, concepts, platonic concepts, Plato, they're kind of unchanging. And so if we're seeing through the lens of our ideas, our mind is a little bit holding onto things as being a fixed way. So if I have this idea that I'm having a lousy day... I didn't have a lousy day today, but I have the idea of a lousy day. That's a kind of fixed concept. That's just like a depressing idea. It's like a oppressive idea, like poor Gil, I had a lousy day. And maybe I had all kinds of challenges through the day, but I'm holding it like this was a lousy day. And I'm seeing everything, and that's fixed. But it's just an idea. And if I don't look at the day through that lens, then I see, well, wait a minute, yes, there were some unfortunate things. I got a flat tire and I've got blisters from my walk and I don't know what... things happen. But there was fresh. I got to spend time with my mask off and fresh air. It was so nice. It was sunny. My food was tasty today. And turns out there's all these little moments through the day that are actually quite nice. How do I define the day? Do I define it by which details of the day? The flat tire and the blister, and that makes it a lousy day. Or can I free myself from seeing through the lens of any concept that tends to impose a kind of permanence on reality? And if I say it's a lousy day, I'm imposing a kind of permanence on my experience and myself and all that. And so there was a time before my mind had the thought, this is a lousy day. And there'll be a day where I don't think it's a lousy day anymore. The thought, lousy day, comes and it goes. If you can see it arise, this is a kind of one of the teachings of the Buddha, if you see a thought like this arise, you're less likely to take it as being a fixed thing. You know that it's temporary. You know that it's impermanent and provisional. And if you know that it will pass, then you know that you don't have to hang on to it and take it so seriously. There's scap, there's space for something else. There's room for a whole different way of catching your breath, breathing easily. And so there's this paradigm shift that's difficult to do, but it's worth kind of mentioning. And that is be very careful about your thoughts that you don't see reality through the concepts all the time. Concepts have their place, but they also limit us because we don't then feel and see our direct experience for what it is. We're painting the concepts over it. I came up with this idea of painting over things. First days I was in the Zen monastery. Something shifted inside of me and I looked at trees and I thought, wow, I'm painting a tree on top of a tree. It was an accurate painting, but I could feel how the mind somehow had this projected thought or idea that was painting tree over tree. And maybe you appreciate what I'm saying a little better when I tell you the stories. Many times when I go on these hikes in the hills, I'll be hiking along minding my own business. And there's a tree root that's kind of growing in the trail, like a little snaking into the trail. And my first moment, it's a snake. Sometimes I can jump out of the way even. But I just painted snake over a tree root. And it's actually possible to feel the projected force of these concepts we have. It's really painful how much people do it to each other. We project our ideas on others. But if you can see we're doing it, then wow, look what I'm doing here. I have all these ideas, expectations. And so the paradigm shift is to know about this trick of the mind to keep us locked in to things being more permanent and fixed as they are by seeing things through concepts and to step back a little bit and being able to just take a look and see what's going on directly. If we do, we start seeing that actually in the details of sensory experience, perception, moment by moment, there's a lot that comes and goes. If you were maybe pretty relaxed and attentive and interested in what I'm saying and what I'm talking about is seeing that things come, then they're no longer there. If I speak haltingly like this, you have a clear sense that my words come for a instant and then are no longer there. Hopefully you were irritated. But you see, and then what happens if I speak at a regular pace, you see that actually there's all this arising and passing of sounds. If you stop listening to the meaning of the words, which can happen sometimes, people stop doing that and when they really get concentrated, they just hear the coming and going of sounds. You hear that? It came and it went. Someone, oh no, it's coming and going repeatedly. Someone yelling outside. So in this refrain that the Buddha gives, at some point as we settle in further and the mind is relaxed enough or settled enough to make this paradigm shift away from concepts, ideas, stories, interpretations, judgments, to just seeing and feeling the direct experience of what's happening. We start seeing that things are arising and passing. Sometimes we're more aware of the arising of things, sometimes we're more aware of just the passing of things, and sometimes those happen very quickly together. They're arising and passing. Things are just coming and going, it's fluid, it's flowing, it's moving. And some of it is because of how things are and sometimes because of how we experience it. So I've been in this room for a long time and many times and in some sense it's reasonable to say it's kind of fixed room, it doesn't change. But in fact we are constructing an aspect of this room all the time. We've all kind of made it into a meditation room. I've been here and it's been more of a classroom. We arrange it differently and I've been in here it's more of a conference room. Even I think a few times it's been a dance room. Is that right? Some of you have been here when people are dancing. There was a dance party here a couple of times. Mostly it was these renegade teacher trainees who were being trained to be teachers and that's what they decided to do when they had a free evening. So what is it? It's not a meditation hall inherently. It's a meditation hall because we've constructed it that way. We've painted meditation hall or projected that onto this room. It turns out that idea of meditation hall is not a fixed category. It's a fluid. It's there sometimes. They're not there the times. And so when I see this room I kind of see it as fluid. I feel like it's pulsing and moving and it's not really solid. It's the way I see it. Of course it's solid. But I'm so aware of how the experience of it is conditioned by my ideas and thoughts and those are changing all the time. It's fascinating to see that interplay of my thoughts, my ideas, my perspectives and what's going on there. So there's all these deep ways of seeing internally, externally seeing. Things arise, things pass, things are fluid, things flow, things are changing. And if you try to stop change, if you kind of have a good heart-to-heart talk with reality and say you know you've been changing a lot. My whole life you've been changing moment by moment. You know it's you need to give me a break. No more change. Finished. At least for today. You're not going to have much success in stopping change. If you try to hold on to things, resist things that change that are going to change anyway, you'll suffer. It'll hurt. So as we get this experience, feel, see, tune into this changing nature of how things are always changing, we've learned how to put aside or see through the concepts, stories, ideas enough to be in this flow of arising and passing, then it becomes clear, much more clear how unsatisfying it is to cling or resist or strain or push or try to reach for something. And it's just not satisfying. It's more satisfying to be relaxed. And as we relax and let go, we come to the third step of the refrain which is described as a wonderful expression, having just enough mindfulness for the purposes of bare knowledge and lucid awareness. And I like this because it's just enough mindfulness. I think it's lovely. Though you're not supposed to kind of have mindfulness. You're like, it's, you know, at the hundred percent level, like a hundred percent mindful. You don't have to push a lot or try to set a high, high standard for what awareness is supposed to be. Just be aware enough. Just to be alive is enough. Just be aware enough so you can know what's happening. You kind of know the simplicity of what's here. And one of those descriptions is just bear attention to here to know that this is a body. I'm here in a body. Here in the present moment, I'm just here. I'm walking. I'm sitting. Just as simple as kind of knowledge. Nothing fancy. Nothing that needs a PhD. And then this lucid awareness. Maybe if lucid seems a little bit, you can't relate to it, a clarity of awareness. So just mindful enough that there's a clarity of awareness. And you know the basic experience, know things in the most basic way of how they are. How they appear without stories and interpretations and judgments. Very simple. This is that simplicity of being. Where just being alive is enough. And we're not searching, stretching, straining, trying to make something happen, trying to fix something, trying to get away from something, judging whatever is happening. We're just there in a very satisfying way. And if we can trust that, relax into that way of being, then at some point it gets more and more clear that clinging is unsatisfactory, unsatisfying. And we have this phenomenal perspective for seeing the unsatisfactory nature of clinging, of grasping. That someone who just walking, you know, just living their normal life, could never even imagine to have this kind of sensitivity to see how unsatisfying and even painful clinging, grasping is. And then there can be, because of the simplicity of being, we don't have to let go. Something lets go. And what lets go is the clinging. And then so the last step says, a person dwells, not dependent, not clinging to anything in the world. And the language is not dependent. So there's nothing we're depending on anymore. And I'm sure we can come up with protests. What do you mean not dependent? I have to depend on eating and drinking and things like that. But in a psychological way, our heart no longer depends on anything for its happiness, for its safety. Because the safety that is such an important part of being alive is found within. We are safer when we don't cling. The deepest and the kind of harm, deepest hurt, deepest suffering we struggle with has more to do with what happens in the heart. Clinging, grasping, tightening, contracting, closing. Then it has to do with what happens to us. But that's very hard to see and very hard to appreciate until the heart is ready for that, until there's some readiness and until there's some deep... Something has worked itself out and healed in important ways. But then to realize that if I don't depend on anything, if I don't depend on the car having four tires with air, then if you see the flat tire, okay, well, my well-being is unfortunate. I have to do something now. But my sense of inner peace, my sense of being at home in my ancestral homeland is untouched by the flat tire. I can be at peace. I can be happy. I find safety because my heart is safe from the movements of clinging, grasping, resisting, tightening, judging, that can be so deeply ingrained inside of us. So like second nature almost. So this process of observing, seeing, being present, being aware, being really here, walking down the steps, washing your hands, opening doors, closing doors, being with your steps as you walk, just stepping and stepping, of being maybe in meditation, seated meditation, and just being with this breath, the arising of the inhale, the passing of the inhale, the arising of the exhale, the passing of the exhale. These are profound experiences. These are not incidental. They're not something that is unimportant. These open up for us to discover the treasure, the wonder, the specialness of being conscious, of being aware. It's when we become aware and really are curious and interested. What is it to be aware? How is it to be aware? What am I aware of? Am I aware directly? Am I aware through my stories? Am I aware through my ideas? And to kind of relax and settle and relax with this awareness, relax the tensions and the agitations that ruffle the awareness, that cloud the awareness. It's a process. So the refrain is a four-step process, but it's even a process to get there. Sit watching your breathing. Do the walking meditation. Walk down the steps with attention. It's a whole thing's a process. And the wonderful thing that I love is that it doesn't matter how far you are in this process, where you are. Don't be concerned with your progress. Just give yourself over to practicing with what is happening for you now. That's beautiful. The sincerity of just practicing as things are. If you're done doing your beautiful teachings about practicing when you're tired, just being tired, then be mindful of that. If you have energy, be mindful of that. However you are, the sincerity of meeting you as you are, that's what opens up to this deep process that will find you. So thank you. And we'll sit for maybe quietly for a minute and then I have an announcement.
