The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Click. Okay. Hi everybody. So tonight I'm gonna talk about a supportive factor of
loving kindness that I'm not sure is really talked about much in happy hour,
but that is a factor of calm or tranquility. And it's a supportive factor of
mind for developing deepening meta that also supports developing equanimity.
And equanimity is important because it's what separates loving kindness from
craving affection or attached affection. A little thread of equanimity in the
loving kindness practice is what makes it a drama vihara and not just an
affectionate kind of emotion, right? So start out with the mythic story that some
of you may have heard. It's a story of the elephant and elegyri and the Buddha.
And elegyri was a trained military elephant back in the time of the Buddha.
And another member of the Buddha's sangha who did not wish him well, who wanted
to sow the seeds of division in the sangha, got this elephant drunk,
enraged it, and then untied it and basically aimed it at the Buddha. So
you can imagine an enraged, drunk, huge beast hurtling itself at the Buddha.
And the Buddha's attendant was with him and got really scared and like tried to
get in front of the Buddha to block this elephant. I don't think that strategy
would have worked, but he tried. And the Buddha said, no, no, no, no. Let me handle
this. And the way the myth goes, the Buddha's loving kindness, his meta, his calm
were so strong that as this elephant rampaged towards him, it slowed to a walk
and then it kneeled down and offered its trunk and its shoulder for the Buddha to
mount it as anyone would mount an elephant in those days. Really quite
remarkable. So that's the myth. I do not see this myth to suggest that any of you
should attempt to meet aggression with nothing more than loving kindness and
calm. That's not the point here. In fact, there's a story, the very famous
meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg, one of the first meta teachers in this
country. She was in India going to visit her teacher in a rickshaw and a person
accosted them, attacked them, trying to steal her purse. And they eventually
fought the guy off and continued the trip. But when she got to her teacher in
Indraji, she was quite shaken and she said, what should I have done? And he
looked at her with this great compassion and kindness in his eyes. And he said,
my dear, with all the loving kindness in your heart, you should have whacked him
over the head with your umbrella. So that's on the physical point. But loving
kindness can, of course, de-escalate situations. I'm more interested at the
moment in talking about the story of Malagiri, this enraged elephant, as an
analogy for how we relate to the animal nature, animal energies and drives in
our own hearts and minds, and perhaps those in others. In this analogy, the
Buddha represents the calm, awakened, meta mind. Meets and transforms
aggressive or misdirected rage unleashed by division, illusion. Our mind, when
awake, infused with loving kindness, calm, meta, can meet and transform our
own animal drives to more kind of a purified energies capable of collaborating
with our better nature of supporting us as we ride them. It doesn't matter if
these energies are greed or hatred, delusion, inappropriate desire,
aggression, whatever, it can be met and transformed. So that's the notion. Since
we don't talk much about calm or tranquility and happy hour, I'm just
going to say a few words about it before we start meditating. So calm is very
different than boredom. And one of the differences is that there's not the
aversion in the calm. There's not a resistance to calm. Instead, it's a
kind of relaxation, a quiet happiness that can support a still more quiet
happiness. And while it's not equanimity, it can be a great support for
cultivating equanimity. One of the best ways to cultivate calm is to
support the tranquility that's already there in any little corner of your
body, your heart, your mind, and then relaxing the body without demanding,
forcing, requiring, but rendering an invitation. One of my mentors invites us
to drop this phrase in something like, may the body relax. It's dropping and
seeing how it feels. And then may the heart relax. May the mind relax. Just
noticing whatever the response is. The breath is also your ally as it is in
any meditation. Longer outbreaths, as many of you know, calm the nervous
system down. Mostly appreciating any calm that's already there. That helps
accrue without expecting more. Okay, so that's my introduction. I'm going to
turn off the ability to unmute in case we get more people in. I'll turn it back
on at the end, I promise. Just want to invite you now to settle in, settle
back. If it's helpful to turn off your camera, you can do that. Make sure
any alerts that might be prone to come up on your computer or on any other
device are silenced, just for your own peace of mind, softening the eyes,
perhaps closing them, softening the belly, scanning through the body. If you
haven't already offering that invitation, may this body relax. One or
two deeper than normal breaths, help them. Shunt me allowing the exhale to
be longer than the inhale. Allowing the breath to return to something
natural. But still, allowing the exhale to be longer if it wants to be or
even just noticing the exhale more than the inhale. Releasing tension from
the day. Acknowledging any tension in the heart, the mind, the body that
remains with kindness, gentleness, softening the eyes and the eye
seconds, maybe imagining a spreading of relaxation along the brow, the area
between the eyes and behind the eyes. Almost like it's a still,
perfectly mirror, quiet lake. Even allowing that image or sense, the
spreading quiet lake to spread through your heart, your chest, solar
light. Noticing the rhythm of the breath.
The support beneath your body, cushion that germ, resting into that
support.
Noticing any feelings of relaxation, calming, depreciating those
feelings. You can appreciating the intention towards tranquility.
Allowing awareness to fill the whole body, resting in the body, resting
in the rhythm, sensation, breath.
Then inviting on each other. Letting go, letting go, letting go,
letting go.
Relaxation to deepen.
Letting go, the checksail.
And at the end, to the bottom of the next exhale, if it feels
useful, the invitation is to rest for a moment in the pause between
the exhale and the inhale. Perhaps holding it for just a
microsecond. And it might not truly be there. Resting in that
silence that stillness.
Appreciating any sensations that are arising through pleasant.
Acknowledging everything that's arising.
Nothing much.
Now, calling to the heart, calling to the mind, a being who
exudes calm kindness, or inspires calm kindness in you, in this
heart. Perhaps a visualization, an image of them.
Maybe a felt sense of them in your heart, or in the moon, as if
they're nearby.
Or even an idea of them.
Seen or unseen. Feeling what it feels like to invoke their
presence.
And as they solidify, the idea of them becomes more present.
Wishing them well.
And perhaps, if it works for you.
Imagining them wishing you well.
Breathing and appreciating them.
Breathing out as a quiet, gentle offering of goodwill.
Kindness, benevolence.
Care.
If it's helpful to focus these intentions of kindness,
friendliness with words, please do.
I will offer a few and please use your own in your own language,
especially if you have one to work well for you.
The invitation to support calm and samadhi stability.
To use very short phrases, even single words.
Safe, peaceful, free.
Happy.
Safe.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Time to time, checking in.
Facing whatever is there, the heart, the mind, the body.
Savoring good intentions.
Appreciating and calling kindness.
And acknowledging loving awareness, anything else.
Turning the attention to offering good wishes to this other one.
Perhaps you might imagine dropping the wish like a drop of water
into that still, quiet lake.
Running it ripple out from the heart center through the body.
All corners of the body.
All corners of the heart and mind.
All corners of the body.
All corners of the body.
All corners of the body.
Ending the scope of the kindness, good wishes to include yourself and this other one.
May we be happy.
Safe.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Perhaps imagining this kindness now.
Like a wellspring within, a wellspring from deep in the calm of the body.
Being that death in the heart, the mind, the body.
Like a spring at the bottom of a placent calm, clear lake.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Now expanding the quiet ripples, calm ripples of kindness, love,
friendliness out further, perhaps staying with this other one and both of you exuding
this benevolence, this friendliness outwards.
Close, nearby perhaps, household, neighborhood.
Human and non-human.
Whoever feels natural to be in its path.
Gentle intentions.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Time to time checking in on the quality of the mindfulness, the awareness of the body and sensation
and greeting any of those, any feelings with kind living awareness.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Kind and gentle, half smile.
Be happy.
Safe.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Whatever is arising, meeting it with metta.
Peaceful.
Now the invitation is to expand the circle of metta.
Outwards and unbounded in all directions, above and below, around and everywhere.
Allowing it to gently flow.
Meeting beings in its path, beings that may come to mind.
Beings that might especially need it.
Or just all beings, unknown beings.
Be happy.
Safe.
Peaceful.
Free.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
For the last moments of this meditation, the invitation is to let go of any visualizations,
beings and allowing the heart and mind to pass or vest, savor or kindly meet experiences
that flow through this moment, this body, heart and mind.
Just as it is.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Peaceful.
Thank you friends for your practice.
Now it has become my custom, our custom when I'm teaching, I should say.
The invitation is to stay with yourself, with your metta.
And if you're comfortable to turn on your video and to take a moment to offer kindness,
friendliness, silently to each of your fellow happy hour sangha mates.
They've just got a tile, you can just wish it to the tile.
Just to take a moment.
It's interesting that each person is also offering you kindness and receiving that.
Thank you.
If anyone would like to unmute and offer a short reflection or comment,
the floor is open for a few minutes, therefore we continue at the evening.
One thing about introducing tranquility and calm into meditation is a lot of times folks feel less verbal.
So just to acknowledge that and bow to it.
If you'd rather put something in the chat, you could do that.
You don't have to do anything at all. You can just sit here and be from the winter too.
So the next invitation is for those who want to.
It's not a requirement.
I'm going to open breakout groups.
An invitation is if you don't want to, but you want to be here until the end.
You can just decline the invitation and I'll rebalance the groups as best I can.
It's just going to be about six minutes.
Perhaps some offer to each other.
Anything you want to share about how that was for you
and about how kindness and calm support each other in your practice or in your life, either one.
The conversation involves elsewhere, that's fine too.
So I'm about to set up the breakout rooms here.
And um, let's see.
Okay, so I will see you all in a little bit or some of you in a little bit.
Enjoy.
Okay, welcome back folks as we're coming back in.
People have about another 30 seconds.
Any thoughts about how that was for you?
Did you notice anything you learned from what you said?
Hi everybody.
Welcome back.
So I'm curious if anyone wants to share how that was for you.
Either about the meditation or about the conversation, something you learned.
You know, Sneel.
I just found it super relaxing.
Super chill.
I dozed a little, but it was okay.
Sometimes I dozed and I'm like, oh no, I'm sleeping here.
Everything was just okay.
I really found it just very nice and warm and comforting.
It sounds like the calm then also touched into some equanimity for you.
Dozing, it's okay.
Yes, I would have to say it did.
I hadn't thought of it, but yes.
Anything you take away from that experience beyond enjoying it?
Well, yeah, right.
You know, it's nice to be able to be settled that way.
You know, right, because there were lots of times in life, you know, I just flew today and my plane was like an hour and a half late.
In five minute increments, it seemed, you know, I sure could have like used, you know, you know, this practice more at that time.
You know, so I kind of, you know, kind of try to want to remember, you know, that, you know, I'm able to pull this up.
Great.
And part of this, these experiences are reference points, right?
Even just remembering, oh, that's possible.
Where's the calm in my body right now?
Even if it's only in my little toe.
Any others? Hi, Greg. Yes.
I'll share a little vignette that I actually shared with some people previously.
I certainly haven't worked with elephants or made an elephant bow.
I have worked with other large animals, so a fair amount.
And I was just reflecting on a horse that outweighed me by about a thousand pounds that I was given to work with who had hospitalized two people who were previous to me getting them.
And, yeah, a friend of mine had written him.
But he wrote him by physical capabilities, a very accomplished rodeo rider.
I was kind of given him because I was kind of known as the guy who would get along with difficult horses.
So a net on this is maintaining a sense of calm in that situation with an animal that has an exquisite nervous system who reacts roughly nine times faster than you can as a human being.
And experiencing the kind of provocation that you're dealing with, striking out and raring, all this kind of stuff.
But if you can maintain a sense of equanimity and calm, and that's key, and if you can transmit that sense of intent, which is both psychological and physical and is rapidly interpreted by this sense of the animal,
over time, the proverbial mini drops of rain wears the marble, and eventually over time, it took several months, but I managed to detune that animal and calm it down and smooth it out and actually made it rideable by people who were a little less capable.
But it was really by then to being calm in the face of extreme provocation and maintaining equanimity.
So in that sense, I found that sort of the horse training thing to be great, a great spiritual training of the sort.
Great, great example and great thank you for sharing it.
And talking about I've heard described as a non complimentary response, which is the ability to respond on an emotional tenor, not by mirroring it, which is our tendency with other people and with animals, you know, based with an aggressive dog or something
like that, right. And that non complimentary response has been shown to short circuit, and eventually calm, what otherwise might be an escalating situation.
So it's beautiful to hear your story and it also applies for our own internal landscape right. If I'm upset about being upset, what happens.
Yeah, it's an interesting situation where if you can't win by physical intimidation, which if the horse is big enough and strong enough and violent enough.
Then you got to do something else.
And that's something else is well how do I, how do I tend to change them by my example, which they pick up and resonate on what I always used to just call intent.
I've seen a work I've seen a work with with angry range bowls to which is interesting so whatever.
Yeah, thank you. Beautiful. As a hospital chaplain.
I'm often sent to the most upset family members and raged and angry for the same reason. It also works with enraged humans.
But, but if they're met with something approaching love, kindness, the, the intent, as you call that it ripples through our soma or being, as well as our language.
We are approaching time very rapidly here. And probably time for one last short one or two word comment or a chat if you would like. Otherwise, I'm going to just dedicate the merit.
You all.
Oh, go pick streets.
This is a silent show until.
Is that Guernica.
You're still muted. We can't hear you.
I'm sorry. Yes, Guernica Picasso 1936 is reaction to the beginning of the Spanish Civil War with airplanes bombing the village.
Another reason to maintain calm.
So friends, we've reached the end of happy hour. Thank you so much for your practice for coming for sharing, whether you shared out loud or just in your hearts, your practice.
May this practice that we do here together may ripple out from us from our hearts, outwards to the lives we touch to the lives they touch and so on.
May all be happy, safe, peaceful.
Thank you and be well.
Thank you, Don. Thank you, Don. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.
