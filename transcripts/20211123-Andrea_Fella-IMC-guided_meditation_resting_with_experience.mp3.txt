 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Beginning with just connecting with yourself in this moment. In a simple way, how are you? Not detailed, but just the overall sense of yourself in this moment. Maybe a simple check-in around agitated or ease, tense or relaxed. And no judgment, just simply kind of acknowledging this is how this being is in this moment. When we do connect without judgment to just how we are, that is an expression of care for ourselves. We would perhaps experience that if somebody was sitting with us asking, how are you, no judgment, just checking in. Mindfulness, in a way, is that kind of connection for ourselves. Caring, friendly attention. And as we do connect with that kind of caring, friendly attention, it can have an effect. So beginning there, just taking in how you are, acknowledging it with this kind of allowing, caring attention. And perhaps noticing or allowing, recognizing whether there is an effect or a kind of shift related to being present with ourselves. Sometimes there can be, not always, but sometimes there can feel like a little bit more space, a little bit of kind of having been acknowledged, yes, this is how I am. Sometimes that can allow us to land more fully here in this moment. And whether there is tension or relaxation or agitation or ease, it can be helpful to just kind of see if there are places or ways to relax more fully. Relaxation is a great support for being present. We might scan briefly through the body, checking in. Maybe the head, face and neck can relax a little bit more. Shoulders, arms and hands, maybe there can be a softening there. Chest and upper back. Can there be a relaxation of the upper part of the torso? A softening across the stomach and abdomen, the middle and lower back, the hips. Maybe the legs, feet can also relax. Perhaps also a little more deeply inside the body can soften or release a little bit. Maybe there can be a little more release or relaxation inside the throat. The area around the heart, perhaps that can soften and relax. The stomach and the intestines. And other than trying to hold our body up, let it be supported by the earth. The structure of our skeleton, allowing this alertness, this erectness. Maybe all the muscles can relax around the bones. And letting go of this conscious exploration of relaxation. What's obvious in this moment? What is awareness aware of? What's most natural or easiest to be aware of? To be connected with an experience. Often it's something in the body or the experience of hearing. Can there be a simple curiosity to receive, connect with what's already easily available to connect with? It might be the breath. It might be a broader sense of the body, kind of. Sensations through the body of vibration or pulsing or tingling or heat or coldness, pressure. It might be hearing, aware of sound, the sound of my voice or sounds in your environment. Sometimes the attention may settle with something and just stay there for a while, rest with the breath for a while perhaps. Or just rest with the vibratory energy of the body or some body sensation. And at times the attention may shift from experience to experience. The body sensation and then the sound and then a breath. If that's happening, the rest, the resting can be with just knowing, just aware. We might sometimes have the idea that the mind can rest when it lands with just one thing. And if there's a lot of experience, it's not resting. There can be this quality of resting with receiving experience. And of resting in the flow of change, like you might rest on the surface of the ocean when there are waves rising and falling. Or allow yourself to be carried downstream by a current without fighting it. What is obvious for you in this moment and how is the attention connecting with it, just landing with an experience or shifting between experience? They are both valid forms of mindfulness. And whatever form feels most natural to you, most easeful in this moment, most available in this moment, the mind will wander. It will forget about being present, about staying connected. Not much to do while the mind is lost, but in the moment when we notice, and we will notice, in that moment of noticing, mindfulness is back. Often we're noticing, I was lost. I wasn't mindful. But that's not what's happening right now. Right now, mindfulness is back. What's it connecting to? What is it aware of? It might be anything in experience. It could be an emotion, a thought, a sound, body sensation. As mindfulness returns, what are you aware of? Sometimes if a thought has been strong, kind of sticky, we can feel a pull to want to continue to think, to let go of the mindfulness and just get absorbed in that thought again. If possible, notice that pull and see if you can land in this moment with kind of the terrain or the landscape that is here now, given that you had been thinking. Really, you're not trying to turn away from what a thought was doing, but really landing with here in this moment, what has been shaped by the previous moments? Curious. As we checked in at the very beginning, how is this being right now? With honesty and compassion and care. What's here? Maybe that relaxation will support you again. You're welcome to explore that. How are you in this moment? What is obvious? And exploring this possibility of resting with however you are. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
