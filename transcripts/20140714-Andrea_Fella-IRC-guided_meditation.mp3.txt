So, allowing yourself to just notice how you are now.
No right or wrong to how you are.
Just how are you right now?
What's the experience?
What's obvious?
Are you aware?
Are you aware?
And what is awareness aware of?
Whatever awareness is naturally aware of can be simply known.
Are you aware?
What are you aware of?
And at the early part of the retreat, in the early part of a sitting, after kind of landing
in the experience, just acknowledging how you are, what's happening for you now.
If you notice there's some tension, allowing a conscious releasing and relaxing of tension
in your body and mind.
As a retreat goes on, I usually do this with the requests.
First, may the body relax and see how the body and mind respond to that request.
May the mind relax.
May the body relax.
May the mind relax.
And as the body and mind kind of settle through this exploration of relaxation.
You may start to recognize that awareness is simply doing its job.
Awareness is happening, mindfulness happening and objects are being known.
And after a moment, there's body sensation and sound, thoughts and emotions.
Awareness functions very naturally.
Can you be aware of that natural flow of experience through awareness?
Awareness can take some intentionality, reminding yourself to be aware.
But we don't have to pick the object.
We remind ourselves to be aware, and notice what objects are there.
If you find that the mind has difficulty or kind of
struggles with seeing what is already present.
You could first recognize that struggling is happening, trying to see is happening,
searching for an object is happening.
Just acknowledge that.
And then it can be helpful to actually pick some obvious physical sensation, some obvious
experience, often a physical sensation to begin.
And then as you're attending to that sensation, you might start to recognize that while you're
noticing that pressure or in-breath and out-breath or vibration or whatever you're paying attention
to, that the awareness also is noticing other things.
You're knowing the vibration and there's hearing that you're aware of that is being
known.
No need to have an agenda to stay with any particular experience.
Are you aware?
What are you aware of?
Is thinking happening?
Can you know it is just thinking?
From time to time, check your relationship with your experience, check the attitude.
In particular, if it feels like there's any sense of struggle, there's usually some hidden
attitude, there will be some hidden attitude if there's struggle happening.
Listen to that.
The interest about even the struggle.
Are you aware?
What's obvious?
It's obvious in this moment.
How about now?
Relax.
Let the mind do its job of awareness.
