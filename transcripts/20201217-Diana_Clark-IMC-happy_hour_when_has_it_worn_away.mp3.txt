The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So a really warm welcome, warm welcome to everybody. It's a delight to be practicing with you all.
And tonight I wanted to talk about this idea of we just keep on coming back. We keep on coming back to the practice.
We keep on coming back to the breath, if that's our practice with mindfulness, or we keep on coming back to happy hour,
or we keep on coming back to the object of loving kindness or compassion practice, or whatever it is that we're doing.
This idea of beginning again, coming back, hanging in there, having some perseverance.
Even if it's not, you know, rock solid, we're there 100% every time.
But just this idea of maybe it's not giving up.
So sometimes we might have these ideas that, well, I've been practicing for so long, X amount of time,
and I have these expectations that something should be happening, that whatever it might be, should be happening by now.
And for some of you who've been coming here, you know that sometimes I talk about how independent of what happens
while we're actually on the cushion, that there might be some, the way that the outcome of the practice shows up is not on the cushion.
So even though on the cushion we might be creating the conditions and practicing with loving kindness,
maybe we don't feel any particular loving kindness, maybe we do, and maybe we don't.
But then where we start to see it is in our daily life.
It's when the way that we respond to mistakes or the way that we respond to some setbacks or some difficulties.
And there's a few similes that the Buddha uses when he's talking about just this idea of kind of like hanging in there.
And maybe we don't see the small, the incremental changes that are happening because they're small and incremental.
So here's one description that the Buddha is using to describe this, the activity of development, how it affects us.
When carpenters look at the handle of their axes, they see the impressions of their fingers and their thumb.
But they do not know so much of the axe handle was worn away today and so much was worn away yesterday and so much was worn away earlier.
But when it has worn away, the knowledge occurs to them that it has worn away.
So it's like it's not until after it's really obvious that we notice, but we can't point to, oh yeah, it was because of that thing I did on that particular Tuesday or whatever it might be.
But instead it's just this very gradual, incremental change that doesn't happen, but it's just very small, but it adds up.
And then here's another simile, another visual.
Suppose there was a seafaring ship bound with rigging that had been worn away in the water for six months.
So that's a long time just for the rope to be in the water for six months.
It would be hauled up on dry land during the cold season and its rigging would be further attacked by wind and sun.
Here's the rope now gets influenced by other things, wind and sun.
Inundated by rain from a rain cloud, the rigging would easily collapse and rot away.
So too, when someone dwells devoted to development, their feathers easily collapse and rot away.
This idea that there's these different elements that have an impact on the rope.
In this case it's symbolic for things that bind us, things that get in the way of freedom and ease,
things that have us connected or attached to things that aren't helpful.
So just this recognition of perseverance or diligence, persistence, these types of things.
But it's tricky to talk about this because what we don't want to set up is this feeling like that we have to strive and that we have to strain
and that we have to force something to happen.
Especially with loving-kindness practice, we want to approach it with some softness and some ease.
But just to approach it again and again and again with some open-heartedness with some, well, we'll see how it is today.
And for me, I'll say that this had a big impact on me that at the beginning when I started meditation practice, I could sit on the floor on the cushion.
I don't remember exactly, but maybe it was like 10 minutes and then my body was starting to complain and I'm looking around me
and feeling the peer pressure at the meditations that everybody else is sitting with,
sitting on the cushion and I was always having to adjust my posture.
But like, okay, okay, that's just the way it is. I wanted to hear the teachings so I came.
And then I didn't even really notice that just slowly I was just able to sit longer and longer and just not having to shift my posture
without even really making that a particular goal necessarily. It just happened.
But just again and again. So maybe you yourself have a similar experience.
Maybe just sitting in any meditation posture.
It just gets easier and easier. Our body gets used to it.
And we can't point to exactly what time or exactly what thing that we did that made all the difference.
So with that as an introduction, let's do some meditation practice.
So taking an alert upright posture.
And maybe beginning with three long slow deep breaths as a way to connect as a way to like easily find kind of like these exaggerated breaths.
And then allowing the breath to return to normal.
Interesting that the body knows how to breathe.
You can just check in with the sensations of the body and seeing if there are any obvious places.
There might be some tension or tightness around the eyes and the jaw, common places.
And the shoulders. Sometimes we find our shoulders are hitched around our ears.
And we allow them to relax and to fall away from the ears.
And feeling connected to the chair or cushion, putting the pressure on the backside of the legs.
And feeling the feet, another place where we can feel grounded and connected.
And using our awareness of the body to support feeling connected and also to support maybe having some less tension, less tightness.
And then to rest the attention on the sensations of breathing.
The movement of the chest or abdomen.
And when we notice the mind is spinning stories or lost in a story with gentleness, with ease.
And then begin again with the sensations of breathing.
Allowing the attention to rest with the movement of the body associated with breathing.
And then to begin our loving kindness practice.
Starting where it's easy. Bringing to mind a loveable being.
And then we have a complicated relationship. Someone is just easy to feel care, warmth, goodwill, benevolence, kindness, love.
And we can connect with this loveable being. Whether it's a person we know or an imaginary kitten, puppies, babies.
Is there a way to connect with this being either with the image or maybe with the felt sense in whatever way that makes sense to you.
And feel the reason why you're using them as a loveable being. Feel the love, the warmth, the kindness you have towards this being.
And to support our cultivating loving kindness. Support our perseverance or again and again bringing the mind back.
You can say these phrases. Also with a recognition that you can choose your own phrases.
These ones don't resonate, don't seem quite right for you.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy. May you live with ease.
May you be safe. May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
We're just inclining the word in mind towards warmth and care.
With this practice.
So that it's available to us at other times, readily available.
And then to extend our loving kindness to include ourselves.
Sometimes we neglect sending loving kindness to ourselves.
So is there a way that you can connect with yourself out of the felt sense of sitting here right now.
Or maybe an image of yourself.
Some people like to do an image of when they were young.
A child.
You're welcome to experiment and find what's easiest for you to connect.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
Can be really helpful to have a sense of the body.
In the heart area in the chest.
And allowing that to support the loving kindness.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
And many of us can be wise and helpful to just stay with these two practices of loving kindness with the lovable being and for oneself.
Without extending it to more difficult people, but really allowing the heart and the mind to get really drenched in loving kindness.
So that it's just overflowing.
Sometimes I might feel like it's appropriate to extend loving kindness.
It's not your choice where they'd like to stay here, the lovable being and oneself.
Or if you'd like to bring to mind a neutral person, somebody we don't know.
Or perhaps you see in the neighborhood on occasion.
Maybe a coworker that's a new coworker that you don't really know.
Maybe one Zoom, maybe somebody in this Zoom session right now.
And we extend our loving kindness to people we don't know.
And be helpful, albeit not the easiest, to have a mental image of the neutral person.
And connect with that image.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be safe.
May you be safe.
May you be safe.
And then to do some equanimity practice to help us stay balanced.
These practice bring to mind somebody that you care about, you have a relationship with.
And sometimes they're a little bit irritating.
Not the most difficult person you know.
Sometimes they're a little irksome.
And for this practice, you have this phrase,
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
And then in this last portion of the meditation, you can do whatever practice seems to be supported for you right now.
Maybe to refresh some of the kindness going back to the loveable being.
Maybe to stay with equanimity and maybe to do mindfulness of breathing.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
And then to end this meditation, though your feet on the ground, the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body, and when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes.
So this idea of maybe we come to our meditation practice and maybe it doesn't feel alive or juicy in some kind of way, but we just keep on coming back.
There's something to be said for the diligence or the perseverance, as well as it can be some gentle inquiry like is there is there a little bit of resistance or is there I've just fallen into inertia.
And I'm just doing the same thing over and over because that's what I've done before.
So we can couple gentle inquiry into our practice if we find that we're coming back and back and doesn't seem like anything is changing.
And couple that with the recognition of course things don't change right away and every time we come to the cushion practice and sometimes we'll sit down to do some loving kindness practice and everything except loving kindness arises.
This is part of the practice to recognize that that happens.
So now I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms, where you can talk about this idea of coming back and back to the practice again and again.
Even though sometimes it's maybe uncomfortable or difficult or not so easy to do.
But then again I want to emphasize to do this in a way in which we're not beating ourselves up in a way that honors and respects ourselves and what's happening in our minds.
Yes, I'm sorry I have a hearing loss. So I had trouble understanding a lot of what you were saying. I'm sorry. But it sounded sort of can you understand me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it sounded it sounded somewhat similar to the talk you gave this morning. Is that true.
No, in the sense that this morning was about compassion. And this when I was about loving this this evening's about loving kindness and more about the idea of just coming back again and again.
And I'm sorry that this weren't able to hear me.
Is this make a difference if I put the microphone closer.
Yeah.
Can you hear this better.
And I think I'm speaking a little bit later to I think maybe that my voice dropped. Yes, Wendy's nodding her head I can see. Yeah, okay. So my apologies for that.
Can I give a quick hint as someone who has a severe hearing loss.
It's really helpful when you go into the breakout groups to just tell people that you didn't hear it properly and by listening to how people talk you pick up a lot and that's how you can put it together because I've been in the same situation Brian thank you.
My apologies. Maybe you can. I don't know is this a signal like just like I can't hear you but I don't always have my eyes open to you right so yeah my my apologies.
Okay, so breakout rooms.
If you have an opportunity you can talk about this idea of coming back again and again, or you can talk a little bit about what the heck did Diana say I hardly heard it.
So, let's go in alphabetical order by screen name. And then you can go around the circle, and maybe just the first time around just say one or two things you don't have to say your whole everything you know, or all of your thoughts about the topic.
And then goes from the first person of the second and third and for some of you will be in rooms of four, and then allowed to come back around so that the first person has a second time, a second opportunity to speak.
And maybe they have something new or different to say, having heard of everybody else. So in this way you can create things.
There's something new together. Okay, enjoy.
Okay, we don't have a lot of time but would somebody like to make a comment about something they learned or was interesting or a question from the small groups.
Well, I mean, since, since I, you know, hadn't heard a lot of what you said I took someone else's advice and in the breakout room I, I asked them, I asked the other three specifically about your comment about coming back again and again and again and what, and I got three different interpretations of it.
It's amazing you've got a very, very rich combination of the meanings in there.
And so this can be rich, right, that we can find our way with it.
This is something I appreciate very much that the, the teachers they have a depth to them. So sometimes we see one thing and other times we see something else.
That's probably true with everything to be asked three different people you'll get three different interpretations.
Thank you, Brian.
