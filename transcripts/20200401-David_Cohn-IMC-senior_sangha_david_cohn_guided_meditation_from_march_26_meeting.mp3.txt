The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Hello everyone. Well, I hope you enjoy this guided meditation and are benefited by it.
Or maybe if you're benefited by it, others around you will be benefited by it. That's the wish.
And my room isn't exactly silent where I'm recording this.
You'll notice there's a little bird in the background tweeting away.
So enjoy that too. Okay.
So please close your eyes and have a comfortable but upright posture.
And relax. Relax the shoulders. Relax the throat.
Relax the face, the eyes, the forehead, behind the forehead.
The big gelatinous brain with all of its little thinking muscles.
Unclench those thinking muscles. Relax the mind.
And behind the eyes, the back of the neck and the jaw.
And down to the chest. Widening and softening the heart.
Coming into the heart and the belly.
And relaxing any agitation, any emotional disturbance. Relax the heart.
And let the mind stop thinking.
Just for a few seconds stop thinking.
And reach into the depths of your calm.
The deep calm in your nature.
The solidity that can always be accessed.
We have this deep calm within us.
Relax into that.
Our core.
Relax the upper back. Lower back.
The front of the torso. The hips.
The thighs. The calves.
And the feet.
Noticing how calm and peaceful the calves are.
And the thighs.
It's their nature.
And softening and relaxing the awareness.
And widening the awareness so that in a global way, the awareness takes in the whole body.
The soft relaxed breathing body.
This is the body.
Now please visualize someone or those you love sitting in front of you.
And say to them, with your whole heart, may you be safe from inner and outer harm.
May you be free from guilt, shame, and hatred.
May you enjoy physical and mental well-being.
May you live with the ease of an open heart.
May you be awakened to your true nature.
Which is an inexhaustible source of love, compassion, and wisdom.
Now please visualize someone or those you find challenging or difficult sitting in front of you.
And you know they will die.
And say to them, with your whole heart, may you be safe from inner and outer harm.
May you be free from guilt, hatred, and shame.
May you enjoy physical and mental well-being.
May you live with the ease of an open heart.
May you be awakened to your true nature.
Which is an inexhaustible source of love, compassion, and wisdom.
Now imagine everyone in the world sitting in front of you.
All over the world, California, the United States, Europe, Asia.
Even unseen beings and animals.
Say to them, with your whole heart, may you all be safe from inner and outer harm.
May you be free from guilt, shame, and hatred.
May you enjoy physical and mental well-being.
May you live with the ease of an open heart.
May you be awakened to your true nature.
Now put yourself in front of you.
And visualize yourself.
You know that you will die.
You don't know when you will die.
You don't know how you will die.
Whether you'll die alone or in a bed surrounded by loved ones.
You'll die from cancer, diabetes, or heart disease.
You don't know how you will die.
An accident.
You don't know when you will die.
It could be this afternoon.
It could be in a few months, a few years, many years.
But you know you will die.
And for this precious time that you have here, now,
whisper yourself the best possible wish that you could whisper yourself.
With all your heart,
what is your deepest wish for yourself?
How do I want to live my life this day?
And for all of my days.
Remember this wish.
And make this wish your vow.
A frame of reference that you can refer to throughout your day.
To deepen your commitment to this intention.
And you could make it your first thought when you wake up in the morning.
And your last thought when you go to bed.
How did I live my day?
We're getting a little too old to not be honest with ourselves.
Did I live my day according to my deepest intention?
And when did I get lost?
And then with compassion for yourself.
And go to sleep.
And now visualizing yourself in front of you again.
With your whole heart,
say to yourself, may I be safe from inner and outer harm.
May I be free from guilt, shame, and hatred.
May I enjoy physical and mental well-being.
May I live with the ease of an open heart.
May I be awakened to my true nature.
An inexhaustible source of love, compassion, and wisdom.
Thank you.
