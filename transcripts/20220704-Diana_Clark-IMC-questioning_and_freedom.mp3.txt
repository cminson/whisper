The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So today on 4th of July Independence Day, America celebrates its independence from
Great Britain. We might say that this is a holiday that celebrates freedom. And of
course freedom means a lot of different things to different people. But one way
that we might think about freedom, that I think that I know I certainly wasn't
thinking about it earlier, but one way to think about it, not the only way, one way
is to ask questions as part of what it means to be free, to have freedom, to ask
questions. Is that true? Is that right? When we think about like you know those
really oppressive places, they don't necessarily have the freedom to ask these
types of questions, to ask any question, to really have this little bit of doubt
and not being sure about everything. And so in some ways we are asserting some
type of freedom when we ask questions, when we investigate, we look into things
for ourselves, rather than just believing what somebody tells us or rather than
just passively consuming all of our experiences or having experiences without
any inquiry, but instead to really be engaged with what's happening, not only
in our spiritual life or meditation practice, but our life in general. We
could even expand out and even say to society this idea of having the freedom
to ask, to be curious, to want to know more. And also this idea of asking
questions is kind of an example of not being completely locked in or
completely stuck, not completely glued to a particular idea or experience, but
instead we have this little bit of maybe of a space between us and an
experience or us and a belief or us and whatever it is that's arising. And of
course, so what are the questions that we ask? We can ask really big
questions as well as just ordinary questions. Some of the big questions
might be, what is it that opens the heart and mind? What is it that allows me, you,
anybody, to not be completely wound up or congealed with a belief or an
experience or something like this? What is it that closes the heart? What is it
that closes the mind? What is it that makes us hold on for dear life? Not asking
any questions at all. It's like, nope, this is the way it is. I know it is. And you
know, don't don't bother me with any of these details or queries or anything
like this. What is it? What is it that allows us to be a bit more open and
spacious? And what is it that causes us to kind of close down and not be open
and spacious? Some other big questions we might ask is, can we live from wisdom?
Can we live from love? Can we have like the best parts of ourselves really be
the foundation, be the bedrock or what informs how we show up in the world, how
we show up for ourselves, how we show up for others? Sometimes it's easy to see
these roots of fear or confusion or greed or hatred and really to see the
suffering that's connected with that. But what would it be like to also see what
is it that's supporting openness and spaciousness and wisdom and warm-heartedness,
the non-greed, the non-hatred, the non-delusion? So these roots of
non-hatred, these roots of love we might say, we could ask how do they show up
in us or how deep are they growing in us? Can we trust them? This might be a
question that we could ask. Sometimes it's certainly in the Buddhist
teachings and I think it's partly human nature we're focusing on these greed,
hatred, and delusion, right? The roots of all suffering, trying to ferret them out
and be mindful when they arise. But we could also ask ourselves about the roots
of the opposites of those. Are they taking, I want to say, are they taking root? Are
they getting implanted in our lives and what might we do to support that? Just as
a, something that was a big teaching for me is just recently I, well recently I'll
say a couple of, more than a few decades ago somebody had given me a plant and it
was to mark a significant occasion. I've been keeping this plant alive in its
same little pot for these, you know, over 20 years and I finally thought like, okay,
this poor thing is looking kind of pathetic. It's really just, you know, a
shadow of its former self, but I don't have a lot of experience in transplanting.
Like, well, here we go. So I managed to get the plant out of the pot that it was
in and, and it was quite something to look at the roots. Of course it was
completely root bound. I think that was why it wasn't growing any longer. But, but
just to see how much growth happens, you know, underneath that we don't see, and I
trimmed some of it off, put it in some new soil and, wow, just given the right
conditions, how things can start to grow, I'm just so amazed. It's only been like
10 days and there's new leaves and, and there's little parts that I can see that's
growing as it might be a whole another, I don't know, something more happening. So
sometimes there's a lot of stuff that's happening underneath that we don't pay
attention to, but when we do pay attention to it, it can grow, it can be a
delight, it can be really supportive to do this. So some of the big questions we
can ask ourselves is, what about the roots of love? What about the roots of
wisdom? How deep are they? And what might we do to support them growing? Support
their growing? Another big question we could ask ourselves is even about this
whole idea of freedom. What does freedom mean for you? Is it just some nice thing
that we think about on 4th of July? Is it something that really drives your
meditation practice, your Buddhist practice, your spiritual practice? Or maybe you
don't have any relationship with it, you never really thought about it, and
there's this big bell in Pennsylvania, I think it's called the Freedom Bell, right?
Maybe that's all that you ever thought, like, okay, it's that thing that I
learned about in high school history class or something. But we could ask
ourselves, what meaning does this have in my life? What are the different ways
that I think about freedom? What are the different ways it shows up in my life? And
has my ideas about freedom, has it changed with my practice? Maybe in the
beginning I thought, like, I don't know what those Buddhists are talking about,
but I know this meditation thing seems to be helpful, so I'm gonna do it. And then
maybe with practice it starts to feel like, oh yeah, with some glimpses of
something that feels less shackled, less restricted. Like, oh, maybe there's
something here. Or maybe you've heard enough Dharma talks or read enough
Dharma books that's a peak to your interest, but I think it's a worthwhile
question for all of us to ask ourselves. What does freedom mean for us? Is there a
freedom from something? Many of us know, of course, right, that the Buddha taught
primarily about the freedom from suffering. Or are we more motivated, the
freedom to, the freedom to question, the freedom to not be pushed around by all
the things that bring up fear or uncertainty, or the freedom to move with
some confidence and ease in this world? And so, with kind of maybe along with
that question is, well, how might I live in the freest way possible? How might that
show up? And with the things that I do, what I say, we train our hearts, we train
our minds in our meditation practice to face fear and confusion and allow joy
to grow in us. So what would it be like to live our lives with that, to bring what
we're learning on the meditation cushion and to bring it into our daily lives? Or
we might have had or are having or some glimpses of some real freedom or some
taste of freedom, but it's not here right now. But even if it's not here right now,
but we have a sense of what's possible or what we have experienced, is there a way
that this can touch our daily lives, impact our daily lives? Is there a way
that even if it's not really ripe and true for us at this moment that we might
be able to ask ourselves if this were true and if I were experiencing this
again, what would I do at this moment? So what would I take to answer some of
these big questions? What is it that opens the heart of mind? Can we live from
love and wisdom? What does freedom mean for me? And can I live from... was it like
to live the freest way possible? What would it take to answer these types of
questions? To answer it so that it's our answer, not something that we have heard
from somebody else or that we think is the maybe the correct, you know,
philosophical or doctrinal answer, but what is that... what might we do to help
support answering these questions for ourselves? Or to live the questions, as
Rilke says in this famous poem. Maybe there's some things simplifying our lives
so that we can stay in touch with these types of things, having a meditation
practice, mindfulness practice, loving-kindness practice, concentration
practice, whatever it might be. Maybe doing service for others is some way
that helps us to express this freedom or to live the question.
This maybe one more question was what would it take to answer these
questions, like rather than just kind of saying, oh yeah that's kind of
interesting and then dropping it. It's a little bit tricky because I don't want to
suggest that we have to find the answers. It's more the openness of the
questioning, so it's more the activity of questioning. It's where there's a lot of
freedom can be found. So in this way, you know, to ask questions is an expression
of freedom, but also freedom allows us to ask questions. So there's a real
relationship between freedom and questions, and we might even say that one
of the ways in which to find in the Buddhist tradition some of the greatest
freedoms is to have some inquiry about, well, who am I? Who is this? Who is asking
these questions? Who has this inquiry? Who is creating these ideas? Who is it
that's telling these stories? And to get curious about that and have some
investigation into that. So that was maybe one function, one benefit, one purpose
of asking questions is that it can lead to greater freedom. Just the asking
itself introduces, you know, an element of openness and spaciousness, but it's
also, many of you may know, questioning might be related to this idea of
investigation, you know, looking into, and investigation is the second factor of
the seven factors of awakening, father's mindfulness, investigation, joy and
energy, I'm sorry, investigation, energy, joy, and then tranquility, concentration,
equanimity. So these seven factors of awakening, all of them support awakening,
and investigation is one of them. And we might even say, let's see, if I remember
correctly, I think it's in the questions to King Melinda, there is a question
about, well, do we really need all seven of these factors of awakening? And the
answer is, well, actually we just need investigation, but in order for
investigation to be as powerful as it might be, we need all the other six for
this awakening. So investigation is also like this looking into something or
asking about it, or having some curiosity about it, is the opposite of
delusion, right? Delusion is this like completely not even being aware, but
asking questions is what doesn't mean you know all the answers, doesn't mean you
know anything, but you're engaged enough that you're not completely deluded. So it
doesn't mean that you have all complete knowledge, it just means that you are
open and present and aware there are things that are not known. So in all
these ways, investigation, asking questions is a real support for freedom
and happiness. Freedom, we might say is the highest happiness, but we don't
always have to have these ideas that it's all about freedom. I'm kind of trying
to tie this into independence day, but we could also talk about just sense of
well-being or happiness. Something else that investigation or asking questions
helps with is that it's actually the antidote to doubt, and some people might
say well doubt feels like it's asking a lot of questions when you don't know, but
doubt is only a hindrance, is only something that gets in the way when
it's filled with a lot of hesitation, filled with a lot of kind of going
around and around in circles due to a lack of clarity. It's a well maybe I
should do this, no wait wait maybe I shouldn't do that, maybe I should do this
other practice, should do mindfulness, wait I'm feeling a little bit not so open
hearted, I'll do some loving kindness practice, oh but wait maybe I should do
some concentration first, but then oh well maybe loving kindness helps me to
do concentration, but you know I've heard that mindfulness is good
concentration, you know how this is right, so let's have an example of how
doubt is kind of you just spinning in circles not really going anywhere. An
in contrast investigation is well let's see what the best thing is to do, I don't
really have clarity right now, but I'm just gonna see how is it, I'm just gonna
do some mindfulness practice right now, and maybe I'll be able to feel into what
practice to do next. So investigation in some ways kind of be seen like turning
on the light in a dark room where you can see clearly, but does it if you can see
clearly doesn't necessarily mean that you know what everything is or what's
behind, what's in the drawers or what that thing is over there in the corner, it
just means that the light is now turned on. We might think sometimes like the
hindrance of doubt is when the light is not turned on, and instead we're bumping
into things and dangling up our shins perhaps or something like this, and maybe
I'll say also that part of the function or purpose or benefit or something that
happens with investigation is the teachings that have been preserved that
come down from the Buddha, they are actually asking for a listening heart, for
a listening mind, for a listening attitude, a listening stance. That is the
practices are offered, and the practices and the understandings are
offered in such a way that the pointing to this idea, well let's see if this matches
your experience. Ehipasiko, come and see for yourself. Now so this opposite of you
know just adopting beliefs is this encouragement to have more of this
listening, this openness, but also this questioning. They ask for the teachings as
for a mind that's paying attention and has wisdom, has some openness, and of
course this is radically different than just simply following the rules. And for
many of us this is what makes the practice so compelling. It's not that a
whole bunch of beliefs that we have to adopt, but instead it's an encouragement
for us to see for ourselves, and I often think about it in this way as if then
statements. If you're interested in having more freedom, then try mindfulness
practice, for example. There's no dogmatic that you have to do this, but if
you're interested in having less suffering, here's something you can try.
If you're not so interested, there's no reason to do this. To this idea, ehipasiko,
the poly words for meanings, come and see. This was quite some time ago, I don't
know, more than a decade, maybe 15 years ago, quite some time ago, when I was doing
something here at IMC that required me to have a password. I don't really now
remember what it was. It was back when we would like share passwords or things.
Remember those days before security on the internet was the way that it is now?
And somebody told me the password, and it was ehipasiko, this poly word, and that
just really highlighted, oh for this person, it was like foundational, it was
like so important to them that they had used it as a password in all kinds of
different things. This invitation to question, this invitation to see for
ourselves, not have to just accept what has been offered, but to explore, be
curious about, examine. So this encouragement to maybe even listen with
some curiosity, maybe a little bit of wonder, rather than trying to confirm
what we already know. I know sometimes this can happen with meditation
practice, like yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. I know the breath, I've been with the breath
so many times, I've seen this in myself, and it's not really connecting with my
experience. But instead there's this encouragement to really have this
curiosity, well okay, I've been with a breath before, but what is it like now?
And what is it like now? So this idea of questioning, I'm just gonna say briefly a
few things about, well, what gets in the way? We like to have answers. So many of
us, we have this idea that well, if I have the answers, then that will protect us.
It'll provide some security, something that'll stable that we can count on. But
there's also a part of us that recognizes nobody knows the future. Even if
you know all kinds of things, it doesn't mean there's gonna be security in the way
that we want. So it's just something we can look at ourselves as, you know, why
we don't ask questions often is because we want to have the answers, we want to
feel like okay, I have it all figured out. I don't need to worry about this
anymore. And of course, there's this, we could ask the wrong kinds of questions too.
There's a story in the sutras about Malunkiyaputta who threatens to leave, he
was a monk and he threatens to leave to disrobe if the Buddha doesn't answer some
of his metaphysical questions about metaphysics, what happens after you die
and these types of questions. And the Buddha said, you know what, I never
promised that I was gonna answer all these questions and I don't answer them,
in fact, because it's not helpful. It's not beneficial, it doesn't lead to peace,
doesn't lead to insight, it doesn't lead to freedom, liberation, awakening, knowing
what happens after we die. And then the Buddha gives this similarly of the
poisoned arrow, chances are many of you have heard about this. This is where a
person is injured by an arrow and then before the doctor can remove it, the
person say, wait, wait, wait, wait, before you remove it, I want to know who shot
that arrow? What do they look like? Where do they live? Who is it exactly? And then
they want to know, well, what was the kind of the tip of the arrow? Was it the
shaped or that shaped? Was the shaft of the arrow made of this or that? And the
feathers of the arrow, were they from this bird or that bird? And like all these
questions, right, here's a person that has an arrow stuck in them and they're
asking all these questions. Well, no, is this feather, do you think this came from
a bird X or bird Y, right, while they're bleeding? And it's silly to think about
that, but I think it's also another question we can ask ourselves. That some
of these questions that we get caught up with, are they really going to lead to
peace? Are they beneficial? Are they supportive? Are they onward leading in
such a way that can support our practice? Or are they the type of questions in
which there really aren't any answers, aren't helpful? So what are some
questions we can ask? What are the conditions that support the arising of
freedom? What are the conditions that support the arising of suffering? Like
some of these fundamental foundational questions in our practice? What is it
that's been clung to when there's suffering? We know that clinging and
suffering go together. Where does this clinging come from? This maybe there's
like an underlying belief or maybe we're clinging to some belief. So some of
these questions and investigation, as a support for our practice, and we might
even ask ourselves, what is the relationship between questioning,
investigation and freedom, liberation, awakening? For us, for you know, all of us
might have our own relationship to that, might have our own idea of how these are
connected. So on this 4th of July, on this day when America celebrates its
independence from Great Britain, initially hundreds of years ago, celebrates
freedom, I wish all of you freedom, ease and happiness. Thank you. If you'd like, I
can answer some questions or if you have any and if you don't that's okay too. Okay
so I'm wishing you all a great 4th of July. Thank you.
