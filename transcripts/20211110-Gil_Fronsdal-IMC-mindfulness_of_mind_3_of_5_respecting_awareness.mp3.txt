 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, this morning the perspective for the topic is that of respect. And as probably you've heard me say many times, that I really like the word respect, actually inspired by it, partly because of its etymological meaning, that it means to look again, to inspect again in the Latin roots. And this idea of having a willingness to not just barrel ahead into the future and keep doing and doing, but to also take a deeper look. Maybe our life, our experience is warrants a second look, a better look, sustained attention. What is really happening here? So we don't take the first impression of things, but we really kind of take time to experience and feel it more deeply. And then as we do this, one of the benefits of it is we begin appreciating the looking itself, the ability to give a second look, that there's something about looking again, looking, seeing, in a relaxed and open, receptive way that's a little bit free or very free of our preconceived ideas, our agendas, our preferences, our bias, all kinds of things that could so easily come along if we just go rapidly from one thing to another. But this thing of consciously deciding, let me look more carefully here, let me be more open, let me take in this experience more fully. That's a kind of sidestepping or kind of putting aside slightly the automatic preconceived ideas that kind of get carried along. Ideas and thoughts and agendas that are directing attention often. I want this, I want that, I want this. And that some of us can experience kind of acutely if we're surfing on the web, on the computer, just kind of going from one thing to the other, seeing this and that and looking. And it's mind is being directed all the time. But to step back and be willing to look again, look more carefully. At some point, the looking becomes, the fact that we're looking, the act of looking becomes kind of special. You know, I've been in places where wonderful vistas, great vistas, you know, maybe high up in the mountains with the great views of the landscape or below or on the beach looking out across the ocean. And for me, at least, there's something about the panoramic view of lots of space and openness and then kind of relaxed looking that I just enjoy looking. And after a while, certainly I'm appreciating what I see, but I also appreciate the relaxed, open, kind of receptive, just looking and gazing. And it's almost like they're both separate and not so separate, the looking and what's being seen. But how they're separate is the looking now stands out in highlight. There's seeing happening and that seeing is so relaxed and spacious and open. And I could just stay here looking at these clouds drifting the sky for a long time or looking at the river flowing by. I can just look and look and just feel so relaxed and settling to do this looking. And as opposed to riding every cloud and saying, well, that cloud is a little bit too big, it has too much of a bump here or that one is a nice shape. And I like to keep it that way. And we're going to find a better cloud to look at because this one's getting kind of boring. You know, to constantly be involved in this directiveness is a very different. It tends to we lose sight of the fact that we're looking, we look more at our preferences. The cloud should be that way, not this way. And so this respect, looking again and again is partly what we're doing in mindfulness practice. We're learning not to ride the waves of our preferences, our agendas, what we always want. But step back, take a look. We do that, but when we step back, take another look, take another look. At some point, the looking, the mindfulness begins to stand out and highlight, oh, it's so good to be mindful. In being mindful, there's freedom, there's spaciousness, there's a relaxation, there's an ease. And that this is good. And we start becoming aware of awareness itself. Now, this topic of awareness is a big topic. And I think that I kind of like to use the word as a vague word because different people have different reference points for what awareness means. And so some people, when you talk about awareness, for them, the way they know things is much more through their thinking. And so they're thinking about things. That's how they're aware. Some people, it's more a sensing. They're aware, they're almost through their body and their sensing. Some people, it's more of a silent knowing where they're not really aware of any active, cognitive movement of the mind to know, but there's a silence as they know kind of intuitively or something. So there's many ways to know. And in the mindfulness tradition, there's a variety of different kinds of knowing that operate at different times. But what can happen with each one of them, regardless of what your way of knowing is, what you think awareness is for yourself, at some point it gets highlighted. It stands out a little bit and highlights, oh, here is something. This is not the object of what I'm thinking about. This is the receptivity or the experience of knowing it. And then we can become aware of the attitudes, like we talked about yesterday, that go along with it, desires, the contractions, that kind of are part of being aware. But then we take a second look, and a second look, until we begin seeing, experiencing awareness, knowing, sensing, feeling, observing, whatever it might be, kind of at ease, open, a certain kind of silence, a certain kind of spaciousness. Even when there's thinking, there can be a silence that knows it. One of my first entry points to the world of spiritual life was spending a week in solitude. And it was a beautiful place, on a farm in nature. And in the course, it wasn't meditating, but in the course of the week, because I had no social contact, no talking with anyone, it was kind of like being on a meditation retreat without being on one. And I became acutely aware of myself thinking. And I had no thought, judgments about the fact that I was thinking, but it was that the clarity by which I knew I was thinking, that clarity, oh, there's a thought, it was like really, it's just like, wow, it's kind of, there's a beauty, there's a clarity, there's a cleanliness, there's a openness, there's a distinctness that I'd never seen before. It was kind of like the old days, the radio would be out of tune, and then suddenly it came into, out of tune, you're tuning in the radio station, and you got it into tune, and then suddenly it would become clear. So it was kind of like that, oh, suddenly the wavelength, I found the wavelength in my mind, and I was clearly aware, I knew. And that clarity of knowing, that clarity that is kind of what for some people the clarity is, they call awareness. And it's not different than awareness, but it's not exactly awareness, but it's coterminous with awareness. And the clarity is so beautiful, so wonderful, and the clarity, so I became aware of this clarity that let me see my, my cognitive thoughts, my words, my mind, with such clarity, and I appreciated the freedom, the ease that was there. So to respect, to be mindful of awareness, mindful of the process of being aware, is one of the ways, supports of coming to a place of clarity. In the meditation just now, I talked about silence, and that's another word. Even though I was thinking when I was alone that week, and that thinking became kind of acutely clear, each thought, I was aware of it in kind of a larger silence. Sometimes what's this mindfulness of awareness associated for some people is stillness. The awareness that's vividly, softly, wonderfully, velvety, still, or sometimes it's spaciousness, there's lots of space for it. And it isn't so much like that's so the ultimate thing, space or stillness or silence or clarity, but it's how it helps us to relax more deeply. It's how it teaches us about non-clinging, how it helps us to see where the remaining clinging is. And we get a feeling for freedom. There's freedom in the clarity of awareness. There's freedom in the stillness and the silence of awareness. And so, oh, we get a feel, like a little hint, a smell, the door's open for that's where freedom is found. So finally, I'll give you another analogy from my childhood that maybe for some of you, if you're old enough and did this kind of thing. When I was a little kid, sometimes my parents would take their car to a car wash. And it was such that you could go through the, in the, stay in the car as it went through the car wash, you know, pulled along and all these water and suds and brushes are spraying. And it was kind of chaotic outside the car, coming against the windows. But inside the car, it felt so safe and quiet and peaceful. And the contrast was so, that was one of the reasons I loved going through these car washes because I felt so acutely the, highlighted the peace, the quiet, the stillness, safety there being inside the car with the chaos outside. And so that's a reference point for me of how it can be in the mind sometimes where I'm resting in awareness and there's a peace. There's a quiet, there's an openness and independent of the chaos that might be happening around me. Carry our peace with us. So, it's a little bit esoteric, a little bit, you know, what I'm talking about today. And I'm trusting that for those of you who don't quite understand what I'm saying, which I wouldn't have when I was first introduced to meditation, that just relax with it and, but keep it in mind, keep it filed away. And at some point you might have an experience, oh, that's what Gil is talking about. And that might help you appreciate it and, and get the benefits of that kind of experience. So thank you very much. And I look forward to continuing this tomorrow.
