As the body starts to become familiar with meditation posture, the body being of meditation,
we can let attention just scan the body.
Start to notice what it is to attend to the experiences arising in the body.
Inviting the thinking process to be less dominant,
the experiences of the body to be more available and we can make those slight adjustments in our
posture.
No subtle shifts as we start to settle, they invite release, they invite a fuller being body.
Maybe it's noticing your spine,
maybe it's letting your face relax, your eyes, your mouth,
maybe it's letting something in your hips, in your legs release,
letting the diaphragm release so the breath comes deep into the torso, dying into the abdomen.
And this body being is not just a way to support releasing the urgency of thought,
but it's also a way to make the body available for the breath.
As if with the breath, the whole body is breathing,
knowing the breath in the body, breathing in,
knowing the breath in the body and breathing out.
Each inhale,
mindful and attentive becomes its own event, we can notice how it moves into body.
We can notice the movement of the chest, the swelling of the abdomen,
and then pause between inhale and exhale the moment of transition.
Just as in walking meditation, we pause, we turn, we walk back,
we breathe in, we pause, we turn, we breathe out.
Just as in walking meditation,
a moment to connect to awareness,
a moment to notice as the mind engaged in a continuing thought,
a moment to turn attention to deliberate involvement in exhale.
We exhale,
we release, we let it go.
In the pause, resuming awareness
and breathing in,
willingness to be with whatever arises, however it may be.
And this breathing, four-part breathing,
allowing and releasing,
helps us to see not just the mental content,
but the mental violence, the Vedana, the emotional feeling disposition.
The inhale, we open,
rather than let it feed the story, we invite it back into the realm of sensation.
You may be noticing how the feeling sensation influences the body.
We pause and breathe out,
inviting release, letting go.
And we pause and we breathe in.
So be it. It is how it is.
What arises arises.
No agenda of control. What should happen, what should not happen.
Feeling disposition, the expression of being alive.
And with the exhale, release.
Grasping it, clinging to it, or extra.
It's just now, another phenomena.
And if it rises up into more constructed emotion,
more constructed story or narrative that goes with the emotion,
breathe that into.
It's just the workings of the mind and heart.
And pause and invite it to soften.
If it releases, it releases.
And breathe in.
And all this in the body of being.
The body and the breath, not separate.
The breath breathes the body, the body breathes the breath.
The breath breathes the body, the breath breathes the body.
Each breath, a whole lifetime.
Each inhale, its own event, each exhale, its own event.
