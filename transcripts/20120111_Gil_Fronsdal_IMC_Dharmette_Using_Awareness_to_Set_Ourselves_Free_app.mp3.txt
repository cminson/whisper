Dharmette: Using Awareness to Set 
Ourselves Free

There are two sides to mindfulness. One side is what 
we’re mindful of. Then there’s the side of the awareness 
that’s used to be mindful. It would be similar to having a 
bell like this one here. You can hold the bell in your 
hand and feel the coldness, the hardness, and the 
smoothness of it; but you can also be aware of the hand 
that’s doing the holding. Some people might focus more 
on the bell. If this were  a solid gold bell worth millions of 
dollars, I’d probably be focusing a lot on the bell. And 
probably  if I had to walk down the street with it, I might 
not even notice my hand getting sore from holding on  so 
tightly, as if someon e is going to take my gold bell. But i f 
it’s a cheap bell, I might notice pretty quickly that when  
holding it for a long time, m y hand begins hurting. Or it 
might not even hurt; I might just notice what it’s like to 
hold it. Rather than focusing on the qualities and nature 
of the bell, I can focus on the qualities and nature of 
what it’s like to be holding the bell. I feel the tigh tness, 
the holding, the gripping in my hand.  
 
It’s the same thing with mindfulness and awareness. You can focus on what you’re aware of, or you can 
become aware of the nature , or the quality of the 
mindfulness that you’re actually using. The two often go 
hand in hand. It’s like the lid of a box that fits together 
with the box. They can fit together really closely, but 
they can also be distinguished as two sides. For many 
people , the tendency is to focus on what they’re aware 
of – not only externally , but al so inter nally. You can 
think about your self and your own problems; and so 
you’re mindful of yourself.  
 
A really useful thing to do is to start becoming more 
aware of awareness, or being more attentive to the 
nature of the mindfulness itself: its qualities , its 
characteristics, what it’s like. The quality of the 
awareness is  half of the picture, so if you don’t include 
that as part of your attention, you’re missing half your 
life. What is it like to be aware? Once you start to 
become more sensitive to what it’s like to be aware, it 
tends to break the strong attraction you can  have to 
what you’re concerned with, what you’re focusing your 
attention on.  
 
If I think the be -all and end -all of a successful life is 
having the right bell, then I’m going to be looking at bells 
all the time , and focusing on this bell , holding it r eally 
close. It’s all about the  bell. I’m not going to be able to 
pay attention to what it’s like to be holding the bell, or 
being with the bell , because I’m so focused on the bell  itself. But if I shift my attention around, I can notice that 
how I’m holding the  bell is what is  really affecting my 
well-being and  the stress in my system. If I’m holding 
onto the bell tightly, I can feel a little tension in the top of 
my shoulders. And if I hold it tightly for a long time, that 
tension is going to build. My inner te nsion, my inner 
sense of suffering has a lot to d o with how I’m holding 
the bell – not with the bell itself.  
 
When we start focusing on how we are in relationship to 
what we’re paying attention to, there’s more that’s there 
than just awareness. There’s how  we’re aware. We can 
be aware with tension, with resistance, with hesitation, 
or with a lot of judgments  and commentary. There’s a lot 
we can add to being aware, and that’s often the case. 
One of the things we add to being aware is being 
obsessed , so that we’re not even aware that we’re 
aware , because we’re so invested in being involved. In 
mindfulness practice, o ne of the useful things to start 
paying attention to at some point is to include in the field 
of awareness getting a sense of what it’s l ike to be 
aware – the quality of the mindfulness, the attention, 
and the attitude that’s present . There are a variety of 
ways of pointing to something th at has to do with how 
you are , besides just what you’re involved in  – it’s the 
other half of mindfulnes s. 
  
If you can start getting a sense of your awareness, your 
attention, your mindfulness – of the act of being mindful as opposed to what you’re mindful of – then meditation 
can really begin. If you have a sense of something you 
can apply, or you can enga ge in , which i s different from 
just being lost and preoccupied in your concerns  – then 
you can start getting some freedom from those 
concerns , obsessions , and preoccupations. Then you 
can start applying and using your awareness . In a 
sense,  you can take co ntrol of your awareness. You can 
take responsibility for what you do with your attention. 
You have some agency of what you do with it, as 
opposed to awareness just going along for the ride. 
There are forces inside of you that are directing your 
attention . You can focus  on different things.  
 
Awareness, attention, mindfulness are tools you start to 
discover,  and then you start using  these tools . First it 
requires noticing. And then it requires not only noticing 
that there is such a tool as mindfulness of attention and 
awareness, but there also has to be an understanding 
that it’s valuable to start focusing on that tool, as 
opposed to focusing only on your concerns and your 
problems. There has to be some willingness to step 
back from the usual way of bei ng locked in to me, 
myself and mine , locked in to our concerns, desires, 
and fears.  
 
Many of us have important desires and fears to be 
engaged in – I don’ t want to deny their tremendously  
important value [laughs].  I want to offer my deep respect to your neurosis [laughs]. But there’s no meditation 
practice unless you are willing to step back from that. 
For some people, this is a huge step because it’s 
counter -intuitive. It goes against what you’ve been doing 
for a long time, or even against what society might be 
indicating to you. Being willi ng to step back from your 
fears  and your desires – to step back and be mindful – 
is to strengthen this tool of awareness , of attention. 
Even if what you’re paying attention to is the fear or the 
desire, the focus is not on the desire , the fear , the 
concern , or the thought. The focus is on the nature of 
the awareness, the  strengthening of the attention – 
opening  up the aware ness, stabilizing the awareness, 
being cognizant of what’s happening , and feeling the 
cognizant quality of this – feeling  what it’s like, and 
knowing that yo u know. There’s a strength, an ‘oomph, ’ 
a sense of presence in the knowing, in the awareness. 
The sense of knowing is so strong , you know that you 
know.  
 
Once you start having some appreciation for 
awareness, for know ing, for mindfulness as a tool in 
itself, separate from what you’re mindful of , then you 
can start using that tool in useful ways. One way to use 
the tool of mindfulness , of attention , is to focus it on 
something inside you that helps you feel more steady , 
stable, and peaceful – more at ease. Is there someplace  
inside where you can feel more relaxed, more at ease, 
even just hints, little wisps of some inner  sense of well -being?  Then let your awareness come from that well -
being. Let your awareness come from being more 
relaxed. Even though you’re focusing on the breath, see 
if the focu s on the breath isn’t about the breath per se , 
but about how being with the breath helps steady, 
stabilize, relax, and create some sense of inner well -
being,  or inner peace in your steadiness,  so that there’s 
more and more a sense of being at ease, calm, r elaxed, 
and here.  
 
One tool to becoming more peaceful, more tranquil, and 
less caught up is learning to appreciate the value of 
awareness , and then to use  that awareness. You don’t 
just rest in awareness, which some people find is a 
great practice. But in mindfulness meditation , you use 
awareness to help set yourself free. Setting yourself 
free is a way of becoming more peaceful. And then you 
can go back into the world and pick up the bells, but 
you’re much more likely to pick them up light ly, as 
opposed to grasping them. Just pick them up lightly , 
because you have a sense that how you are, how you 
carry yourself, and what you do is very important – as 
opposed to latching on , or locking on to something.  
 
And, as you know, if you hold the be ll really lightly, [bell 
sounds] you can make a nice sound that you can’t make 
if you grasp onto it [some metallic clicking sounds] [bell 
sounds again].   
 May you be a bell that rings beautifully.
