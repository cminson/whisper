Greetings, everyone. Greetings.
Thank you for your practice and just asked if you would put a word and chat about what's arising for you.
And I'll bring a few of these words in. So many beautiful offerings.
Warmth and tenderness.
Neutralities, ephemeral. Yes, I'll talk about that in a moment. Just like me.
Yeah, open-hearted. Hard-opening. Warmth.
Love for neighbors. A smile.
Both of us. All of us. Deep goodwill.
Indeed. Thank you. Thank you all for these beautiful reflections as they keep coming in.
Yeah.
So as we continue to explore the practice of cultivating compassion this week and the systematic way that it has been taught,
as we start with categories that we're more connected to, better connected to ourselves, our benefactors, dear beings,
and then we move to this category that we just explored in the meditation, which is the neutral person, neutral person.
And we connect, cultivate our care for someone we don't really know, we don't have a lot of experience with,
a lot of background, a lot of history with.
And this category is a very, very important category because up to now the categories as we expand the heart,
the categories are people we know, we know ourselves, kind of we keep discovering ourselves, but we kind of know ourselves.
We spend more time with ourselves than anyone else. Our benefactors, our good friends, etc.
So far we've been in the known territory.
And now the neutral person is the cusp, it's a very important transition to the next few categories.
It's really the building block. It's the most important step to the next expansions of the heart.
So important to step this category, this neutral category.
And as we engage with the neutral person, which you might have noticed after a while practicing with the neutral person,
they don't stay neutral anymore. Our hearts start to care, hearts start to expand.
And I have lots of stories, which I have shared before, practicing with the neutral category for a while.
And the person becomes so dear, becomes so dear.
Like a sister, in a way that my heart wouldn't know the difference between who used to be the neutral person,
who I didn't even know I hadn't spoken to a word, and my best friend, my sister, there was no difference in my heart.
So these categories are very, very, and it's not just me. This is the classical teaching that actually,
I'll give you, since I shared this with you, I'll tell you there is a test.
When we have these final tests, the final exam of practicing these practices of the heart, let's say compassion,
when you practice it intensely for a long time, say on a retreat, or really dedicate your heart to it for a period of time,
the test is, we haven't got to the people we have challenges with, but the test is when you imagine that,
this is from classical language, you imagine that you're on a trip and the bandits, and you're on a carriage.
You're in a carriage with your dear being, dear person, and with your neutral person,
and the person you're having challenges with, the person who's really pushing your buttons.
The four of you are in a carriage, you're going somewhere and the bandits stop you, and they get you out and they ask you,
okay, which, you know, one of you, you have to give up one of you.
One of you, you have to give up whom, whom are you going to give up?
And then in your heart, you try to figure out whom are you going to give up?
Are you going to give up yourself?
Well, you're dear to yourself, your life is dear, your dear person, of course, you're dear to you,
your neutral person, you realize, oh yes, you practice with them, they're dear,
and then the person you've been challenging, you've had challenges with also,
not condoning the challenges, we'll talk more about that tomorrow.
But, you know, there's an affinity, there's a love, there's a care, there's a love,
so you're not able to choose anyone at that point, that's the real, the blossoming, the blossoming of this practice.
But the point really is that these categories, as you might have explored,
you might have realized even today with the short, short time that we've done this,
is that these categories are ephemeral, they keep changing, they're transient,
they're anicca, they're impermanent, we don't see people as they are, we see people as we are.
So, when we have kindness, compassion, ease, gentleness, we tend to like people,
we tend to, and we can cultivate, it's not just that this is the way you are,
and you can't shift and change, and this is the way you're for the rest of your life,
this is the cultivation, this is an absolute cultivation, our attitude,
and the way our stance towards other people, neutral people, people we have challenges with, again,
I'll talk a lot more about that tomorrow, so we'll save that because that's a very juicy category.
And yet, this category of the neutral person is really the necessary step to work,
to expand our hearts and have equanimity and peace and care for the people we have challenges with.
But staying with this category today, a few other things I want to say.
So, our hearts shift and expand, and the person who was once relatively neutral is not neutral anymore.
We start to care for them, and as I mentioned, I know for me and many, many, many practitioners who I've interacted with,
this is true, this is what happens.
I remember once I practiced with someone who worked at the laundromat,
and every time I walked by that, the not laundromat, the cleaners, yes, cleaners,
every time I was curious if she was there, she was like, oh my goodness, my heart would leap,
this neutral person had become a dear friend, I was so happy to take my clothes there.
So, the heart is so expansive, the heart is so expansive, who we decide to care for or not.
It's so elastic, it's so elastic.
And another thing, of course, we realize that we're all the same.
We all want to be happy, us human beings, we want to be happy, we don't want to suffer.
All of our lives, our internal lives are just as compelling to us.
My life, this richness of thinking, this and that, and the whole day I have thoughts and intentions and aspirations.
Yeah, other people have them too.
If we stop to realize that, realize how similar we are.
And through that common humanity, we can have love and care for one another.
And again, as I mentioned briefly earlier, another importance of this category is that that neutral person becomes the stand-in for all of humanity.
So, when we expand to all beings at the end, our hearts connect with this person as, oh yeah, and this person too, and this person too.
And I'm not so separate from that person.
So, this is profound practice.
And when I discovered this, I was not born a Buddhist.
And I've discovered these practices just in my heart, I would say my mind has been blown, but my heart has been blown, so powerful, so powerful.
Another thing I want to bring in today is I had mentioned yesterday about the near enemies of compassion.
And yesterday I talked about empathic distress or falling into grief as a near enemy or as a masquerader of compassion, something that feels like compassion, but actually it's not compassion.
It's very different from it.
Today I want to talk about another near enemy.
Another near enemy or another masquerader, something that masquerades as compassion, but it's not compassion.
And that is pity.
Pity is not compassion at all.
So, the simplest way to understand the difference here is pity is where we have a less than, you know, like, oh poor you, oh you're going through this hard time, oh poor you.
Oh, so we have this, I'm up here, I'm not going through this, I'm okay, and oh you poor you, so there's a less than, there is a comparison, like I wouldn't, I'm not going through that, or I would never go through that.
There's a separation basically, there's a separation, you're separating yourself from the other person from up here, like oh poor you, I feel compassion for you, but that's actually is pity.
Whereas, whereas compassion is yes we're equal, I feel your pain, this could be me, this was me, this can't be me in the future, or I feel your pain we're not so different, this can happen to me.
It's the sense of, there's no separation, there is a kinship, there is a kinship in this feeling of kindness, of this feeling of compassion and warmth, whereas pity there's a sense of putting down in our minds perhaps even not realizing.
But look for that, look for that when you're having compassion for someone, whether someone you know, you care about, or someone you don't know, notice if there is that kinship, that lack of separation.
So, I'll talk more about, so tomorrow we will explore the next category which is very important category, people we have challenges with, and I want, and in preparation for tomorrow I want to invite you if you can for the rest of the day to engage a little more with the neutral person as you're walking,
as you're sitting, as you're going around, just maybe imagine you're sitting, you're making yourself a cup of tea, imagine this neutral person making themselves a cup of tea, and as you're enjoying your cup of tea,
imagine this neutral person enjoying their cup of tea, you're not so different, or maybe you're both like green tea, I wish you well, I wish you well, sister, brother, my kin, I wish you well, so let's practice with that.
For the rest of the day, as a preparation, really this is the stepping stone to work with people we have challenges with, and that's a very juicy and very important category, so important for us.
So, let's try to engage our hearts in their in expansion today, so thank you so much Sangha, thank you for your practice, for your engagement, for the expansion of your heart, may you be well, may you be happy, may you have ease, and may your hearts know their capacity for brilliant expansion.
Alright, looking forward to being with you tomorrow, take care.
