 It's opening to just the simplicity of being aware of yourself in this moment. Aware of the body, sitting, sensing, hearing, breathing. Aware of how you are in this moment, what moods and feelings are present, thoughts. Perhaps there's some agitation or some ease. And can you simply receive or be aware this is how it is right now. Just like this. There is the possibility with mindfulness to simply receive, be aware of how you are in this moment. Not just when you stand in front of a mirror, the mirror simply receives how you are and reflects that back. Mindfulness can be that way too. Non-judgmental. Not wanting things to be any different. The mirror just reflects. It does not have an opinion about what it reflects. And in much the same way, mindfulness can simply reflect. This is what's happening. This body, these sensations happening. This mind, these moods or thoughts or emotions happening. So can there be a simple receiving of what's here? It can support you sometimes. Sometimes you can simply settle back and just receive. Just be aware of what's already here. And sometimes it can be supportive to allow the attention to settle, connect with a particular area of experience such as the breath. And explore receiving that. Whatever being with that as it is, this is the breath that's happening right now. And at the end of the day, uh, yes, it is. If there is some resistance or frustration about what's happening in this moment, that too is just what's happening in this moment. And so can that be known? What's happening right now is resistance or frustration, mindfulness reflecting that. There's nothing outside of the realm of what mindfulness can meet. Mindfulness doesn't judge resistance or frustration either. Just how that's what's happening. And the mind will wander, it'll get lost in thought, get hooked to something or other and forget about remembering ourselves in this moment. Unfortunately, at some point that remembering will return. While we're not remembering, there's not a lot to do about it. But that moment when we remember again, that moment, some care and some appreciation for that moment, mindfulness is back. And what's happening right now? Reflecting capacity available to receive what's here. In that moment it can be helpful to relax. There's no need to judge for the mind having been wandering. And if there is judgment that's arising, that too can be simply recognized. The relaxation can help to soften a judgment that might arise around the returning of mindfulness. And that relaxation can support that simple receptive recognition of this is what's happening. This is here. This is what's happening right now. These sensations, this breath, these sounds, these moods, or emotions, or thoughts. It's like this right now.
