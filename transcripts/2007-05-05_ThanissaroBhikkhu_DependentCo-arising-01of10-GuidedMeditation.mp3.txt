It would be best to start with a brief meditation, and then at the end of the meditation we'll
hand out the reading materials. So close your eyes.
And think thoughts of goodwill. Goodwill is a wish for happiness, for true happiness.
The good thing about true happiness is it doesn't take anything away from anyone else.
So when you wish for your own happiness, you wish for the happiness of others, there's no conflict.
Each of us looks within to find the resources that we can develop into a path of true happiness inside.
So start first with thoughts of goodwill for yourself. Tell yourself, may I find true happiness?
And then spread those thoughts out in ever-widening circles to people around you.
Start first with people who are close to your heart, your family, your very close friends.
May they find true happiness.
People you know well and like.
People you like even though you don't know them so well.
People you are more neutral about.
Remember that the world would be a much better place if everyone could find true happiness within.
And if you place limitations on your goodwill, you're placing limitations on your own mind.
That's where thoughts of goodwill to people you don't even know.
Not just people, living beings of all kinds in all directions.
East, west, north, south, above and below. Out to infinity.
May we all find true happiness in our lives.
Now bring your attention back to the present moment. What are these resources you have here right now?
You've got the body sitting here breathing, you've got the mind thinking and aware.
So bring all those things together.
Think about the breath and be aware of the breath as it comes in, as it goes out.
And allow the breath to be comfortable. Try to notice what rhythm of breathing feels fast for the body right now.
It could be in long and out long, or it could be in short and out short, or in long and out short, or in short or out long.
Experiment for a bit to see which rhythm of breathing feels fast.
You can focus on the sensation of breathing at any part of the body.
Because the breath is not just air coming in and out the nose, it's the whole energy flowing through the body.
It brings the air in and allows the air to go out.
Your mind wanders off, bring it back.
Wanders off again, bring it back again. If you have trouble staying with the breath, you can use a meditation word to go along with it.
A traditional one is bhuta, which means awake. I think bhuta with the breath and bhuta with the out.
Now in the Buddha's instructions on breath meditation, once you've become sensitive to long breathing and short breathing,
he says to be aware of the whole body as you breathe in, be aware of the whole body as you breathe out.
And a good way to work up to that is to survey the body section by section to see how the breathing process feels there.
A good place to start is down around your navel.
Locate that part of the body in your awareness right now and watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out.
If you notice any sense of tension or tightness there, allow it to relax.
Think of the breath energy coming in and out of the body right there at the navel so you don't have to push and pull it too much.
As soon as you breathe in, it immediately comes in there.
If you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away so that you're not building up tension as you breathe in or holding on to tension as you breathe out.
If you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away so that you're not building up tension as you breathe out.
If you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away so that you're not building up tension as you breathe out.
If you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away so that you're not building up tension as you breathe out.
Then move your tension up to the solar plexus, the area right in front of the stomach, and follow the same three steps there.
One, locate that part of the body in your awareness.
Two, watch it for a while as you breathe in and breathe out.
And then three, if you notice any tension or tightness there, allow it to relax and give it dissolving away in the breath.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away so that you're not building up tension as you breathe out.
If you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away so that you're not building up tension as you breathe out.
Then move your tension up to the middle of the chest and follow the same three steps there.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away so that you're not building up tension as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
Then bring your tension up to the base of the throat.
Follow the same steps there.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
Now bring your tension to the middle of the head.
And think of the breath energy coming in and out of the head from all directions, not just the nose, but also the eyes, the ears, in from the back of the head, down from the top of the head.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
Now focus your tension in the back of the neck.
And think of the breath energy coming in and out from the back there and going down the spine, down the shoulders, out the arms.
To work through any tension you may feel there in the back of the neck and going down the shoulders and the upper back.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away as you breathe out.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away.
So, if you notice any tension there, allow it to dissolve away.
Now, if you're meditating on your own, you can continue the survey of the rest of the body, down the back, out the legs,
and starting again at the base of the neck, going down the shoulders and out the arms, section by section, until you cover the whole body.
And then you could start again at the navel and go through the body again.
By the time being, just go back to any of the spots we focused on just now, whichever one you found most comfortable, most congenial.
Allow your awareness to settle there and then think of it spreading out from that spot to fill the whole body.
So, you're aware of the whole body breathing in, the whole body breathing out.
And then just try to stay with that center of broad awareness.
There's nothing else you have to think about right now, nowhere else you have to go.
Just be aware of this body breathing right now, the whole body breathing.
Your awareness may have a tendency to shrink. So, every time you breathe in, think whole body breathing in, whole body breathing out.

Before you open your eyes, remember there's a skill to opening your eyes after you've meditated.
Try not to let your awareness go flooding out into the world outside.
And at least some sensitivity to what's going on inside the body.
You can choose one spot in the body to take as your home base.
And try to stay in touch with that spot.
As you open your eyes, listen to the talk, ask questions, disagree with the speaker, whatever.
Try to stay centered inside.
Try as long and as continuously as you can.
Okay, then open your eyes.
