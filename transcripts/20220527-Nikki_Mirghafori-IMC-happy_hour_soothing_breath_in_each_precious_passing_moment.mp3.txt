There. So hello and welcome to happy hour everyone. It's lovely to be with you,
it's happy-making to be with you in this moment in time, wherever you are in the
world. So for today's practice, I'd like to invite us to explore a couple of
themes. One is, you know, when they bring two themes together. The theme of
metta, kindness, together with the theme of peace, peace, especially given that it's
a Friday or Saturday depending on your time zone. So a sense of bringing in a
sense of peace and peacefulness. This, you know, metta can show up in so many
different ways. Metta, kindness, this practice can be very energetic and warm
and it can also be very quiet, very gentle, very comforting, soothing, very
stilling, very stilling. So that's one aspect that I want to bring in and and
invite us to really rest, to relax into it. There's not so much doing that needs
to be done, but to rest, but really to rest. And the other theme I want to weave
in today is is one of impermanence, is one of of brevity of time, brevity of our
time. And the best way to be with the brevity of our time, that actually we are
all dying, we are dying every moment. And the best way to really appreciate that
an opener heart to that is with peace, is with stillness, with presence, being
fully present with care, with love, with appreciation for whatever is in this
moment in time for ourselves, for others. I want to weave those in and even though
maybe for some it feels like, wow, awareness of our brevity of time,
awareness of mortality is not peaceful, but it can be, you know, that it can be
and actually the appropriate response is peace. The appropriate response is peace.
And the invitation is if leaning into brevity of time really brings in more
sense of letting go peace, love, kindness, lean into it, but if it brings more
agitation, then don't lean into it. It's an invitation. You don't have to lean
into it at all. You can stay with the yes, yes, saying yes to the peace, to the
calm, to the presence of the groundedness in this moment. So see what is more
helpful for you as I bring up the invitations and yeah, and lean more or
less into these invitations. So see what might work for you. So okay, well, let's
get formally started with our practice. So moving your body perhaps, if you need
to move, shift, find a comfortable position where you can be sitting or
lying down, or even standing, whatever this body needs, whatever this body needs.
Appropriate response to what is needed in this moment, what does your heart need,
your body need at this moment. Ah, letting go, releasing with the outbreath. Ah, letting
the inbreath be received in the abdomen. The inbreath received. The outbreath
released, released, letting go.
Feeling, sensing, sensations of the feet, and the earth, the hands, and your lap,
your sit bones on the cushion, on the chair, these contact points.
Releasing your weight, under these contact points.
Releasing. Releasing doesn't mean pushing away. If there is, there are emotions
present, might be sadness, grief, joy, subointment, whatever there might be, it's
okay. Sort of holding them tight, as if you were carrying a load of bricks in your
chest. Release, it's okay. Let them gently drop on the floor, proverbially, with you.
Ah, don't have to hold them so tight, hold them contained. Let them release, let the
sack open. Ah, no longer heavy, being carried.
Ah, let the breath be spacious through the body, the whole body.
Around the body. And if your body was the breathing, breathing ball, maybe the
edges are a little blurry, a little elastic, the breath. Being breathed inside, outside,
including breathing through the bricks that have fallen on the floor, about you,
maybe softening, maybe the bricks must have breathed into, maybe become a little
softer, a little lighter. Not effortful, just happens on its own.
Maybe nothing more is needed in this moment, but to just be breathed.
Let everything be breathed, your joy, your sorrow, your lightness, your heaviness.
Your gladness, your grief, your gratitude, your disappointment. Your hopes and dreams
for the future, your fears, all of them breathed. Right here, all of them okay to be here.
Many thoughts arise per occupation, but then be breathed through, not so heavy.
The grace of the breath, touching everything.
The grace of the breath, touching everything.
The grace of the breath, touching everything.
The grace of the breath, touching everything.
This breath, this thread, this thread that keeps you alive.
Breathing through everything, all these moments of awakeness, of sleep, of being alive.
This thread, this precious thread,
runs through everything. You can be aware of the grace of this breath, through...
