Okay.
So, um...
was making the, the case that, um, the, uh, contemplation of, of mortality can support, uh,
Samadhi can cut through the noise and clarify what's of value to us. And, um, and today,
insight into self, self, limits of willfulness. The ways in which my, my life
does not belong entirely to me. And mortality offers, uh, us the contemplation, maybe we
can say the egos, helplessness, the world that is unresponsive to our willfulness.
Tuesday, I think, was futurelessness, Samadhi today, helplessness. What of life is left
when the ego is all out of moves? And death, um, is in one sense a kind of the ultimate
humbling, uh, but also the source of a great deal of our, of our grandiosity. And the sense
of, of self, sense of self as a kind of hub of control. That's what I was alluding to,
but the ways in which, you know, the direction of attention, the kind of attentional spotlight
can incarnate a congealed sense of self, the sense of like me as the attentional agent,
the sense of controlling the attention to the breathing or the body or this or that.
And then, and then something else in the field that does not depend on us, that does not
taste like me. The sense of self is the kind of hub of control. This is, um, death obliterates
control and throws us off. So one Gabriel Vezquez, adulthood brings with it the pernicious
illusion of control, perhaps even depends on it. I mean the mirage of dominion over our
life that allows us to feel like adults where we associate maturity with autonomy, sovereign
right to determine what's going to happen next. Disillusion comes sooner or later. No
one who lives long enough can be surprised to find their biography has been molded by
distant events by other people's wills with little or no participation from our own decisions.
Those long processes that end up running into our life, sometimes to give it the shove it
needed, sometimes to blow to smithereens or most splendid plans, tend to be hidden like
subterranean currents, like tiny shifts of tectonic plates. When the earthquake finally
comes, we invoke the words, we've learned to calm ourselves, accident, fluke, sometimes
what is our relationship to helplessness. Before we die, we want to develop a relationship
to helplessness. That's Michelle McDonald's language, often would say like develop a relationship
with. Sometimes I think a synonym for dukkha usually translates as suffering. A synonym
for dukkha is maybe helplessness. And there's almost always some move to make, but our capacity
for influence creates the illusion of control. And then we come to a place where there's
no move to make, and maybe we've not developed a kind of relationship with helplessness.
And part of meditation practice is about wieldingly experiencing helplessness. We call it surrender.
Maybe we call it equanimity. And part of why we do this is that willfulness obscures certain
qualities of the heart-mind. The moment is never perfect when I'm in it. It can feel
terrible not to be able to do something. It's like an animal, it's like helplessness has
got to be the lowest on the list. It can feel so terrible, but then of course there's like
so much relief sometimes when we actually just give up on exerting ourselves, on making
change, on changing something, someone. And so part of this contemplation of mortality
is to help us find a way to keep our heart open, even amidst powerlessness. We're surrendering
our clinging or doing nothing left to engineer. Tibetan teacher Dilko Kensei Rinpoche said
something like, I don't remember it exactly, but something like at the end of our life,
our mind gets very small or very vast. And I for sure have seen both. And sometimes when
people are at the end of their life and they have nothing, in a sense, nothing left to
defend, no territory to defend, nothing really left to fear. The love gets very vast, right?
It's like the hatred and the contraction, the tightness is a function of the territoriality,
the fear. The Buddha said that we usually think about the self as the cause of things,
but the Buddha said that it's the effect. The self is the effect of things, the effect
of what? To my mind, most centrally, I'd say it's the effect of fear. And part of how we
kind of insure our safety is by, in a sense, we orchestrate our survival by hallucinating
self. The self, in a certain sense, feels like the kind of headquarters of my clinging,
longing for more fear of an end. And so in our practice, we can notice the more safe
it feels in meditation, the more deeply the moment feels like refuge, the more we can
forget ourselves. The more safe we feel, the more we forget ourselves. And then some stimulus
frightens us, right? We hear something, we think something, the knee hurts, and we like
are chased back into the corner of self. So maybe we say self is maybe partially the effect
of fear, but it's also part of what makes death seem so terrifying, because it can feel
like we imagine death from the perspective of self, or imagining the destruction of the
self. And we're in a certain way protecting a phantom. I don't think insight into a not-self
is like a perfect consolation for death and loss. It's not a perfect consolation, and it's
imperfection, that's the theme for tomorrow. Not perfect, but it's very meaningful, it's
pretty good. The philosopher, a very famous quote, Derek Parfit, it's difficult to believe
that there is no such thing as an all or nothing self, no deep, further fact beyond the multitude
of small psychological facts that make you who you are. When I believe that my existence
was such a further fact, I seemed imprisoned in myself. My life seemed like a glass tunnel
through which I was moving faster every year, and at the end of which there was darkness.
When I change my view, the walls of my glass tunnel disappear. I now live in the open air.
There is still difference between my life and the lives of other people, but the difference
is less. Other people are closer, less concerned about the rest of my life, and more concerned
about the lives of others. Death and self, willfulness, surrender, offer this for your
consideration. May we live well today, may we live well, whatever that means. Touching
to be with you and be swimming in these waters together. Thank you.
