 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So welcome to our meditation. And... So welcome. The... So one of the key components of mindfulness meditation is our ability to clearly recognize, to clearly recognize what is happening in the present moment, and to recognize it in its simplicity. So in that way, and partly that means to recognize it as a present moment phenomena. And maybe without a past or a future. Of course it has that, maybe, but the simplicity of just this experience, without the thoughts, the ideas, the associations we have with past and future, the associations we have, a simple recognition that is independent of our preferences. Of course we have preferences, but we also have the capacity to know independent of them. To know clearly independent of our desires and our aversions, our plans, our hopes, even independent of our usual sense of self that we operate under, or we construct, or we associate with our agency and our doing. And that's maybe the most difficult part of clear knowing, is to just allow the most natural, simple, inner capacity to know, to occur, to be, to arise. And without a lot of ideas of baggage around, I'm the one who's doing it, or I have to do it well, or I'm not doing it well enough. Just a simple knowing. And so this week we're looking at compulsive desire, compelling desire, the desire that we get caught in. And that can happen in the ordinariness of thinking, that we start thinking about something, and it doesn't take much to realize that some thoughts, some trains of thoughts, there's desires that is propelling them. Some of them have aversions, some of them have other things, but this week we're looking at desire, and there's probably much more often desire propelling thoughts than most people acknowledge. Sometimes there's strong feelings in the body, even emotions that have underneath them some desire that's part of it. Maybe in the corners of it, underneath it, maybe in the center of it, somehow a desire is part of it. And if those desires are compelling or compulsive, or we get caught in those desires, then there's no freedom. And the medicine is to clearly recognize, clearly know. So if you know that you're caught in desire, the medicine is in that knowing. It might not be there automatically, but rather than looking for a solution in the desires, in the compulsive desires, it's in the knowing that there's a kind of solution, kind of freedom to be found. And so this kind of stepping back and clearly knowing, oh, this is desire, this is being caught in desire. And in that stepping back, there's freedom. It's like you were caught in the quicksand on the edge of a lake or something, and all you had to do is take one little step, just maybe a few inches away, and stand on dry ground. And you can look back then on the lake, on the quicksand, and realize, oh, I'm no longer in it. So to step back or to open up, clear recognition, oh, this is compulsive desire, this is being caught in desire. And then to look for where that freedom is, where that spaciousness is, where the openness is, where the not caughtness is. And there's a specialness. That's where something sacred is happening. That's where the sacred ground is, in that clear knowing that is free of so many things that usually gets attached to how we relate to things. And if you're able to find that clear recognition of desire, then welcome into that clear knowing, into that space, that sacred ground. Welcome into it your breathing, as an alternative to being caught up in your desires. The breathing is very closely related to this sacred ground, this ancestral territory that we can live in, that we lose when we get involved in compulsive desire. So don't worry about having compulsive desire being caught in it. It's the stepping stone for clear recognition. It's the means, it's the support for clear recognition. Find that freedom. So you don't have to fight it or push it away or feel bad about having it. Say, okay, hi, my friend. You are the stepping stone for this clear recognition, this little moment of simplicity, of freedom. It helps to do this if you take each moment for itself. Some people say that every day is a good day, so saying every moment can be a good moment if there's this clear recognition, the simplicity of the moment. So assuming a meditation posture and closing your eyes, and before doing anything else, can there be a clear recognition of here and now how you are? Clear recognition of how you are, and then experiment with, make subtle adjustments so that you're not caught up in how you are or reactive to how you are, for or against how you are, just knowing that this is how it is. Maybe it's through an opening up wide, wider than how you are in a sense than knowing it. Maybe it's stepping back in the mind so you can gaze upon how you are with some freedom or independence. Maybe it's knowing how you are from a quiet place within, a calm place. And then welcoming in your breathing. Welcome breathing into your knowing, into your awareness. Especially the inhale, receive the inhale. And as you exhale, allow for the exhale. And as you exhale, for a few exhales, allow your body to relax, to soften. Adjusting your arms maybe if that allows your arms to be more at ease. And as you exhale, to relax in the mind, to calm or soften the thinking mind. Rather than letting go of your thoughts, let your thinking slow down. No hurry, lots of time. Or perhaps as you exhale to let go of your thoughts as well. And so that the clear knowing of the exhale is wordless. The clear experiencing of the inhale is wordless or mostly wordless. And then as you meditate here, if you notice that you get caught up in desire, even subtle desires, try not to make it a problem. Instead, see it as a stepping stone for the sacred ground of clear knowing. The clear awareness of the desire that is not caught in the desire. You might be caught. The desire might be caught in itself, but the clear knowing is not........................... What right now can you clearly recognize that you're enabling or going along with without knowing? Stepping back, opening up wider to clearly recognize what hasn't been recognized. In the simplicity of knowing and then allowing the breathing to return to the fullness of that knowing..... And then as we come to the end of the sitting, imagine that you're sitting in an easy chair, maybe in a very open room with open door, maybe outdoors in an outdoor lounge chair. And people come to visit and you stay relaxed, settle back in your chair, welcoming them, receiving them, without needing to get up, without needing to do much, just allowing them into the space, allowing them to take a chair as well. Welcoming them. So in the same way as we come to the end of the sitting, can you be relaxed, open, nothing you have to do but to be welcoming, but open your awareness now, your mind to the people that you'll encounter today, whether strangers on the street or in stores, or there are people that you'll see on, somehow on the computer, in the news, people you might think about today. And welcome them into your easy, relaxed space. Welcoming them into a space where you offer safety, you offer warmth and kindness, a peacefulness. You offer them a chair where they can sit also, welcoming them into a space in your heart where they also can be at rest and not demand anything of you or require anything of you. And in this imaginary exercise of receiving people into your sacred ground, wish them well or feel how the welcome itself is a well-wishing. And may it be on this day that coming out of our meditation through the day, that in our hearts, in our minds, maybe in our actions, that there's a welcoming of people, a well-wishing of people, looking upon people with kind and compassionate eyes. May those people we meet today be happy, safe, peaceful and free. And may we contribute to that possibility that at least in our presence, they're safe, we offer peace and they're free from us, from our desires and our compulsions and our aversions. May all beings be happy.
