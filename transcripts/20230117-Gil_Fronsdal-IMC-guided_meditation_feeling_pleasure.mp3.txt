 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hello everyone and thank you for being here. There is a kind of pleasure in sitting down here weekday mornings and being together with all of you to meditate for me to be able to do some sharing, some of what I know or practice. And maybe for some of you there is also a pleasure. Some of you clearly find some pleasure in all this, the chats that you are warmly greeting and the chats you are giving. And there might be lots of things that are uncomfortable in your life. There might be lots of things which are quite difficult and challenging and things that will lead the mind to ruminate about them and have difficult thoughts and predictions and ideas about it all. And at any given time there is both what is pleasant and what is unpleasant. And one of the revolutionary ideas that the Buddha had for his time, and maybe for some of us it is a revolutionary idea, is to allow ourselves to feel more pleasure. And especially that is useful when we have discovered that a lot of the uncomfortable feelings we have, the unpleasantness we experience, has its genesis or has its support in the chronic ways in which we are thinking. Or the chronic kind of negativity bias where we kind of, through fear or through whatever reason, we tend to orient ourselves around what is unpleasant. And of course Buddhism is about an honest assessment of what is difficult and challenging our suffering. We are not denying that. But if we really want to be able to manage in a healthy, dharmic way with the sufferings and challenges of our life, the Buddha said it is helpful, or to paraphrase him, it is helpful to feel pleasure. You are allowed to feel pleasure. There is a role for pleasure in this practice. I just went to heat up my water and I noticed that as I was getting ready to heat up the water the way I was handling the cup and the filling of water, and I put it in the microwave here, that I was concerned with the talk I was going to give and teach and the activities of getting everything ready on time. And it was fine, but if I really noticed that carefully, I noticed there was some unpleasantness and it wasn't particularly pleasant. And as soon as I recognized that, I became attuned to the pleasure that was there in filling up the cup of water, carrying it, stretching my arm, putting it into the microwave. A small, maybe insignificant pleasure in some scale of things. And some of that, once I felt a pleasure, then I could move my arm and be with the whole phenomena heating up the water. I could do it in an even more graceful way, more pleasant way. Was that a denial of the unpleasantness that I was feeling? I don't think so. I think that my mind was just focused on one part of reality. And there was a different part of reality that was more nourishing, more supportive. Rather than thinking about what I was going to teach all of you, I probably better to show up in a good state, show up more settled, more happy, more contented. So as we sit today, orient yourselves towards what is pleasant here and now. Not what's pleasant in your life more generally, but here, in your body. And not having pleasant thoughts, you know, things that are wonderful fantasies. But if you are going to think about your meditation, can you think in a pleasant way? Can you focus your attention in a pleasant way? Can you be aware in a way that's not tense or unpleasant? Can the breathing be pleasant? So to begin the meditation, just sitting up straight, gently closing the eyes. And to be sure to acknowledge and not deny that there are things which are uncomfortable. Take a few moments to acknowledge here and now in your body, your heart, your mind. Yes, there is something which is unpleasant, uncomfortable. And some of that might be unnecessary. Some of it is a healthy part of life. But for practice, either way, we don't have to push it away or deny it. Try to fix it. And having acknowledged it now, if you can acknowledge what is pleasant for you here and now, starting with your body, maybe in your hands, wherever it might be, the pleasantness. Maybe there's pleasure in relaxing more, softening the tight muscles. And then becoming aware of your breathing. And can you be aware of your breathing in a pleasant way? Or at least not be aware of it unpleasantly with strain or pushing, contraction, with beliefs of, I can't, this is difficult. Is there something in the most simple way in which your body breathes? The most simple way your body breathes is that you can find some pleasure in it. Feeling the body's experience of breathing. Is there any point in the cycle of breathing in and breathing out that has the most pleasure, most nice feeling, however fleeting it is? Be sure to feel that part of the cycle well whenever you get to it. Feel the pleasure or the niceness. Don't have to look for dramatic pleasure. Maybe it's a very light pleasantness, ease. And as you're experiencing your breathing, maybe in an easeful, relaxed way. Are there small ways you can adjust your breathing so it becomes more pleasant? Maybe there's a relaxing in the belly, in the chest. Maybe a teeny bit more breathing in, a teeny bit longer letting go as you exhale. Maybe a teeny pause before you inhale. And if you can feel some pleasure, let that support the mind to be present here now. In some ways the mind is attracted to what is pleasant. Allow it to feel the pleasantness of the moment as a way of supporting you to be here and now. To help you settle down and relaxed. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To help the mind trust being present here and now. To know pleasant present moment pleasure. We have to be aware. Allowing awareness to be receptive to receive the pleasure that it knows. The simplest pleasure of the moment here and now in breathing, sitting here. May be the pleasure that comes with meditation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There is unpleasant sensations experiences. Is there a way of holding them or relating to them from the places of pleasure, pleasantness? May be taking them both in as you breathe so that there's not a fixation on what is uncomfortable. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we come to the end of this sitting, are there people for whom if you think about, you feel pleasure. It's pleasant. It's enjoyable. It's evokes good feelings to think about certain people. You still feel the pleasure of recalling people in your life, who you enjoy or who you love or who you care for nicely. The love, the friendship, the goodwill you feel might be the source of that pleasure, the delight. And to relax into that pleasure of knowing them, thinking of them, feeling the pleasantness if it's there. And then imagine that from that pleasant pleasure, you can gaze out upon all people. The people you love, care for, the people you are neutral to, even the people you're troubled by. You can look upon them with kind, pleasant gaze and wish them well. Is there a way that coming out of meditation, that you have access to a different kind of well-wishing than you usually have, one that's more spacious, open, less reactive? May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Thank you.
