Recognizing awareness. 
Simple practice. 
What is obvious? What does awareness know? What is awareness receiving? Awareness receives our human experience, sounds, body sensations, thoughts, emotions, moods or mind states. 
Awareness uses the language that awareness receives objects, but that language can sometimes obscure the process nature of experience. 
So awareness receives experience, and we can be aware of the experience. 
Awareness is our most familiar way of paying attention. 
We know what awareness is receiving. 
We recognize some of the specific qualities of the experience. 
In body sensation, we recognize pressure, hardness or softness, pulsing, tingling, vibration, heat, coolness, movement, expansion, contraction, pulling, tightness. 
These qualities of physical experience are more the elemental level, the specific quality of physical touch-sense experience. 
In sound, there's pitch and tone. 
In mind states, there's the quality of mind state, and quality of experience of joy might have a quality of expansiveness or being uplifted, the experience of fear might have a quality of contractedness. 
Thoughts have their qualities in relationship to how they are experienced. 
Some thoughts arising as an image, others as if we were speaking to ourselves. 
So all of these experiences are known in awareness, received, received in awareness. 
As opening to what is received, it is perhaps our most familiar way of being aware of staying connected with what's happening. 
We may not be as accustomed to noticing awareness itself. 
We know awareness is happening because it knows objects. 
This intimate connection between awareness and what is received in awareness. 
Recognizing awareness, recognizing awareness itself does not have to be a turning back or a looking back, trying to look directly at awareness. 
And be more of a stepping back, a falling back, and becoming aware of awareness. 
The experience doesn't disappear. 
The objects what is received does not disappear. 
It's more that the mind orients to that the mind is knowing or aware, that the mind is aware rather than what the mind is aware of. 
Are you aware? What is received? What is being received? What is obvious? The mind has the capacity to recognize that we are aware. 
Perhaps the simplest is just knowing that you're aware, even though you may not know how you know you're aware. 
Right now, you're hearing my voice, and if you can check in, perhaps ask the question aware, if there's the thought to ask the question, there's that kind of checking in. 
You are aware. 
Am I aware? Yes. 
Just taking that in, you know that you're aware. 
This is the experience of knowing that you're aware. 
You don't have to look for it. 
Am I aware? Yes. 
This is the experience of being aware. 
Just take that in, see if the mind can settle with, perhaps for some, the non-obviousness of this. 
This is what it's like to be aware. 
Yes. 
Taking that in, you don't have to figure out, identify or look for the qualities of that experience right now. 
Just this. 
Am I aware? Yes. 
This is the experience of being aware. 
As continues to receive experience, even as you perhaps can recognize, yes, this is awareness. 
You don't have to track my words, but perhaps you might notice that the words are coming in and being understood. 
You don't have to do that, you don't have to try to recognize the words. 
There can be this awareness, knowing that you're aware and receiving experience, understanding the words. 
As we become more attuned to awareness itself, we might notice that awareness receives objects in different ways. 
There's a different feeling, perhaps, of awareness receiving objects at different times, different ways it feels at different times. 
There's not really good language for speaking about this. 
So it might at times feel like awareness is receiving one object after another. 
It might feel like the attention is moving from experience to experience, that quality of a shift of attention, and perhaps a sense of following the attention. 
Just one object, one experience after another. 
Or it might feel like awareness is very still and that objects are coming into awareness. 
Awareness is arriving in awareness, not a sense of awareness moving, but awareness still and objects coming into awareness. 
It might feel like there's a very smooth quality to the awareness, a flow from one experience to another. 
Or it might feel like awareness is popping from one object to another. 
Kind of discrete moments. 
It can feel like awareness is taking in many objects or many experiences simultaneously. 
Not the one object at a time, one experience flowing from one to another. 
It feels more broad, receiving many experiences simultaneously. 
We're exploring here how it feels, what the experience is. 
Let go of any ideas about what's actually going on, in terms of an idea that awareness can only know one thing at a time. 
Let that go. 
What is the experience? Are you aware? Are you curious about knowing that you are aware? Sometimes awareness feels very broad, taking in a panorama, diffuse broad experience. 
Awareness can feel very broad as it receives a diffuse experience, or sometimes awareness feels like it focuses on something very precise and specific. 
There's no one way that it feels. 
Exploring. 
How is it for you right now? Are you aware? What is awareness receiving? How is awareness receiving experience?.
