The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Here we go. So hello and welcome everyone. Welcome to Happy Hour. So for our
practice today, I'd like to invite us to explore, in our meditation together, a
couple of different concepts that I want to bring together. One is the concept of
practicing loving kindness, META, which has so many different dimensions. It's
both a cultivation practice, and it makes us kinder, happier in how we feel,
externally, relationships. There's so many different aspects to this practice, so
many different aspects. But of course, we spend many, many sessions tapping into
all these different aspects, relationally, internally, etc. And one aspect of the
practice of META is that it's also a considered a unification practice. It's
a practice that calms the mind, that pacifies the mind, that stills the mind.
And it's like petting, it's like petting the mind. If you're petting a kitty, like
purr, it starts to purr after a while. So this practice, if we gently, gently pet
the mind with this practice over and over again, it starts to purr. It starts to
purr. There's a sense of ease and contentment and goodness, nourishment,
nourishment of loving kindness for ourselves. That just fills the heart, fills
the body, which is so healing, can be so healing. So that's the aspect that I like
to invite us to tap into. And if you've had a long day or a hard day, if this
sounds like good news, that this is what we're exploring, then yay, because it is,
there is an aspect of healing, calming. And for this, for it to build up, there are
various things that need to be in place. And one, again, it's a much longer
conversation than as we've covered many aspects. But one thing I like to lean
into, so just saying that this is not a complete description of everything that's
needed. But what we'll be leaning into today for our practice is, is an
embodies embodiment. So keep, we keep bringing back this metta to ourselves,
to the body again, and again, and again. And when the mind wanders off for a
thought or a plan or tomorrow, yesterday, it's like, oh, sweetheart, it's okay. It's
okay, come back to the body, come back, come back. And if we feel, oh, I've had
this, I'm done with it, I'm bored, like, oh, stay, stay, stay, stay, we just keep
petting, we just, you hang in there. And one concept I want to bring in here is in
psychology, this is called the very technical term of response inhibition,
response inhibition, which is this, in one description of it is refers to the
suppression of actions that are inappropriate in a given context, and
that interfere with goal driven behavior. Yeah, that's very psychological. But the
point here, which is actually this practice, it's really, I mean, this idea of
response inhibition is when you stay, you just stay you kindly, gently, I know it
sounds really clinical. But it's also another way to feel into like, you know,
it's like, oh, I've had it, okay, it's been whatever 20 minutes, okay, I want to go
and watch Netflix. Now I've practiced, you know, I've done this, like, stay, stay,
stay, can you stay? And the more you stay, the more like, okay, I want to just
fidget and grab my tea and drink it in the middle of meditation and fidget and
scratch myself. What if I stay? What if I gently stay? Get not in a harsh way. I'm
not suggesting that. But can you gently train yourself to stay? Keep petting, petting
the kitty and see what happens. See what happens at the end, right? If you don't
interrupt, if you don't go after all these distractions of thought or mind, just
see if there's sense of nourishment. Again, you need to be very gentle with this.
It's not a harsh thing to do. Just lovingly. Oh, can you stay, sweetheart? Can you
stay? Okay. So that is the frame for tonight. That is the frame for tonight. And
again, gentleness, ease, it's nourishment. Being nourished and healed is our goal, is
our destination. So if anything, if you find yourself becoming too harsh or too
tight, that's not the way. Let that go. It's okay. Just breathe, breathe with ease,
breathe with ease, and kindly, kindly turn to whatever is arising as if you're
petting the kitty. So that's the frame. I think I've said all I wanted to say to
set the frame. So, so let's begin. Let's practice together. So, so let yourself be
comfortable for this practice, especially for this practice. Let yourself be
comfortable sitting comfortably. It's good if your spine is straight. There is sense
of integrity in your posture. Lying down is fine. Lying down is okay. But there will
be a sense of integrity in your limbs, in your spine. Ah, let your body be
comfortable and landing, landing, landing, arriving, arriving here.
Embodied, embodied, turning the attention to the body ever so gently. And inviting
the body to relax. Let go. Might be tired. Might be hurting. Release. Can you
release? Ah, can you release into, release into all the nooks and crannies of this
body that haven't got attention today because you've been too busy. The mind
has been attending to the proverbial to-do list. Here.
Relaxing, relaxing, releasing into the body, letting the breath be
breathed. Gently, kindly.
Each breath, with each in-breath connecting the awareness of the body,
the awareness connecting, with the sensations of breathing in this moment,
and with each out-breath,
releasing into, say, your toes. How are the toes feeling? Refuel out-breaths, release
into the toes and the sensations in the toes. Then the feet. Then the lower
legs. Relaxing. Same way that image of us, petting, the kitty, let the breath
embrace. Different parts of the body. The feet, the out-breath now. Ah, embracing
the lower legs, the knees. The upper legs being petted, embraced with the out-breath.
The each out-breath released, released, felt. Notice when you release each part of
the body, as if it was being petted by the breath. Is there a more sensation that's
available? More ease that becomes a thing. The entire lower legs, lower part of the
body, the sub-bones. Petted with the out-breath, kindly. There's a sense of
kindness, gentleness. In each breath, the metta is infused with each breath. It's not
separate. The lower abdomen, taking your time.
. The lower back, released.
Into the chair, into the cushion, the bed. With each out-breath.
into the chair, into the cushion, the bed. With each out-breath, you can
breathe. The chest, area around the heart center, with each out-breath.
Released. As if the breath is lovingly petting a kitty. Here, here, here, here.
Here. Dear body, dear kitty.
The in-breath bringing awareness, bright awareness to this part of the body, the chest
bright awareness, the out-breath letting go, releasing. Notice if you're getting sleepy,
it may be helpful to bring attention, the in-breath to the aliveness, to the brightness
in this body part. Down the shoulders, arms, elbows, lower arms, hands.
With each in-breath bringing awareness, bright awareness, with each out-breath releasing,
letting go, the kitty being lovingly penned.
The neck and shoulders, aah, the face, the cheeks, the nose, the nose, the nose, the
cheeks, the forehead, the tongue, the ears, the jaw muscles, and the proverbial thinking
muscle of the brain. In-breath, here, bright out-breath released, relaxed into, let thinking
be relaxed, or released, let it be released.
And now, the entire body, the in-breath, let it be released, let it be released, let
the in-breath, sense of awareness, brightness, here, knowing the body is breathing.
And the out-breath, release, relax, let go, kindly, lovingly, as if the breath, the out-breath
especially, is petting the kitty of the body, lovingly, it's the metta, the metta in-breath,
here now, I'm here, I pay attention to my dear self, dear body, this dear being who's
me. Ah, the out-breath, release, with kindness, here, here, sweetheart, maybe you even have
an image of the breath, petting the whole body, maybe the body starts to purr after
a while, receiving all this loving attention.
Let yourself be surprised as to what levels of peace, nourishment, healing might be possible
all through continuity, consistency with this practice.
And if thoughts arise, pet them and release them too, coming back to the body, the nourishment
of the breath, wrapped in metta.
Ah, the out-breath, release, let go, kindly, lovingly, it's the metta, the out-breath,
releasing, releasing, letting go.
The other side of the coin of metta, release into peace, release into love, loving each
part, each and every part of this body with the breath.
Ah, the out-breath, release, let go, kindly, lovingly, lovingly, lovingly, lovingly,
lovingly, lovingly, lovingly.

Can there be meta wrapped with each breath in each breath breathing in and out for this entire body?
Especially if any part is having challenges.
Let the breath imbued with kindness be nourishing, healing to your heart, to your mind, to your body.
