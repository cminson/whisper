 It says here very explicitly, kind of says, the view I have no self is a problem. So if you ever, if you doubted that, if I was just making this up, that the Buddha was somehow empty, no self-you, here you have it in the horse's mouth. Or be careful what I say, I suppose. So here we have this idea of the frames of reference being shifted. He's saying that there's certain questions you can ask which are very common for us, it's very kind of automatic or maybe kind of almost seemingly intuitive to ask questions like, who am I? Was I in the past? Who will I be in the future? What's going to happen to me? What am I? These are very basic questions of human beings asked. And in fact, in some spiritual circles, practices, there's some very central questions, you know, who am I? What am I? Are asked. Now, what the Buddha is saying here is that these are probably not useful categories for examining our experience. And maybe what we're going to do is not to try to answer these with some of the various kinds of views that we can be attached to, but rather to shift the frame of reference, shift the question of the words that we're trying to address away from the question of self to something else. That perhaps the any question framed with a framed by the word self is going to lead to some misconception and probably going to lead to some conceit. So we want to be careful, very careful with the kind of questions we ask. If you ask, you know, who is a true self? Who am I? Or what am I? That it might not lead to useful answers is, I think, a suggestion here. So for the purpose of Buddhist spiritual life, you don't want to ask those questions, which seems very odd to people who are used to asking those questions. And it seems like it's very reasonable to ask those questions, but rather you ask something different. And you turn around and you ask. So in the last paragraph, so he doesn't he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention. And he tends to ideas fit for attention. So he shifts the frame of reference. And he tends to what are the questions? What are the ideas? What are the frame of reference, which is appropriate? This is suffering. This is the origin of suffering. This is the stopping of suffering. This is the way leading to the ending of suffering. So suffering, or dukkha, stress, becomes the question, you know, what is the cause of the suffering and what is the ending of it? So the therapeutic purposes of Buddhism come to the highlight of the frame of reference. We study our life by studying where is the suffering here? Rather than we studying where is the self here? What is a true self here? We say, where is the suffering here? And then Buddhist practice is to go directly into the suffering, not to not to dwell on suffering, it's a morbid way, but rather to see suffering, see the cause of suffering and experience the ending of that suffering. And what the Buddha is suggesting is that's a useful frame of reference. That's a useful approach to studying our life. So it's dropping the category of self entirely, which is always going to be, I would suggest, a concept, a categorical category imposed on top of experience, in favor of paying attention to some particular aspect of our direct experience, which is always in a sense, in a sense we can say kind of real. The self as a concept is not real because concepts are not real in and of themselves. They're useful as concepts. But what's real in a sense, if we allow to talk about, use that language, is our suffering. And if you're feeling like you're suffered, that's as real as anything's going to get. So it's, you know, it means you want to deny its reality, that's okay with me, but let's just define that as the benchmark for suffering reality. And your suffering is something you can directly experience. And so you start, you want to keep focusing on what can be directly experienced because the purpose of Buddhism is to become free of your suffering. And since suffering gets born based on our relationship to the world of experience, it's in the world of experience that we can become free of suffering. So we don't need to posit some sense of self, because we can't be free of suffering. Self or some reality beyond our experiential, experienceable world. There's no need for that in Buddhism. There might be such a thing, but there's no need for that because the domain of suffering and freedom of suffering comes from in the very domain itself of experience. And one of the central categories of experience or focuses of experience is suffering. Now, does that make sense, what I said? So questions, Jim. Yeah, I noticed the first identity view. So this is about right view that, correct, that identity view would be wrong view. The first one being I have a self. Where are you? Well, I was at the end where he was talking about the three feathers being a man. Oh, yeah. So is identity view being this framing of the self being wrong view? Yes, yeah, I think so. Or identity view is the view that there is an existing. So right view, traditional, traditional stuff, discussion about view is that right view is understanding the Four Noble Truths and understanding how to use the Four Noble Truths as categories of reference, as frames of reference for understanding the Four Noble Truths. So the Four Noble Truths is not meant to be a view in terms of a metaphysical view of what's true and what's not true. It's rather categories for helping us focus on our direct experience. So our direct experience is quite varied, quite wide. A lot of people can't think of it. As the Buddha said, it's particularly useful to have this particular aspect of our direct experience, the suffering of the beautiful self. Oh, yes, in a sense you can, but this is not a general formula. What he's saying here is that just stay with whatever you're doing. I think what he's saying is that these particular aspects of reference to, particularly in this particular sense, so you don't want to just pay attention to anything in the world, but this is particularly useful. So, so, so, creative experience. Say there's a lot of peace in your meditation practice. If a person focuses on the peace, it might, it might sustain the peace a little bit longer, it might not, it might be useful to recognize it, it might strengthen it, it might predispose a person to have more peace in the future. There's a time to really be mindful of the peace, but at some point the person wants to turn their attention and start noticing where is the subtle clinging, where is the subtle stress, so the subtle suffering, even in that very deep state of peace, because it's the suffering which is going to be the, the, the, in a sense, maybe the tip of the iceberg for where clinging still exists, and so, and where the cutting edge of your practice needs to be, and so, and so you want to, so, you want to then look around, see where am I still suffering, where there's still some holdings and attachment, and then look at that and address that directly, and what you'll find is at that point of suffering is still an area where you're relating to something which is conditioned, some fabricated, it's something that's been created, an assumption or something, some clinging, and then, and then you be, and then because you're addressing it and you, you, then you let go of that, so, so as, as things get more and more subtle in meditation, then you're able to address more and more subtle areas of clinging, and for some people it's only in very deep still meditation that they might actually directly be able to perceive the clinging and the suffering connected to I am. In normal everyday life, you know, I am is such a, is such an easy natural thing to assume that you don't necessarily mean you're suffering because of taxes, you know, you know, who could care, you know, it's, it taxes you, it's way over shadow what's going on with, you know, I am, but once, you know, you're on retreat long enough and you've forgotten your taxes, you've forgotten your bills, you've forgotten, you know, all these things, you know, and you actually get very, very still and very quiet, then you see it actually, in the suffering inherent in just having the notion I am is seen, and then you want to investigate that. What happens to some people in deep meditation is that they get to kind of plateau a lot of peace and whatever, very calm, and then, and then they kind of just hover there for a long time, and a way to go to the next stage is to actually begin looking around and see where is the suffering here, where is the, where is there still some stress and some clinging, and then, and that can move you on, and, and finally it'll move you on to what's what Dhanisribhika calls the unbinding, the final release, the final letting go of any kind of clinging at all. So, so another way of maybe saying what the Buddha said here, I hope, is that if you want to simplify your practices as being, and making it most direct and most straightforward, you would use these questions or these frames of reference. You pay attention in this way. You pay attention to suffering, the cause of suffering, and all that. If you, if you start negotiating the path from the point of view of self, that sooner or later you're going to reach an impasse where you can't go any further. So what you, from the Buddhist, from the Buddhist critique, which maybe is not fair critique, they will look at people who have, there are people who will say now I've discovered my, you know, infinite self, I've discovered my cosmic self, I've discovered, you know, whatever, and from the Buddhist point of view often when they listen and pay attention to what their meditative experience is, or whatever, that's, that's giving that impression, they say, oh, that person is, is in the seventh or eighth or the sixth or the fifth jhana, an particular form of absorption, which is very, very reified where consciousness becomes infinite, for example, in the meditation experience. And then they, they take that meditation experience and then they add an assumption of self to it. Oh, I have an experience of consciousness being infinite, that must be myself. They've added an assumption to it. And then adding that assumption, if you, if you pay careful attention, you'll see that that itself is extra not needed, and in fact adds a certain level of stress to the whole system. It involves a little bit of clinging. And it's a misunderstanding because the final release hasn't happened. Infinite consciousness still has within it a certain level of clinging. It's very, very subtle. It's phenomenally subtle. But if you look very, very carefully, if the mindfulness is very well developed, then you might be able to see the very subtle dissatisfaction that's part of that experience. And as you include that feeling of dissatisfaction, that it's not enough or not good enough, we're kind of, then there can be letting go of that. Sometimes that'll then move into deeper jhana experience. And sometimes the person will go, will go to the eighth jhana or something even further. And, or sometimes they won't go any further into the jhanas, but they'll take, they'll just jump from that jhana into final release. They just let go of everything. Rather than just letting go a little bit and just going on to the different, the next jhana, they'll let go much more and move beyond the meditative world entirely. So I think this is, for me, this is a very important point. And for a few other teachers, I know this is a very important point, that certain questions are useful to address, useful to carry with you. And some questions may be not useful to carry with you. And some questions would seem very natural, intuitive to carry with us. And people will bring often to us, you know, to address in their practice, maybe are not so useful. And so maybe what's needed is to jump over to a different frame of reference, to look at our life from a different point of view, not looking for the true self, but rather looking for the true release from suffering. So from this point of view, any kind of view of self, it's kind of, has no point. I mean, it might have some point, but it's not needed. Any view of self, whether you have a self or don't have a self, is no longer interesting to answer. You don't have to answer that question if you're focusing on the Four Noble Truths. And the claim here is the Four Noble Truths will take you the whole way. So that makes sense? So I don't have to. What is the container? Yeah. Yeah. It all changes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. What's happening? What's containing them? What is here? What is this experience? Well, I don't know. Maybe it is the frame of reference question. Well, maybe not. See, first of all, it might be interesting for you to explore where that need for understanding what the container is. I mean, question that for a while. Don't you simply think naively think, well, I'm going to find the container. Question the question and question that category and say, where do, on what authority and what what belief or what tenants am I basing this question on? Is it a valid, you know, do I have a valid, valid, is it on valid authority that I'm even asking that question? And it might be, for example, a kind of flat earth question. If you're looking for the end of the earth because the earth is flat, you know, you're never going to find it because the earth's not flat. But so if you're looking for the container, you might be asking the same kind of question. It's possible. I'm not going to. I'm not saying that's the case. So don't don't believe me. So I don't want you to let go of that question too quickly. But you might want to look at it. I can't listen. I'm stuck in like two weeks now. Yeah. Could the container be simply an ever ongoing process? Yes, I think that's fair to say. So like the river is an ongoing process. So so that the content in a sense, if there's any container, it's an ongoing process of your whole life, which is made up of many different mental and psychological and physical factors that are all working somehow in harmony, working together. And if you try to go and pinpoint it more exactly than that, then overall process, then then you won't find something. That's one possibility. So if you go back to the themes of the day, themes of self and no self at the bottom of the page is a very famous quotation by Buddha Gosha, who is who laid down kind of the the he's like a Thomas Aquinas of terra vata Buddhism. There is suffering, but none who suffers. There is doing although there is no doer. Liberation exists, but no liberated person. Although there is a path, there is no goer. Although there is an experience like Denise had, there was no experience or there's no container. So, you know, yes, please. The what not there. To you. So I got stunned a little bit there because I guess you're asking just a very simple, straightforward question, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yes, of course you can talk to me. I'm always available. Like, you know, like next Saturday during the retreat or where do you sign up? I do two kinds of one day sittings. The ones they sitting from a 30 to five, there's 15 minute interviews that people can sign up for you have to come early. Usually it's like get a slot. Those from nine to four 30, there's no formal interviews, but there's usually plenty of open space during the walking meditation to come and talk to me informally. And then outside of those times, I like to see people on retreats. That's my preference. But outside of that, I can see people in my Ivan office in Menlo Park. He's, you know, give me a call and we'll set up a time. Yes. Go. So what's someone turn on the light? I don't know where it is, but phrase jumped out in the middle of this. There's an acknowledgement in the middle of this, if there is a, there is a no word. There's a what? No word. Yes. Where is it? Right in the middle of the number six margin, this very solid line, no word of any sense in the Yeah. Yeah. Maybe so. Maybe so. I thought that was one of the wrong views. This is the same as this is not the inappropriate way. It seems to say there is a lower with the point of thinking it's constant. That's one way of understanding it. The other way of understanding it is that there is knowing that's for sure. The Buddhism is never going to deny knowing because it's so central, but then to pause it on top of the knowing a knower, that's extra. There's no need to add that on top. And then from that, then the person gets even more complicated. But I mean, so it's a bit, but everything in italics there is, it is a view. Yeah. But that's, but, but it's so, it's so central to many of us that, you know, we have to grapple with this little bit to really, otherwise we're not going to put down the self. I think it's fair to grapple. Okay. So let's go to seven, which I think is the last of the discourse readings. dump. One who is such, and I don't know what her such, but I'm tired of it all. I've heard a scene called Burrow's Head, and that's not the true life. One who is such, and one who is such all the time, and I've heard a scene where you were taught. You can see well in the dance in that arrow. You're going to reach the pass of the mind, and you'll see that's just how it is. There's nothing on this economy that has to be. So maybe a little bit hard to understand this because... But the... When the zagata, when a Buddha someone was awake and sees something, there's certainly seeing happening, but there isn't a positing of an object that's being seen. Now, there isn't a positing that there's no object being seen either. There's just seeing. So it seems a little bit odd, this kind of way of talking, but I think that if we try to drop out of normal descriptive language of how we describe our experience, imagine maybe what would be an experience of grace, an experience of mystical experience, an experience where radically the self is not being posited, where there's no self-conscious experience of doing anything with the experience. Then maybe we get close to what he's talking about here. When you're talking about the consciousness or the experience of someone who's awake, there is no... And I call it, I think, grace because you don't see a door as an object, but there certainly is... A person knows what to do with a door. A person still opens a door and walks out. So the person relates the door as a door is supposed to be related to. But the person doesn't then add on any kind of... There's no additions to it. A door is just a door. There's no idea the door is an object either. Of course the door is an object. But the mind doesn't construct it as an object. It doesn't take the next step of thinking, oh, that door is a door, even though there's a seeing of the door. Does that make any sense? For whom does it make sense? Please, you know. I hope it doesn't make sense to some people, because then I'm confident that... I don't know if they said... I thought that I heard the thinking of our children's books and actually how we learn language. They thought I'd go through a picture of the Bible. Sure. So this is kind of possible. This is similar to the class we're in every year. It's actually like the town of Watcha Cap'n. When we're doing pressure experiments, this is like the sixth grade, it's a kid's job, and you need to hold. And you do... You'd be working with syringes and different sorts of devices to make low-end pressures, and it's not only what you put it under, you push them against the wall. And I hope that those depression wasn't being pulled into the wall for a push them into the wall, because it being pulled is a pleasure when you're being pulled in and pushed on. Even after a month of experiments, they desperately want to leave the theme pulled into the wall. And it seems to me I can remain in response. But at some point, instead of such a way as only goodness, I try to... I pressure you to travel so low. Really, being pushed on. It is not to be pulled on off. That is no... There is no such thing as suction. And in a rough analogy, the children make this... The shift, which you think is a beluded investment, is a shift away from... Don't get hung up on suction. It really doesn't exist. It's a mental construct. It's a communion that's going to be this and this. What really exists is pressure differences that allow things to... Thanks. Yes. Perhaps if we translate this into... If we translate this into kind of common relationships with people, we don't see the person as being a fixed entity, a fixed self. He's incapable of changing. So if someone does something mean to you, you don't then always consider them to be a mean person. You don't make them a mean... Now, that person is a self because they're mean once, and I'm always going to attach meanness to that self there. But rather we see that mean activity happen. And let's relate to that. Let's be mindful of that. Maybe there are some consequences that you can implement because of that one experience. But you're ready to see the person in a fresh way. You're not carrying with you some fixed notion of who that person is. You don't want to be blank in the sense of, anything goes. That's not wise either. But you want to be mindful of what you can actually experience, what actually happened. And then be mindful of any way in which we add or interpret extra concepts on top of that. So if someone was mean to you, it's bad enough that they were mean. And so just be mindful of that meanness. But then we can add, for example, the notion that's a mean person. But you don't want to be a blank slate where it says, well, meanness doesn't really exist. I'm not going to pay attention to it. Does that make sense? That's what it's all about. Yeah, that's right. That's a nice assumption to have. It's helpful, something to have. Yeah. And... But you can get in trouble with that assumption too. Well, here, I can tell you, you don't want to lose your head. No. I'm not sure if that's the option. So... Yeah. And... Well, two things to that. One is that I think it's helpful to have a view of open possibility, and the possibility of change and development, and not have some view of things that are fixed the way they are. Buddhism is very optimistic about what... About the capacity of human beings to develop themselves and change themselves. And the other is, we need to be mindful of what we do in terms of... in relationship to ideas of self and self and other. But we don't want to get hung up a little bit, where there's no self-teaching. We want to be careful you don't kind of... Now you're taking the class and all this to allow... I'm no longer going to see a self in a person over here. You know... The idea always to be mindful of what you're actually doing, as opposed to just positing some... positing some... something you should not care. So now I thought... I want... I got interested in this topic recently again, of Anatta. When I started trying to see how some of the... Western writers and the teachers of Buddhism handled the teaching of self and not self. And I found it was very interesting, especially when I got into my own local tradition of the Vipassana movement in America. And I thought it was kind of... Some of the things I found is condensed, I think, and I did in Jack Kornfield's book, A Path with Hearts. And Jack, I think, is a very sophisticated thinker. And much more sophisticated than most people will give him credit to in this. Because he's kind of the popularizer of Buddhism also. He likes to kind of... He likes to be kind of... be evocative, to evoke people of beautiful, kind of sugar-coated, wonderful stories and make people feel good. But I think he's someone who's very well studied and very sophisticated in many ways about both Buddhism and also Western thought. So it's not someone... If you're sophisticated yourself, it's very easy to read Jack and discount him. However... And so he has this wonderful chapter, interesting chapter, at least, no self or true self in his Brokapatha cards. And if you have that book, you might read the whole chapter and see what he does there. It's fascinating. It raises a lot of questions. And in the opening pages of this, he tries to lay out what he takes to be the Buddha's teaching on Anattva. So... Why doesn't someone... So under the section called The Nature of Selflessness, why doesn't someone read the first paragraph for us? So you had this whole data looking at what the Buddha said about this question of self and the issue of Anattva. Now, from the perspective of what you studied today, what do you think about Jack's statement to him? How does it fit? What's your reaction to him? Please. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
