So, hello everyone and warm greetings.
Welcome.
And some of you have been commenting in chat.
I see that it's cold where you are.
And sometimes when the weather is warm or cold,
in between, there's a way of using the temperature of the place where it's meditating
as a reminder to be involved in the sensory body,
to be connected to the body in some deeper way where we're sensing and feeling it.
Sometimes when it's uncomfortable, whether it's easy to be in the control tower,
you know, a little bit upset with what's happening or not liking it.
And an alternative is to kind of enter into the sensations of cold or warm
and rest in them and feel them, receive them.
And there's occasionally a very different way in which the body receives warmth and cold
if the mind is not resisting or reacting to it,
but the mind is helping us to feel it and sense it in the body.
And that's kind of the theme for this morning's meditation is a kind of sensory awareness exercise
which the Buddha is pointing towards.
And that is to have a sensory experience of the breathing.
It means to step out of the control tower of a lot of thinking and analyzing, judging
and trusting that we don't have to do that.
We're trusting that instead we can rest ourselves, rest attention in the body as it's being experienced,
as it's felt, the sensory body.
And not only does it, in being grounded in the sensory body,
is it protection from being wandering off and wayward thoughts.
It's also a little protection from being excessively self-concerned,
which is naturally enough and certainly appropriate enough at times,
but it can be overly done.
It's nice to take a vacation from self-preoccupation.
And so this dropping into the body and feeling the body's experience,
for some people can see that it provides them with that vacation from self-concern,
at least for these minutes of the meditation.
And finally, there's something very special about sensations that we experience.
Sensations are the meeting place or the synthesis or the dynamic kind of experience that arises
when the mind is connected to the body.
The body has sense nerves all over it that can be triggered, stimulated to give a sense experience.
The mind is what knows that. Awareness is what knows that.
And the meeting of the body and the awareness, the meeting place of the body and mind,
is in the sensations themselves.
And the sensations occur where the sense nerves reside.
And so sensing, or capacity to sense, and sensations are like two sides of a hand
that can't really be distinguished in experience.
And that's the meeting place of the mind and body.
And we're trying to, in this meditation practice too, have the mind and body be together,
working together.
If the mind ones are often thought or commentary, discursive thought,
then the mind is somewhere else besides the body.
But when the mind is there connected, meeting with sensations, with sensing,
then they're working together.
And one way today that we'll talk about dropping into that is by relaxing into it.
So to assume a upright meditation posture,
and sometimes by being careful with your meditation posture,
the body begins to support you in being aware through the body.
An intentional posture has attention in it.
Gently closing your eyes.
And as you inhale, sense and feel what happens in your body with a deeper inhale.
And on the exhale, a longer, gentle exhale, relaxing the body.
Breathing in and breathing out.
And it's a little bit of a ritual to take some deeper breaths at the beginning.
A ritual of being reminded.
Here, this is the body.
This is the place to be during these minutes of meditation.
And letting your breathing return to normal.
And as you exhale, relax different parts of your body.
But as you relax them, see if it can be like a relaxing into the sensations of that part of your body.
Almost like you're resting in that part of your body.
Maybe beginning with your belly.
On the exhale, softening the belly and resting.
Softening the belly and then softening, settling into feeling more of the belly.
On the exhale, relaxing your legs, settling into your legs, feeling them more as you relax.
Breathing in and the exhale, softening the shoulders and feeling the shoulders more as you relax.
On the exhale, relaxing the muscles of your face, feeling those muscles.
Feeling your face as you relax.
And if there's any tension or pressure associated with thinking mind, thinking muscle,
as you exhale, relax the mind and feel whatever sensations are associated with that tension and pressure or what replaces it.
And then open your awareness to that place in your body where you most easily experience the body breathing.
And as you inhale, receive the sensations of inhale.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax whatever keeps you separate from the sensations of breathing.
Relax into the sensations of the body breathing.
Perhaps floating on the changing nature of those sensations.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
If you're intimate with the inhales, you probably feel more than one sensation as you're breathing in.
More than one sensation of inhale.
And probably one more than one sensation as you exhale.
There can be two or three or a kaleidoscope of sensations that come and go or fleeting as the body goes through the motion of breathing in and breathing out.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, and feeling the sensations of exhaling, see if you can relax into them.
Relax with them.
Settle further into your body, breathing.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
As you exhale, relax into the sensations of exhaling.
Relax into the sensations of breathing.
And have the sensations be where the mind and body meet, trusting.
That staying close to that meeting point is valuable.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
And for a couple more minutes, see if you can be continuous in your awareness
of the whole length of breathing in, beginning, middle, and end.
The whole length of breathing out, beginning, middle, and end.
Really staying connected, like the mind is holding hands with the body breathing.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
Relax.
And as we come to the end of this sitting,
learning to stay true with the breathing, meaning learning how to stay attentive
to the breathing is a life skill where we also learn to then develop the attention
to all kinds of things in our lives,
including an attentiveness, a presence that we can offer to others.
We can listen better without quickly inserting our ideas and thoughts.
Hear people deeply.
We can take time to see and feel and sense the situation we're in before we assert ourselves into it.
And this ability to sense and feel and see and attend is the basis for wisdom to living wisely.
It's also the basis for living kindly because to be wise in Buddhism
goes hand in hand with being friendly and caring.
So may it be that whatever ability we develop to be mindful, to be present,
to attend with attention, may it serve us to contribute to this world,
so that we contribute our care, our love, our kindness, our compassion,
our friendliness for the welfare and happiness of all.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be safe.
And may all beings everywhere be free.
