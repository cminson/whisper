The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, great to be back with you. See so many familiar faces here.
Tonight, I want to talk about the moments in between in our lives. Moments of waiting, of travel, the interstitial moments.
Whether it's in line at the grocery store, at an airport, or waiting for a doctor's appointment, whatever.
And to invite us to bring our practice to those moments.
Practice to the strangers around us, to ourselves, to the sort of mundaneness of those moments of waiting.
For me, I found that my own practice, my own life really transformed when waiting went from waiting to an opportunity for practice, for meditation practice, and in particular loving kindness practice, although mindfulness also works beautifully.
So, I'm going to read something. We have someone from Albuquerque. This is actually written by a poet about the Albuquerque airport.
A friend of the Insight Meditation Movement, or a friend of Buddhism, Naomi, she have Nyai.
And she has a little piece that she wrote called Wandering Around an Albuquerque Airport.
Many of you may have heard this before. Just to listen to it with the ears of someone who might be practicing with something similar.
She writes, After learning my flight was detained for hours. I heard the announcement.
If anyone in the vicinity of gate 4a understands any Arabic, please come to the gate immediately.
Well, one pauses these days.
But gate 4a was my gate. I went there.
An older woman in full traditional Palestinian dress, just like my grandma wore, was crumpled to the floor wailing loudly.
Help said the fight service person. Talk to her. What is her problem?
We told her the fight was going to be four hours late, and she did this.
So I put my arm around her and spoke to her haltingly.
And I'm just going to read the translation because I have no Arabic whatsoever.
Dua, that's a girl's name. What do you want honey? Wait. Wait a second, please. What are you doing?
The minute she heard any words that she knew, however poorly used, she stopped crying.
She thought our flight had been canceled entirely.
And she needed to be in El Paso for some major medical treatment the following day. I said, no, no, we're fine.
You'll get there just late.
Who's picking you up? Let's call him and tell him.
So we called her son and I spoke with him in English.
I told him I would stay with his mother until we got on the plane and would ride next to her southwest Airlines.
Then she talked to him and then we called her other sons just for the fun of it.
Then we called my dad and he spoke to her for a while in Arabic and they found out, of course, they had 10 shared friends.
All of this took an hour. Then I thought, what the heck?
Why not call some Palestinian poets I know and let them chat with her?
This all took up to about two hours.
She was laughing a lot by then, telling about her life, answering questions.
She pulled out a sack of homemade Mamoul cookies, little powdered sugar crumbly mounds filled with dates and nuts out of her bag.
And she was offering them to all the women at the gate.
To my amazement, not a single woman declined one.
It was like a sacrament.
The traveler from Argentina, the traveler from California, the lovely woman from Laredo.
We were all covered with the same powdered sugar and smiling.
There are no better cookies.
And then the airline broke out the free beverages from huge coolers, non-alcoholic, and the two little girls from our flight, one African American, one Mexican American,
ran around serving us all apple juice and lemonade and they were covered with powdered sugar too.
And then I noticed my new best friend, by now we were holding hands, had a potted plant hooking out of her bag.
Such an old country tradition.
Always carry a plant.
Always stay rooted somewhere.
And I looked around that gate of late and weary ones and thought,
this is the world I want to live in.
The shared world.
Not a single person in this gate once the crying of confusion stopped seemed apprehensive about any other person.
They took the cookies.
I wanted to hug all those other women too.
This can still happen anywhere.
All is not lost.
Naomi, she hadn't gone.
So, not that all of us are necessarily any of us are going to do exactly something like that, but what I love about her writing this is it speaks to the incredible power
of openness and kindness to strangers.
Openness and kindness in these moments that could just be about waiting,
be really unpleasant, could be really isolating.
And instead, sometimes there's this magical connection when one person is open, kind and pathetic to another in these situations.
One of my roommates many years ago in Chicago met her future husband in a stalled grocery store line in very similar type of circumstances.
And just like the magic of the whole line talking to each other instead of being grumpy and frustrated.
Just to invite the possibility.
Kindness.
Open.
Those are my introductory reflections, friends.
The invitation now is to settle back.
Find a comfortable posture.
Turn off anything that might distract you.
Computer notifications, phone notifications, anything like that.
Close your eyes.
Just so you know, I'm going to make it to where no one can unmute, but if you need to chat me, you can still chat me.
I will have my eyes open some of the time.
And the not unmuting part is just to make sure no one inadvertently noisily comes into the meditation room of meditation.
So finding a balanced posture, balanced between comfort and alertness.
And if you're comfortable doing so, the invitation is to soften your eyes and then gently close them.
Let them rest.
Let the gaze go internal.
Back towards your heart.
Most as if you could see through your body to your heart center.
Starting by taking one or two slightly deeper breaths.
Putting any excess tension out with the out breath.
And scanning through your body.
Feeling any places of quivering, aliveness, vibration, places of softness, tension, or relaxation.
Maybe sweeping the attention from the tip of the head, the crown of the head.
Down through the face, forehead, eyes, cheeks, jaw.
Allowing even the tongue to relax.
Maybe feeling the warmth of your breath.
Through your windpipe and throat.
And inviting that to soften the neck.
The chest.
The shoulders, relaxing down away from the ears.
Feeling the breath.
Your chest, maybe flexing the ribs a little bit on the in breath.
Maybe warming the inside of your upper back.
Feeling the pleasure, the relaxation of the out breath.
To allow the attention to sink further into your core.
The lungs and viscera, the diaphragm, the belly.
Allowing them to hang softly from the spine.
Softening the mid and lower back.
The hips and groin.
And allowing your weight to feel supported.
Against the cushion, chair.
Whatever that surfaces.
Held by gravity.
Cradled.
Allowing the legs, the thighs, calves, shins to soften.
Allowing any excess tension to drain out of the ankles and feet.
While inviting them to relax true.
And allowing awareness to fill up the whole body.
Awareness from the inside out.
Attuning to the sensations of your own aliveness.
And especially attuning to the sensations associated with your body breathing.
Could be a general sense of aliveness of transpiration.
All of the cells in a give and take of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Dancing in harmony.
Or it could be as simple as the rising and falling of the abdomen and chest.
Or the subtle, pleasant, or simply undefinable sensations at the tip of the nose.
Rest in the flow of the inner and out for a few minutes.
Inviting all other concerns.
In there.
Allowing awareness to fill the body in the moment.
Loving yourself to be served.
Now when you're ready.
The invitation is to call to mind.
A person, animal, or being.
From whom the thought of them just brings a smile to your being.
A sense of lightness or happiness to your heart.
It could be an image of them or a felt sense of them.
Perhaps even imagining that they're nearby in the same room.
Noticing.
Turning into your heart center.
Noticing how it feels there.
Noticing how it feels in your whole chest.
And then it feels right to you.
Sending good wishes to this other one.
Maybe on the out breath.
Or as an imagined gesture.
Or expression.
Receiving how that feels.
Give, offer, and in breath.
And then it feels right to you.
Imagine them receiving these good wishes.
Perhaps a felt sense of that or imagined expression.
Some kind of resonant.
Some kind of attuning for it.
Resuming the offering.
Emitting from your heart towards them.
Like a movement.
Sound wave, gone.
Offering.
Receiving.
Like it's thoughtful.
You can use words.
Your own in your own language or I'll offer some.
To clarify and hone these good intentions.
We'll start with slightly longer phrases.
And then shorten them.
Encourage you to shorten whatever you say.
The way of building momentum.
May you be safe.
From inner and outer harm.
May you be happy.
May you heal and be as healthy as possible.
May you know peace.
May you be free.
Be safe.
Happy.
Be healthy.
Be peaceful.
Be free.
Offering these good wishes to this other one.
Thank you so much for your work.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Time to time.
Checking in with the sensations and feelings in your own body and heart.
Refreshing these good intentions.
Just imagining them rippling through your body.
Outwards to this other one.
Or wafting out like a breeze.
Every cell, every pore, every muscle and bone in this body.
To this other one.
To this other one.
To this other one.
To this other one.
To this other one.
May we be safe.
Happy.
Healthy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The invitation is to imagine you and this other one.
In a mildly unpleasant or neutral place.
Or you're waiting.
Just in between.
In between events.
Activities, places, knowledge.
In that situation.
Sending kindness both to yourselves.
To yourself and this other one.
And also to any other people, creatures.
That might be either directly or tangentially there.
Or in a mild and some way.
Rippling out on you and this benefactor, ally, friend.
You see.
Happy.
Be peaceful.
Be useful and free.
Thank you.
I'm handling this chester ripple of offering to extend out beyond, feeling the resonance
the goodness of the intention in this body and heart.
you
you
you
you
expanding the circle out further perhaps letting go of any imagined scenario
and offering these intentions of kindness, femineness outward, unbounded in all directions
as near or far as they want to flow
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
in the most moments of this meditation
the invitation is to let go of any phrases or visualizations and just to relax into be with
savor or acknowledge whatever is arising in this moment
this body and mind with kindness and appreciation
and everything just flow through
you
you
thank you for the sincerity of your practice
this has become the custom here when I teach the invitation now is to stay in meditative space for a moment
and take a moment to offer kindness, feliness silently to the other members of this sangha
the ones here in this zoom room and little tiles you can turn on your video if you want to be seen to receive this kindness
and just scroll through and offer to your sangha mates, fellow practitioners
knowing as you're offering, you're receiving good wishes from everyone else here
and also to take a moment and offer kindness to any fellow practitioners who aren't here tonight
maybe once they'll be listening later, couldn't make it
thank you for that
Laura is open for anyone who has any short reflections, comments, questions about the practice based on what we did
you would like to share, I guess maybe use your zoom hand because we have more than one screen tonight
you're also welcome if you're not comfortable speaking to put it in the chat, it's fine too
yes, Kenneth, hi
hi, that was really wonderful, I really thank you for that, there was so much in there
the first part of it where we're feeling the energy of life force inside ourselves
is something I've been doing a lot of because I work with Tara Brock
but sensations in your body, in your hips and everything, so I call it my butt meditation
thank you Kenneth, yes, the aliveness
thank you very much, anything else while you're there?
no, okay, Charles Lee, please
hi, hello everybody
yeah, it was very absorbing practice
my house is empty, which is almost never the case
so it was like a different way to sit, I could hear the sound of silence
I, when you rang the bell at the end of practice, there was like a physical
filling of volume in my ears or ear canal that actually felt like it was being filled
so really in touch with the body
but throughout the entire sit, I was
like, what do I do with my hands? I was like, this would be a whole lot easier if I didn't have hands
so I don't know if you have any advice as to what I do with my hands when doing stationary practice
thank you so much for the beautiful sharing first
I'm curious, two things, first of all, where were your hands when you were practicing?
they were on my knees, they were in kind of like a mudra, I learned it as Zen practice
I was like this, I was like this, I was like this, I was like this
so there was a lot of switching
so is it fair to say there might have been a little bit of exploration, interest, curiosity
and maybe a little bit of rustlessness there with the hands?
yeah, I think there was some curiosity but then it definitely got into the fidgeting
and then even this idea of what's the, a little bit of doubt
what is this better than that, well this feels good but isn't supposed to feel good
or is it supposed to work towards keeping me centered
yeah, so feeling good is a good place to notice
and it's probably for me in meditation as long as it's not pulling me out of the meditation, if it feels good, it's usually help
so you can play with that
and then this is, I've not heard other teachers in this tradition talk about this
but I'll also share something that has been helpful for me particularly in loving kindness practice
which is to use like a mudra that is specific to the practice for me or for you, you can invent your own
but I've used a couple, one is trying to show you it's a heart, see that
and then if I'm directing it towards someone, I tend my fingers, yeah
and I just put my hands on my lap or have them down at my sternum which you can't see because of a camera
but wherever it feels useful, this is not supposed to be like a strained thing
and another thing I'll sometimes do occasionally especially when I'm switching people is something like that like an offering gesture
now that's non-standard, a lot of teachers will tell you not to move
so I just want to invite that as an occasional thing, not like an all-the-time thing but it can be helpful to draw the mind more deeply into the practice
especially if you happen to be more of a kinesthetic type
so those are possibilities but I would say like playing with a little bit and then settling into one thing
let yourself get deeper, it sounds like you were quite connected
thank you, beautiful questions
next
so friends we have reached what is for many people their favorite part of happy hour
Laura, we are about to go into breakout rooms, can we do a quick one?
yes for sure, just if you don't mind my just sharing what works for me in my hands
I often like to hold something that is meaning for me like a stone or a little clay figurine as meaning for me and that helps to calm and ground me
beautiful, thank you for sharing that, that's great
that's so weird, my wife just got made meditation stones, thank you
there you go
so friends, those of you who want to stay and talk in breakout rooms, you're warmly welcome to stay
if you want to stay and not talk in breakout rooms just don't accept the invitation, you can stay and meditate quietly
I'll be in the main room with my camera off
the invitation is to talk about
what might be an informal situation then in between situations where you would like to practice or have practiced kindness
or any of the other heart qualities, generosity, gratitude, equanimity, patience, compassion
altruistic joy
and like what works for you in informal situations
welcome back, we just have a minute or two left so anyone want to share anything short about something they learned from that
or something they shared in that that I think the large group would be interested in
yeah I want to just comment on I don't know if it's typical for the whole group at all
but it made me aware of how the time I waste in downtime
not really using it in any focused way at all and sort of encouraged me to, you know, realign myself if you will
beautiful
it's something really kind of profound to see isn't it
but that we can shift our relationship to downtime
in between time
well time's important, you know, it's the only asset that we can't recoup
you know we can get money back but we can't get time back so
yeah, we have moments
so I think we're at the top of the hour friends so
thank you for sharing each of you and with each other and earlier with all of us and just now with me
check and see
and see thanks going out to Neil
so
just want to briefly dedicate our time
may the benefits of our practice here together ripple out through our own lives and hearts
through the empty spaces through the moments in between
and may they be a benefit to all people all beings our lives touch
and all beings their lives touch and onward and onward
outward and outward
may all beings be safe
happy
healthy
peaceful and free
and may our actions help that to come about
thank you again for your practice everyone have a wonderful weekend
