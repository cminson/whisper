 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Here we go. Great. So hello and welcome everyone to this rendition of Happy Hour. Happy making to be with you, to see you and looking forward to practicing together. So I'd like to just transition into the guided meditation together and whatever you need to know, I'll share during the guidance and I might say a couple of words afterwards. So just trying slightly different forms instead of giving it the Dharamat at the beginning. So let's practice. So inviting you to get into your meditation posture, whatever that might be. Sitting standing lying down. And giving some attention to the body. Maybe the body needs to be just a little stretched. Maybe shoulders need to be rolled a little bit as mine do or weight needs to be shifted back and forth, side to side to find your center of gravity to really come into your body. Maybe your ankles need to be rolled a little bit to bring some life, some attention, some awareness into the legs or feet. Your hands maybe need to be rolled a little bit. This can also help actually this movement and help with a bit of embodiment, just bringing attention to the body. Maybe opening the jaw, arriving the body. By actually moving the body a little bit, waking it up. Here, here. And landing, landing in your sit bones. And connection points, your bottom of the chair, your feet, with the floor, your hands with your lap. Connecting with this body seated. Connecting between the back and the back in the 1956 flat surface body,Sp Gamses. Here's the best way to towel the sensitivity. Here is the scallionoqu Releases. Bass, Bass, bass, his tutorials, and Territorybutt. All the sensations, so many sensations. Bring him to the foreground. you and connecting it with the sensations of the breath and the belly each breath grounding just this breath as if it were our last right here right now as if it were the first and last just this breath the sensations of this breath here letting go of everything else is so sweet and nourishing just to be here with the nourishment of this breath you And if thoughts arise, not a problem to think, and yet right now, we choose to give our hearts to this practice in a friendly way. We smile at the thoughts, the plans, the occupations, reoccupations. Thank you. I'm giving my whole heart to this right now in this moment. Please come back later. If you're important enough, you'll come back. I'm going to give this priority. Give my heart priority, just me. Nourishing presence with each breath. Here, here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Relaxing the body, relaxing the mind, releasing, releasing. And now taking stock of what's happening, what's arising in the body. The area is where areas where there's ease, the areas where there's tightness, pain, maybe there's fatigue or agitation, tightness. In the body and in the mind, how's your heart? Your mind, your heart-mind. And notice there's not one thing, there are multiple things always. There could be, say, agitation, sadness, boredom, gladness, gratitude, peace, all of them together, everything present. And whatever you give your attention to, that becomes a measure, that becomes more predominant in that moment, which is okay. Just notice there are a lot of things. A mix of nourishing and challenging states, mind, body, heart. Now as if you were sitting on the lap, you gave yourself, sit on the lap of the Buddha or Kuan Yin, the paragon of compassion or some other archetype. Maybe the being of light represents complete acceptance for you. They see you, they know you through and through all the cause and conditions of your life. And in fact, they invite you to take their perspective with them. So you're taking their perspective looking at yourself, looking at your life, looking at your body, sensing your body, your thoughts, your mind state, heart state. From their perspective, you're joining them, making a third person perspective of compassion and kindness, wisdom and kindness towards yourself. And you're also saying if there's crankiness in the body and the heart, mind, you appreciate that from the perspective of complete acceptance, wisdom and compassion. How many causes, conditions in your life? Anyone else was in your shoes with the same background, genetics, life experiences. Everything that has happened. This would be what would be rising. So cut yourself some slack and see the goodness in you through the eyes of the Buddha, Kuan Yin, the being of light. Thank you. If the voice of judgment comes up, see that too as part of the cause and conditions. It's like a recording. It's been recorded a long time ago in your history and just playing out. See the goodness. This being who is you is doing their best. And in the words of Suzuki Roshi, you're perfect as you are and you can use a little bit of improvement. And you hold both through this perspective of kindness. Thank you. Thank you. From this perspective, from the third person perspective, through the eyes of the Buddha May you be safe, dear one. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you have ease. If the Buddha was generously wishing you well with abundant generosity of heart, may you be safe. Seeing yourself. Third person may be kneeling by the lap of the Buddha. Third person may be kneeling by the lap of the Buddha. Third person may be kneeling by the lap of the Buddha. Third person may be kneeling by the lap of the Buddha. Seeing yourself in the third person with kindness with good will, wishing yourself well may you be safe. Third person may be kneeling by the lap of the Buddha. Third person may be kneeling by the lap of the Buddha. May you have peace and goodness and joy. Whatever wishes feel appropriate in this moment, signifying your good will for this being who is you. Thank you. Thank you. How can I be a good friend to you? Asking yourself from this perspective, how can I be a good friend to you? Not exacerbate what's difficult to support you. Be kind. How can I love you more fully? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As we turn to bring this meditation to a close, let's consider all those we know, those near and dear, those we have challenges with and neutral people, also through the eyes of the puta, koynyan being of light. With benevolence, they're all doing their best. And the causes and conditions that each and every one of us has. How can you be a good friend? How can you see them and be a good friend? As best as you're able to with benevolence, wisdom, kindness. Wishing all beings well. May all beings everywhere be well, be safe, happy. May they be healthy. May they have ease. May all beings everywhere, including myself, be free. Thank you. Thank you for your practice, everyone. So the third person perspective that we worked with tonight can be very powerful when we see, when we try to play with this perspective and see ourselves with benevolence, with kindness through the eyes of the puta, koynyan, some being that represents kindness and compassion. And seeing ourselves from that perspective can open something up, can open the sense of, oh, what does this person who is me need? And am I making it worse with the judgments? How can I be a kind friend to myself? So it can open up a new perspective that's often when we are in our own mind or maybe judgments are coming up or our regular habit patterns may not be accessible. So, and with that, I'd like to invite us to turn to practice in small groups now. And the invitation tonight with the small groups, the small breakout groups is, how have you tried the third person perspective in this way? What about it works? What about it might be challenging? What can support you? What about taking the perspective of the Buddha or koynyan, et cetera? So just playing around with perspective, sharing your aha moments or challenges or maybe you fell asleep, which is perfectly fine, or maybe the whole time you were distracted, which is perfectly fine. Just checking in, just a brief check in with each other in order to support. And the invitation is just speak from your own experience, just a short nugget. There's no right or wrong. And the next person will go alphabetical order, will share a nugget. And then the next person, there is no asking questions or directing. It's just we show up. And also when your turn comes, you can just say pass, perfectly fine to pass. So, and such a rare and beautiful opportunity to be able to share, to practice with others. It's remarkable. So I'm creating the breakout groups, ask you to be kind to yourself, be kind to each other. And I'm about to open them. And actually, here we go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody's back. So we have time for maybe just a couple of reflections. And you're welcome to type them in chat if you like. You type them to me alone. There. It'll be private if you type it to everyone. It'll be public. And you can also raise your hand. Any reflections, any aha moments, any challenges? Mary Ann. Thank you, Nikki. I just wanted to say that the third person perspective is very helpful for me, both in giving myself metta and in concentration. Because it seemed like the, the, I had more freedom to just let myself concentrate and stop thinking because somebody else really important, the Buddha was saying it's okay. So, yeah, thank you. Beautiful. Thanks for sharing that lovely, both in giving kindness and in concentration. Just the sense of ease, letting go. Yes, the Buddha, the invoking the external and yet the internal Buddha, the inner Buddha, Buddha within. Beautiful. Thanks for that, Mary Ann. Jerry says, I was kinder to myself and then more kind to others, as I am very good at self-criticism. Yeah. Thanks, Jerry. Yeah. This third person perspective can really be helpful with criticism, especially for where I went. So, Michelou says, helpful to sense Kuan Yin's warmth, loving, but not caught by my personality, a relief to be beyond my personality. Yay. What a relief, right? To have the wisdom and kindness and not be caught. Beautiful. Just, I'm loving the practice reports. And one of you also sent me an email earlier today, because this is a similar theme that we worked with on Wednesday. And then one of you emailed and said, yes, this is working for me great. And just things are easier with the third person perspective and just, yeah. Yeah. So, beautiful, delightful, lovely. Any other reflections before we close? This feels complete to me. And one of you says, a new person wanted to know about the third person. Is that, I'm a little confused by this comment, does that mean when you became a third person, the new person wanted to know about the more, a new person in happy hours? I'm not quite sure about the context of that question. Yes. There was a new person who has never been to happy hour ever, ever, ever. And she was very confused and she wanted to know what it meant to have the perspective of the third person. Okay, great. Thanks. So, thank you for that, Serena. And I did explain it in the guided meditation. I wonder if this person joined later in the middle of the guided meditation or maybe, but the idea of the third person perspective is, is the way I guided it tonight was first we sit on the body and then we have a sense of, oh, yes, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Kuan Yin, externally, that is just giving us love and kindness and acceptance. And then we take the perspective, we join them looking at our own lives. That's kind of we take the third person perspective together with Kuan Yin, with Kuan Yin or the Buddha. So that's how we take the third person perspective onto our lives. So we're still us, but so we know our own history, our own life, but it is from this perspective of complete kindness and generosity. That's what that means. Another person says, Hi, Nikki, one of our members felt more grounded from the practice after dealing with the difficult news from the police officers in Tennessee. Yeah, difficult, difficult news, difficult times and they continue in our country and our world. And I'm glad to hear that this practice of peace could offer some support and some grounding. Yeah. So, yes, the recording is available and I'll post it tonight. And yeah, and what I'm also just to let you know, since I've been I'm experimenting tonight with with a different length of happy hour, not the whole hour, but to see if it's actually it's a little shorter if the guided meditation is the 30 minutes we keep that, but the Dharma talk is shorter, if the reflections are briefer, so that maybe instead of a full hour, it'll be 15 minutes or something. How does that feel overall? And it's 15 minutes now, so let's give that a try. So let's close. Let's close our happy hour tonight. And as always, I thank you for your practice, for your cultivation, showing up as best as you're able to. May all beings be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks, everyone. Be well. Take good care of yourselves from a third person perspective with lots of metta and love. Take care.
