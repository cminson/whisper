 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Today I'm going to talk a little bit about a discourse of the Buddha that I find kind of inspiring in its simplicity. It's very repetitive, so in years past I just kind of glossed over it and didn't really read it carefully. And now lately I find it very meaningful in its repetition and its simplicity. And the context we're giving it is kind of how I'm feeling after a very full week of all kinds of input from this world around me. I did a two-week retreat that ended last Sunday. A wonderful experience of being absorbed kind of in the world with Dharma. And in a sense kind of came out of it into the wider world again, to experience many things that are difficult and wonderful in this world of ours. And I mean the big one that had a big impact on me was reading about the COVID-19 situation in the United States and in the wider world. And also talking to people who work in hospitals and their experience there, what's happening there and around the hospital. And reading about these things. And it's so tragic how many people are dying and sick and impacted from the illness. But the tremendous strain on the hospital systems and hospitals in various states overflowing and people not being able to find hospitals, they'll take them because they're all full. But I'm also struck by the tremendous, the fault lines of tension that exists in this country are exacerbated through this, the whole COVID-19 crisis. And the level of animosity and hate in all directions that is being spread and acted on is kind of astounding for what is an illness. That illness in which many people are dying. And at the beginning of the pandemic there was a fair amount of, last year, a fair amount of discussion about superheroes, the medical first responders and hospitals and nurses and doctors and staff. And who were not vaccinated and were kind of showing up to support and to help and try to offer medical care to people who were sick and dying of COVID. So doing out their own risk of their own life. And there's that still happening and it's kind of frustrating for them that with the vaccine available that they still, you know, they're probably vaccinated most of them, but still it's dangerous for them. And that they have to experience so much death. And, you know, some of these people in the hospital, doctors, nurses, chaplains, staff, are witnessing multiple deaths a day and day after day, day after day when they go to work. But also that there are some hospitals, there are demonstrations outside the hospitals where people are angry at the medical staff for treating COVID, for the whole divide between the the anti-vax and the pro-vax people and anti-vax people coming and denying there's even COVID. And I read about nurses who will take off their uniform and have no medical badges or uniforms at all if they go into stores, local stores, because if they do, people hate them. They get attacked, at least verbally. And now it's not going to feel safe. I heard a story of people who are going to work to try to help people from dying from COVID who had to go through a gauntlet to protesters who were yelling and hating at them to do their medical care. So it felt so painful to read and know and learn about these experiences that are going on. And so on so many fronts. And I wanted to, what do I say? How do I talk? I felt like I had to talk, say something about it in a Dharma talk. And what do I say? And then there are other experiences during the week that are very much on my heart that also led me to, what do I say here? So I decided to talk about this particular discourse, discourse which I think many people would read and not find it inspiring, find it, you know, soporifically repetitive and dull somehow. But I don't think that was the case when it was originally composed. It was composed in oral culture. And the repetition was part of the song, the rhythm. There was a rhythm, there was a tune, there was a lyricism to it. And the chanting it in unison in the monastic communities. And it was kind of like a song which repeats its lines over and over again. And it has a kind of rhythm of the way it affects the heart and washes through us and makes it, you know, these really great Dharma points. So just washing through. And they didn't have, couldn't write back then either. So if you wanted to have, you know, remember something, you didn't write it down and then check it out later. You had to really memorize it. And so to memorize in this rhythmic kind of way of repeating the same kind of thing with slight switches, changes, was probably very effective in an oral culture. Maybe not effective in a written one. So this text is number 114 in the Middle-Link Discourses. And it's Seva, Sevitaba, the discourse on the word Sevitaba means, the word Seva some of you know. Seva is a kind of an Indic word that it means to serve or to help someone. There's an organization that Ram Dastara started called Seva that is doing humanitarian work in India and other places. And so it's just this word and the word means to serve. It also means, or to attend to. It also means to practice. And so I love this idea that the word means both, that somehow we practice in order to serve. It's a way of serving. One translation, the most common translation, translated is what should be cultivated. But cultivated misses the idea that there's a kind of little bit of a devotional quality to it of serving, of helping. What should we serve? What do we give ourselves to in a nice way? And it is practice as it's talking about. And this teaching is, the Buddha gives a very simple teaching. And then without any explanation, and then the Buddha's disciple, Sariputta, follows up with an explanation of what it means. The Buddha then approves of that and does a more simple teaching. Sariputta explains, and then the third round, the same thing. At the end of which the Buddha says, to summarize it, if lay people listen to this and apply this in their lives, it'll be for their long-term happiness and welfare. And it's interesting, he specifies lay people. And in a sense, it's a little bit like secular Buddhism. There's nothing about rebirth. There's nothing about all kinds of liberation. Anything that makes it more complicated or more kind of religious for some people. It's, here are some things you can do that is beneficial for you. How you can live your ordinary life if you pay attention to this. And nothing religiously really is asked of people. It's kind of secular practices that way. However, it also points to the heart of the Buddha's message and something very central to how he orients himself. And how Buddha starts, he talks about what should be done and what should not be done. Or what one should serve and what one should not serve. What one should practice and what one should not practice. And then he goes through a list of things. So there's this dichotomy that's put up there. And in that, we're always doing something, whether we're thinking or using our body for something or speaking in a way that's not our body or speaking in some way. What criteria do we use for what we do with our body, what we do with our speech, and also what we do with our mind and how we think. And don't just leave it to chance. Don't let it kind of go amok by itself. But have some presence of mind to notice what we're doing. And then to make a choice between different things. What do we serve? So the Buddha goes through, makes this list. He says, there is conduct of body that one should serve and conduct of the body that one should not serve. There's conduct of voice, of speech, that one should serve and conduct that one should not serve. There's conduct of mind that one should serve and conduct of mind which should not serve. And he goes on, says there are dispositions of mind that one should serve, dispositions of mind that one should not serve. There are perceptions. Here we are, conceptions of the world, conceptions of things that we should serve and conceptions that we should not serve. There are views, opinions, stories of the world and ourselves that we should serve and ones we should not serve. And then there are, this is an interesting one for many people who struggle with Buddhist ideas. There are identities that we should serve and identities we should not serve. And this kind of way of thinking is kind of central to the Buddhist teaching, which means that it's an avoiding of categorical teachings about what one should do, categorical teachings about what kind of views, perceptions, conceptions, dispositions, and even identities that one should have or shouldn't have. And some Buddhists have this categorical idea that you should have no identities, you should let go of all identities when you're practicing. But here the Buddha doesn't want to reject everything in some category or accept everything in some category. And he's always asking a question, looking at, well, there's some way you should do it and some way you shouldn't do it. And so that's all the Buddha says. And then his disciple, Sārī puta, says, well, let me explain further. Buddha says, sure. And Sārī puta says, if what you're doing is unwholesome, don't do it. If what you're serving is wholesome, keep doing it. If what your disposition is unwholesome, then don't do it. If it's wholesome, do it. If the identity you're holding onto your living with is unwholesome, and he explains it as unwholesome leading to affliction, it's unwholesome and it's harming you, don't do it. But if it's wholesome leading to non-affliction, then it's fine to do it. So there's always, Sārī puta's evaluation for what to do and not to do is based on this idea of wholesomeness and unwholesomeness, which sometimes is translated as skillfulness and not skillfulness, which points to its consequential, considering in doing this, what are the consequences? And if it's skillful consequences, beneficial consequences that are useful for you, then do it. And that if not, then don't do it. And so here there's an evaluation process that each person can do for themselves. These are not categorical teachings of anything about how to behave, about ethics necessarily. It's a little more nuanced than that, but or about views, you know, and some people will not like this text because it's so dualistic, they'll say, what should be done and what shouldn't be done is two things. They're standing in opposition. They're binary and like there's doesn't leave any other room for something. And, and, but that's a view. And so, you know, what about non dualism? And the Buddha would say, there is a way to serve non dualism that's one should do, and a way of serving non dualism when one should not do. And how, if it's wholesome to do it, do it. If it's not wholesome, don't do it. And so having this kind of guide, this perspective, we each person becomes their own teacher, their own guide, their own person finding our way forward. And because the word for skillful also can mean very close to the English word for ethical, it's how we become our own ethical guide. And it's being what's wholesome and unwholesome. And this is so crucial to the Buddhist teachings that we would have our own ability to recognize this quality of all the things that we're going to do in body, speech, and mind and to track it. And so when it's unwholesome, it feels painful. It has an ouch in it. There's an ache, there's a contraction, there's tension, there's stress, there's a closing down. There's the unwholesome undermines the person who has it. So things like anger, hostility, delusion, greed are their primary representations of what's unwholesome that undermine the person who does it. The ancient language, they talk about these things, greed, hatred, and delusion, burn the person who has them. So they might be outwardly directed, wanting something or being hostile to someone else, but we're harming ourselves when we do it. So it isn't always so major like the harm, but there's a feeling of tension, stress even sometimes. Something gets lost, some self alienation. When things are done wholesomely, there's a whole other way of feeling. It doesn't feel deflating or diminishing or doesn't have an ouch, it has more of an ah. It has more of a feeling of yes to it. There's a feeling of opening, of relaxing, of delight or warmth, a feeling of wholesomeness. Not everyone associates in English the word wholesomeness is something that feels so good, but when I was a kid, the advertisements for bread talked about wholesome bread. That's my big association with the word. And these commercials on TV, and I think the idea was that it was nutritious. But more than nutritious, it felt comfortable. Maybe some food that we grew up with at home, that a parent made that felt more than just tasty. It felt like the parent's love came with it and was so nourishing in a psychological way. It's what I associate wholesome with. So we do things that have this beneficial effect. And for some people, this is a new idea that we could be tracking ourselves carefully with mindfulness and make simple choices away from what is unwholesome to what is wholesome. Away from what has an ouch and towards what has an ah is nourishing for us. Away from what is denourishing, unnourishing us. And to be sensitive to the purposes of mindfulness is to develop a heightened sensitivity to that very difference so that we can choose to be nourished. And so it isn't just simply being mindful in the present moment and just that's enough of it. But it's doing being mindful in the present moment so we can make these simple choices as they're obvious of how to do something. And it could be as simple as how we make a meal. If we do it tense in a hurry, resentful. If we do it afraid about whether I like my food or not, that's a very different, that has a little bit of an ouch to it. But if we do it with an inspiration and joy and love and generosity as part of it, just delighted that we have people we can feed, that has a very different feeling for it done from love. So to kind of track this, to know it and then to kind of begin to know, kind of smell the direction, almost second nature, that's the way to go to what's wholesome. And this is the way that hopefully we can find our way in a fractured society. A society that has a lot of tension in it and a lot of hatred in it and a lot of greed in it, that we don't want to contribute to that. We want to contribute not to the unwholesome but to the wholesome. Unwholesomeness produces more unwholesomeness is a teaching of the Buddha. Wholesomeness produces more wholesomeness for oneself and also into the world. So unfailingly, dedicatingly, committedly, living a life that's committed to the wholesome. The ah, the beneficial, that which is nourishing, that which is inspiring, that which is for the greater welfare and happiness of all beings. We don't always know what that means like in terms of actual things in the world. Should we vote for different kind of taxes or not? What kind of tax system should we have? What kind of electoral system should we have? All these big questions that are difficult to agree on, let alone really have answers for. But be very careful not to lose sight of the wholesome in discussing these. Don't sacrifice the wholesome because of views and stories and opinions. Remember what the Buddha said, there are some views that one should serve and some views one should not serve. And those views that are wholesome and have wholesome consequences, those should be served. But those which are unwholesome not to be served. And it isn't just the views, but it's how we hold views, how we use views, how we speak of our views. There's a way of speaking about them and the way of not speaking about them. And how do we know? The one that speaks the ones that speak in a way that's wholesome. Don't speak in a way that's unwholesome. So it goes on and on. And this idea of wholesome, this way in the text, but you get the general idea of it. And that's what I felt most and felt inspired to talk about in the wake of so many challenges that exist in our society. And may it be that we are a wholesome, contribute to the wholesomeness of our society, the nourishment of our society. So that what is really good and beneficial for the welfare and happiness of every single person in our society, including the people who are so often forgotten and marginalized, or that we don't include in our hearts. Let us include everyone in our hearts, even the people we disagree with, so that our attitude towards them is wholesome, even if we disagree with them. So thank you all very much.
