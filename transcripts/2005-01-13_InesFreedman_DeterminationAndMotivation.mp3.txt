 The topic tonight is determination or resolve. Determination is one of the ten parmes. The parmes are known as the ten perfections. They are qualities of character that lead to awakening. They include generosity, virtue, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, determination, loving kindness and equanimity. What differentiates a quality of character as a part of me is whether it's associated with liberation and compassion. For instance, you can have a lot of determination as a bank robber, but that doesn't make it a skillful quality as it is if you're helping someone. Aditana is the Pali word for determination. It means a determination that's not shaken under any condition, like a mountain not moved at all by a storm that passes. It's associated to the Thai word aditan, which means vow. I'd like to read a little piece from an article by Tanis Shrudiku. The Buddhist said, The purpose of practice is to see what you've never seen before, to realize what you've never realized before. And many of these things that you've never seen or realized lie outside the limits of your imagination. In order to see them, you have to learn how to push yourself more than you might imagine. But this has to be done with skill. That's why the Buddhist said that a good determination involves four qualities, discernment, truth, relinquishment and peace. And I'm going to talk about each one of those four qualities. Discernment is the ability to make skillful judgments. In relation to determination, discernment means two things. It means setting a wise goal and knowing how to achieve the goal. To set a wise goal, you need to know why you want what you want and if it's a skillful goal. An example of a long-term goal in meditation is the goal of awakening or liberation. You need to keep reminding yourself why you're meditating about what the meditation really means in terms of your future. That you want true happiness, you want dependable happiness, the sort of happiness that will stay with you through thick and thin. In the short term, there are many useful goals. And those goals support your long-term goal. You might decide, I'm going to meditate every day this month or I'm going to be mindful of every single breath in the next hour or I'm not going to move during the sitting. Another example of a long-term goal could be why speech. You might decide my speech will be kind and thoughtful. I'll listen well, I'll no longer lie, speak harshly or gossip. A short-term goal that could support that, because that's quite a big chunk to try to accomplish, especially if you don't have those habits. What you might want to say to yourself is, today I won't talk about anybody else. It's difficult to sustain practice without a goal. We might start wondering why you're here, why you're meditating and why you aren't out sitting on the beach or watching a movie. Once you've established what your goal is, you need to clearly understand how to achieve it, what steps to take and how to stay inspired in the long run. Once you understand the steps, then you turn your attention from the goal and you focus on the steps that will take you there. You then focus more on what you do than on the results you hope to get. You may shift your attention from wanting to be liberated to the short-term goal of, I'm going to be mindful of every breath for the next hour, each and every one. An example is the goal of running a marathon. Once you've decided that this is a skillful goal, then you decide how to train for it. You may research the best way to train, talk to others who have done it. Once you have your plan, then you focus to actually doing it. You may choose to run every day and gradually increase your distance. Now your focus gets narrower. You focus on today's sub-goal. Today you're going to walk one lap and drop one lap. And then your focus turns into the present moment and you start paying attention to how your body feels. This step, this step. And the next day you again remind yourself, okay, I want to do a marathon. So that reminds you, you know, while you're running. And then you focus on today's new sub-goal, which might be, I'm going to run two laps today. And then again you shift your focus while actually running into the body now. In making the plan, it's really important to focus and to consider how to stay inspired in the long run. It helps to daily remember your primary goal. If you want to run a marathon, you might find a running buddy. You might start reading books and magazines about running. With meditation, you could have as your primary goal the goal of awakening. Or some people have a goal of stress reduction. If you're clear that your goal is awakening, you may decide to follow the eight-fold path that the Buddha laid out. You may choose to meditate every day. Try to be mindful all day, to sit retreats, to give up getting intoxicated. Then you would shift your focus to today's sub-goals. If you're going to meditate 45 minutes, you might commit to be mindful while you're eating, or commit to be mindful while you're walking to the car. And then as you enter each activity, now you change your focus and you focus into the actual experience. If you're meditating, you focus on your breath. If you're eating, you focus on how the food tastes, on your chewing, on how your body feels while you're eating. When you go walk in the car, you might focus on the sensations at the bottoms of your feet. To stay inspired, you might remind yourself of the larger goal each day by reading Dharma books, reading poetry, keeping a journal, talking with friends, listening to Dharma talks. The second quality needed for determination is truth. Truth can be simply doing what you say you will do, to yourself and to others. Only when you do that, can you trust yourself. This is where I like to remind myself of one of the meanings of the word determination, which is vow. To treat our words and commitments as a vow. There's a quality of honor we think of when we make and keep a vow. I think it's a powerful way to approach giving our word, including to ourselves. You might want to consider in your life, do you keep your word? Do you do what you say you will do? Are you timely? Another factor about truth is being truthful about our experience, about how we feel. This requires mindfulness. If we're struggling in pursuing our goal, we need to investigate what's causing the struggle. It's usually one of the five hindrances. Desire, aversion, restlessness, sloth and torpor, or doubt. For example, if your intention is to get up and meditate at 6 o'clock in the morning, and you're in bed and it's warm and you don't want to get up, is desire present? Are you clinging to comfort? Or you just don't want to get out of bed because it's cold out there. That's aversion. Just by recognizing what it is that's in the way of you pursuing your goal, sometimes it's enough to loosen its hold on you. Sometimes we're feeling lazy. But it's important to recognize that laziness is an attitude. It's an activity of the mind. It's something we do. It actually takes energy to be lazy. Have you ever felt lazy and you don't want to do anything, but you find yourself anxiously tapping? I remember in college, there was nothing that could put me to sleep faster than my histology class. That's microscopic anatomy. It didn't matter how I felt. I'd get into that class and my eyes would close. As soon as the class was over, I'd be awake and energetic. At the time, I wasn't practicing mindfulness, so I didn't realize that I just had a lot of resistance to learning this material. I really did not want to learn those details. I didn't find them relevant in my life. The resistance, which was a lot of energy, exhausted me, made me tune it out. It's important to notice the qualities of doubt and resistance when they're present in relation to our goals. They can build unnoticed and they undermine our determination. The third quality needed for determination is relinquishment. There are always things you have to give up in pursuit of any goal. In the Dhammapada it says, If you see a greater happiness that comes from forsaking a lesser happiness, be willing to forsake the lesser happiness for the sake of the greater one. We often give up a greater happiness for a quick pleasure. For example, you may have high blood pressure and you need to stay on a low-salt diet, but you're tempted and you have some potato chips. You risk your health for a quick pleasure. In meditation you might sleep in, which gives you an immediate brief pleasure, but then you break the momentum of sitting daily and then meditation doesn't become a habit. Without it becoming a habit, it doesn't deepen. You may get a quick pleasure from gossiping about someone, but after that you may feel more distant from the person you talked about. The person you gossiped to might start wondering, God, did they talk about me that way? Then it creates another barrier between you and that person. Therefore it undermines your desire to be happy. The fourth factor of determination is peace. The easiest way to know if the determination is skillful is if there's greater peace. If the goal you're pursuing does not bring more peace, it's not a skillful goal. It's also very important to keep the mind calm and peaceful as you work towards the goal. For instance, an athlete who trains really hard, they can be very determined, but if they're not peaceful without that quality, they get very stressed, they get tight and they get injured. And they don't do as well. When athletes talk about being in the zone, it's a time of peace. The zone feels very, very still. And that's when people perform the best. Without peace, determination is stress-producing. A workaholic can have a lot of determination, but it's obsessive and not skillful. They're always leaning into the future. By focusing calmly on the step right in front of you, instead of rushing forward with your mind, one is able to stay peaceful in the process. Determination must include acceptance of who we are right now. Even as we might be determined to improve ourselves, it's essential to accept ourselves as we are right now, not to reject who we are. Acceptance brings a sense of peace and ease and spaciousness to the situation. But acceptance does not mean becoming complacent. It takes mindfulness to not become complacent. The question is, are we putting out our best effort? Our best effort looks different depending on a condition. For instance, if you get up in the morning and you meditate and you're really energetic and you're really feeling good, you have this wonderful sitting, and your best effort, your mind just stays on the breath and is able to be very mindful. And that's easy to say, God, I'm really putting out a good effort right now. But let's say you get up the next day and you've got a cold and you didn't sleep well, and you're tired and you're barely able to concentrate, and what's your best effort then? It doesn't really matter how well you concentrate. It matters that you're putting out your best effort in that condition. It's very easy to undermine ourselves, like saying, oh, well, I'm sick so it doesn't count. Or I'm tired and I'm not going to try. There are many different aids to calming the mind when you're not in sitting meditation. We all kind of know how to do it when we're sitting. Just by sitting still, the body tends to calm, the mind tends to calm. But when we're out in the rest of our lives doing different things, it's very easy to just get ahead of ourselves. And one of the most useful things I've found throughout the day is to just take a couple of deep breaths, long deep breaths, just every couple of hours, just to calm myself and get back in the present. Another really wonderful method is to just check in on your abdomen. Is your abdomen relaxed? How many of us are spending most of the day just tense right in the middle? Other things you can do is, some people like to use phrases like relax, let go. Sometimes I've used, it's called a gata, it's a small poem. This one is by Thich Nhat Hanh. And I've just used it throughout the day at different times just to remind myself to come back to the present. Breathing in, I calm body and mind. Breathing out, I smile. Being in the present moment, I know it is the only moment. When determination is skillful, it can feel like grace. It may still be challenging, but there's a sense of relaxation and peace. Like Thomas Jefferson said, I'm a great believer in luck and I find that the harder I work, the more I have of it. I want to talk a little bit of motivation. Determination is a decision. The driving force is intention. The clarity of our intention is important. What do I want and why do I want it? Determination is dependent on our honesty about what we want. We may want something because we think we should want it. Many years ago, I thought I wanted to live on a farm and grow my own vegetables. A lot of my friends wanted the same thing and they went ahead and did it. They went in those directions. I intellectually thought that was the right way to live, but I didn't really want to do it. I looked at the farm catalogs and read about it and never did it. It took me a long time to realize that I didn't really want to do it. I actually suffered a lot from it because I wasn't doing what I thought I wanted to do. I kept failing at it. It took me a while to really get that that wasn't what I wanted. We often lose sight of why we want something. Let's say I'm planning a trip to South America and I want to learn the language. At first, I may study Spanish diligently, lots of energy, but then slowly my enthusiasm wanes. So I need to remind myself why do I want to learn Spanish? By focusing on the why, the motivation strengthens. Motivation can come either from desire or from aversion. Desire and aversion are not the enemies. For example, let's say my back hurts and I don't like it. I don't want it to hurt. That's aversion. But as I pay attention to the aversion, I may ask myself, is there something skillful I can do in this situation? Is there anything I can help with? And so I may decide to start doing yoga. So the motivation to do yoga might come from not wanting to hurt. An example of using desire's motivation may be after retreat. The retreat experience might have been really intense and wonderful and when I come home, I just want to have more of it. So it inspires me to want to sit more regularly and longer. And that's motivation from desire. Determination depends on faith or confidence. Confidence is built on the experience of many small successes. For instance, I remember learning the piano and playing the first phrase of jingle bells. Just these little notes, jingle bells, jingle bells. And realizing, wow, it really sounds like a song. And it just gave me the confidence to be able to want to try something a little bit harder. Confidence can arise from seeing someone else who has done it. I remember when I started jogging, my husband told me that I would soon be able to jog two miles. And at that time, the most I'd ever tried was one lap and it had been challenging. But because of his confidence and his experience, I opened my mind to the possibility that I might be able to do it and it might be easier than I think. And within a short period of time, I was able to jog the distance. So it was his confidence and his experience that gave me the confidence to open that possibility for myself. And that's what we do with a mentor. Using someone who actually has done or is further along the path than we are. There are many things we can do to help maintain our motivation. Henry Beecher said, it's easier to go down a hill than up it, but the view is much better at the top. I'm just going to go over a few different things that we can do. There are a lot of things we can do to maintain our motivation. The first thing is to declare what you want. It really helps if you simply, in simple words, are able to articulate what it is you want. Sometimes people have very vague, grandiose ideas of what they want, especially when it comes to their spiritual practice. But you ask them, what do you want? And they're kind of like, well, you know, this kind of big, general thing. And I think it's very helpful in any skillful goal that we may have to actually be able to articulate it simply. And for some people, it's very helpful to write it down. Knowing why we want it, I think, is crucial in maintaining your motivation. Be clear about your reasons for it. I find it useful to read it a few times a day, but any way of reminding yourself works. I sort of like the idea of, you know, in Islam, they pray five times a day. That's a great thing to do with your primary spiritual goal, to focus on it at least five times a day, throughout the day. Maybe when you first wake up. Maybe at meals. Maybe right before you go to sleep. Another thing that is very helpful is visualization. Visualize what you want with as many senses as possible. Include words, a visual, a physical felt sense, and an emotional tone. For instance, I'd say you want to learn ballroom dancing. You might imagine yourself seeing yourself dancing. That's like a visual. And then you can imagine how it feels in your body. Kind of imagine how your body feels in the movement. And then imagine how you feel emotionally. You know, how happy it makes you, you're lighthearted, smiling. There have been many studies showing that using mental imagery improves performance in sports. Mental imagery can improve specific motor skills and also enhances motivation, confidence, all of which help elevate the level of performance. I think, I don't remember the name of the football coach, but the entire team has been taught meditation. And from what I hear they've done really well, but somebody else might know about that. When you visualize, you're actually creating neural patterns in your brain, just if you had physically performed an action. Determination requires diligence, energy, active engagement, a warrior attitude. It helps when you visualize that you include that emotional tone. So if you're picturing yourself, you know, let's say you're meditating for stress reduction. You want to really keep in mind, visualize that emotional tone of like, oh, I'm really relaxed and I'm happy and I'm peaceful. When practicing for the goal, it's important to switch the focus to the process, to the steps of the goal. This is where mindfulness is essential. Pay attention. What's the best energy available to me at this moment? Energy is often available if we focus. What's important is the continuity of our best effort, not peak performance. Pay attention to anything that might prevent your best effort. Let's say I'm jogging and I plan to jog three miles. At about two miles, my energy is low and I want to stop. So I might ask myself, what's the real reason I want to stop right now? Is it that I enjoy running when I have lots of energy and it's not as much fun now? Or do I really have a reason I might kind of get injured or, you know, it's unhealthy for me to jog right now? And the mind plays tricks, you know, and I've seen it in myself. I've been able to psych myself out of wanting to quit quite easily. It's helpful to create a container or support for carrying out our intentions. In a meditation practice, you might want to have a place where you sit every day, do it at the same time every day. Maybe read an inspiring quote. Other examples of support might be a study group, a writing group, keeping a journal, having a buddy you talk to, a mentor, a ritual, poetry, coming to Dharma talks. I want to use an example of my life, from my life, to show how the four qualities of determination relate to an actual choosing a goal and following through with it. The four qualities, again, are discernment, truth, relinquishment, and peace. About six years ago, my husband and I had found it intriguing that Theravada monks don't need afternoon, and we discussed the possibility of doing what they do many times. It seemed like a good idea, but I wasn't sure either of us could sustain it. About six years ago, while I was in retreat, he started doing it. After a couple of months seeing that he was able to do it, I joined him. The first thing we used was discernment. We had to decide if it was a skillful thing to do, and then we had to decide how to go about it. So we spoke to a few monks and asked them about their energy levels, their health, how it affected their practice. The fact that thousands of monks all over the world do this gave us confidence that it was okay to do it. Then the monks stopped eating after noon, and initially that's what we were going to do. But as we looked at our lives as laypeople, we decided it was important to still be able to at least share one meal with friends. So we changed it to two o'clock instead of noon. Using the quality of truth, I asked myself why I wanted to do it. I wanted to make food less important in my life. I wanted to simplify it. It was the practice of renunciation. The third quality, relinquishment, meant giving up more than food when I stopped eating after two. It meant giving up a certain kind of socializing and entertainment. Thanksgiving dinner just isn't the same when you're not eating. Even though I'm comfortable not eating when others are, sometimes it makes others uncomfortable. But we were inspired knowing that it nourished a kind of peace, the fourth quality, by simplifying our lives. There's less cooking, less shopping, less dishes, less money spent, less planning meals, less obsessing about food. One of the things that really helped was visualizing the thousands of monks all over the world who live this way every day. When we asked Arshun Amaro, who's a monk up in Ukiah, he said it took him two weeks before he got used to it. They helped give us the faith during the first more difficult phase. We also did this together, which gave us tremendous support. Then it soon became effortless, something we rarely think about. I'd like to end the talk with a poem by Mary Oliver. It's called The Journey, and I think it's about determination. One day, he finally knew what you had to do, and began, but the voices around you kept shouting the bad advice. Though the whole house began to tremble, and you felt the old tug at your ankles. Meant my life, each voice cried, but you didn't stop. You knew what you had to do. Though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible, it was already late enough. In a wild night, and the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds, and there was a new voice, which you slowly recognized as your own. That kept you company, as you strode deeper and deeper into the world. Determined to do the only thing you could do. Determined to save the only life you could save. Thank you. Do you have any questions? I have a question. It's about the time the farmies, and I don't know if it's just in the tradition or not, but sometimes it's six, they call them six-part meetings. They include generosity, patience, energy, awake. Bad concentration. Bad concentration and discipline or ethics, whatever the word implies. But are they two different traditions? Yes, they are. Parmitā is a Sanskrit word, whereas parmī is the Pali word. In the Mahayana tradition, which includes Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, they do have the six qualities. The Thirban tradition is older, and they had the ten. So it got changed at some point. Any other questions? Let me ask you a question. Did any of you make New Year's resolutions this year? Nobody? Not yet. Not yet? Okay. Did you make a resolution to make a resolution? Nobody. Did anybody make one last year? Did? Did you keep them? Great. So when you did that, did you make a plan for how to do it? I mean, I don't know if you want to share, you know, if it's too per... Yeah, I get the problem. I actually... I don't know if I have an idea of what I wanted to do, and I had a goal. I had to set that goal. And no matter what, I'm kind of like... I'm kind of like working like leaving myself so much. No matter how people were saying, no, you can't do this, you can't do this. So I did a little stuff, and I said to the person, I could make up the big thing. I didn't do a little stuff. I would never get rid of any stuff. Clean my house, that would be different. How do I make a day clean, no matter what I do? I did it. I just took a little day stuff, and I couldn't believe I could have cleaned the whole area. I never did it before. I was a graduate, and I did it. So that was amazing. I got here to do this. That was crazy, because I did it, you know, and I'm on my way so much that I was never going to let me do it. But it took me a year to do this. I did it, so I did it. So I had my goals, my goals, my goals, my goals, my goals, my goals, my goals, my goals. And by the end of the year, about that time, I really realized that, oh my gosh, I did this. I saw a through this, and that was how it took me a long time to get into that. At one point, I was really good about being very, very good at planning out, and I did it again. I did it again, and I got to do it again. So, you know, I needed determination. I did it by trying to grow. Then I stopped it for about 10 years, and then I did it again. I got really depressed. I can do it again. I'm not good enough with it. I couldn't come up, and then I did it. So, I don't know. I guess we can change it once we want to. I think about doing something that's how we feel about the confidence. Thank you. Doing that, the small steps, you know, that's how we build confidence. And, you know, you think about the ideal of practice is to actually be awake every moment of the day. Every thought counts. Every action counts. Every action counts. There isn't a moment to just wait and get over and get past. Everything counts. And, you know, I forget, one of my teachers said once, you know, it's like with mindfulness, you know. So, every moment that you practice mindfulness throughout the day builds a habit where we gradually become more and more mindful throughout more and more of the day. And the, well, she used this idea of, you know, filling a bucket. It's like, you know, one drop, you look at this huge bucket and you see one drop of water, it feels like, oh my God, it's going to take forever. But still, one drop at a time. And all of a sudden you see, oh, it's like a third of the way full. You know, it gives you confidence. Okay, I will keep practicing mindfulness. Okay. What I personally have done for mindfulness practice during the day is I have like a couple of activities which I'm always mindful of. That's brushing my teeth and washing the dishes. And sometimes when I eat, and, you know, so at least those things are times when I kind of automatically, I'm so conditioned that I don't have to try. I just automatically go there and this is my time. It's like a meditation practice, my brushing my teeth practice. So if anybody who didn't, would like to share this, if you had a resolution at any year, doesn't matter which year, that you didn't follow through. Do you know why? Yes. I eat too much. I don't eat healthy foods. I've had trouble making resolutions and keep it there. I've made resolutions too, because I've been on the couch a lot. And I've only begun to succeed on that in the last six months when I finally get multiplied by weight loss and spirituality. But before I started as related, it didn't seem to them much to me. And how did you do that? How did you tie it into spirituality? I found that, I found a church, I'm from San Jose, which is a church in San Jose, which did a weight loss that was tied into the spirituality with new thought, with the floating science. And that worked. That worked. Now I'm beginning to get more spiritual over time. I'm seeing that it's not just a relationship between ultimate reality and resolution, but it's an entire attitude towards eating and towards respect for animals. And other things that I wasn't really worried about before. And I'm hoping that as I come here, that this will help me go deeper and ultimately lead me to a new epidemic. Thank you. Anybody else? I spoke about the idea of creating a container that supports your practice or supports your goal. Would anybody like to share what inspires them? What they have in their life that supports their daily practice? Anything else you might do? Do you remind yourself while you're practicing? Do any of you do that? I hope there's been a lot to read. I wish I could practice more. I said one, but I'd love to read all kinds of books. The wings of awakening, which is really sort of complex, or things like Kip.com, which are more accessible. I like the whole range of inspiration. I'm seeing clarity that friends that I have that practice are more mindful than I am. I see their clarity that gives them that inspiration. I want to be more clear about things I didn't like. That's an inspiration to see how it affects them. The more I understand where they're coming from, why they are the way they are, because they're mindful of it. I find that probably my strongest, consistent motivator is just suffering, just running into difficulty when I don't practice, and not typically dealing with this real boy, but when I'm kind of after practice. I find that the times when most of the time I'm drawn to extremely difficult periods of frustration or fear, something like that, are really, really good. So what you need now is how to keep yourself inspired when things are great. That's the biggest book, but I'm really feeling fine and joyful. One of my teachers said that he noticed that the monks that would really put their hearts into it were people who were dying or ill or had major suffering in their lives. They would progress the fastest because they were the most motivated. That's like the first noble truth, that there is suffering. I think what happens is that we lose contact with that when things seem to be okay or we're very distracted. I remember reading something by Matt Flixby where he was talking about that, the Buddha kind of understanding the basic psychology that we won't change unless we perceive that the pain of continuing our behavior is to be less than the change, in regard to change our behavior. So people who all of a sudden become diagnosed with lung cancer will all of a sudden become really motivated to stop smoking. By laying it out, it's clearly the form of the truth. I think we have a lot of the behaviors we have, enormous from that awareness of our own pain. We have so much access to entertainment in this culture and it's very easy to just not feel when things aren't right. The Buddha said we should give up a lesser happiness for greater happiness. Are there ways right now in your life that you're giving up a greater happiness for lesser happiness? How about the other way around? Are there ways you're giving up lesser happiness for greater happiness? Well, I'm not proud of it, which hopefully happens when we do. A lot of times the only time I can make time to sit is at night before going to bed, which is oftentimes the only time that I have to spend some time in a way. And it's usually a choice of like, very kind of heard, or more intuitive, relaxing, or coming up to a moment, I only meditate. But on one hand it makes it very hard to have the discipline to do it. On the other hand I feel like I'm giving up lesser happiness to progress in life. And actually, not the only time, I have to spend my life by far, in a way that is not a choice of time. It is a real check of time. Thank you. What I'm noticing is that it's clearly a very difficult subject. The often subjects call great response from the room. And in this case, I've noticed, you know, there's a certain reluctance. It's clearly a very difficult issue. And one of the questions I have over this is that there's a passage that interests me that it's one of the shorter sutas with a date. Well, I divide that, it asks the Buddha, you know, how do you cross the great stream without pushing forward and without standing still. When I pushed forward, I was a world about, and I stood still and sank. And that's what seems so difficult, because when we set ourselves great, you know, goals, I mean, you're speaking about a very skillful set of guidelines. And unless this set of guidelines is a very skillful use, it's possible just to push and push into the world about and end up bewildered and frustrated. And standing still also doesn't do anything. I mean, one just becomes admired. And the concept of the greater happiness is a concept. I mean, it's not, we don't actualize that. We don't realize that actual happiness until we've done something for a very, very long time. So we have no certainty that we're going to chew it all, or that the little glimpses that we may have aren't merely transitory. So it's a clear, I mean, I think it's a very difficult issue. I'm not asking a question. I'm just guessing bewildering. Yeah. Oh, go ahead. I was going to say, this reminds me of just a little imagery talk through my head about how, you know, if you can imagine yourself on this river, and you're in this little, say, kayak or small boat, and you're rowing away, you're going away, you're going away, you're going. You think, you know, you're going, you're not sure, upriver or downriver, but you're hoping it's the right direction, you're rowing away. And at some point you realize that your overall effect is, yes, waking you up to the fact that you're sitting, you're rowing, but the river is carrying you, because you're, first of all, making the decision to get in the boat, to go there. You know what I mean? It's like there's a working together between your intention and the situations you find yourself in every day. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of like that quote I said, you know, about luck. You know, the harder I work, the more luck I get. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then, well, where's the crew next? In the middle of the river, going someplace. Yeah, I think that, you know, going back to what Lewis was saying, you know, in terms of, you know, like that quality of pushing too hard, you know, and that's what I really like about what the Buddha said about, you know, making peace a really important part, because that tells you right away whether you're pushing too hard. And the other part is getting confidence, you know, and I guess there's little glimpses that might be temporary. Still, there, I guess it would inspire us. You know, they're definitely inspiring to me, you know, because each time I get one of those glimpses of like this deeper, much deeper peace, and I see over the years, I get more and more of them. You know, so something feels like it's, you know, it's in the right direction. I have another very simple question. In terms of keeping your word, do you find it easier to keep your word to yourself or to keep your word to others? To others. How about anybody else? I'm just sort of curious, how many find it easier to keep their word to others than to themselves? So that's the majority. That's interesting. Anybody? Anybody? Steve? I'm not , or it's, it's got to be Wisconsin's is no open Think about it if you have a lot of something easy to share and feel a lot of love for yourself. And it's easy to do love in kindness with everybody. Yeah, it makes you think about, you know, are we giving a word because of our deep integrity or because of our image? So that's why I think it's really important to look at the quality of keeping our word to ourselves. Because if you think about, if you have a friend, you tell them, yeah, I'll meet you for dinner tomorrow and you don't show up. You do it time after time, eventually they just think you're a flake. And so when we do that to ourselves, it really affects our level of self-respect. What do you see the relationship between Buddhism and yoga, like Raja Yoga and some kind of yoga? How do you view the different traditions of yoga? Well, Raja Yoga is, I mean, yoga, there's a lot of different yogas, so I'm not sure. Raja Yoga, I'm not all that burst in it. It's like the king of yogas, which includes a lot of the mental disciplines. And from what I know of Raja Yoga, it's basically in terms of the practice itself, it's a concentration practice. There's a lot more to it, and I'm not familiar with it, but the actual meditation itself doesn't include merging with the one. That's really the focus of yoga. Yoga means union. So it doesn't necessarily look at the other qualities of mind. It really kind of bypasses the rest of the mind with the goal of this union or absorption in the one. And whereas in this particular type of practice that we teach, mindfulness practice, we include everything into our practice. I'm sure there's parts of Raja Yoga that may include daily life, but I'm not really familiar with that. That's just the one practice that I recall from it. I'm familiar with the Hatha Yoga approaches, the actual physical practices. That's more of, and some concentration practices, but not that much with the rest. Yes? Can you describe, as I understood Buddhism to get aims towards nirvana, would other mindfulness practices all lead in that direction, or are you aiming at a number of goals at once in terms of the mind? Traditionally, from what's taught us, the purpose of mindfulness is nirvana, is the deathless liberation, being awake. What that is has lots of interpretations. In terms of aiming for other things in the mind, in this particular practice, for instance, the idea of absorption is a mental practice, but it's not the goal. I'm not sure if that answers your question. We could have a lot more discussion about it. Thank you, everyone.
