I want to just warm welcome all of you for this hardcore group for continuing our adventure
on mindfulness of the body.
I just want to say a few words to begin our half-day practice, so today much of the emphasis
is going to be on practice, so there will be a lot of quiet practice time.
And I'll say a few words about how we arranged for our day today.
We will be doing sitting, walking, and incorporating different postures in our meditative practice,
and so you will get some experience of lying down practice as well as standing, but it
will alternate from the quiet non-moving to the moving postures, and so it will be alternating
between the movement and the quiet sitting or lying down or standing.
And the first couple of meditations will have some light guidance, guided, and then towards
the later part of the day will be more silent, and so there will be a progression for us
to just quiet down, stealing down more and more.
And around, let's see, around 10, 10.05 and there will be a bio break, or you can use
the bio break in one of the walking meditation period, and so that started somewhere around
9.30 or so, and towards the end of the day, oh, before I go there, there will be a period
around 10.50 where we'll offer an optional fireset chat for, as a way of sharing practice.
Basically for those who are on retreat, probably had experience to this in IRC, as offer an
opportunity for a practice discussion time, and for others who don't want to join this
firesite chat, feel free to continue with the walking meditation.
And then the last part of our half day will be a review and a summary, and that's the
last 20 minutes or so, and we will also offer some reflections by the teaching team, and
then closing the day.
So that's what we have in mind for our half day.
I wanted to just offer the first few minutes to see if there are any questions, comments
before we begin the rather quiet day today.
And please use your zoom hand if possible.
Okay, Aditya.
Thank you, I was going through the super pass material, and I'm not sure if it was already
covered, but there's a part where it's mentioned that a monk was, it's the same as below as
a verb, night as day.
I couldn't understand what that meant.
Good questions, I'm going to open to any of my co-teachers to see if there are any comments
that you'd like to put in.
Well, what you're referring to is the sutra that was offered in that handout, which is
different from MN119, let me just say that up front.
And I put that in because in MN119, in the book at least, Bhikkhu Bodhi allied that section,
and so I wanted to have it all in one place.
But that text also has some of these additional wordings like what you said.
So the commentary offers an explanation of the as above, so below, as a below, so above,
as being related to doing the body scan of the 32 parts where it's supposed to be scanned
from the head to the foot and the foot to the head.
That's just the commentary interpretation, but that's one thing that's offered.
I would say it's maybe could be read a little bit more metaphorically, like one becomes
equanimous and able to meet all experience.
And whether it's night or it's day, there's always awareness of what's going on, whether
it's above or below or around, you know, it's just a sense of meeting experience equally,
always with care and mindfulness.
So that would be, but I, you know, I open to other possibilities from other teachers.
Yeah, I'll maybe just add to what Kim said when I read that there is a pervasive sense
of mindfulness of feeling in various ways, and so there is that fullness in the practice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you, Aditya, for the question.
I wonder if I might add one more thing on that, let me give me a second.
Yeah, I just, I think that's a great question and I noted that too.
And something that may become available in a longer sitting experience or meditative experience
like we'll engage in today is the way some of our conceptual thinking about the body
can sort of loosen.
And the body map, for example, that we create as very young children, if we're fortunate
enough to be cared for in certain ways, that we hold on to can be kind of loosened and
there can be a sense of the boundlessness of experience, that is experience that's not
bounded in the body.
And you can just notice this sometimes in the meditation, it's not dark or light when
the eyes are closed.
And some of the ways of knowing experience aren't sort of shaped by our minds in quite
the same way.
So there may be an invitation there too, Aditya, to sort of open up to experience as it arises
before in a way we impose a body on it.
So with that, maybe I will invite Kim to take us to the next part of our day.
