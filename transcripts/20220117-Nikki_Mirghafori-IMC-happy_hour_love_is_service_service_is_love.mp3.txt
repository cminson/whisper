It?
Yeah.
Great.
Great.
So, hi everyone.
Welcome to Happy Hour.
It's lovely to be with you.
So, for today's practice, I wanted to invite us in our practice today, tonight,
in the honoring given today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the U.S.
To honor this beautiful human being who spoke of preached about love,
about opportunity for all, justice for all, and really preached love,
powerfully preached love, and given that Happy Hour is about love,
and is about cultivating love, both internally and externally for the world,
as a way, as a way that we show up, as a way that we serve the world,
to honor, to bring his legacy in today.
And another theme I wanted to bring in to our practice today is,
I heard on the radio this morning that because of the pandemic,
many usual parades, et cetera, were canceled,
but people were doing acts of service in community.
So, instead of parades, the community had, and I forget where this was,
but they had scheduled free COVID testing as a way of serving,
as a way of offering service.
So, really, this is the way, this is the day of service.
So, with that theme, love and service, love and service.
How can we serve?
How can we serve the world with our love?
With service?
Sometimes we think of service as, oh, it's reserved for Mother Teresa
and Martin Luther King, and people who are really, really advanced in price.
No, it's just, how can you serve?
How can you serve people you care about, people you love,
people you don't know, people at the grocery store that you can smile at
and not be in a rush and let them take their time.
All of these can be seen, can be perceived as acts of service,
all of these little ways.
So, don't discount the small ways that service, love and service,
can show up in our lives, instead of just reserving it for those big,
earth-shattering ways.
All these small ways, you really don't know how they're going to impact you,
your heart, your development, your cultivation and how it impacts others.
So, I think that's all I want to say before we settle into the silence,
the beauty, to the nourishing silence and practice together.
So, I invite you to arrive, arrive in your body.
Here.
Landing, landing in your body, in your seat,
in this life, in this body.
You're sitting on a chair, let your feet perhaps be further apart than usual
and really plant them on the earth.
I am here.
Planting, planting your sit bones on the earth, your bottom,
and your hands.
Planting them on your lap, let them relax, let them soften.
Connecting with the muscles, doing a brief scan,
the top of your head, your face, anywhere there is tension.
Ah, you can go with the next heart breath.
Moving down to the chest, abdomen, arms and hands,
sit bones, upper legs,
knees, lower legs, ankles, feet.
Planting the breath, the in-breath and the out-breath.
Be received, be welcomed in the abdomen,
centering you, connecting you more deeply to the earth.
Nowhere to go, nothing to do, but to just relish this moment.
Of just being breathed here, here, now.
Planting all the tension, all the holdings in your body, in your heart.
Nowhere to go, nothing to do, but to just relish this moment.
Nowhere to go, nothing to do, but to just relish this moment.
Nowhere to go, nothing to do, but to just relish this moment.
Nowhere to go.
Thoughts arise, thoughts arise.
It's okay, it's the nature of our minds to think.
Smilingly, smilingly, smilingly, release.
Thank you, thought.
I'm choosing, choosing this moment to be silent, to connect with my heart.
Take refuge, please come back later.
You might need to release a hundred times, it's okay.
Do it smilingly every time.
That's part of this training.
Not impatience, not getting angry at yourself, berating yourself.
I'm a bad meditator, no, part of this training.
Just to release smilingly, smilingly.
Maybe you can have a little chuckle like yourself and your dear mind.
And reconnect, reconnect with the breath, with the silence.
And rest.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just this breath.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Try releasing smilingly, thoughts.
Come back, return, reconnect with the breath.
Notice how releasing can feel joyful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now, if you wish, I'd like to invite you to open up
how your care, your goodwill, your love is an act of service both to yourself and to others.
To yourself in the way of cultivating, inclining your heart and mind.
To the realization of the awakened version of yourself, the inner Buddha, and how it also serves others.
How it serves goodness in the world.
If you like, you can bring to mind one or multiple people or beings could be pets you care about.
With each breath, share your love, your care, your affection, but this were these beings as an act of service.
Could use the phrases if you want, you know them by now, could be as simple as may you be well, or could be without words.
Silent, just with the breath, see what you need, what is needed for your practice right now.
And offering, metta as an offering, as an act of service.
To the giver, to the receiver, to the whole world, I care, I care for you.
I wish you well, wish you ease, wish you goodness, may you be well, may you be free.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Cultivating goodwill serves you, serves your humanity and serves the others and the world.
So simply, this being or beings, may you be well, may you be free, or you can use the four phrases for safety, health, happiness, and ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now let yourself be included.
As a dear being, along with this other dear or dear beings, may both of us or all of us be well.
May all of us be free, filled with goodness. I wish as well, I care about us, whatever words or grief, let your heart, mind, body be included in the goodwill.
As if your body, your heart is being showered by care.
Just as others, these dear beings are showered with care.
Soak it up.
Soak it up.
Soak it up.
Now as you expand, as you've expanded, to include yourself, this cultivation of goodwill, metta, as an act of service, true self-care, self-metta, self-compassion,
serves the world, serves you and others in the world.
It's not selfish.
It's more available to serve others without neediness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And in this practice, you are included, your dear being is included, so you can also invite someone whom you have some entanglement with, or someone you consider the other.
Maybe another party affiliation, or whatever is considered the other for you, and include them, can you bring them in?
And lean into metta for them, or yourself, or your dear being, or the three of you equally, see what the heart needs to stay stable and spacious.
This other being, this challenging person you have challenges with,
is not so different from you. They're human just like you. They just want to be happy.
You could have been born as them. They could have been you.
Who we end up becoming is not our choice entirely.
It is not.
For the last moments of this practice period,
opening the gates of our heart, white, male beings, male beings everywhere,
be well, sharing our goodwill. It's all beings, all beings, in the planet, they're all beings, humans, animals, seen, unseen, far, near, all beings.
Be safe, happy, healthy, and have ease. May all beings, including myself, be free.
Thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
So we have time, a few minutes.
Any insights, any reflections, any questions you'd like to share? You can raise your zoom hand, or you can type in chat.
Just type to me. I will not read your name. Otherwise, I'll read your name also. Any observations, anything you'd like to share for the benefit of Sangha?
Claire.
Thank you very much. That was a lovely meditation.
I've given a lot of service in my life, and it always served me well, actually. It's very rewarding for me personally.
And in the way, I was given a quote, and I don't remember who said it, but it's apparently pretty famous, that has always stayed with me. And that is, service is the price we pay for living on the earth.
And I love it, because it's so true. So I wanted to share it with you.
Thank you. Thank you for that. I appreciate that. I love it. And it's interesting.
Maybe the corollary of a quote that comes up for me is slightly different than that is because the price we pay almost is like, because I'll usually think of price.
We pay like something net of like, this is the price you pay. Service is the honor we get to have, is the privilege we get to have because we live on earth.
It's a privilege to serve. It is, right, Claire?
I think so.
Exactly. So how about that version? I propose that as a new one.
Okay.
Thanks for bringing that in, Claire. Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you, Charles Lee.
Any other reflections, please? Questions, comments, complaints, it's all welcome.
So as we prepare to turn into Ali. Yeah.
Thank you for that private reflection.
I'll read it out loud without a name since it's private, someone hoping that I feel much better very soon and thanking me for generous guidance and loving the example that I said. I think self-care is also, I read that I love because self-care is simplified.
I wanted to serve because the theme was service, what I had in mind to decide. So I wanted to serve. I wanted to have happy hour and yet as part of self-care, I did want to make it manageable for me myself.
So thank you all for joining on Zoom if you are hoping to be on YouTube and switched over. Appreciate it.
Thank you all. So tell you what, how about we, those who can stay, I'd like to invite you, let's transition into small groups with the intention of service.
How can you stay and be in a small group to listen and with care, with love.
Be of service. How can I be of service connecting with these two other human beings?
Let that be the mantra in the back of your mind or the intention with which you go into the room, into the small groups.
How can I be of service? How can I be of service in this small group? How can I serve? How can I be of service to myself and to others?
Again, not pushing, but maybe service is just listening, just listening or maybe sharing your insight or your confusion or something you're struggling with.
Maybe that's way of serving. See, how can you be of service to yourself and to others?
The rooms are created, take care of yourself, take care of each other, and we'll stay in the rooms a little longer tonight.
Here we go. Maybe 10 minutes or so. Here we go. The rooms are open.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right. Welcome back, everyone. The rooms are closed. Everybody's back.
So any reflections, anything you'd like to share?
Did you enjoy the longer time tonight in conversation? Yes, yes.
I see some people nodding. I see some people not nodding. Okay, it's always a mix. It's fine. Yes, I see thumbs up hearts. That's great.
So, yes, I see Neil. Please, Neil.
So something someone brought up in my room was that, you know, when things are difficult, just showing patience is a way of being of service.
And I just thought it was such a lovely way of looking at things.
Absolutely. Yeah, beautiful. Thanks for bringing that, that gift from your small group from your small room to the bigger container, so that can be shared with everyone and be recorded on audio Dharma for other people's benefit.
Absolutely true. Patience is an act of love, is an act of love, is an act of service. If nothing else, if nothing else is available. Yeah, thank you, Neil.
What a beautiful point to end on tonight. So thank you all.
Deep bows for your practice for your showing up for yourself for each other and for the world.
May all beings including ourselves be well, safe, and free.
Thank you all. And now I stop the recording.
