The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Good start off by settling into our meditation posture,
making any adjustments if needed to our posture,
being aware of the body.
I can simply know that we're sitting in the sitting posture.
I'm getting a sense of the whole body sitting.
I can tune into if there's any areas in the body where there's some tension or discomfort.
And if there are any of those areas, then we can invite those to relax.
It could be maybe the shoulders or the forehead, maybe another area.
I can just simply be aware of whatever is most predominantly present in our awareness.
It could be anything ranging from the breath to other bodily sensations,
hearing, or maybe thinking, feelings or emotions.
We can simply relax and sit back and let whatever is most obvious just arise.
There's not much that we have to do.
Just kind of receiving what is already there.
We'll need to go out and search for what to be aware of.
If there's not much obvious, then we can just wait till something more obvious comes in the foreground.
Just being aware of waiting.
If there's no right or wrong object to be aware of.
Whether it's something pleasant or unpleasant, whether it's a lot happening at the same time,
whether it's not much happening, you can be aware of all of it.
Awareness doesn't judge, but just is aware of whatever is happening.
You can even be aware that we are aware of awareness.
Simply knowing that awareness is present.
Almost effortless knowing what is happening in each moment.
Just being aware of what is happening in each moment.
