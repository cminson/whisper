Body

A few words about the Dharma, and the practice this 
morning. I want to suggest two things. One is, it is very 
interesting to be aware, to be mindful of, and to know , 
where your attention is. What are you paying attention 
to?  
 
There are six different domains , or ways , that your 
awareness c ould be channeling the world . For many 
people, t he most common channel of attention is 
thinking . A big percentage of their attention  is thinking 
abou t things in one way or another. Another way is to 
be aware of what you see. You can be very focused on 
seeing, so metimes very intently looking. In this case,  a 
lot of attention goes into seeing. At other times , you are 
certainly seeing , but your active att ention is not really on 
seeing . You are not really giving yourself over to seeing , 
you just happen to be se eing. Another way of 
channeling is  listening. You can just hear , or you can be 
actively listening , and y our attention goes to listening. 
Then smelling, tasting , and the body.  
 So, where is your attention? At different times, as you 
are sitting, or walking , or moving about , do you know 
where your attention is? Just be interested. Where is 
the attention primarily going  – the active  attention , in 
which you are more  involved? Where is it going? If you 
find yourself in thought a lot, that 's just interesting. You 
could be other places.  
 
The prac tice of mindfulness is very much  a ‘body -
fulness ’ practice. So first, be aware of where your 
attention is. Especially notice if you are thinking a lot. If 
you are thinking, t urn yourself over to your body. Really 
feel what is going on through the body. Let the body be 
the antenna through which you experience what goes 
on – not your thinking. If you’re  thinking , let yourself 
come into your body , and feel what is happening.  
 
For people who are not familiar with being mindfully 
aware of the body, maybe an analogy would be helpful. 
Imagine  that it is a cold winter morning. Your house is 
cold when you wake up , and y ou are in your cozy, 
warm, co mfortable bed. Maybe you  don’t want to get out 
of bed. Chances are pretty good  that, at that moment, 
you are not entirely lost in your thoughts. The coziness, 
the warmth, the comfort of being in bed, you feel in a 
tactile way. You feel it in your body , and  it feels so good. 
You feel the cold outside , and you have the warmth 
inside your covers. You feel this visceral, tactile, 
physical sense of the body. Then , if you leave your bed , and it ’s cold, and you ’re walking barefoot , you can feel 
the physicality of that. You might tense  up around it. To 
turn yourself over to your body is to be in that zone 
where you are feeling the warmth or the  cold, t he 
comfort or the discomfort.  
 
Turn yourself over  to whatever is going on , to what is 
happening in your body. Feel it in your body. Turn 
yourself over , and just be there with experience. If you 
are thinking a lot, turn yourself over to your body , and 
feel what it is like in the body to be thinking a lot. Let the 
body be the resource , the negotiator, t he finder of the 
path. Let it  be the practice.  
 
So, notice where your attention is , and whenever you 
can, turn your attention back to  your body. I hope you 
enjoy the morning.
