The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So hello and welcome everyone. Welcome to Happy Hour. Lovely to be with you and to
practice together in this moment. Whatever time zone you're joining in and
whether you're new to Happy Hour or you're an old-timer. So for today's practice,
I'd like to bring in a theme that is so many favorite themes I have. But this one
is a theme of service and how it relates to our attitude in daily interactions
with people. So there are many, many ways we can show up, many ways we can show up in the world.
And a lot of times, maybe we show up or we've noticed in the past, we show up or we still
show up or others show up. Let's say human beings show up with this perspective of what can you do
for me? What can I get from you? Like every interaction, how can you satisfy my needs?
How can you satisfy my needs to be seen, to be acknowledged, to be recognized, to be applauded,
to be approved of, to be, how can you satisfy my financial needs, my sexual needs? Like how,
what can you give me? Just this extractive approach that we might recognize that, you know,
might be unseen sometimes, might be subtle. What if, what if, and this was really eye-opening
to me years ago, to completely shift that? And what if in every interaction we have,
there is a sense of, what can I give? What can I give you? What can I, what can I support you with?
And it might be, the answer comes up, might be kindness. Maybe it's a smile, maybe it's a gift,
maybe just the stance of generosity, of heart, but really the stance of what can I give you?
What can I do for you? How can I serve you? How can I be of service? And somehow, maybe the words
to be of service, they sound grandiose and they sound big, but they need not be. It can just be
dropped in into the background of our minds. And there's so many beautiful outcomes to this
shift in perspective, because when our interactions with others and with the world
becomes a matter of generosity, a matter of giving, a matter of service, it's not so much about us,
but me, me, me, me. And it can bring a lot of freedom. And not to say, of course, there are
needs that need to be satisfied, needs for shelter and food and taking care of oneself.
And also, it doesn't mean that we invite people to walk over us. It doesn't mean any of that.
It doesn't mean any of that. And of course, one of the beings that we serve, if we're serving 360
degrees and carrying 360 degrees, that includes ourselves. So how can I be of benefit? How can
I be of benefit in this interaction? How can I be of benefit to this other being I'm interacting with?
And also to myself, not in an extractive way, it's just an attitude of not being extractive,
but one of generosity that can make a huge shift. And having been on this path, perhaps,
for some of you who've been practicing for a while, you've heard this teaching on
not self or impersonality. There are so many ways to have insight into that and to acknowledge that
and to manifest that. And one way is, it's not about me. It's not about me, me, me, me. It's
not about me. It's a different interpretation. There are many different ways. But not to say,
this is the only way or limit ourselves to this vision. I'm not saying that at all. But if we
approach, if we approach others, if we approach the way we show up in the world as a way of our
gift of generosity, I'm living for a short time, my life is a brief flash, flash of light in the
cosmic sense. What kind of gifts do I have to give? Can think of it as a legacy, if that helps you.
What do I have to give to this person in this moment? Might be the last moment I interact with
them. I might be hit by a truck, get an aneurysm tomorrow. Life is so uncertain. What can I give?
What can I, how can I serve? So having that attitude as a shift, and maybe I'll invite you to try
that, of course, we'll explore that in this guided meditation, but then as a weekly practice, as a
daily life practice, to bring that into your mind, into your mind when you're interacting
with others with yourself. It can really shift and can also lighten a lot of freedom. It can
lighten a lot of suffering into freedom, because if we're caught in me, what am I lacking? What do
I need? Instead, this practice brings up a sense of abundance. Gosh, I have so much to give, actually.
What does this person need? Maybe they need a patient ear right now. Maybe they just need
me to be silent and not give advice and just listen. Maybe that's the best thing I can give
right now. Not be a no at all. Just offer them my presence. But what can I give? Because sometimes
also giving advice could be so that we feel good. We've done something, you know, right? Like, we
feel smart. But anyway, there's so many ways that this attitude of service, of giving can shift,
can serve. So I've said enough to set the frame and I'll start the guided meditation together.
We'll be about 30 minutes roughly. Sit in a way that you can be comfortable. You're back straight,
ideally. Lying down is okay as long as you don't fall asleep. And as always, we start by
landing, connecting with the breath, with the body, spend about 10 minutes settling, and then
I'll give some invitations to explore this practice of this attitude of service. So here we go.
So arriving, arriving in the body, arriving. Here, here, this moment.
Letting go, releasing any tightness, any holding.
Releasing, releasing thoughts. Not that there's anything wrong with thinking,
but right now we release them. Release thoughts for the benefit of ourselves to give our hearts
to this practice in this moment. Turning away, turning, turning away, giving up thoughts,
turning towards this delicious seclusion of the mind, the stillness. It's so quiet and still in
here. We just keep stirring it up. Turning our gaze inward.
Okay.
Dropping, dropping your weight into your sit bones.
Dropping, dropping your weight into your feet, into your legs, with the next out breath,
releasing, releasing into this body.
Letting awareness connect with the breath.
In breath, out breath, received, received, sense of receptivity.
This body knows how to breathe.
Okay.
Okay.
Receiving the breath, or let the breath be received.
The entirety of the in breath, the entirety of the out breath,
and the abdomen, and the lower abdomen, entirety of the in breath, entirety of the out breath.
Okay.
And your thoughts arise. It's okay. It's all right.
Let there be ease, gentleness. It's okay, sweetheart,
peeling yourself, and release them. It's okay. It's all right.
Letting the breath be received, nourishing, emptying, gently, gently, like the waves of the ocean.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And thus the breath is being breathed, being received.
To be allowed the breath to be breathing through the body, throughout the body,
sensed, severe entire body is bellowing, not effortfully, but energetically.
The depth of the breath, the length, doesn't have to change at all.
It'll make it more forceful, and it just be received naturally as it is.
Acknowledging that this breath is nourishing the whole body, it's the whole body breathing.
Notice sense of enlivened, aliveness, sense of aliveness that can bring, feeling enlivened.
Okay.
Okay.
And let this whole body breathing, let it enlivened.
A sense of aliveness, aspiration, inspiration.
And to awaken the sense of goodness.
Maybe, maybe the area of the heart center, aspiration, goodness. Here I am, practicing,
showing up as best as I can.
Okay.
Okay.
Feeling, feeling this goodness, sense of goodness, generosity, kindness.
That's your birthright.
That's who you are internally.
Breathing with, breathing with.
Trusting, trusting in the goodness, in your own goodness, in each of our goodness.
And let's bring to mind someone who's dear to you, we have an easy relationship with.
Could be a person, their pet, their child.
See yourself in their presence.
With the question in your heart, the question, how can I serve you?
How can I, how can I be of service more generally?
And how can I be of service, be of service to them, but also including the relationship?
How can I be of service? How can I be of benefit?
It includes them, the relationship, and includes you in this, this being who is you.
How can I be of benefit?
How can I be of service?
Just in your mind's eye, see yourself being, there may not be any doing needed
in the scenario, just feeling to the space.
And don't ask the question desperately either, just drop it in.
As if you were taking a drop of color with a dropper.
Drop off your favorite, drop off your favorite color.
And dropping it into your whole body, this attitude, diffuse, but definitely here.
In your mind's eye, in your heart's space.
How can I be of service? What can I give here?
How can I be of benefit?
Not necessarily looking for answers,
but letting there be this attitude, the spirit of asking the question.
And notice how your mind, how your heart feels with this attitude of being of benefit.
Is there more gladness, more happiness,
more warmth, more care, more trust,
more stability, strength?
And now letting that go, maybe imagining yourself,
the presence of others, maybe those you work with, if you work or volunteer,
or a group, maybe family,
group that includes a mix of perhaps
dear beings, neutral beings, maybe those perhaps who are challenging to is okay, just a group.
And imagine yourself. You can also simplify this, I guess, to a complicated, but in the space in your
heart's mind. So you're just sitting, just taking a splice of time and silence. You're frozen,
taking a moment frozen in time. The question, how can I be of benefit all around to everyone,
included? How can I be of service? How can I be of benefit?
And not thinking about it, just breathing, breathing with this aspiration through your heart center.
How can I be of benefit, my presence, my gifts?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Maybe it's just a feeling of radiating kindness, radiating goodwill.
How can I be of benefit all around?
How can I serve?
How can I be of benefit to everyone?
And letting this go, letting that go in your mind's eye.
Now, if you like, you don't have to, but maybe there's one interaction that
didn't quite go well, or maybe you felt like you had an extractive attitude interacting with someone.
In the recent past, if you like, if you wish, you can bring that up to
awareness. And if you don't find anything, that's fine. Just stay with one of the previous scenarios,
radiating kindness and service. But if there is something that felt like, yeah,
just, yeah, that attitude of mine wasn't very helpful for me. It caused suffering for me and
others. Bring this scenario to mind, your mind's eye. And imagine, in the midst of this exchange
interaction, you had an attitude of wanting to be of benefit, realizing you are an impermanent being.
Every interaction is unique, and it could be your last.
If your attitude was one of service, being of benefit to yourself and others,
and the scenario, how would you act? How would you have acted, perhaps?
Not thinking too much, but just dropping this question in and see what arises. Maybe nothing
arises, it's fine. Note the difference.
We're dropping the scenario also.
Let yourself, let there be this question, living this question, how can I be a benefit?
How can I serve?
Where is the world? This being who is me? How can I be of service, this living, this precious
human birth of mine, all these gifts that I have, all these opportunities? Yes, I do
have challenges, of course. Everyone does, of course I do. I have so many gifts, so much
to give. How can I be of benefit in ways small or not so small? Radiating, radiating
your goodness, letting your light shine. May all beings everywhere be safe. May all
beings everywhere be happy. May all beings everywhere be healthy. May all beings everywhere
have ease. Wishing all beings well everywhere. May I serve well as best as I am able to.
May all beings everywhere, including myself, be free.
Thank you, thanks everyone, thanks for your practice. So, how can I be of service? How
can I be of service? We have a few minutes for reflections that might have come up from
your practice, questions, comments. Anything is welcome, and I'd like to invite you if
you haven't spoken recently in the group. You can raise your hand, your zoom hand. I won't
see your physical hand, or you may also type in chat. If it's to everyone, then I'll read
your name. If it's just to me, you'll be private. I'll just read your reflection. Is there
anything that you noticed? Was there a ha moment for you, perhaps? You'd like to share?
I'm not sure how to articulate this, but something about the difference between giving to please
others or fix things or fulfill a need versus really being receptive and responsive. When
you ask that question, how can I be of service? That feels really different. I had an interaction
today where I was just revisiting it in my head. I was like, wow, if I had just paused
and let myself ask that question, I feel like I would have had a really different interaction.
It wasn't as much a transactional, like, what can I get from you, but more like, what can
I give you to make you happy? But that wasn't really what was needed, maybe.
Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you for that. I really appreciate you bringing more depth
and nuance to this question, because it's not just extractive. It's also sometimes where
I just want to give you what you want right now so that you don't bother me. There's
some ways of giving which are not responsive, just as you were saying, that are reactive,
maybe reactive and not responsive. You might ask somebody, how can I be of service? They'd
say, I need this specific thing, but that might, and you give that, but that isn't actually
what you have to offer or like, that doesn't feel good for you to give or, you know.
Exactly. And it also may not be a question that, how can I be of benefit? Maybe that's
a better question, or maybe how can I be of service? It's not something that you necessarily
ask them out loud, but it's what you're thinking yourself deeply as a way of orienting you.
That's more important than that orientation. Inner orientation will determine the correct
words to say outward, which might even be silence, but yeah, the internal orientation.
Yeah, thank you. Thanks for that extra nuance and depth there. Appreciate it. Lovely. Bill
says, thank you, Nikki. Wonderful meditation. You're welcome. Thank you for your practice,
Bill. And here is a private reflection. This practice was beautiful and also challenged
me for someone who struggles to identify and honor my own limits. It feels like a thin
line between how can I be of service and losing myself? Can you talk about wise discernment
in this space? Yes, absolutely. Very important. And I was trying to bring that in also, but
I'll speak to it more directly because it's very important that, you know, how may I be
of benefit? How may I be of service? It needs to include you. It needs to include yourself.
It needs to be 360 degrees. It's just like the practice of metta. When we practice metta,
say we're radiating metta, when it's radiating out of our chest, whom does it contact first?
Well, it contacts us first. It brings us the goodness first, and then it's radiated out
and touches all other human beings. So there is the sense of, yes, this question of how
can I be of service? How can I be of benefit? It includes you. And in Buddhism, there is
the sense of you are as important as other beings. It's not a sense of sacrificing yourself.
There's no difference. You are as worthy as everybody else. So the sense of caring for
yourself sometimes actually might be asking yourself the question, how can I be of benefit,
sweetheart? How can I serve you? How can I love you better? And maybe if there is challenges
with limits and honoring your own limits, it might be if you want to engage in this practice
to actually step out, to step out of yourself for a moment, and imagine you and this other
person in an interaction say, how can I serve these two people, one of them being yourself,
so that you are included in that care and that love, like, oh, yeah, this is what serves
both of them equally as if they were twins. How can I serve both of these? Because sometimes
if we have the perspective of just our bodies out of these eyes, and perspective can shift,
but when we step out of ourselves and see the relationship, or how can I be of benefit
to this relationship, that could be one way to have to bring in wise discernment. And
you can let me know in chat if that helps enough, or if there's more needed there. Okay,
you're welcome. Great. Yeah.
Hi, Nikki. Hi. Thank you for the meditation. It was really useful. And I was new here.
So it's my first time here. So thank you for that.
Welcome. Welcome. Actually, the previous question resonated with me a lot about like, how can
it be? And then you answered a question, right, that that really helped me. So when I was
doing meditation, my two days basically stay was just like super busy at work and then
responding to a lot of requests. And then, and then I just go like, I need to sit down.
That's why I joined this meditation. And then when you guided me saying like, how can I
be a service? I think about myself. How can I be a service for myself? And what can I
do? I think it will like maybe what I did today was to make a decision and be here instead
of like, spending this hour in front of my laptop and doing work, right? So that's actually
the concrete thing I did when I, when I follow you, like, how can I be a service myself?
I want to make a decision. Every time I make a decision, I wouldn't I want to think that
is the, am I limit? Is he like hurting my limit? Or like, is he good for myself? Right?
So I'm just curious, my question. And then that has been really helpful. I just want
to say that. And then I feel better after doing this half an hour of meditation, I feel
less like, I feel more settled down. So my question to you is that, do you feel that's
a good technique? Like just contemplate that? Or do you have more concrete guidance in terms
of how to think through like things when when when I feel like, yeah, yeah, this is great.
I so appreciate me. What one thing that I heard you say is, is, you know, I so appreciate
your inner wisdom that your inner wisdom decided, okay, how can I be a service? Okay, the best
way I can be of service to everyone, right? I said, take care of me. This person who is
me, I'm really stressed out. I've had a long guard day. And the best way is to take care
of me and sit and meditate and be in sangha. And, and yes, of course, that's supportive
and beautiful. So, so you've interpreted this, this practice perfectly well. It includes
you. And how may I be of benefit, how may I be of service is towards yourself. And in
fact, those that that, you know, when I was talking about being extractive, sometimes
we're extractive towards ourselves, we're like, work hard, harder, right? There's so
so it's just being of benefit. So beautiful, well done. So if I did the right thing, and
yeah, yeah, beautiful. Thank you so much. Thank you. So, so dear ones, let's turn, let's
turn our attention now to practice together in in small groups. And let's take the same
attitude to small groups of roughly size three in small sangha. And how can I show up? How
can I be of benefit to myself to others? And maybe being of benefit is just holding space
for others and listening with kindness, with care. Maybe that's how we can be of benefit.
So, so in small groups, each person will speak from their experience only, and you can say
pass when it comes to you, you want to be silent, it's okay, only speak from your own
experience, not commenting, reflecting, not managing the group or other people's experience
asking probing questions, it's just from your own personal experience. The next person will
speak from their own personal experience. And then the third person will come back to
you again. So each person will say one nugget, and we'll go around and around a few times.
And how can I be of benefit? How can I, how can I serve? It's the question, let that
be, can as if it's a mantra in the back of your head, you're not saying it out loud,
but yeah, how can I speak? Not educated, it's not about educating or impressing anyone,
but how can I share from my experience, just a few words, a few wish from how this practice
was for you, the insights that you can, that came up for you, that often helps others,
they can have their ahas when they hear your ah or when they hear your challenge, oh, yes,
common humanity. So with that spirit of kindness, we enter the space, take care of yourself,
take care of each other. And in terms of order, you can go reverse alphabetical order. And
I'm opening the rooms, take good care. Here we go. Welcome back everyone, the rooms are
closed. And we have come to the end, if there's any reflections, which are very, very quick,
and you want to share, you can type them in chat, and I'll read them quickly. But, but
otherwise, yeah, we spend some lovely time with questions and reflections, the beginning.
So, so maybe I'll formally close and at the end, I can stay a couple minutes, as we say,
or goodbye. So thank you all. May we all be of benefit. May we all serve well in,
in all the ways, in all the ways that we're able to, may all beings be well, may all things be free,
including ourselves.
Thanks. Thank you all. Take care.
