 I'd like to talk this morning about wisdom, compassion, and courage. This is my first public appearance since being on retreat for about five weeks. I was thinking about the theme that I was drawn to present this morning. I want to connect it in some way with the coming of the spring, because in many ways the traditional teachings are often presented in terms of developing wisdom on the one hand and compassion on the other. It's sometimes said that the two wings of the Dharma, as if the Dharma is a bird that flies, the two wings are wisdom and compassion. We really have to develop in both of them. I love that image. It's always, as it were, taken me away when I've heard it. I think that it's helpful in terms of the spring to think of this teaching about wisdom and compassion as really offering a basic orientation or reorientation or a way of seeing where we are in our practice. One way is to ask, am I stronger in one or the other? Where do I need to develop? More in wisdom or compassion, or maybe a lot in both. It depends. But there's a way in which I'd invite you to hear the talk and to ask yourself, where might I develop and where might I develop further? I'm going to be adding a third aspect of development, which is in a way what lies between the two wings. If there are two wings in a bird, a bird needs a body. I'm going to talk some about that third aspect as having to do with courage. We're really manifesting in the world. That's a little bit of a different twist or take on the traditional way of presenting. Here we are entering into spring. I love having just done, I did about a five-week retreat and I love doing that right before the spring comes. It's a way that it's really, it's a wonderful time. If you have the time now to do a lot of practice or take a few days just to move away from the busyness. I imagine that around here people are just as busy as in Berkeley and Oakland. I imagine I was really busy before I began this retreat. It was wonderful just to do nothing. Sometimes being on retreat, I enter my little room. I was at Spirit Rock and I say, I wonder if there are any telephone messages. You know how that is, it's like that constant repetition of stimuli and things to do. I often think that if people were really honest, they are not really interested as much in spiritual awakening as in completing their to-do list. You have to ask yourself, maybe they're the same thing, I don't know. You have to ask yourself, this is what Thomas Merton said. About 40 years ago, the great Christian contemplative, there is a pervasive form of violence to which the idealist most easily succumbs, over work. To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many people, to want to help everyone and everything, is to succumb to violence. This frenzy kills the root of inner wisdom which makes work fruitful. He wrote that in 1960 and guess which direction things have gone since then. So here it is the spring, things are coming. We can really look in a fresh way and sometimes that takes getting away from that frenzy that Merton talked about and getting away from the busyness. Getting away from the tiredness that many of us have and so I think it's really important if you have time, this is a wonderful time, to go away, to let go of some of the things and really to open to a kind of reorientation, restoration, rebirth, remembering of what's important to ourselves. I think we do that just in a way by coming here. One thing I've discovered since I came back is that the NCAA basketball tournament is happening so you could be watching that right now and you're not. Maybe you're thinking about it some of you but maybe not. So anyway here we some we take this time to say this is important for me to sit quietly, to be with my own experience and to develop really it's to develop further in wisdom and compassion. So I want to talk some about wisdom, some about compassion and then some about courage and then leave some time open for discussion together. Maybe my hope is about 10 or 15 minutes at the end. So wisdom is often talked about as the development of clear seeing and particularly clear seeing into that which brings about suffering or that which brings about freedom. And the core teaching which presents in a very simple way the Buddha's understanding of the roots of suffering and the roots of freedom is the four so the so-called four noble truths which are the truth that there is indeed suffering, the truth that there is a core root of suffering, the truth that it's possible to come to peace and come to a release of suffering and fourthly a practical path that gives very very simple direct means to work with suffering and to transform suffering and to come to that greater peace and it's often taken to be the core wisdom teaching of Buddhism, the core wisdom teaching of this tradition and it's really central to all the different manifestations of Buddhism. About four or five years ago I was invited to be a co-facilitator for a community that was developing, a Buddhist community that was developing in New Mexico. It was a really interesting project that was developing something like a meditative retirement home. It was interesting, it was the people were saying people who have been meditating are definitely getting older and at some point there's going to be a need for Buddhist retirement places, meditative retirement places where you know you don't play what Parcis all day or whatever or cards or whatever so and they also had the notion of combining that with offering training for working with illness and death and dying in a contemplative way. It's a wonderful project. One of the issues was that they had gathered people together who were from different Buddhist traditions and they invited and there were differences of practice and differences of methods so they brought myself and another person there to help facilitate and one of the things that we did almost immediately was that we found that there was indeed a common wisdom teaching that could unify the people there for their work, for their really important work and that was the teaching of the four truths, of the four noble truths. So I want to talk a little bit about those as the core wisdom teaching and relate it to our practice because in a way what our core wisdom practice is mindfulness practice. That we practice learning to see clearly in the present moment not because we have some fetish of the present moment. A lot of animals live very interestingly in the present moment and we're not necessarily trying to be like them but we recognize that when we attend to the present moment we have a way of seeing what's happening and seeing a lot of what's beneath the surface, seeing where we're confused, seeing where we're actually suffering but don't want to feel it, seeing what our thought patterns are, seeing what our repetitive patterns of mind and heart are. When I first started meditating one of the things that I discovered, first of all I think I started meditating a long time ago and I actually didn't know what country I wanted to live in which naturally presented itself as a lively thing to think about during meditation and so guess what I did during meditation? Should I live in this country or this country? So then you know it's sort of in, out, yeah in, out and then I this country, country A, country B, 30 minutes go by, oh back to the breath and so I thought you know I could see how active it was. One of the other things I found when I wasn't thinking about country A or country B, I was planning the future. You know I come from a kind of family of planners. My sister actually got a master's degree in planning. You can get degrees in planning. Some of us don't need them. So what I found was that I was an incessant planner and this is part of what the mindfulness is, part of what the wisdom is, teachings are. We see what's there. I would sit there and I had, let's say I was like a student at the time and I would have like a report to do in two days okay and I had it pretty much under control and I would rehearse it like I don't know a hundred times you know and it really wasn't necessary but there obviously was some kind of fear and insecurity. I would you know later conclude five or ten years later that was driving it right that's what we do and I always said my god I didn't realize I planned something I spent and because it wasn't just the report it was what's going to happen here what's going to happen here and I would just rehearse and rehearse and plan and plan. I said you know a hundred times is really not necessary. 25 would be quite adequate you know and what will I do with all that extra time from the 75 planning sessions. So that's what we do really with the with the mindfulness we just see those patterns and when we do retreats we get to see the patterns in much more depth. In a way we become experts in our patterns of heart and mind and body and this is we might think that we're oh I'm not attending to the breath but when we're not attending to the breath if we keep coming back and seeing what's there what we're doing is we're really becoming experts on the ways our minds work and what the four truths teach us is that it's really important to look for particular kinds of experiences when we do our mindfulness practice that it's really important to look for where we're suffering. A lot of times we don't want to face our suffering we don't want to face our our grief or our fear or our sadness we don't want to face the the knee pain we don't want to look at physical pain a lot of what's most important and what's really taught in this first truth is that is that it's possible to open up you know in the way which is not forcing it to what's difficult to what's painful you know not to hide a lot for a lot of people it's a revelation my suffering is workable I don't have to hide from it I don't have to pretend you know this is this is one of the inspirations of practice that we can open to suffering we don't do that as a society very well you know we don't do that we're not really trained to do that well so this is one of the powerful learnings in a wisdom way that there is suffering and that it's workable and what we do with the second truth is that we look carefully at the patterns which cause suffering we look very carefully at our emotional patterns our bodily patterns our mental patterns and we see okay which of these patterns are contributing to fear or contributing to self-judgment or contributing to creating some self-image that is very precarious it's another thing that people learn in meditation is just the the tremendous amount of self-images that we carry around and so we look at that and we we discover the core of the second truth is that the deepest cause of suffering is a kind of compulsive grasping after some kind of thought some kind of view some kind of experience some kind of way that things have to be and we study how much we do that we all do that a lot you know we grasp after views we grasp after pleasant experiences we grasp after certain experiences we grasp after having things be my way and this does cause suffering and we're invited to study that because what's really invited is linked with the third truth what's really invited is that it's possible to to let go where we're grasping and to be with phenomena in a different way to see with that which causes suffering and to somehow let go of the grasping to not to it doesn't mean that we don't have views but we don't grasp after them it doesn't mean that we don't do things which support ourselves but we're very we can look more carefully into the self-image and we come to a kind of peace in that way because we're not continually trying to control things quite in the same way and we come to see really the the more and more the deep luminous quality of who we are that when we let go of the grasping more and more there comes to be more of a luminous heart-filled quality of being that comes to more and more to pervade us to pervade our being this is what the buddha said about that deeper nature which is really connected with the third truth luminous is this mind is this heart brightly shining but it is colored by the grasping that visit it this unlearned people do not really understand and so they do not cultivate the mind and heart luminous are the mind and heart brightly shining free of the grasping that visit it this those who practice really understand so for them there is cultivation of mind and heart and that cultivation is really done in the fourth truth which is the truth of this very practical workable path of practice it's really uh what i really love is that it's basically telling us life is workable and that we really can grow we really can come to understanding we really can open up our hearts and that their practical means for doing it i think that's why so many of us are attracted here because it's very practical it's very down to earth we don't sit around reading books about emptiness in the luminous mind and talking about it and saying how wonderful it is well maybe some of us do sometimes but but we we actually ground all this in direct practice and we keep coming back to that we try to make of our lives more and more that our whole lives become practice more and more and more it doesn't mean being rigid and you know serious all the time but it because it can be very very light and filled with joy but it's we we come to find ways that my my practice can be right there i can have my practice more and more inform my work inform my relationships inform my being a citizen a community member and so forth my creativity all gets uh unified but we know that sometimes wisdom by itself can become overly dry or distanced or cerebral and so this is where the emphasis on the heart comes in the emphasis on compassion the emphasis on developing love to really balance the to really balance the mind and i'll share a little bit about my retreat because my five weeks were all loving kindness practice all meta practice have you ever done loving kindness practice for a long time how many have done it for at least a day okay great some of you may be with me because i led a retreat here last summer on it and i'll be doing another one at spirit rock um next saturday so um it's really interesting to have these phrases we say may may my phrases are may you be happy and contented may you be safe and free from harm i should be able to remember them i've been saying that may you be healthy and supported may you be free and live with ease and to say these over and over and over again and you know what happened for me was really a beautiful first of all the phrases become pervasive so i'm sitting there just intending that myself and others be happy it's a very interesting state to be in for you know 18 hours a day i mean even comes in you know i wake up in the middle of the night to pee and the phrases are there i wake up first step may you be happy going to the bathroom and and what what's also cool is that doing a long time doing five weeks they naturally kind of form themselves into a rhythmic lullaby so i was singing and being rhythmic and developed when i was doing walking meditation and and the the phrases that we just repeat and you know some people say just repeating phrases all day long isn't that boring um once you get into it surprisingly little or surprisingly not boring um and so i developed it was like it was like saying a prayer over and over again like saying a prayer in the form of a lullaby and i really connected with all the different traditions where they do prayerful song and prayer and rhythm and the sense of rhythm uh developed first in the walking so the the met would have a rhythm it would just be almost like the shaman's drum the first i would the first beat and i'd just be right there it's like the mind gets entrained by the rhythm some of you know this from dancing or from um from uh working doing shamanic work so it was really wonderful to do that and this quality of the heart starts coming out which is really the loving kindness practice is really the core practice that we do for developing the heart and it's this wishing well for ourselves and others so that it becomes more and more pervasive so that it's there increasingly all the time even if it takes a little bit of remembering to do so that we come with a basic approach of kindness to the world it's like the Dalai Lama says my religion is kindness what are you about my religion is kindness it's like taking a kind approach to every moment of experience and we train with that with metta with the loving kindness practice with the work with phrases and then loving kindness for metta has its permutations because that open heart the wishing well heart when it connects with suffering becomes compassion because loving kindness develops the open heart when it meets suffering it becomes compassion when that open heart meets things going very well it becomes joy you know joy general joy and a joy for others and then when nothing particular is happening it becomes equanimity and the sense of balance this balancing of the of the open heart with with the wisdom qualities and so it's this wishing well i'm going to tell tell you a story which i just heard a little while ago which is a story which i think expresses the spirit of metta her loving kindness which we really cultivate because the most challenging place to develop loving kindness is with our with people who are difficult for us whether right in our lives or in positions of political power or whatever and this is a story that i heard about Shirley Chisholm who just died some of you may know her she was the first African-American woman congress congress person and i actually met her a number of times because i worked in a previous lifetime i worked in the US congress for a while i was actually a congressional intern when i was in college during my college time and i met Shirley Chisholm a number of times she's a very small black woman about five foot and the story is that in 1972 she ran for president she was the first African-American woman presidential candidate she didn't win but she ran a campaign and also on the campaign was George Wallace who was an arch at the time an arch segregation what do you say segregationist segregation you know what i'm saying and he was he was very militantly uh pretty well basically racist and he during that campaign some of you may remember he was shot by a would-be assassin and he was in the hospital and Shirley Chisholm visited him and the first words that George Wallace said were your people aren't going to like this that you're visiting me and her response was i wouldn't want what happened to you to happen to anyone that's the spirit of metta is that wishing well and she that was a very very powerfully developed heart very powerfully developed wisdom and that's the spirit of metta that's the spirit of the heart that can be there even in those kind of circumstances it says as a human you know i offer my open heart to every being to every human being and to other beings knowing that we basically all want the same thing we all want happiness and we all want peace we all want to be um we all want in a way to be seen and recognized for the beautiful qualities we have we want to be cared for it's very simple in a certain way and what metta does what loving kindness compassion do is they cultivate that more strongly in us now very interestingly when my own experience i have found that wisdom and compassion and love are wonderful but there really is a third aspect that's needed and this is i found from my own experience and you can say it in different ways that i found in my own experience that i could i could be developing a lot of wisdom i could be developing a lot of heart and in some way i could not be fully grounded what that means is i could go into situations and i could kind of be knocked around and so this third aspect of this core teaching has to do with being grounded with being able to actualize in the world with able being able to take these teachings out there and i i centralized it under the notion of courage and this i learned from a vietnamese friend of mine who lives near here and teaches in at the temple in san jose named venerable minduk who's a really good friend of mine and um we worked together a lot and he told me you know i've been talking a lot with him over the years about the forms the way that buddhism took shape in vietnam during the war and he told me that i think it was in either in the 50s or 60s you know when things were really really intense the vietnamese buddhists decided to change the core teachings and they said we have wisdom and compassion but we need a third aspect and they officially said we have three core pillars for the dharma wisdom compassion and courage because we need courage at this time we need courage to act we need courage to be in the situation of war and i love that i love that addition and it makes a lot of sense in terms of my own experience because it's really that quality of um i think it has a lot to do with really being more fully in our bodies and being more fully in the world you know there's this wonderful line that i that i um remembered from a mary oliver poem it's a poem some of you may know i won't read the whole poem it's a poem called when death comes but i think it's really appropriate because each of us as bodies are immediately subject to fear right because as a body as a separate body we are in a precarious situation we will all die we're all vulnerable and fear is a very negative thing and we're and fear is a very natural um reaction you might say that and fear is with us as long as we identify most fully with being separate and death is the you know the as it were the negation of our separateness in a way we think that at least and so mary oliver wrote this amazing poem called when death comes i'll read it maybe i'll read this just to to end because it really is about this quality of courage and has this line when death comes like the hungry bear in autumn when death comes and takes all the bright coins from my purse from his purse to buy me and snap the purse shut when death comes like the measles pox when death comes like an iceberg between the shoulder blades i want to step through the door full of curiosity wondering what is it going to be like that cottage of darkness and therefore i look upon everything as a brotherhood and a sisterhood and i look upon time as no more than an idea and i consider eternity as another possibility and i think of each life as a flower as common as a field daisy and as singular and each name a comfortable music in the mouth tending as all music does towards silence and each body a lion of courage that was the line that was thank you each body a lion of courage don't you like that each body a lion of courage and something precious to the earth when it's over i want to say all my life i was a bride married to amazement i was the bridegroom taking the world into my arms when it's over i don't want to wonder if i've made of my life something particular and real i don't want to find myself sighing and frightened or full of arguments i don't want to end up simply having visited this world thank you so we have some time for any questions or discussion or explanation, spontaneous poetry if insight meditation is maybe the core of our wisdom practice and meta meditation is the core of our compassion or loving kindness practice then is there a practice that we have to develop courage great question i actually had thought about that and then some of it's in my notes but i wanted to have discussion so i cut it i think that there there are a few core practices i think a core practice for me related to courage there's a way in which the wisdom dimension links up with particularly with the mind and seeing our patterns of mind seeing our our experiential patterns really closely there's a way in which the loving kindness practice links up with the heart i think courage practice has a lot to do with really a grounding in the body and in particular i know in my own experience i worked i worked a lot with john travis who was like a teacher of the body and i did practices over a lot of years where like for two years all i did was i was aware of the field of my own body as my meditation object so i really kind of got a further grounding just in bodily presence i spent another year and a half just keeping my energy in the belly which is a martial arts technique some of you know the hara or the you know and i find that those those kind of practices were very very helpful and effective for actually going into action because it grounded me in the body and in the hara it's like the i found like the grounding in the belly really complemented well the training in the heart and the training with the mind and it led to a kind of groundedness and it's the and this is pretty explicit in martial arts training but if you if you really ground here it's kind of hard to be knocked around but i found i could have a before that i found i could have a really really open heart and be pretty clear and if i wasn't grounded here i would be knocked around so there's a way in which the um a training in awareness of the body is i i think linked to the courage and then then first of all i think actually the whole practice is about courage because it takes a lot of courage to look at your own mind we could say that but in humor as well i mean it takes a lot of courage just to sit there and hang out i mean i love the i love the line that i learned from gill he i don't know how often he uses it here but it's a wonderful line he said if there was another person who was alongside us just repeating what we tell to ourselves all the time we would find that person incredibly obnoxious it was just just repeating and you know repeating the same thing 500 times and what's so interesting about our mind is that the fifth 500th time in some way we find it just as interesting oh yes gotta deal with that and uh so i think it takes a lot of courage to actually hang out with those 500 repetitions and so in a way all of the practice it takes a lot of courage to see one's own heart and that which blocks the heart but i i think i think it's that i would point to the body practices and then and then doing further practices to bring it out into the world to bring to explore one's edge where where there's fear you know and to make that a kind of a practice you know to you know i've have friends who you know i mean i do this sometimes i have friends who are teachers who work with people and say let's see a situation which is at your edge where fear comes up you know in the real world in the everyday world and let's go into that with heightened mindfulness and heightened heart energy that'd be a way that'd be a way of practicing which is really i mean some of you can probably do that but it's really uh it's really kind of exciting it makes it makes the ordinary encounter with one's boss fascinating i could tell some stories about that okay thank you please could you repeat again you said when loving kindness meets yeah and those marriages this is a traditional understanding which is that the loving kindness energy or the loving kindness practice really it's it's a fundamental method for opening the heart there are other methods you know you can i think it's the repetition which makes it really key i mean one could you know we can listen to music read books and it opens the heart but we don't usually do that all day long which is what we do when we do intensive method practice so it really is a kind of opening of the heart and when the heart is open just in its own elements without any disturbances without any fear it the finding that i that i find in the teaching is that that our natural uh way of being is that of of being loving of being warm and kind and that when we're not scared or startled that's who we are this is this is the the teaching that this is our core nature and that we get covered over because of conditioning and fear and all sorts of stuff and so if that's our core nature when uh when nothing particularly is happening um just to scare us and when there's not necessarily suffering around we just manifest as kindness but when we encounter suffering either our own or others that love very naturally becomes compassion and when it finds something wonderful that's happening it turns into joy the heart just kind of sparkles you know it's like we go out and see the spring growth and and something just opens in our hearts you know and then the the the last is um equanimity and and some of you may know that these four qualities are the traditional teaching called the divine abodes or the brahma vihara which is which is they're you and they're taught together because equanimity in a way is the balance for the love the compassion and the joy because the danger of the love the compassion the joy is that we get a attached to outcomes you know oh i want you to be happy if you're not happy get happy no or or or compassion you know i compassion is the feeling with the suffering and the attachment can come in when we say okay i'm being compassionate but get over it so so i right you know you get the idea right and so it's the equanimity which teaches that things are happening because of causes and conditions now we can intervene out of compassion but there are limits to how we can change things you know so does that help so yeah thank you it looks like we maybe have time for for one more question or more comment please okay i'm not okay you were talking about in the beginning about meeting our own suffering okay we're talking about in the beginning about meeting our own suffering so say i've been practicing a lot and observing my mind and observing my suffering and um and you mentioned about in society though most of us aren't looking at our suffering we're working with this and i don't know if so this is i think causing issues for me i feel the more i open i can't go out in society and i'm hitting so much pain and suffering that it's just like killing me it's kind of how it feels so i was just wondering what you could say about that sort of yeah that's a great question and i was thinking about that yesterday because i went to the demonstration in in san francisco and was was there and trying to bring net to mind loving kindness mind to to these events which i have not i actually haven't really read newspapers for about six or seven weeks but i assume that what was happening before is still happening more or less um let's see this is actually a deep it's a deep question and i'm only can given the time i'm going to have to be brief so just know that it's only a part of a response um yeah there the first thing is that sometimes when we're um doing i don't know our first years of practice or training it feels like that you know i would i would come back from retreats when i was first practicing i was living in boston it'd be really hard for me to just even walk on the city streets because it felt like there was so much aggression just right out there and um what can i say partly partly it's a matter of really being more and more familiar with one's own with one's own suffering and learning how to be with it in a more skillful more and more skillful way secondly it's knowing that sometimes it's fine just to um not go near a lot of things for a while kind of protect yourself and know that you're becoming more and more sensitive and that it's hard and just to you know not necessarily go into certain situations you know think of think of what we're going through as a kind of training sometimes training needs to be a little bit protected you know um thirdly there are there are practices that we can do that help us with the suffering of the world and there are ways there there are tools and techniques to bring that kind of understanding more more into the world you know whether it's one's place of work or or in the larger society and one of my mentors is Joanna Macy i really recommend do you know her work beautiful teacher who's actually teaching at spirit rock the day after i am on the 27th and she this is her core teaching she teaches how to bridge being with suffering individually with being with suffering in the world incredible incredible i've worked with her for about 15 years and she's an incredible teacher there are practices and tools that one can work with that can help to make this being with the suffering workable and can help one be a more skillful change agent you might say that can help one basically not be overwhelmed because a lot of it's about not having the suffering kind of stick if i can say that not having stick but having being aware of it having it come through you but not somehow having it stick in your body and stick in your emotions and there are ways to do that you know there are ways to do that so that people can be with the suffering and have and not be closed but not have it um just be like some pitch some gravel pitch or something it just covers you and covers you and covers you and suffocates you so that's so that's a really quick answer but it's it's workable i've done a lot of those practices and Joanna Macy's work would be a real key to looking further into that and look at her books and if you have time on the 27th go hang out with her so thank you thank you for the great question so i'll just end with a um a short dedication of merit so maybe may the fruits of this morning whatever we've learned whatever's been helpful whatever insights there've been or inspirations or rededications or new understandings may we dedicate the fruits of the morning and you may even want to dedicate the fruits of your practice and even the fruits of your life for the benefit the awakening the release from suffering of all beings so thank you
