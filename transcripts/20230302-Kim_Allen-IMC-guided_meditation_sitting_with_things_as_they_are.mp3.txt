 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Alright, so let's go ahead and get started with our meditation together. Just allowing yourself to arrive, physically of course, but also internally for meditation. Settling in to your posture, whether you're sitting or lying down, maybe you're even standing, that's fine too. Just having a sense of your body in the meditation posture, perhaps feeling the contact points, your seat against the chair or the cushion, or whatever you're lying on, your legs or feet against the floor. And just letting yourself feel that support. Letting yourself be supported. And then sensing the straightness of the body, sometimes really letting go into support gives kind of a counterbalancing upward release to the spine. So letting the spine and the head just naturally elevate upward so that the body is both straight and relaxed. And seeing if you can tune into any sense of ease in the body, some part or area that feels comfortable right now. Then maybe tying that sense of ease to the breath. So as you breathe in, breathing into the ease in the body, and as you breathe out, maybe letting it spread through the body. And if there are various thoughts happening in the mind, that's fine. They can just be more in the background. And bring into the foreground the sense of the body and the breath. And then tuning into any feelings of stillness in the body. The body is a dynamic entity and there's always some emotion, especially from the breath. But there may also be a sense of stillness, at least overall the body is not moving much. So maybe feeling how the ease is related to the stillness. So let's get started. So we may sense how the body provides kind of a stable container for the breath, and also for various emotions or thoughts. The body can be the reference point, the anchor, and these other things move around, the natural seatedness and strength of the sitting body. Sometimes sitting is likened to being like a mountain. Just there. And then you can feel the wind and the sun and leaves flow around the mountain just sits there, calmly. Thank you. And in this sit, you are invited to remain with the body in this mountain state, if you will. So that means not shifting around, not holding ourselves rigid. But if there is some kind of discomfort in the knee or the back or the hip or the shoulder, the first inclination would be to just let that be like a little disturbance on the mountain. And just sit, perhaps breathing through it. Meditation teaches us not to unthinkingly react. And that includes automatically adjusting the body. So with complete ease, smiling at the body, just sitting if there's some discomfort or an itch. And how does the mind deal with that? Maybe there won't be anything, so you need to create it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Feeling the deep rest of just sitting still. It's always possible to turn the mind again toward the ease in the body. Breathing into that, spreading that. Thank you. Thank you. And of course, if there's an actual physical injury or a real sense that there would be harm, then of course it's okay to move. But we would do so slowly, mindfully. So noticing the intention to move and then gently moving. And as we do so, feeling how the, whatever pressure we were feeling slowly dissipates. It's also quite useful just to sit with things as they are. That is the practice to be with things as they are. Feeling the ease and the rest and the beauty of sitting still. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And so, inner joy or happiness or contentment. It's fine to breathe into that and allow it to spread into the body. And I'm just acknowledging that sometimes happiness is part of things as they are. And I hope that you have a great day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm grateful for that. Perhaps sensing into the combination of softness and strength that emerge from just being the things as they are. If there's any hardness, there will be a dooka. But there needs to be strength. So what is it like to have softness and strength? What is it like to have softness and strength? And as we come to the end of this sit, perhaps taking a moment to reflect how valuable it is for both you and for others to have the sense of a mountain-like presence and posture, just being able to be there. Sometimes what we encounter is dukkha in others, suffering in some way. In order to be helpful, we have to be able to be present. Sometimes their suffering is coming out in the form of words or actions to us that are unwelcome. And again, it's very helpful if we have some ease with being that this kind of presence in the world keeps suffering from perpetuating farther and it can even bring it to an end. And it's very well cultivated through our meditation practice. So may it be a day of softness and strength in order that the beauty of the Dharma can be felt.
