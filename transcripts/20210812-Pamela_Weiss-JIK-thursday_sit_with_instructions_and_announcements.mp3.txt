 And as we introduced yesterday, the focus for today will be on the body. And for the purposes of our meditation practice, really on the first foundation of mindfulness. Of the body and the body breathing. So to begin the instruction today, inviting you to take a relatively comfortable posture. It's like most of you are seated, but it's also the instruction that I offer this morning will be equally relevant if you are standing or lying down. Toward the end today, Eugene will also offer some instruction in walking meditation. So please, either letting your eyes close or having a soft gaze down. Maybe beginning by just taking a few deep, full breaths. Exhaling the chest and belly, fill on the inhale. Letting it all go on the exhale. And the focus on the body and the breath within the body on this first day of retreat is really to help support us arriving. Attending to the breath and the body as a way to help support us in getting here. Finding our way into the body and the breath is a way to support arriving in the moment. Moment by moment. So it's often helpful at the beginning of a period of sitting or standing or lying down to bring some care and attention to the particulars of our physical posture. It's not so much that there's a right or wrong way to sit. But again, as we attend to the posture, the physical embodiment of being here, it helps us come into the present. And so the idea as Eugene described last night is to find a way to sit that allows the spine to be upright, vertical. And when we say a long vertical core of the spine, it means really finding a balance between not a spine that is tight or rigid, tense, and also not a spine that is kind of collapsed. Where is that place in the middle that we can really allow for the natural curves of the spine supported by a solid base so that the lower half of the body is kind of support for the top half of the body. So for me, it's often helpful to begin by feeling the weight of the body, the heaviness, the density of the bones and muscles really sinking down, resting down. Feeling the earth element of the body, the weight of the body rest on the earth. As you feel the weight of the body sinking down, resting down. Seeing if you can allow yourself to feel supported, held, in the chair or cushion or bench wherever you're seated, by the floor and the earth. Sometimes it's helpful to shift your weight very gently, forward and back, side to side. Seeing if you can find your way, sense your way to the place that feels like center. Where your weight, your energy, your awareness is equally balanced. The front body and the back body and the left and the right. As you find that place of balance at the center, feeling the weight of the body sinking down, resting down. At the same time, simultaneously feeling the length of the body rising up. Length of the spine growing up out of the pelvic floor, the girdle of the hips. Looking for that natural sway in the low back, soft belly. Imagining you could feel each of the vertebra, the spine rising up, the belly, the ribs, lungs and chest. You might imagine you could feel the sternum, that breastbone lifting up just very gently, the v imagining the shoulders themselves relaxing, melting away from the ears. Seeing the shoulder blades slide gently down the back. Looking to have the weight of the skull, the head, really resting at the top of the spine. That there's no strain or pulling in the neck or the upper back. You see what it's like to align the ears with the shoulders. Maybe letting the chin, it sometimes juts out in front. Seeing the chin drop very slightly down toward the chest. Just enough that you can feel the back of the neck lengthen and open. You might even imagine there's a string very gently tugging from the crown of the head up toward the ceiling in the sky. Seeing the skull, a sense of buoyancy, the uplift. Really allowing the weight of the body to sink down, rest down, recorded by the chair, the cushion, the floor. At the same time, the length of the body is rising up. Making a sense of uplift, of dignity, of poise. As you begin to find your way, sense your way into this dynamic, balanced place of center. Sometimes it's useful to let your awareness scan through the body like a soft breeze. Starting at the top of the head and moving down and just checking to see. Are there any places of unnecessary gripping or tension? Maybe in the eyes of the jaw and the neck, the arms, any places that you can invite to soften. Relax. The diaphragm. The low back and belly. Stensing, opening, softening. Continuing down through the hips, groin, the buttocks. Releasing any unnecessary gripping or tension. Releasing the legs, knees, the ankles and the feet. And as you're ready, I like to imagine I could invite my awareness to fill my whole body. Finding out the fullness of your shape and form from the inside. And inviting this sensory experience of embodiment to be less of a task and more of an exploration. How is it to be in the body now? I notice the body feels warm or cool, maybe the body feels heavy, dense, spacious and light. I can't be aware of the aliveness of the body. Perhaps there's a sense of stillness. Whatever's true, whatever is here for you now, the invitation is to meet it, to be with your direct sensory experience as it is, however it is. Moment by moment. Some of it's pleasant, some unpleasant. Can you be here for all of it? And if you like, it's fine to simply rest in the awareness of the body, the body sitting or standing or lying down. Often it's helpful to be aware of the particular sensations of the breath in the body. Again, we're not looking to force the breath or change it, try to have any special kind of breathing, but rather noticing where is it in the body that the breath makes itself known. I'm being aware of the sensations of breath, perhaps at the tip of the nose, the back of the throat. And the rise and fall of the chest or the belly. Perhaps there's a sense of the whole body breathing. In this way, we tune our attention, the awareness of the body and the body breathing. Help connect us to the moment again and again. Here. Here. Keeping it very simple. No matter how often the mind wanders off, lost or enchanted, memory or fantasy. Each moment you have the opportunity to begin again. Letting the breath and the body be a refuge. The moment of the home coming. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. Resting in the body. And the body breathing. Bringing a quality of tender, loving awareness to each moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment.

One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. One more moment. So I'm going to pause here and just to see if there are any questions about the instruction or about. Good morning everyone. When we do these retreats, we kind of alternate between sitting meditation and movement meditation. And the basic movement that has been used for a few thousand years is walking. And the power of walking meditation is often undervalued. I know I undervalued it when I first began to practice. And then as I really, when I really gave myself to the walking practice fully, I started to receive the gift of the power of walking practice, which has to do with Samadhi. And it's a body practice walking, right? We're just walking. And we're not trying to go anywhere. We're trying to get, as Pam said, here while we're taking a step. And I'm going to give you two different options, two options about how to do walking. And the first option is the traditional one that I always practiced with. And it comes from the Mahasi Sayadaw lineage, and it's very powerful in terms of supporting Samadhi or the concentration that can come. That's part of the eightfold path, right? Right concentration, right Samadhi. And Samadhi means we begin to unify with our experience. So what we want to do is walk and bring body and mind together while we're walking. And how many people raise your hand if you've never done walking, formal walking meditation? Let me just see. Okay, keep your hand up so I can see. Okay, great. Thank you. So here we're going to begin together and then I'm going to display it. But I want you to stand up with me if you would. And I'm going to, I think I need to. Okay, so begin by just feeling your body standing. And if you can't stand for whatever reason, and even if you've done this before, please stand while we do this. But if you can't stand and you're in a chair that moves, that also works fine. If you're not in a chair that moves, is that is anybody here who can't move who can't walk. I just want to see. I don't see any hands up for that. Okay. So, feel your body right now, like let your awareness become into your body saturate your body with awareness. And then let the awareness go down into your legs and your feet. So you're just sensing your legs and your feet and you're aware of them by feeling them. And don't move for a second just feel it as it is. And then slowly lean to your right and feel the pressure that comes when you put more weight on the right side. And then move your weight to your left and feel the pressure the experience that happens when your weight is over your left leg and left foot. And then move back to center. And now move your weight to the right side and pick up your left foot and put it down. Then move your weight to your left side, pick up your right foot and put it down. That's the basic walking meditation. It's so simple. And just feel the experience of the leg you're moving especially now do it a few times. You're just taking a few steps in place. And you want to see how close you can get to the experience of the leg and the foot that's moving. And if you have space where you're standing, you can do what I'm going to do I'm going to turn around on you and I'm going to walk and just take a few steps at a relatively normal pace. And when you get to the end just stop and stand for a minute. Turn. And walk back to where you were. And then stand there for a minute and feel the standing be aware that you're standing. And that's the walking practice. You're just walking a short distance. Could be as short as we just went could be eight feet could be 10 feet 12 feet 20 feet. And then you're stopping standing turning and walking back 8 10 12 20 feet. And that's what you're doing. You're not trying to go somewhere. You're trying to get here together with your body awareness and body together while you're walking. And if you as the momentum happens of the walking practice is generally people walk faster at first and go slower as they continue. After five or 10 minutes you might go into second gear second gear means you're going even slower. And usually it's, it's a little bit of here I'll try to demonstrate lifting place lifting place lifting place lifting place lifting place lifting place. Like that standing. Lifting place lifting place lifting place. And then after a while 20 minutes 25 minutes 30 minutes, you can downshift another gear and go even slower. And, yeah, it's like you're almost looks like people are walking and standing still sometimes, because you're just, you're just feeling the most minute sensations of the wall lifting, moving, placing, lifting, moving, placing, lifting, moving, placing, lifting, and even smaller lifting, moving, placing. And sometimes it takes a while to get one's balance from doing that sometimes people if you have problems with balance, you do it along next to a wall, you could just touch the wall. But what's being asked is to get closer and closer more intimate with all the movements of the body. As you're walking. And so you're downshifting to make it simpler and simpler and simpler. So you become more unified with the experience. And that's a very powerful way to practice. And, and it's an art to learn how to do it, especially if you're new to the walking practice. So the key piece is do it. It doesn't work if you walk for five minutes and then go get a cup of tea. You know, or, or if you, you know, realize you have to make some food because of something. What works is by doing it, the walking teaches you how to do the walking practice. And if you know how to do the walking practice that there's no excuses, just do it and see what happens if you do a period of sitting and then a period of walking, and then a period of sitting with no break. And it's a very powerful way to start to thread meditation into the simple movements of our life, which is sitting and walking. And I think, I think I'm going to leave it at that today, Pam, looking for where you are not seeing Pam, there you are. And we could add some more options tomorrow, because I think just stay, especially for today, just get here. It's all about being intimate with yourself with this body with this life here that is sitting and being aware of it, and then walking and being aware of it. Okay. So, questions about the walking practice. Okay. Great. Well, have a great walking meditation.
