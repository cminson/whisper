 But there's still so few people coming in and we could take the first few minutes now To start a little bit more informally if anyone has any questions or comments based on last week's instructions and The experiences you might have had Practicing the simple meditation instruction at home This is a good time for that as we're waiting Or we can sit quietly and wait Yes, it's a very simple question. I'm trying to figure out a timer Yes So you stick the tape in machine when it's time to meditate so you have your 30 minute tape and your 45 minute tape and your one hour tape and Yes Yes, time to tell you man The there's a few traditional ways of keeping time Before the headlights they I don't know when they would decide to get up in the morning The monks would get up really early and they would sit until they could see the lines in their hands So they you know, that's how long they would sit so it would vary how long they'd sit then depending on the time of year and the other way is To burn incense and the difference at six of incense are measured by time how long it takes to burn and so there's 30 30 minute incense and 60 minute incense and What 45 maybe and so you can burn it then so you can get incense maybe if you buy local incense you have to kind of time it yourself and And then maybe you know figure out how much you have to take off and just But then you burn you know, you have the instance burning and when the instance is finished then, you know, it's time to get up So there's many ways It's nice to have a timer because otherwise people will otherwise People get restless and and then he said looking at their watch a lot and It can be a great distraction for meditation because you're looking at your watch. It keeps the mind stirred up and and it It keeps us from really looking deeply inside Yes Yeah Yeah, yeah, I'm sure if you go to some you know various stores and just ask for timers and you'll find there's probably dozens and dozens of varieties I see you also have someone call you on your cell phone I'm truly overwhelmed I'm truly overwhelmed Sorry you asked Actually when I had that for a while as someone when I first started teaching here in Palo Alto So one of the women who was organizing the sitting group here And gave me a little clock that Little clock but was unique by this clock was that you had an option of whether to have it ring or vibrate When it for the alarm and her idea was that It was easier for me to keep time for the sittings if I would if if I used to wait for the alarm to go off and then I hit the bell rather than looking at the Watch right and but it wouldn't work if the alarm went off and then I hit the bell So so because it vibrated I could just you know have it in my hand or something and and then once you know I would hear you know feel the vibration and I'd hit the bell and the problem was that the the vibrator was almost noisier than the bell Well Maybe with that we should start with a little meditation period and before we do maybe a few of you especially near the back You can sit a little bit farther forward Then when people are people are coming in late will find space in the back of the room Bunch up a little bit to be nice There's space up here you can see it How many of you are this is the second day of the five-week introductory course and So last week then was the first and we talked about the basics of the practice a little bit How many of you are here for the first time today? So didn't come last week for that Okay, so hopefully I'll say enough that bring you up to date So take a comfortable but alert posture The opportunity exists in taking a posture where we're if it's possible where the body is upright self-supporting And that in that upright and aligned posture It's possible to entrust oneself to the body or trust oneself in the body and or trust life itself in with the body So much of the ways we resist life or defend ourselves against life Is translated into our bodily postures or bodily holding patterns or tensions in our shoulders and one of the beautiful things about the classic Cross-legged posture for meditation. It's one of the postures because it's so stable Where it's possible to release a lot of those held tensions will hold ourselves against gravity It's a posture that allows a very deep level of trust Lying down lies that allows for that also trusting but lying down doesn't have the same advantage of Holding yourself upright at the same time and the combination of uprightness and the trust is really very helpful It's not necessary to do this. You can use a back rest if you want or lay down, but there are advantages to it So those of you can to sit upright In a comfortable posture and to softly close your eyes And then take a few moments to take some deep breaths and as you breathe out to relax And Then letting yourself breathe normally with no special effort letting your breath breathe itself And Then you might spend it take a few moments now to scan through your body and see if there's any places of Tension must seek muscular tension That might be easy to relax You might start at the top of your head your forehead and your eyes Your Jaws Sometimes as you breathe out you can maybe soften slightly your shoulders shoulders your shoulder blades You might be possible to relax your chest Perhaps your arms You It might be possible to soften relax your stomach let your stomach hang forward Releasing any tension in the belly And If you can release the tension in the belly and let the belly be soft Can you feel what that does to your center of gravity to the weight? of your lower torso And The idea in meditation is to be here in this place at this time If you're thinking about the work today or tomorrow Thinking about the past to the future We're thinking about something some person or some activity. It's happening now, but someplace else Then you're not here now And what that means is you actually split Fragmented your mind is in one place and your body is in another your body is here in this room on this floor at this time And the idea of meditation is to bring the mind and body together So both the mind and the body are in the same place at the same time In this place this very place here this very time here together So to remind yourself of this you might take another deep breath and as you breathe out settle into your seat Feeling the weight of your body against the floor your cushion your chair And this spot in this place at this time And then take a few moments just to feel what it's like to be in a body right now What is your body's experience of itself at the end of a day whatever kind day you had? Take some moments just to feel your body how it is right now see if you can feel it Rather than judge it or make any comments about it And then within your body as part of your body can you become aware of your breathing? How your body experiences the breathing? Perhaps you feel the breath the breathing most strongly in the abdomen Belly rising and falling perhaps you feel it in the chest rising and falling expanding and contracting Or perhaps you feel it in the nostrils in the back of your throat as the air passes back and forth It doesn't matter where you experience the breathing or how you're breathing This is not an exercise in breathing right or wrong This is a practice of being aware of the breath that you have whatever that happens to be So let your attention become aware of the breathing And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might put your hand on your stomach And you might feel the rising and falling there So let your attention become aware of the breathing or the breathing And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes If you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes You might feel the rising and falling there And if you can't find or experience your body as it breathes She might feel the rising and falling there It's not right to remember The more you can find her that you can come here And weï¿½ll come back in and she will see you, tabs on the diagnostic modifications There's a rhythmic cycle of the inhalations and exhalations See if you there rest your awareness See if you can rest your awareness awareness, and the changing flow of breathing in and breathing out, being consciously aware of the in-breath and the out-breath. Inevitably, your mind will carry you away from here and now, the experience of your breathing, your thoughts, your concerns, your commentary. And when you notice that that's happened, then softly, gently, begin again to be aware of your breathing, resting yourself in the experience of breath. Inevitably, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts, your thoughts. The body's experience of breathing is always in the present moment. It's always here and now. And we train our ability to be present by letting our conscious awareness stay connected to the present moment of living breath. Don't be bothered by what your mind does. Don't be bothered by anything, just in the middle of whatever is happening. And trust yourself to the experience of breathing. And remember that this practice is a practice of being aware of what's happening. And that's all, just to be aware. Be aware of your breathing. And if, in the context of being aware of your breathing, you're also aware of how difficult it is to be with the breath, or how scattered the mind is, or how tired you are. That's great, that you're being aware of what's actually happening for you here and now. There's no need to fight it or resist what's happening. It's a practice of simply being aware of what is true for you right now. No need to get involved with anything, or think about it, or criticize it. Just come back again to the simplicity of your breathing. The in-breaths and out-breaths are like the ocean waves that wash up across the shore back and forth. It is not so much we're watching the breath, but we're feeling the breath within the breath. We're experiencing the sensing or feeling, how it is for the body to experience the breathing. It's almost a sensory awareness exercise. Not thinking about the breath, but sensing and feeling it. Letting go of your thoughts and concerns. And then just for the last minute now, let the experience of breathing be as a continuous part of your awareness as possible. This particular corner of the universe that's you is breathing. Can you really experience that breathing fully for one minute? Yes. Yes. One of the things that gets said a lot in this particular practice is teaching. You probably hear me say it many times. What we're cultivating or training is our ability to be aware of our own self. We're not training ourselves to have particular emotional states or particular states of mind. It's more an awareness training than it is in necessarily attaining something like calm or becoming distressed or becoming filled with rapture or joy. All those things might occur in the context of awareness practice, but if we hold on to those or make those the focus or the plan, then we actually subtly remove ourselves a little bit from the main task, which is to really brighten and sharpen and strengthen our ability to have a non-discriminating awareness, non-judgmental awareness that can really see things directly without prejudice, without bias. So as I said during the sitting, that you might become aware during the sitting that it's difficult to be with your breath because the mind is really busy. It's scattered or whatever. You're having an emotional turmoil or you're sleepy or whatever. The fact that you're aware of it, this is going to be silly to speak this way, the fact that you're aware that you are that way means that you're aware. That's the practice, is to be aware. Isn't that making it really simple? Now, some of you might think, well, that's silly. What good does it do me? But most of us are only half consciously aware, but to really recognize the awareness is really the key and to really brighten that awareness and really rest in the awareness is phenomenally transformative and liberative to do that. So I'll tell you my football story. Some of you heard this. I was watching football on television some years ago with some friends and these were meditation teachers. One of them had the remote control in his hand and as sensible people do, when the commercialist came on, he turned off the sound and we had a conversation. We were talking about something. Then at the end of the commercial, some sensible people are inclined to do. He didn't do what the sensible people are inclined to do. He didn't push the button to get the sound to go on again. We were aware the game had started. We stopped talking. We faced the television. We watched the game, but there was no sound. Since he was a teacher of awareness, he's supposed to be attentive. You should probably notice that there's no sound. I thought, well, he's probably doing something intentional. He knows what he's doing. This is interesting. So I won't say anything immediately. I just sit here and find out what this is like. What's this experience like of watching football without sound? I could watch what was going on. I can figure out. These guys stand up and they fall down. Then you wait for a while and then they stand up together and they fall. Every once in a while, some guy breaks free. You can see he's going across these white lines and he's going in the right direction. You can see with the 40, the 30. Oh yeah, he might make it to the end. Oh no, here comes some other guy. He caught him and they both fall down. You don't need to have much explanation to see these kinds of things. Then at some point, my friend did hit the mute button again and we had the sound. The difference with the sound was that we had the sportscaster making a commentary about the game as the game went along. Suddenly, I could see what's going on. It was interesting. I was kind of new enough to know it was interesting. They made the 30, the 20, the 10. Oh, they might make it. Great. They made it. Great. With the sportscaster speaking, oh my God, he's at the 30, he's at the 20. I'm out of my chair. Yes. I'm all excited and roused and it's really great. I realized that the experience of watching football is a lot different with the commentary than without, with the sportscaster making the commentary without. Until that time, I had naively, because I hadn't thought about it, had compounded or conflated the experience of football with the sportscaster, with the commentary, as if these two things are the same thing. They're really two different things. It's fine to enjoy the sportscaster and get all excited, I guess. It's also important to realize that they are two different things. If you realize they're two different things, the game itself and the sportscaster, you can actually have a different relationship. You can be free or actually be able to see directly for yourself, rather than always seeing through the lens or the emotions of the sportscaster. One of my friends, Sian Palo Alto, realized this. He found out that the local radio sportscasters for the 49er games, they're so much more emotional because it's the home team, whereas national television sportscasters, it's not necessarily their home team, they're just national sportscasters. The local radio, they're much more excited. He turns the television on, but turns the sound off and turns his radio on to really get into it. What does this have to do with meditation? Each of us has our commentator in our mind, in our head. Most of us are constantly making commentary. Sports casting, play by play, or maybe United of Sports, maybe it's the soap operas or Oprah or some kind of commentary going on. We're constantly making commentary about what's happening around us, inside of us. I'm sitting in meditation and I stay with two breaths and I get scattered. I come back to my breath, I get scattered right away. Then you make a commentary. I'm a terrible meditator. I'm probably the worst person meditating here in the whole room. It's hopeless, I'm embarrassed, I'm ashamed of myself. Everybody else here is probably enlightened already. Maybe while everybody has their eyes closed, maybe they can sneak out. That's rather evolved from a commentary. However, what most people don't see is they don't see that the actual experience we're having and the commentary are two different things. You can have different kind of commentary. Commentary is opinion, commentary is judgment. Commentary is old interpretations that have been inherited from family and society or whatever. It's not necessarily what is directly happening. It's like this filter, this lens or veil that's put over experience often. Most people don't see these two as being separate or two different things. What we're trying to do in meditation in part is not to discount any parts of ourselves and say any parts are bad. What we're trying to do is to see the difference between our direct experience and the commentary, the judgments, the ideas, the opinions we have and what's going on. Then if we can see that difference, that distinction, then we want to try to rest in the direct experience rather than resting in the commentary, rather than living in the commentary where most of us live all the time. For some people, it's a very radical and foreign idea that you don't have to live in your commentary. You don't have to live in your thoughts and evaluations and judgments, which for some people are incessant is what kind of where they take up residence. There's a whole other way of living. That whole other way of living is a more embodied way of living, a way of experiencing with all our senses sight, sound, smell, taste. All our senses are lived life as it's being lived, things as they are. As we can experience our lived life in the present moment as we are right now, stronger and stronger and more more, then it becomes clear and clear the difference between our lived experience and the ideas that we have about the lived experience. If you see the difference between the two, then you can see that your ideas maybe are more optional than you realized. One of the classic examples is someone's late for a date, someone's late for an appointment. You're standing there in the street corner waiting for them to pick you up. They're supposed to meet you at the corner of Emerson and Hamilton, right, maybe, at four o'clock. You've told them time and time again how painful it is for you when they come late. You feel very disrespected. Why? Please come on time and it's your last chance. The person doesn't show up. You get angry. How can that person let me down one more time? This means the person has disrespected me one more time. Why am I always getting into relationships where they disrespect me this way? I need to go find a therapist to help me because ... You've gotten involved in the commentary. All that's happened, what's really happening in the moment, all that you really know in the moment itself is you're standing in the corner of Emerson and Hamilton. They cross each other, right? I hope. They don't cross each other. They do cross each other. For some of us they do and some of us they don't. You're standing on the street corner, you had an appointment to meet someone, and you're standing there in the street corner and they're not there. That's what's actually happening in the present moment. Until you have other evidence, everything else is commentary. It might be good guess, but it's really ... You're not really sure about it. Most of us have the experience, I've had the experience of judging and being angry with someone for not showing up and then finding out later that they had a very good reason they didn't show up. They were on their way and they had a car accident and they're in the hospital. Suddenly the whole of my anger and upset and feeling the disrespect and the need that I did, the feeling I need to go to therapy to work out my relationship with people, it's all kind of ... Wow, it just goes, poof, I just made all that up. No, it might be true. It might just be the person who's disrespecting you. That often happens. Until we have the evidence, do we take the actual experience of the present moment and intertwine it inseparably from the commentary, or do we see what is commentary and we hold it a little bit loose in our mind until we have better evidence? You following me? It's very, very profound to begin seeing the difference between what is actually happening in the moment and the ideas, the commentary that we have and what's going on. That's one of the things that we begin training ourselves in doing in meditation. As you sat here, this last sitting, probably we became aware a little bit of how easy it is for the mind to leave the here and now, to go on to the past, the future, thoughts and concerns. How many of you noticed that? Those of you who didn't raise your hands, have already noticed it before. With that, let's do another short sitting, five minutes or so. If you need to just stand for 10 seconds, you can stand and stretch. The advantage of beginning to see the distinction between what's actually happening in our lived experience in the commentary is that it makes it a lot easier than to choose to stay, to entrust ourselves with the lived experience. So your commentary about your breathing or your meditation, that is not your actual experience. Judgment, criticism belong to commentary and they're not really needed. It's a lot more peaceful just to be with your experience than it is to be with your experience and judging it. So take a deep breath or two, close your eyes, take a deep breath and if it's possible, just relax your mind, relax your thinking. Take a few moments to feel that space underneath your skull that we call the brain behind your forehead. Feel what's there, if anything. Maybe you feel very subtle vibration, maybe pressure, heaviness, whatever you feel, the area of your brain. And then as if your brain is a muscle, as you breathe out, can you relax it? Softening the hold of your commentary and then as simply as you can, but as directly become aware again of your breathing, the lived experience of breath, of breathing. And then as a way of helping you stay with the lived experience of breathing, you can ever so subtly in the mind name the in-breath in, the out-breath out or rising, falling as a way of really encouraging yourself to feel the breath as fully as possible. And then as we sit these five minutes, staying with the breathing, be attentive to when the commentary kicks in, the judgment, the ideas, either commentary about your experience now or the commentary about something completely unrelated. And if you notice that's happening, then see if you can yield yourself back, turn yourself back into the physical embodied experience of breathing, just to rest there with a breath. Whenever you need to, remembering to come back again to the present, to the breathing, letting go of the commentary. And then now, stop paying attention to your breathing for a few moments and instead look through your body and find the strongest physical sensation that your body has right now, aside from the breathing. Something in your legs or your back or shoulders or anywhere at all, the strongest physical sensation. And then bring your attention in an allowing way to that strong sensation, just to feel it, to get to know it. Notice what happens to the experience, the physical experience. When you just bring simple direct awareness that allows it to be there, notice what happens as you're aware of it, if anything. Notice any tendency you have to make commentary about the physical experience, meaning. And if you can, let go of the commentary in favor of feeling fully in the body what it feels like, that experience. If it disappears as you watch it, then look for some other sensation in your body, the next strongest. And if it persists, then it is gently and as allowing as you can, allowing it to be there. See if you can sense it more closely, as if your awareness is putting a bright light on it and you're really going to place yourself really close to it, letting it be the object of your awareness. And then you can let go of paying attention to the physical sensation. And then come back again, very simply, matter of factly, to your breathing, feeling the in-breaths and out-breaths. So what was that like for some of you, this last short little meditation we just did? Was it helpful for me to talk about the commentary and make a distinction there? What happened as you brought your attention to the physical sensation at the end? Yes? The physical sensation was a mixed bag for me because when I meditate I tend to have anxiety. The positive side is that I really like that I have anxiety all the time in my life. That's one option you have. Sometimes in meditation people realize aspects about themselves that it would be good to spend some time analyzing and reflecting and sometimes with a friend, sometimes even with a therapist. It can be very helpful. Part of the power of meditation is that it offers us an opportunity to, in a sense, leave ourselves alone. It's very rare that most of us leave ourselves alone. Often in a commentary we're concerned, we're worried, we're anxious, we're afraid, we're ambitious, we're getting something done, we're planning, or whatever. And in the... we're not leaving ourselves alone. But not... almost everything that happens within us is trying to process itself, trying to kind of finish itself, come to an end, liberate itself. And it doesn't finish itself because we're constantly stirring up the waters. Like the classic analogy of meditation is that of a pond that's muddy. And if you come along to a muddy pond with a stick and stir up the mud, it'll just stay muddy. But if you leave the pond alone and just let it... and don't stir it up anymore, it'll settle by itself and it'll become crystal clear. So all the mud will settle to the bottom. At least that's true in Buddhist hydrology. And so there's something very profound about this, and that is so... so to actually bring awareness to the physical experience of anxiety and to hold that... to hold it in awareness is a way of leaving ourselves alone. And the awareness kind of makes space for the anxiety to unfold and settle itself in a very different way than if the mind keeps thinking about it. Because it keeps thinking about and reacting to it, which is stirring up the... keeps stirring up the water. So there's various choices you can make having become aware of what you did. But in how we deal with it in meditation itself, we'll talk more about in the next few weeks. Next week we'll talk about emotions, but is actually to bring and hold ourselves with the physical experience of tension or tightness, what you felt in your throat, you said? And as you did that, what happened? I think it really didn't help at all the time, realizing in hindsight that it's what we learned about it. And the worry I propose is a symptom of commentary. It's a form of commentary. And it takes a while. I mean, the point I tried to make earlier between learning to separate what's actually happening from the commentary and to really see that clearly enough so we can actually choose not to keep fueling the commentary. It's very simple for me to sit up here and say that. It takes a long time actually to really learn that and get it under skin deeply. And it takes patience and it's well worth doing. Someone else, your experience in that last little sitting. Yes. My back started hurting. And I don't know, I think in part the old experience pain is like part of the thing that something is hurt. And when you don't say to yourself something is hurt and weird things happen. It's still hurting. But you're not alone, you say it's a failure. That's interesting. So I wonder how many times does our commentary and judgments about pain actually perpetuate the pain? Sometimes it does. Sometimes it does. And it takes various forms. Some are pretty obvious. For example, our reactions, our judgments and our worries and our versions to physical pain, for example, often it could take the form of tightening around the pain. And the tightening around the pain, tensing around the pain can make the pain worse. And often what the problem is not necessarily the pain originally, but rather the added suffering that comes from the tension around it. So if you learn just to be there and not to have the commentary or judgment, it can actually, certain kinds of pains will actually dissolve and go away. Some pains are for, maybe just for simplistic sake here, have more of a mental or psychological root rather than structural, rather than having poor posture or something. And one of the most powerful things we can do with mental, with physical pain, that it's roots and mental tension is to bring awareness to it. And it often dissolve. It's quite amazing. Where is it? But as I know, you almost fell asleep. You almost fell asleep. Oh yeah, it's okay. Yes. I felt very itchy. Yes. And? No, and that's it. No commentary. No comment. Great. Yes. I had noticed last week and this week that when you asked, are you thinking about the future, are you thinking about the past, are you thinking about in here when the door keeps clicking, when people are laying and going in and out? So I was thinking about now. Yes. I wasn't a president, but it was pulling my ear and pulling my nose. I was definitely getting annoyed by that. I was thinking, well, you're late too sometimes. But I was in the moment, you know, hearing every little sound that was there. And I both weeks I went home last week to my husband and I was annoyed about the people that were late. And that was distracting to you and to, you know, the flavor of what we're here for. And so definitely there for me now, you know, with this meditation with the door. Did your husband have any good advice? How did he bring it off? Oh, good. Well, you say it didn't bother me last week, but this week I was very aware of thinking I'll get less just getting kind of irritating you. So your commentary was dependent on your commentary was dependent on level of her commentary. Your idea is about what she was thinking about. So, well, one of the profound and maybe a little bit difficult principles to understand about mindfulness practice is that there are no such things as distractions. There's just something else to be aware of. And as we become aware of it, then you can also become aware of, do you just allow it to be a sound as a sound, or do we make all kinds of associations? Oh, those lousy people are always late, you know, and I'm always on time and why can't, you know, I really struggle to get here on time and, you know, you know, we have all these ideas, we form all these ideas. And it happens regularly on longer retreats that I teach that someone in the hall, you know, is not as silent as someone else. You know, maybe they, you know, whatever. And so someone comes to me and says, you know, I can't stand it. I can't meditate with this person, you know, breathing heavily or whatever near me. And then they'll come back a few days later and say, you know, what I realized is that it's just sound. There's no inside and outside. It's nothing different than any my breath or anything else. And all that reaction I had to it was my commentary, my aversion, which added extra on top of it. And I was suffering, the heavy breathing or the sound, the door opening and closing, that is not suffering. Suffering doesn't reside in click, click, click. Suffering resides in, oh my God, how could they have done that? I'm late. I can't hear, you know, get anxious and upset. That's our reactions to it. And reactions belongs kind of this world that I'm calling the commentary. And what we're trying to see here is the difference between what's actually happening, not just simply our commentary, but our reactions. And that's where our freedom will come when we see that difference. And so we say there's no such thing as a distraction, just other things to pay attention to. So maybe I should carry on with the instructions then and maybe it'll become a little bit clearer. The basic instructions for mindfulness practice could be described very simply. And that is pay attention to what is predominant in your experience right now. So whatever is predominant in your experience, that's where you put your attention, to feel it really carefully. If the door is opening and closing and that's really predominant thing in your experience, that becomes your meditation object. It doesn't become an obstacle to your meditation. It is your meditation. So there's no conflict. It's just another thing happening. Now because, so that means everything in the realm of human experience can be included as part of the meditation. And that's why practice is so, I believe, profound and transformative because it includes everything in our life. There are different kinds of meditation practices that really focus on particular parts of our life or are very good at escaping for parts of our life. But mindfulness practice is predicated on the idea of entering into our life and finding an awakening in our life, not an awakening away from our life. Does that make sense? And so in mindfulness we train ourselves over and over again to turn ourselves back into what is happening, even if we don't like it. We turn ourselves back into the experience to get to know it better, to wake up to it. So everything's included. But because it's a little bit hard to sit down and say pay attention to everything, we do the five-week trajectory course. We kind of build week by week. We do the breath the first week and the breath is kind of the foundation because it is hard to be present and the breath is this very wonderful constant in the middle of our life. We use that as a kind of whetstone to sharpen our awareness, an anchor to help keep us and develop our ability to stay in the present. So the breath is our great friend and ally for this practice. But the breath is not the be all and end all of the practice. So this is where it's important to understand that the difference between the foreground and background of experience. What we do is we pay attention to what's in the foreground of the meditation practice is to pay attention to what's in the foreground of experience. So when we first sit down we place the breath from the foreground. And there might be many things in the background. Sounds, smells, tastes, thoughts, feelings, itches, whatever. As long as those things are in the background and you can keep the breath in the foreground, that just simply rests there. Just be there, rest there, come back to it. The mind will go away a little bit. Just come back, come back and develop your ability to be present with that stuff. Sooner or later something else will push itself into the foreground and kind of compete with the breath or push further forward than the breath. Like some strong knee pain or back pain or the door or neighbor barking or an itch or a strong feeling or something comes up. Something that comes up from the foreground. The practice at that point is to let go of the breath and take that new foreground as a place where you bring your awareness. Just bring your awareness to it and sense and feel that experience. And you might very quietly, kind of in a kind of nice rhythmic way, name the experience as a way of helping you stay present. The name is kind of like an anchor that keeps you there so the mind doesn't wander off too easily. So you're sitting here and you feel an itch. So the itch becomes quite, first it's kind of in the background, you're kind of aware of an itch but it's easy to stay with the breath, you stay with the in breath, the out breath. At some point the itch becomes stronger and you feel, so you let go of the breath and you bring your attention to the itch. And you might name it itch itch. But mostly you just feel it as you never felt an itch before. And when the itch passes or it's no longer in the foreground then you come back to the breath. Or some other physical experience occurs say your knee hurts. You bring your attention then you bring your attention to the knee and you really experience what that need discomfort is like. Many of us with discomfort want to keep ourselves removed from the experience. We want to avoid it at all costs or get rid of it. And we kind of train ourselves habitually not to actually go into discomfort and get to know it better. And there's a lot to be learned, a lot of benefits to be had by actually going in feeling our discomfort rather than always trying to fix it or get rid of it. So in mindfulness practice we bring our attention carefully to the knee if the knee is hurting. And we feel it, what is it really like if you really bring your attention carefully to the pain. What happens if you drop below the level of name or concept into the direct experience of pain? And what you'll find is that pain is made up of many different kinds of sensations. It's made up of for example burning or pulling or twisting or stabbing or searing or very hardness or heaviness or pulling or there's all these strong sensations, particular sensations that characterize what we call a distance we call pain. If you bring your attention really closely, really feel the pain, you'll find the pain, if you try to pinpoint where exactly it is from a distance, oh it's the knee, it's right there, I know where it is. But if you bring your attention really carefully to feel exactly you know to the cell almost, where is that pain in the body? You'll find the pain is not this constant, it's not so solid, it's actually a kind of a dance of vibrating sensation, a dance of sensations that are kind of sparking and passing away very fast and moving about a little bit around different points of the knee if that's where you're feeling it. And it's not so constant and then the amazing thing happens if it's not constant, what's happening in between? The little sparks. And if it's not always pain, there's little gaps in between, even if they're just kind of very very fast, maybe it's a lot easier to be there with it. So it's fascinating to explore. And it's possible to understand the reactions and the commentary we add to that pain and the ways in which we tighten up around it, make it worse, the way we feel self-pity or feel shame or the ways in which we kind of trip out and completely go to Hawaii. Because you know, you don't want to sit there with the pain and deal with it and be present. It's too uncomfortable and daydreaming about the beaches of Hawaii, that's a lot better. And so one of the reasons people, one reason that people will distract themselves in meditation with all kinds of wonderful thoughts is as an avoidance mechanism from staying present. So to notice these things. But what we're cultivating is a very simple matter-of-fact non-judgmental awareness of what's happening in the present moment. It can be very strong, pleasant sensations in the body that arise. Sometimes when people meditate, their mind gets very quiet and calm, the mind gets very concentrated. And in that concentrated state, some wonderful states of rapture can arise in the body, bubbling sensations of joy and warmth and tingling and kind of effervescent kind of feelings. So you can feel this wonderful feeling of warmth maybe arises in the chest and it's very predominant in the foreground. Then the instructions is the same. You bring your careful attention to that experience of warmth in your chest, that feeling of nice pleasure in the chest. And feel it really carefully, get to know it. And then notice how your relationship or reaction to it. Is there commentary? Oh, I'm a really good meditator. Or I've arrived. Or how can I get this again? Or maybe I better start, maybe I better, what was I wearing? What am I wearing right now? Because if I wear the same thing, what would I have for dinner? Maybe if I had the same dinner tomorrow, I could maybe have the same experience. The mind starts doing all these things or judging it really good. Or some people who come from certain religious backgrounds will judge wonderful pleasure, joyful experiences in meditation as being shameful and bad. And so all this commentary and reactions, the trick in meditation is to let it be. That's like a mantra that we use, let it be. Let it be. Let it be as it is without, you know, you'll have commentary anyway, without getting fooled by the commentary, without resting, not taking up residence in the commentary. Come back to the simplicity of the direct immediate experience that you're having and rest there. And you do that over and over and over again and becoming familiar and feeling comfortable with your lived experience. Most people are not comfortable in their lived experience of being alive for all kinds of reasons. They live in their heads most of the time. So that's the instructions for today, the expansion of last week. Last week was primarily pay attention to the breath. This week the instructions is stay with the breath as best you can. But when some strong physical experience in your body arises that takes precedence, takes prominence over your breath, let go of the breath and bring your attention to that physical experience. And that can include sounds. If there are strong sounds, just do hearing meditation, listening, listening, listening. Notice your reactions. Just listen, you know, rest and listening, just listening. And then when you're, when it's no longer kind of in the foreground or grabs you then simply, gently come back to the breathing. There can be kind of a sense of floating. Floating between what's the breath and then something else which becomes more prominent. And then when it's no longer prominent, kind of floating back to the breath and being with the breath, staying in the present moment. The breath, the body is one of our best friends. It's really a phenomenal ally and help in living a sane life. Insane lives tend to arise out of insane minds. Insane minds tend to arise out of insane cultures. Some people, you know, it's really phenomenal to try to live for most people in this part of the country here in Silicon Valley. There's a lot of pressure for many people here. And it's interesting how different people relate to the pressures of living here. Some people think that something's wrong with them. If I can only figure out how I can be more time efficient, if I can only figure out how I could, you know, get to the gym and do my shopping and do my cooking and get to work before eight o'clock in the morning, you know, if I can only figure out how to, you know, whatever, then everything will be fine. It's up to me. Other people will say, this is a crazy society we live in. How could, you know, it's society's fault. I don't know whose fault it is, but we all have our favorite place we assign the blame. And often we assign the blame or we're preoccupied trying to fix things and we tend to stay too much in the head. And the head fragments us. If we stay all the time in the head, all the time in our thoughts, as I talked about earlier, we get fragmented. We're not in the present in our body, our body and the mind are not in the same place. And that creates a fragmented being. And most people in this environment here live very fragmented lives. And it's paradoxical that the busier we get and the more kind of cell phones we have and all kinds of things. I got a cell phone a few months ago and I was surprised after a few weeks at how that changed me suddenly. I noticed this tendency inside of me to not just simply be driving or walking or just hanging out kind of peacefully and nice, but to use every moment I could to be on the phone taking care of business. I'm a meditation teacher, how much business do I have? I can't do it. It's like this virus that comes with a phone. So I saw it, so I've kind of cured myself of it pretty quickly. But I could see the tendency and living in more of my thoughts, more in my speedy thinking ahead and talking to people, which is so much in the head anyway. The body is the place that we can heal the splits between the head and the heart, the head and the body. The body is the place that is always in the present moment. And the body is phenomenally honest about where you're really at, what's really going on with you. The mind is actually kind of tricky. The mind isn't always so honest. Some meditation teachers say that the mind has no shame. The mind isn't even so interested in the truth, the next business deal or the next whatever. But the body is a truth-sayer. If you stop and pay attention to what's going on in the body, your body will tell you immediately, are you tense? Are you stressed out? Are you happy? Are you worried? Are you afraid? Are you joyful? Are you preoccupied? You could feel it in your body, these things. So a very, very important principle in spirituality, in Buddhist spirituality, is beginning to come back into our embodied sense of being and living more from the body time, the body's lived experience of life rather than from the mind's experience of life or the mind's ideas of life. And in the sense that mindfulness practice is finding awakening in life and turning ourselves into life, the most profound place to do that is through our body. Maybe the only place to do that is through our physical embodied lived experience of how we are as human beings. So the instructions to start including the body as part of the meditation practice is not just simply good for the meditation practice, but it becomes a very important foundation for understanding then the following week how to include emotions as part of the practice and how to include thoughts in the rest of our life. And it's phenomenally useful. Mindfulness practice is an embodied practice. It's a practice of going back into... it's unfortunate we have the English word mindful because it lends itself to the idea it's all about the mind. It could almost as well be body fullness. To begin healing the split between the mind and the body. And the idea is not to be excessively in the body, which it's possible to be. The idea is to have a balanced relationship between the mind and the body. And most people in our society are too much in their heads and their thoughts and their mind. And so the emphasis on being in the body and experiencing the body is a phenomenally important corrective for many of us in our culture. Occasionally I meet people who are too much in their body and I have to tell them pay attention to the mind or something. But it's rare compared to the other way. So you might take this for this next week, take this into account and begin... including the physical experience as part of the meditation. But you might also, as you go about your daily life in various situations, check into your body. Take a moment, stop what you're doing. Maybe you're standing at a red light, stop the red light. Rather than being impatient for the light to change and thinking ahead, take a breath and feel what's going on in your body and let your body tell you or explain to you or reveal to you maybe where you're really at. And once you realize where you're really at, do you want to stay there? For example, if you're kind of rushing ahead and thinking ahead and riding the bumper of the person ahead of you and that lousy person, they realize, you know, I'm in a hurry, you know, and you realize, wow, that toll, that cost my body to be so stressed and so in a hurry. Is that the way I really want to live? And maybe, you know, you have much more choice if you check in and find out what's going on. Standing in line in the market or before you answer the telephone. I've made it a habit where I'm regularly, constantly coming back and checking with my body what's happening with my body. As I sit here talking with you, I'm regularly, as I talk, checking in with my body to feel what's going on with my body because my, I react, so, which I do anyway, but I pay attention to my body and I notice when I get imbalanced and I try to come back to a balanced place so I can talk from a balanced place and center place for all of you. Any questions about that? Yes. What are the symptoms of someone who is too much of your thoughts? There used to be people who came back from Asia doing particular kinds of Buddhist meditation practices that were very much about being in the body and they get this added Buddhist teaching that there's no self, which they misunderstood and so you ask them, you know, how are you? And they say, oh, I feel a lot of tightness and tension. Yeah, but how are you? Yeah, the tightness and tension is mostly my chest and my neck and but you seem really angry. No, there's tightness and tension. That's an example. Yes. I have trouble knowing what's foreground and background. It often seems to me that I can just keep something in the foreground by bringing my awareness to it. I'm not sure when to go back to the breath. Eventually it won't be the foreground anymore, I guarantee. Well, thoughts will come through, my mind will come through, but that's what breaks it all. So you turn to the thought and then you're able to keep the thinking in the foreground? Is that what you're saying? No, then I'm lost. Then you're lost. Then you come back to the breath. The breath is a default. When in doubt, come back to your breath. Just come back to your breathing. When in doubt. Can you say something about the distinction between naming and noting? I'm using this synonymously. Well, it seems that what you're saying, noting is identifying the experience here. So it's listening, not knowing. Right. Hearing, hearing. That's what's actually happening, hearing, hearing, itching, itching. Recent pain, pain, thinking, thinking, anger, anger. Very simply, you don't have to be so accurate with a note. I find that my name is not... Oh, yeah, yeah. So if you're looking, you could spend a lot of time naming everything you see. Green shirt and blue pants and white pants and gray hair and looking on forever. Or you can make seeing, seeing, seeing, seeing. The idea with meditation to some degree is to be restful of what you're doing and to be a little bit relaxed. So if you find yourself... Whenever you find yourself, the way in which you're meditating is causing stress or strain, then back off what you're doing and see if you can find a more restful way of being present. And being present takes a while, so you have to realize that this is a training that we're doing. And you can't expect to stay in the present moment for very long if you've never really tried to do that. And it's phenomenal. People will... Because maybe because we're adults and we're overachievers or whatever, I don't know why. But people will sit down and they expect to be able to stay with their breathing immediately or they fail, they're doing it wrong. But it's like learning to walk as a baby or it's learning to play a piano or something. It takes a while. And one of the important qualities, spiritual qualities that are being cultivated in the process of learning how to stay in the present moment, it might take weeks and months and a long time, is patience and acceptance. Patience and acceptance of where we're actually at and how we actually are are very, very important qualities of mindfulness practice. So don't be ahead of yourself. Just be patient and accepting of where you're at. And then slowly you'll find coming back to the present moment of what's actually happening in your breath and in your body, that your ability to stay there and the wisdom that arises from staying in the present like that will become more and more part of your life. Anything else that we should talk about? Does that seem to make sense for you, the instructions on the body? Yes, Maria. Well, as you were talking about, I was thinking about something that happened to you today, right here. I was in a room with a group of people and we were putting together a presentation and there was a lot of rushing and tense. And suddenly I just left the room and wandered out of the room and I went to my office and I sat down and I realized I was sitting in my office and I said, what am I doing here? And as soon as I caught myself there, I said, oh, I have to get back to the room. And I said, well, actually, no, I'm probably here because, and so I did at checking in with my body, what's happening? And I realized that my body left room because it didn't want to be there anymore and that it was important to just sit there and notice that. And so I did stay out of the room for a while and went back and everything was fine. And it's a good coping mechanism, but what was interesting was recognizing that my body was taking care of me and catching it. That was kind of interesting. If you give the body a chance, it's almost as if the body has a tremendous repository of understanding and wisdom and intuition or whatever. And to the degree in which we're alienated from our bodies, the degree in which we're alienated from that wisdom or intuition or that kind of knowing, that can happen. That can be a very useful part of a person's life. So part of mindfulness is embodiment, being in our body, being present for our lived experiences while it's occurring. So you might, as you go through the days this next week, just check in periodically in your body or check in and see, how is my body experiencing this situation? What is your body experiencing this situation? I had some kind of leisurely time this afternoon and I did that with the weather. I kind of knew what the weather was, but I didn't really know what the weather was until I stopped and said, how has my body experienced this kind of cool winter weather? And it was really a delight to let my body experience it. I just loved it. There's a whole different kind of sensibility to the present moment. My thoughts were about the weather were different than what my bodily experience of it was. So next week we'll talk about emotions and an important area of people's lives. And hopefully I'll present maybe a different perspective on emotions from the common cultural ones about how to be present for them and how to include them as part of your life. That's probably enough for today. For those of you who are new and who are not here, I'd like to thank you for your support.
