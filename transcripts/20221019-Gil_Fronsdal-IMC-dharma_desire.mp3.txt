 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. To say a few words about the practice, one of the characteristics of Buddhist teachings often is an emphasis on non-attachment. And that can translate into the idea that you should let go of desires and not have any desires. Another emphasis is the idea that when you meditate, you should not try to make something happen, engineer your practice, try to fix it, try to kind of, you know, but rather just be present and see clearly what's here, which suggests also no desires, just be present. So in some way or other, people listening to Buddhist teachings can feel that, get their message that desires are not good. You're not supposed to have any. But this is a mistake, that desires are an important part of the practice, important part of human life. Chances are that if people have no desires, they're probably depressed. I don't think that, you know, having no desires is really, you know, I think that human beings are not really human beings, they're human desirelings. The desiring, just part and parcel of life, you know, wanting to eat if you're hungry, wanting to drink when you're thirsty, you want to pee when you eat the pee. There's all kinds of desires that are part of a normal course of life. And there's bigger desires to be had. And there's the desire to practice, the desire to meditate, desire to be in the present moment and not losing your mind to your distractions over and over again. And these desires are really important to have. Without those desires, why would you do anything? Why would you show up here? Why would you meditate? Why would you not be, you know? And so there's a way in which desires are important, valuable, they can be an orientation, they can be a motivation, they can be a safeguard. The alternatives might be worse, which the mind does. And also, as I said, it can orient us to what we're about. This is what I want to do. This is clearly a desire. The art of it is to have the desire together with a certain kind of non-attachment. It's not one or the other, but both together. To have a desire, but to do so with clarity and maybe some strength even to it, but without being caught up in the expectation to succeed, without relating it, the desire, to all kinds of ideas about me, myself, and mine. The conceit, like, I have to do this, it's up to me, and I have to prove myself, I have to be successful, I shouldn't fail. There can be so much me that goes together with desire. That makes it much more complicated than it needs to be. Just a simple desire, this is what I'm doing, I'm putting my life force with these 45 minutes into doing this, this is what I like to do. So it's clarity, kind of decisiveness. The mind likes decisiveness sometimes, like, this is what we're doing. And then there's also being relaxed about not succeeding, being relaxed when the mind has other ideas and you come back, not making it a problem, not making it something that you're neurotically pursuing, not being something that you have to... There can be a lot of strength behind desire, but no attachment, a lot of strength without expectation, a lot of strength without relating it to the whole complex of me, myself, and mine. There can be a lot of strength to a desire without there being any strain whatsoever. There can be, you know, part of one desire is to have desire with no tension as part of it. That's a great desire. And so that protects you from having the desires have tension associated with them. To have desires that somehow the desires itself is more aligned with freedom than it is with clinging. So, but some clarity, this is what I would... So for today, while you're here, you might experiment with this. You might see when you're doing walking meditation, whether you kind of establish your own desire, but a clear desire, to somehow do the walking meditation in some way or other. Some desire associated with it that's realistic for you. Don't have desires which are unrealistic. You know, maybe, you know, modest desires, and then if they work out, then maybe you can up it up a little bit. It could be my desire determined, this is like the most important thing. This is what I'm going to do. Yes, I'm going to try to track the whole exhale. That's the one desire. And then we'll see what the desire is at the end when that's over. You know, maybe I'll do the inhale. But anyway, so the point being, make it small enough, make it modest enough that it's kind of doable. And then as it's appropriate, you can make the desires a little bigger and bigger. When you come back to sit, you know, sit down with desire that's related to the practice. And see if that having clarity and some decisiveness around it can be helpful for you. If it's not helpful, then it's probably, there's some attachment to it, some clinging, some extra strain that's involved. And part of the purpose of this kind of this way of talking is that to discover what that extra is, that's part of the path as well. So in this way, I hope that you enjoy your desires today, that they serve you and you benefit from them. Thank you.
