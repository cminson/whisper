The sound of the bell.
The sound of construction happening outside.
The sound of my voice arising and passing.
And the sounds inside of us.
The noise inside of us.
The sound of silence as conditions change.
How is it that when we bring ourselves to the present moment, with no contention?
How it is that this body, mind, heart can be at ease in the midst of all?
In the midst of this ease, in the midst of papancha, proliferation, in the midst of strong emotions or soft emotions.
What a wonderful morning of practice.
It reminds me when I was a volunteer at St. Hospice in the mid-90s.
I think it was, yeah.
And of the 90s, something like that.
They were some precepts.
We call them the precepts.
Now they're called five invitations.
It was part of what Frank, forgive me, Frank, for forgetting your last name.
But he's the author of the five invitations.
And one of those invitations are what we call, you know, precepts at that time of Zen hospice, at that time was resting in the middle of things, resting in the middle of things.
And in some ways we can relate to how it is that when we are here in the present moment, however it arises and passes, however it unfolds.
And we rest the attention and, you know, whatever we choose to rest the attention in could be the body, body breath, sounds.
And just receiving, receiving what is coming up.
It's almost like we turn on the radio and we listen to it, we receive the sound and we turn it off.
We're engaged in a situation and the attention is resting, resting and searching and looking, you know, for how to be with this situation in a way that is satisfying to us.
There are different ways in which we can be with different situations.
What is the way that will bring rest and ease and clarity and wisdom and continuity of being here in the practice?
Turning the attention towards us, instead of looking out, looking inside, receiving instead of again searching, resting in the middle of things.
That's what for me is resting, coming back to this anchor, coming back to, okay, in the middle of everything that is happening in life.
We can rest here and still be here with no contention, seeing, liking, not liking, wanting, not wanting.
And it's okay, seeing balance, non-balance, it's okay.
It's part of us being human.
And so we're used to, you know, in our lives.
As we come back together in person, we notice how it is, wow, after so much time passing by, you know, a few years.
And now we're here and it's like, okay, something may release.
In the midst of all, there's something new, new conditions happening.
And the body tells us construction is over for now.
Maybe it's lunchtime.
How is it? How is it too? In the midst of all suddenly, oh, it changed.
I can notice myself smiling or not smiling when there was silence, there was not silence, and at some point, no preference.
Okay, this is what is here. Not even saying that in the mind, you know.
This is here. Is there anything that needs to be taken care of? Is this sound, you know, okay?
Is it okay for me to be here? Yeah, it's not hurting me.
Okay, I stay here. I can manage. It's fine.
Same thing with emotions.
The air emotions arise in our minds and hearts, and we receive them.
Is it too much? You're the only one who knows yourself well from the inside out. No one can tell you.
This is where the trust in your practice comes in.
Too much? Let me step back.
Too much thinking, oh my gosh, this is driving me crazy.
Or, oh my gosh, this is so good, I want more.
Let me just take a break. Change the channel.
Resting, resting in the middle of things.
Shifting, shifting where attention goes, how you're being, applying this attention.
Every moment is an opportunity for practice.
This morning of practice, you know, it was like all the workers, beings outside were practicing.
All of us were practicing together.
Everything, everything is welcome. This is how our lives is sometimes.
A lot of noise inside of us.
And then we see the stillness, then off.
Okay.
So we can see how a situation comes into the mind heart and say, yes, I see this.
And we feel it. We have a sense, sense, the experience, the felt experience, how it is in this body mind right now.
Okay.
How we're relating to it.
Okay.
Is contraction going up, contraction going down?
Can we be like one of the stories that we hear as we practice here?
Can we be this practitioner, this monastic walking in the midst, in the middle of the battlefield?
At ease.
Walking in the middle of things.
So having a reference point for you in your life.
Maybe this morning, changing from sound, no sound, very, very evident.
You cannot control it. You cannot, there's many other things we cannot control in our lives.
And appreciating, appreciating, okay, this way of relating, yeah.
This other way, okay, to the situation.
Oh, I see. Yeah, this is Duka.
Or, okay.
What needs to happen here? What needs to be done to take care of ourselves, our minds, cultivating a mind that is at ease with anything that shows up,
that can relate wisely.
And see where, where, where is that we take moments of rest.
And moments of basking in the goodness when you see, wow, I really appreciate this.
