The Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California So those of you in the heat these days, rather than saying warm greetings, perhaps you could appreciate an offering of cool greetings. That's been said that the English language, because it was evolved, developed in England, which can be cold and rainy, that the idea of warmth is very appealing and heartwarming. Whereas Buddhism developed in India where it can be quite warm, and there what is wonderful is coolness, to be cool. And so the idea of coolness has very different connotations than it has in English, where being cool is being pretty hip or something. But being cool is being refreshed and being delighted and being all kinds of things. And so the idea of nirvana is very much associated with the idea of becoming cool, cooling down, the cooling of the flames, and maybe in this heat. You can appreciate how that's really a meaningful metaphor that maybe sometimes English-speaking people wouldn't quite be inspired by. So I'd like to say some preparatory words for this meditation, but no preparatory guided meditation. I just want to say my words, and that'll serve as the support for the meditation today. So if you'd like to close your eyes as I say this, hopefully you can listen, but kind of get yourself settled and on your own as you listen. So these qualities of the Dharma for today, it's the one that says, come and look, come and see. And so insight, the name of our kind of meditation, insight meditation, does involve seeing. And it does involve seeing more clearly what comes into view as we see. So coming into seeing more clearly the experience of breathing, the body, sounds, the thoughts, emotions, and that's part of the value of it. But one of the profound things to see, if we're trying to see something, if we're looking to find something, like there's some insight that will be profound, something to discover that's kind of profound, if you're seeking, then what you're looking for can be found in the seeing, not in what you see. What you seek is found in the seeking, not in what you're seeking for out there. The thing to be aware of is the awareness itself. Be aware of ourselves mindful, aware, attentive, where our attention includes what it's like to be attending to what attention takes in. And so this backward step, this kind of turning the awareness around almost to look at itself, there, what do we find? What do we see? And we might see layers of attitudes and reactions, opinions, preferences. But if those are there, then we haven't taken the backward step far enough back into that which is looking to the looking itself, to the awareness itself, in its simplicity. And in that simplicity, that is the place to rest. That's the place to then open up, to be aware of this world as we sit here meditating..............................................................
