There.
Okay, hello and welcome, everyone.
Lovely to see you.
See your faces on Zoom, feel your presence on YouTube, wherever you're joining from the world.
Lovely to be with you.
So for the practice for today, so many beautiful practices to choose from.
And many of you know that Diana and I were teaching a meta retreat last week online.
In fact, some of you were on the retreat.
Well, my CU here.
Hi.
Good to see you.
Good to practice with you.
So, so having sat really having been in a container of meta for one week, how nourishing it is.
And isn't also meta can shape shift into the other practices of compassion into vicarious joy, gratitude, equanimity, etc, etc.
And having led many different practices this past week and sat in them myself, what feels really resonant is the last practice that I invited folks to explore on the retreat, which is radiating, radiating meta over in the entire world.
It can be such a joyous practice, they can be likened to us feeling like Santa Claus, just giving gifts of kindness, gifts of kindness.
And if you think of if you remember a time that you have given gifts, just generously given gifts of kindness, how, how uplifting, how supportive for you that has felt to be giving gifts to just share your generosity here.
Here I am here is this being who is me just sharing your generosity, without any expectation for, for return for reciprocity just sharing sharing your generosity, your kindness, your gifts can be very joyful just it can fill our hearts with gladness and happiness.
And, and to say sometimes when people are do this practice of meta loving kindness for all beings.
Actually, let me just say one more word so so as you might recall we practice the instructions for meta loving kindness practice are gradual it's a gradual cultivation the concentric circle starting from where it's easy, moving out moving out including more and more expanding
and more and more and more. And then the final category of all beings just includes everything and everyone. This idea of radiating, radiating for everything, everyone and everything and sometimes when people do this practice.
They tune into and this can happen not just with meta for all beings but even meta for say dear person or even for ourselves when we're sharing loving kindness, and then our mind tunes into challenges into difficulty.
So if we're doing it for ourselves we get this oh but I'm having such a hard time. Oh, and then the practice of meta becomes a practice of compassion because it's meeting challenges.
Similarly, this practice, if we do it for someone who's near and dear to us a benefactor or dear friend, when meta loving kindness meets challenge, we feel oh they're going through a hard time.
First we're just practicing meta simply may you be safe may you be happy. No, no, may you be free from suffering. Oh, when kindness meets compassion when kindness meets suffering becomes compassion.
Similarly, some people sometimes tune into when they're trying to generate, you know, share their goodness with all beings everywhere.
Then suffering in the world comes up for them. They tune into the suffering like oh but so many people in the world are suffering so many animals.
Oh, then at that point the practice becomes a practice of compassion. It's not pure meta anymore because meta is when we're wishing loving kindness for neutral beings.
So at that point meta has shape shifted to compassion not to say it's a problem or it's wrong, not a problem, but just to recognize at that point oh your mind is tuning into the suffering. So the practice has become compassion which is okay.
And if you want to keep the practice as a meta practice for all the just wishing well, then tuning into just the gift, the gift of generosity of the meta and imagining beings who are new in a neutral situation they're not suffering.
Either are they really happy or not unhappy so that's the trick here to keep this practice in the channel of meta. Let's say advanced pointer. Just does that make sense give me a nod or thumbs up.
You're with me. Yeah, great.
So without further ado, let's practice. Let's, let's give our hearts to this practice.
So, so arriving in our bodies always starting with the body.
Starting landing in the body here.
Connecting with the breath. Connecting this breathing.
Sitting body. Turning our gaze inward.
The gift of this moment, the gift of this breath.
And if thoughts arise, not that there is anything wrong with thinking per se, but in this moment, return our hearts, return our hearts, return our attention.
Away from thinking. Thank you, not now. Please come back later thoughts.
Turning away, letting go. Gently, smilingly.
And turning towards, turning towards this breath.
Sensations of the body in this moment. Soothing, healing, nurturing.
Like a lullaby. And breath out, breath.
Breath out, breath out.
Can we be nourished?
Can we feel nourished?
Receiving the breath.
Just simplicity.
Can we be nourished?
Can we be nourished?
Can we be nourished?
Can we be nourished?
Can we be nourished?
Just this breath, just this moment.
Imagining as if the breath is entering and exiting through the middle of your chest, through the proverbial heart center with each breath.
Sense of kindness, friendliness is awakened on its own.
As if there is a fire, a holy fire in the middle of your chest, and the breath is bellowing.
Bellowing on the embers.
Feeling the warmth.
Maybe the image of a golden light works better for you, if not fire, it's okay, whatever works.
Each breath, this light, this golden light, golden orb of goodwill becomes brighter and brighter shining.
Gradiently, with warmth, with care, just appreciate, appreciating your inner goodness, trusting in your inner goodness, your power to care.
To be friendly and kind.
Just witnessing with each breath.
Letting this light, this warmth, this fire to be nourishing to you first, heating you up, radiating through your body.
To be friendly and kind.
To be friendly and kind.
To be friendly and kind.
And let yourself feel nourished, relaxing, resting, warmed by this glow, which is both yours and not yours.
You're acknowledging it as yours perhaps and yet.
It is, it is part of your buddha nature.
This goodness, this capacity is here.
You're just acknowledging it, helping it glow more brightly.
You're just acknowledging it as yours perhaps and yet.
You're just acknowledging it as yours perhaps and yet.
You're just acknowledging it as yours perhaps and yet.
You're just acknowledging it.
You're just acknowledging it.
You're just acknowledging it as yours perhaps and yet.
Let this practice be easeful, not effortful. You're not pushing it out.
Just acknowledging observing.
The warmth, the care, that's shining out, radiating out.
And first, it touches you.
Now letting it, acknowledging it, radiating outward.
Your whole body radiant, your whole body.
As a vessel of kindness, just because you exist in this world,
just because you breathe, kindness, goodwill can radiate out.
From your thoughts, your words, your actions in the world,
just as you're sitting from your thoughts of loving kindness,
from turning your mind, your heart towards kindness.
Goodness can radiate out in ways you can't imagine.
Let it flow, radiating outward in all directions.
The front radiating from your chest forward, your body forward.
Wow, amazing. You're right.
All beings who come in contact with this radiating metta,
feel gladness, feel your goodwill, feel your care.
May you be well, dear being.
You're human, the four-legged animal, flying,
beings, swimming beings, slithering, hopping, all beings,
to my friend, to my right side.
May you be well.
Let it be easeful, just resting in the sense of ease, contentment.
Let it radiate out, not pushing.
It radiates on its own. You just hold witness.
Extending all the beings behind you in that direction,
radiating, being radiated kindness backwards.
To your left, draped in light all around you,
shining out, kindness. May you be well.
Maybe simply using may you be well.
With the four phrases, if you wish, you'll be safe, happy, healthy, at ease.
And upwards, upwards, all the beings above you,
flying, orbiting, and all the beings below you,
insects, beings on the other side of the earth, all around you.
As if there are tiny Santa Clauses dispatched all around the globe.
All little, little tinker bells of light.
Blessing, sharing your kindness, all beings, may you be well, may you be well.
Sharing gifts of kindness.
If it helps, can bring some classes of beings to mind,
without it becoming too busy, maybe all babies, all human babies,
all over the globe, whatever, color, nationality, race, conditions there.
May you be well, may you be happy, all animal babies, all little kittens.
All calves, all baby birds, all young fish,
all baby spiders, you can have fun with this practice.
Cultivating, cultivating.
And this radiating of metta, remember you are included.
You are part of all beings.
And so are your dear beings, your friends, benefactors, family, people who are easy.
Love beings, all the people who are neutral in the world, you don't know them.
Also let the beings you have challenges with.
They're being included if it doesn't make the practice too challenging.
All beings everywhere.
Let it be joyous, a practice of generosity, with each breath.
May all beings be well, may all beings be happy.
Also if mind states, difficult mind states arise, boredom, irritability, irritation, let that be held with kindness.
Meeting all experience too, with kindness, with a smile.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Expansiveness of the heart, may all beings be well, may all beings be happy.
Expansive, unbounded, exalted.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Expansive, expansive.
Imagining perhaps all the beings around the world, all the two-legged beings, may all be well, all humans.
On so many different continents.
All the creatures of the sea.
May you be well, may all the creatures of the skies.
All the animals of the land. Whatever the size might be.
Make sure which medium or tall.
And now and then checking in to see what it feels like to be, radiating, wishing well for all beings.
Excluding none, whether there is a sense of more ease, contentment.
Just suddenly, maybe.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is the last moments of this practice period.
Acknowledging this radiance of metta is our true nature.
We're not creating it, fabricating.
It's already here. Just acknowledge.
And by acknowledging, we cultivate it to be more readily available.
Just letting, letting this goodness nourish us, as if we're sitting in it.
This light, this warmth, as if it's a big warm hug.
May I be well, may I be safe, happy, healthy.
May I have ease.
May all of this goodness flow through me, flow to others beyond me, through this vessel.
That is me.
May all beings be well.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be free.
Thank you for your practice everyone, dear Sangha.
Those on Zoom, those on YouTube joining us.
So, this can be a joyful practice.
Just giving gifts, letting it flow.
Let it shine. Let it shine.
Let your light shine.
We have some time for any reflections, what you might have observed.
And for the benefit of others, for the benefit of Sangha, we share our reflections, we offer it.
May it be of support. This is what I discovered. This is what opened up for me.
Or this is what I'm confused by. This is what didn't work.
Both for your benefit and benefit of others.
Invited to raise your Zoom hand if you'd like to share.
You can also type in chat. If typed to me alone, I won't read your name. You'll be private.
Reflection, if typed to everyone, then it will be a public reflection.
And I will read your name. So, any reflections, what did you discover?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Kalei, this says big thanks on YouTube. You are welcome. Thank you for joining in practicing.
Soo Jung, please.
Hi. I just want to thank you for lovely practice again.
It was just lovely to see you today. I've been missing you both for about a week, I guess.
Okay. So, I was so distracted by someone is cleaning my place right now.
So, go back and forth wearing the mask and back and forth.
I really try hard to be this present, but then I was not able to. I had to confess that.
So, at the same time, and I'm trying to just let go of controlling part again.
Like, oh, you know what? Did she clean this part? Did she did what I said?
So, just sitting here, I'm like, okay, let it be for 30 minutes and whatever it happens, just let it unfold and let it just let go of it.
But I'm actually inside of the room, small little room, and I'm thinking, you know, I'll just let go of it, whatever.
Yeah.
Great. Thanks for sharing that, Sujang. It's lovely to be back to see you and everyone, the Sangha.
I've missed you guys as well.
And what you're talking about, two reflections. One is regarding this letting go, the letting go, the letting go of control.
The letting go is also related to Mehta, because when we let go of control, there's a sense of offering generosity, offering gift, offering like, it's okay.
We're offering this gift of Mehta to ourselves when we're not like, ah, you know, holding tight.
Letting go, letting go. So that's one reflection that comes out, which I appreciate you're playing with this letting go.
Another one is when, when, with this other person or other doing what I asked them to do, et cetera, et cetera, you can include them in the Mehta.
You can include yourself in the Mehta in this practice, because it's all beings.
And the person who's cleaning, who's offering their service, their time can be very well included in that.
May you be well, may you be safe, may my thoughts of control, oh, just offering yourself kindness, so expanding, really directing this Mehta to whatever is arising in the space of awareness.
Does that make sense what I'm inviting you to play with?
Yeah, next time you can try that. Of course, letting go is lovely.
And yeah, it's beautiful.
Okay, so let her do whatever she has to do. I think that that's also my practice.
Yeah, because that's what you're essentially doing anyway. You're not getting up to go interrupt.
So you might as well offer her gift of Mehta in your heart, because you're actually doing it, but there's kind of a, you know, holding back a little bit, right?
Holding back the Mehta with doubt. Is she doing the right thing?
Or may she be while she's doing her best? Because you're not getting up to go interrupt anyway.
Might as well you're in this way, you're offering your own mind piece.
That's what I'm pointing out. By giving her Mehta, you're offering your own mind and heart piece.
That's what's beautiful about this practice. We think we're doing a favor to the other person, but actually we're doing ourselves a favor.
That's what I'm pointing out. Freeing your own heart up from like, oh, what's happening?
That makes sense. Thank you.
Yeah, and some reflections here.
Lovely meditation. Thanks. You're welcome. I love to generating the feelings of radiating love first before starting the words.
Ah, lovely.
Yeah.
Do you have any suggestions for if I find it really hard for me sometimes to believe that I have put a nature in me, like I feel like I've forgotten how to have a kind attitude.
I know I have it other times, but today it feels so distant. Yeah, I appreciate the question.
It's, I think, the last part that you say, I know I have it other times. That is the stepping stone, but you know you have it some other times.
Today it feels distant, so you trust that you have it. You land in that trust that it's available other times.
And that's enough. Just sitting with that. It will trust me. Just sitting with that. Yeah, I trust that it's available to me other times.
And then maybe even bringing to mind memory of times you have been kind, say to a friend or a child like, oh yeah, it's not so distant.
So bring the memory in and that helps rekindle.
Yeah.
Yeah, and reflection from someone who is on the retreat. So glad for this beautiful continuity.
It's really helping with the challenges of integration and missing being steeped into three jewels. Ah, that's very sweet.
So, so glad, Catherine, that you can join Papaya on YouTube and support the continuity.
And you can next time you can join on Zoom, because now we're going to be enjoying the third jewel of Sangha by speaking with each other in small communities and just spreading, spreading each other's kindness.
Receiving kindness and spreading kindness. And it's just very simple. It's not big.
It's just we all have it. We're all these candles or light orbs or shining bright suns, you know, whatever metaphor works for you tonight.
So with that, I would like to invite us as we get into the breakout rooms to start with 15 seconds of silent meta for each other, just silently holding each other with kindness.
And then then you can share as much or as little as you like about your practice.
Few words or just holding witness, listening to each other.
So, with that, I am going to open the rooms and here we go. I know we can have a little longer. Maybe we'll have like eight minutes, seven minutes tonight. Here we go. Enjoy.
Welcome back, everyone. Welcome back.
We have a couple of minutes for any reflections, what might have come up during either the practice, silently or in the group.
So, if you haven't shared, you're welcome to raise your hand or type in chat. What's up? What's up?
We're the benefit of all beings.
I see a lot of smiles. Ariana, please.
Well, I'll just, at least one other person in the meeting, we referred to the, or in the breakout group referred to this time as our reward at the end of a difficult day. So I wanted to thank you for that.
It was, so these are all, thank you.
Oh, thank you so much for sharing that. That is such a gift to hear, Ariana. Thank you. Thanks so much for sharing. Fred, I see your hand.
I want to be quick.
Sorry. Yeah, I was realizing during the meditation that earlier today a friend had asked me to help him on a project which I, which I, I'm skeptical that I can be very effective in helping.
But I, I could feel some of the, the muscles developed from this regular practice that allowed me to say, oh, yeah, what the hell, let's give it a try.
And I think that was, I think that's the source. So who knows it will work out, but it's, you know, better to try than to not.
Oh, that's sweet. Thanks for sharing that, Fred. It's the, the, the workings of this practice, how it manifests in the world, right?
In the way of, yeah, why not? I'm going to give, I'm going to try to help you. It may not work out, but I'm going to try to help you.
Beautiful is that, that muscle. Thanks so much for sharing that and, and allowing us me to hold witness in this beauty of this, this, um, yeah, manifestation in the world, the way it's showing up this practice, your practice.
Yay. We all celebrate together our practice and the seeds, the seeds that we plant and the way they, they show up.
And delighted that this is a reward because it's so sweet. It's so sweet to come together and practice a gift, really a gift at the end of the long, perhaps hard day. Yeah.
So with all that, thank you for your practice, dear ones, may you be well, may you be free, may you be happy and all beings everywhere.
Thank you.
And now I stop.
