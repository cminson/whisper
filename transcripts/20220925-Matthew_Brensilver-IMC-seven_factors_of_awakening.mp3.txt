 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome. So I don't usually do talks on lists. Sort of because I like how the lists interact with each other or the facets of the list interact with each other. But today, a talk on a list. And it's almost like we can get, we almost get too familiar with the list over time. I mean, when we're new, it's different. But as we practice over years, we sometimes get so familiar with Buddhist lists that we almost lose track of their brilliance. And I was talking to a friend, a colleague of mine, who said something like that she just basically assiduously followed the eightfold path deep into her practice, years into practice, just assiduously followed that, trying to implement that in all spheres of her life. And it changed everything. And that shouldn't have shocked me, kind of. But there was something about understanding her mind, the potency of her mind, and then just to say like, yeah, these kind of this list meant everything. And so in our own practice, we apply these, we pick up these themes, these teachings at greater depth and nuance, and they come to mean more and more to us over time. And what we hear in a list, the first time we hear it is so different from the hundredth time we hear it was really a different list. The Dharma generally revolves around what's to be let go, what's to be released. And the basic architecture of the view is that, in a sense, suffering is our only problem. That to relinquish suffering is not a trivial thing. And in its wake leaves just many species of goodness. It's not that we let go of suffering, and then we have to create some other kind of positivity. And so quite naturally, the attention goes to the untangling deconstruction of the sources of suffering. But then what is actively cultivated, what species of wholesomeness are actively cultivated? And one of those lists, what's actively cultivated, the goodness that helps us keep going, and sometimes celebrate as a kind of like the anti-hindrances, the seven factors of awakening. And so the Buddha says, I do not even see even one thing that when developed and cultivated leads to the abandoning of things that fetter so effectively as this, the seven factors of enlightenment. The seven factors are both a kind of the path and the fruit. It's often how these teachings are. They're both the path and the fruit, the practice and the culmination, the work that we do and the fruit that is harvest. And there's a story of the Buddha somewhere in the suttas being sick at night and asking one of his disciples to almost like as a kind of the feeling I had of like a kind of bedtime story. Yeah. Of Okunda bring to mind the seven factors of enlightenment, speak them to me in that state of sickness at night. In our practice, in meetings, practice discussions, interviews on retreat, for example, so much of the time there's some form of suffering that's being, some people are seeking consultation on one way or another. But what happens when they're not? What does the teacher do when there's no report of active course suffering? Mostly we just say, keep going. But sometimes, sometimes we say, let us examine, you know, like the, these seven factors to see the relative balance of the energizing side of practice and the tranquilizing side of practice. Because a lot of this path is a kind of, it's a kind of dialectic between, between different forces. A lot of this practice is a dialectic between the absence of suffering and the emergence of new currents of suffering, sometimes deeper layers, currents of suffering. So, this, these states are the, as we get more and more free, the mind states are increasingly characterized by a kind of some balance of these seven factors of, of mindfulness as a kind of balancing point of the energizing and tranquilizing factors of investigation, energy, effort, intense joy, rapture on the energizing side and tranquility, samadhi, the unification of mind and, and equanimity on the, the, the tranquilizing side. And, Saitātajānīya said something like the, the first, the first, it said something like mindfulness, investigation, energetic, vigor, effort. These are the causes and the others are the effects. Yeah. Which is an interesting formulation. They have complex relationships with each other. And so, in a way, we, even though the, the characterization of the tranquility fact aside as being the effects, yeah, not something we do, we sort of have to begin, you know, with a little bit of tranquility. Otherwise, there's no room to digest the impermanence, the impermanence and the imperfection of experience if there's no tranquility. Yeah. To try to let go, to try to open, to try to soften all of these things are very difficult to do in the absence of some modicum of tranquility. And so there, there's a lot of relations between these different facets in our, in our practice. So mindfulness, mindfulness is a word that's been used in so many ways. One of my mentors said, we just have to throw it out, you know, it's just been so, it's like a pocket into which so many things have been put that the word has sort of lost all meaning, integrity, something like this. And sometimes in fact, the way mindfulness is used is a kind of umbrella term for the seven factors. Yeah. If you actually hear the way it's used in popular culture, it's actually, it's not sati in the narrow kind of sense. A lot of other beautiful qualities are smuggled under in the back door kind of to this, this umbrella term of mindfulness. And I'm not blaming the wonderful John Kabat-Zinn for this, but John Kabat-Zinn did say this. Yeah. This is 2000, 2011. Said mindfulness-based stress reduction, which, which he has developed this eight week program that's been a tremendous blessing to many people. And my life no doubt is a function of the kind of efforts, his efforts and many others. Said mindfulness-based stress reduction was developed as one of a possibly infinite number of skillful means for bringing the Dharma into mainstream settings. It has never been about MBSR for its own sake. It's always been about the M and the M is a very big M. We use the word mindfulness intentionally as an umbrella term to describe our work and to link it explicitly with what I have always considered to be a universal Dharma that is co-extensive, if not identical with the teachings of the Buddha, the Buddha Dharma. That we do need a word. We do need a word to try to convey the depth and the beauty, the richness of the Dharma. And in this case, mindfulness was chosen. Yeah. And, and there are consequences, there are definitional consequences to that decision. Yeah. And so what do we mean when we say mindfulness? We can talk about it in these sort of more pared down ways or more grand ways. And in a sense to, for mindfulness to, to really, it's never been described as a single, it's always conjoined with other factors. Yeah. In the way that a big umbrella term kind of implies. And so I do actually link mindfulness with, with the kind of an awareness that lets go. An awareness that is just already conjoined with other factors. An awareness that is aware of the movements of suffering, of the movements of greed, of an aversion, but is uncompelled by them. That sense of like, I was alluding to this in the SIT sense that the, the awareness is a little bit bigger than the forces of suffering. And that when awareness is present, no matter what suffering is there, something else is also true. And it's a subtle move, this gesture of awareness, but it's radical. And sometimes it just, just, just that, that sense of knowing suffering in the clarity and the openness of awareness does not erase all of the unpleasantness or something. But it's enough that our life all of a sudden feels quite different than it did one moment ago when we were fully identified with the phenomena of suffering. And so we usually talk about mindfulness as a kind of what rescues us from our habits, particularly the bad habits. Yeah. The sense of that there's without some metacognitive awareness, we are just living in obedience to our habits. And that's fair enough, but mindfulness also becomes a habit and helps us develop good habits. And the sense of that we have often early in practice of like, okay, I'm going to leave here and I'm going to go have my day and I've got to be mindful. I got to remember that's not, that's not how it feels. I don't think as we continue practicing, it's not this sense of mindfulness is this, this, this kind of thing we like the, on the grocery list, like I have to remember carrots, you know, and you know, when you kind of do a bad shop, you know, sort of like get discombobulated or whatever. I can kind of feel it at the register. Like I just, I messed up, you know, I'm forgetting a lot, you know, like, and we have this sense of like, oh yeah, I could just keep forgetting the mindfulness or something like this. And it's okay to try to motivate like explicit cognitive control or something, but to some extent, what we are actually training in is the elevating the trait level of mindfulness, the mindfulness that exists in the way a habit exists. Yeah. That we actually don't have to remember in the same way that we're more mindful when we're not trying to be mindful. And that's important because we'll never be able to remember enough consciously. Yeah. Yeah. And then there is the investigation, which is of course enabled by mindfulness and investigation, investigation to me not, not about some X kind of top down cognitively trying to figure something out, trying to figure out, like, investigation and rumination the line is thin, you know Like how did I get here? Why do I feel this way? Where am I going and those questions can kind of like masquerade as deep? existential inquiries, but they're actually have a kind of ruminative obsessive feel to them and an investigation is not kind of loosely looking for some Answer out of the ether or something. It's a kind of sustained attention to the the unfolding of experience the connection between moments and I associated a lot with curiosity which is really kind of the lifeblood of this practice. I Don't know where that where if that's in a list somewhere in you know, but I You know Investigation is like very closely linked to curiosity and the truth is there's no Cure for a lack of curiosity and there's nothing a teacher can say To keep you engaged unless you find something that you get interested in Like I want to understand this. I Want to know why I keep doing this. I Want to know? Some facet of my mind I want to understand something and In a sense when there's curiosity present because it's so agenda list It's not like I want to get happier even It's like a very deeply trustworthy intention for animating practice. I Want to understand more and there's a kind of patience in it And there's a kind of patience in it And There's a Sense of It's not even the point to get to some answer. There's like no final answer there's just deepening and refining and nuance and and more curiosity and We find our kind of cruising altitude in our Autobiographical story of who we are of what we are of what the path is of where we're going of what happiness is and Then that rug will be pulled out Before too long hopefully yeah, and that ignites a kind of new Sense of curiosity a new round where we're no longer satisfied with the stories we've been Feeding ourselves The somewhere the Buddha says that we have four options when in pain blame self blame others despair or investigate Yeah, that's not a hard multiple choice question It's like okay, what is happening here and we do develop a kind of Faith really in the looking a faith Not that everything's okay or anything like that but a faith that maybe We just say a faith in wisdom Faith in love a faith that the more deeply we look The more Dharma we will find the more the more the deep more deeply we look the more reason there will be to to love And so we're not so afraid of what we'll find Energy very uh This is among the most emphasized themes in the suttas and I Think because this path is against the stream Genuinely against the stream in some ways it's with the stream in other ways. It's against the stream and it's against the stream in the sense that Neurosis is often the path of least resistance. Yeah, like my neurosis is Just like so happily floating down a stream, you know Strong current at my back, you know, like a Gil has they in some of the way talks about Satya Patan I think I picked I remember slides from Gil where it's somebody coasting down The water just relax the effortless of mindfulness. That's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about the the stream of neurosis where it takes zero energy for me to act it out right and we all know those moments where it's like for sure like the easiest thing to do right now the absolute easiest thing to do is To express the forces of suffering and my own bad habits, you know right So, what are we gonna do? Yeah What are we gonna do we're going to mobilize energy effort Sometimes not always sometimes we really are in the stream of goodness and The goodness and the awareness and everything feels effortless But that's often a function of prior effort, yeah and so we marshal our energy because growth is Hard it takes energy, you know, it's like when kids going through a growth spurt and they have to like really rest or something it's like that and So we're we marshal some effort in order not to Obey the dictates of greed hatred and delusion and This path is a It's a renunciate path in the sense that it is not a something for nothing path and sometimes we get the sense that just because Oh The awareness is is so powerful and that the most simple gesture of it Can sometimes bring incredible relief we get the sense that maybe maybe If I'm making effort I must be doing it wrong it is we have some sense that The lure of something for nothing You know is deep in us but But it's not we are We're not giving up things for no reason. We're giving up lesser forms of pleasure for deeper forms of satiation And And and Rapture Rapture a rapture born of letting go doing really badly on time here Hmm Yeah, sometimes Sometimes this is this is translated as as Joy, but it's sort of more and we want to make the definition accessible But it's more energetic than that more effervescent than that more compelling a kind of like just the the attention just sucked into the flow of this and Because it's so normally our thoughts are the most prominent thing and experience by far by far, but That can change and a sense of of PT Rapture that becomes More compelling than anything else and this usually experience usually pleasant, but sometimes not pleasant and At some point even that you know as unimaginable as that might be rapturous pleasure Isn't that why I'm here isn't that what I'm in? In you know why I'm doing all this letting go and whatever, you know for rapturous pleasure even that gets old. Yeah even that gets old, but it is significant insofar as It does confirm That this path is not a con Yeah, it's not another shell game and when we start to see like I didn't know That I could feel this way I didn't know that I could settle into the moment in this kind of rapturous way You're like, okay this induces faith and it's a sense of like There's something here for me and the power we actually sometimes for some people it's the first deep glimpse of the power of our mind which we have underestimated forever This kind of delight is said to give way to a Calm yeah, which is a little bit the reverse what we think about we think we get calm In order to then become happier, but here is kind of reverse its happiness And then we get calm we get settled we get focused we get it, you know But but calm This pivot to the tranquilizing side of the path and The way is in which our nervous system is just longing to be unstimulated Just longing to be unstimulated We think we're always looking for pleasure or something But we're usually looking for pleasure to balance out the intensity of something else and peace And peace this tranquility maybe the beginning of that is In a sense our deepest longing I almost think of it as the nervous system longing for the Dharma to be at peace it is As far as I can tell the only thing that does not Fatigue the heart peace And so To begin to settle to begin to settle to find ways of breathing to find signs anchors ways of attending that bring some measure of tranquility and is necessary in order in Order to do the work of letting go, you know, it's like if we're trying to Trying to to let go and open to experience from a very Untranquile state it just feels like it makes our mind more brittle There's no more space. It's filling a cup that's already overflowing So we learn ways of Bringing in some calm and over all the years of practice now it it's almost like even no matter what's happening in my mind my there's like such deep associations with the posture and with the sense of the The breath and the sense of gravity that something you know it's like this kind of cue that just induces a measure of tranquility and Then there's more room to bear with the imperfection of samsara When There is Tranquility less agitation there's less of a kind of Searching and foraging for for food for the mind to medicate our agitation Yeah, that sense of like where we're often kind of just scanning the realm of our own thought world as a way to To medicate to medicate the the sense of Threat and the sense that of unacquired opportunity and so This tranquility when that begins to settle when there are not alarm bells going off in our system moment by moment What else is there to do other than just pay some attention? And so we settle into to Samadhi to the kind of unification of the mind and And Samadhi linked of course with Joe rapture rapturous joy Samadhi is what What turns the Dharma into something more than a philosophy? Yeah The Dharma is really it's a good philosophy But it won't save us as a philosophy and then we have to it has to become real Yeah Has to become real Has to be be realized. Yeah which which Yeah, when Credit literary critic, you know Eve Sedgwick said like oh, yeah The difference between knowledge and realization is in realization something becomes real as real as this very room and For the Dharma to become real it it requires some measure of Samadhi Otherwise it's just kind of a A peeling set of ideas that we sort of clumsily try to apply to our life but until we actually start to hear the Dharma from a place of unification of steadiness it's It's not so useful And so we we come into Alignment it feels like all the all the Pieces and parts of us all the sudden start moving in the same direction and the kind of ambivalence and the sense of being for the fragmentation of the self Just recedes and we are all all of us is moving in one direction It feels more and more natural just to rest the attention with what we decide is relevant And We get so So We kind of use the Level of discursive thinking as the barometer for our Samadhi and for our practice Generally, we sort of take the surface layer of the mind very seriously and we use that to measure how still we are But the truth is there are processes of stillness that happen outside of the the realm of discursive thought and that's why When people have been sitting in retreat for example For a few days or a couple weeks as have people have been at insight retreat center now. Yeah Even if their minds are Still florid with thought There's a deepening that's happening as some kind of silence Is setting in and I associate Samadhi with the unification of mind but also with the plasticity of mind the its sense of depth and This it's it's how deeply impressionable it becomes Yeah, and so the mind the the mind that is Stabilized is a very is a deeply impressionable mind and whatever We learn under the conditions of Samadhi has legs Yeah, the insights that we gather the understandings that we cultivate The realizations that we have under conditions of Samadhi that has legs it stays with us we all know the sense of The the light of some insight or some understanding fading over time insight developed under under conditions of the Unification under conditions of Samadhi have legs. Yeah stays And In In In the experience of Samadhi of pete the of the kind of Delight of every part of us moving in the same direction We We Have a kind of the the movement of the heart is not towards the intensity of pleasure but towards the neutrality of of of equanimity of a kind of The the heart mind like utterly unstimulated by the unstimulated by the winds of phenomena Sense of something in us is the longing to be unstimulated by the winds of phenomena and we This is as a pecka equanimity deepens there's a sense of At Least first it's a sense not of the absence of preferences But the absence of the compulsion to enact our preferences That distinction makes sense the so it's not that that there isn't preference But the sense of like the compulsion to bring our preferences into being To make something happen and all of the agitation and strategizing Requiring to bring clinging to fruition that starts to fade And But in that process Something in us is being softened it's like I think I said something like the calesas Or softening or hard or something like that, which is a weird Formulation and I'm not even sure it makes sense, but That's how it kind of feels to me. It's like the forces of clinging When they're met in the the kind of openness of equanimity, it feels like something is being softened One of my teachers said One of my teachers and young called equanimity the primary cathartic factor of mindfulness Yeah of the path the primary cathartic factor is being a loo alluding to the sense of Of release that happens the softening that happens when when the when the forces of clinging Actually soften rather than harden our heart Harden our heart I think it said that equanimity when it really ripens is the The closest approximation of awakening But the amidst this like radical okayness This non interference with all phenomena with the winds of samsara we don't actually lose the poignancy of our life of life itself the poignancy of of suffering the suffering world Love is only a kind of stones throw away from peace and The mind that is that is stable that is tranquilized that is gathered that is a quantum as Just just one Kind of drop of love flavors everything So I offer this for your consideration yeah and Seven factors yeah So may they May they be the practice may they be the fruit yeah and Yeah, please pick up whatever is useful here and ignore the rest Yeah, I think for real you know you this pays your path and you have to be the the kind of judge of what is what is useful and you sort of test things out and You see yeah, you're patient patient, but you test them out and and This is the way our path unfolds in our very idiosyncratic way So so thank you thank you for your attention and thank you to the crew on YouTube and to you Martha Kevin yeah, thanks for say hi to them for me, okay chat chat them They know they should still be able to hear me, but thank you Kevin Okay folks you you be well and yeah, we'll see you see around the Dharma campus somewhere See you see around the Dharma campus somewhere
