 So, I'm very glad to be here. I really appreciate this Sangha, Gil Sangha. There's a particular quality that I find here which is very touching. You can feel a sense of community, a sense of people working together as a community. That's very special. I'm also part of a community. It's not such a well-known community. I've been a non-Audéne in 1979, nearly 24 years ago. I became a non-Audéne at that time, 25 years ago. It was quite an extraordinary experiment. We were all little kind of guinea pigs just experimenting, bringing a traditional community to the West with what it entails when you bring East and West together. Monasticism versus a very lay-orientated community, society, especially in England where the monastery were burnt several centuries before our centuries. So, it was an interesting experiment. So, tonight, the little time I have, I thought I will speak to you a little bit about the life of a nun and what it is to live in a monastic life and what is a monastic community. I haven't spoken about this very much over the last two years I've been around here. I thought to myself, interesting, perhaps. Let's see what happens. People sometimes ask me, how did you become a nun? I say something which makes them laugh because I always think that I only realised three years after Audéne that I really had become a nun. Only because the reason why I Audéne was that I was interested. I had met Achen Sumedhu who I did not consider particularly as my teacher because I was like many of you who spent many years trying to cultivate a kind of spiritual independence, not wanting anybody to tell us what to do and not wanting to depend on anyone. So, I did not want to admit that neither of us are a Buddhist nun nor did I have a teacher for quite a number of years. I was just very keen on meditation and realised after having been a dancer for many years and trained as a dancer, I was used to a strong discipline and a strong training. Suddenly, after 32 years, really, I realised I had a mind. I had never been trained. I had a body. I had been very well trained. But my mind really, I didn't even know I had a mind. Like many of you, we spent many years wondering why life is this way or that way, why we have certain circumstances that seem to follow us around and suddenly we turn around and we realise we have a mind that seems to be the culprit of it all. So, this is really what interested me at the time. Suddenly, I realised there was a whole vast field of training, understanding, and that became a great joy in my life when there was suddenly this vast vista in front of me of possibilities. And I wasn't 32. Of course, at 32, like most of you, you feel like you're very old already, don't you? You've done it all, you know, and there's nothing left to do really, except becoming wise. So, this was my agenda. I was kind of getting some wisdom by the age of 31. I thought the next 20 years, I'd just like to develop a few skillful means that's going to help me to live a little bit better and to grow as a better person. So, I had a good fortune to meet Achean Sumedho whilst I was studying at university where my ex-husband was a university professor there. And he visited the students because one of the students at university had been a monk with Ajahn Shah for three years and he was also a student of my ex-husband. And so, he started the Buddhist Society and invited Achean Sumedho and that's how I got to know him. And I heard him speak about his life as a monk in Thailand and lo and behold, I thought, my God, this is a life I've been looking for, even though I didn't want to be a nun particularly. But I felt the lifestyle that he was describing had an amazing kind of, he just kind of, in a way, encapsulated the way I wanted to deal with my own energy, with my own mind, because he was describing a very simple way of life which made use of the brain and used one's intelligence, one's wisdom, and at the same time seemed to go in the direction of simplicity, contentment, and happiness. And I thought, that's just what I want to have in my life. I don't want to become a brainless, vegetable-like person living in the countryside. I was a city girl, a metropolitan girl more. So I wanted to live, I just wanted to have a kind of interesting life, but also I felt the need to simplify it. And so what he was describing, even the idea of getting up early in the jungle of Thailand that he was talking about at the time, seemed very appealing. I did not particularly want to Thailand, nor did I want to live in the jungle. But I couldn't understand the spirit. I just got a sense of what that meant, the letting go of so many identities that we carry around, when we have to live in society, a culture that makes a lot of demands on us, makes a lot of pressure, you know, inflict a lot of pressures on us to be a certain way. So the idea of just dropping one's identity, even if it was to get another one, but at least it was one that was completely committed to the path of letting go and liberation, was very attractive, and the path of truth. So eventually that brought me to Chetas monastery, even though I had no intention to ordain whatsoever, but the jokes in my community is that, Ajahn Sundar I came down for a cup of tea and never left. And this is true. It's just the way it happened, really. It wasn't that I just came down for the cup of tea and planned to become a nun. It's just that some insight arose as I was meeting Ajahn Sumedho and talking with him, which made me feel that suddenly I was in charge of my own life and was able to do what I wanted. Basically, I was responsible. I could stay there or not, but it was not that I had choices. The insight that I got at the time was the fact that I became, felt a sense of freedom and the sense that I had choices. I could do whatever I wanted to follow the path of truth. I could be a layperson. I could be a monastic. Whichever way I went was okay, kind of thing. Certainly, I had no intention to stay. But you see what happened to insight, particularly the one that you hardly noticed, are very powerful. And suddenly I found myself actually staying at the monastery without really having fully decided. But I felt really still at home with the whole situation there. It wasn't even the situation because the countryside was in particular. I mean, I was very attracted to the countryside, but it was not something that I felt I had to spend my whole life there. But it was just more, it was something much deeper. The sense of commitment of the people living there was something so moving and so touching. That kind of total commitment to something that was so founded in the path of truth, in the path of liberation, in the path of something. It's a kind of respect for life, a deep profound respect for our humanness. That it really drew me. It's like it drew my heart, like a bee's on honey. It just attracted me beyond my control almost. Even though my self-identity wasn't particularly in it, but there was this pool and attraction to a commitment that I was not even aware of at the time. So I stayed. And people tend to think that monastic life is a life of peace and a life of ease and relaxation. And we're all sitting on our little kind of fluffy pink cushion waiting for Nibbana to kind of dawn on us eventually. As we sit and sit and sit with a smile on our face and lots of just eating and drinking, sitting and just merely waiting for Nibbana. That's often people say, oh, do you mean you have anger? Do you mean you doubt? Do you mean you get upset about things? As if monks and nuns turned into sunnilys as kind of marble smiling Buddha that was just completely cut off from reality. Just had completely free from problems, issues, difficulties, pain and all the rest of it. Well, this is why I thought I will talk to you a little bit more about the monastic life. So I would dispel a few illusions, you know. So when I came to the monastery, I ended up living in a small cottage about 15 minutes from the main house, which by the way, this house came about because the English Sangatras, which was a foundation in England, which existed for a number of decades. And its purpose was to invite monks from Asia and host them whatever teaching. Eventually, Ajahn Sumedhu came across them and they said, he's a guy. That's him who we want. And so the president of this trust went with Ajahn Sumedhu to Thailand to ask permission if Ajahn Sumedhu could come back to England and start a monastic community. So we don't think we do think very thoroughly in this tradition. Ajahn Sumedhu went all the way back to England to check out whether the place was suitable for forest monks to live there. You know, busy, urban place. London, the house was on a busy street with several pubs across the road. And so, but Ajahn Sumedhu said it was a suitable place. It was good for, you know, it was good enough for monks to train and to start cultivating the, continuing to cultivate the dharma in an urban situation. That's how it all began. And the house of Chittest came about when one of the joggers that they used to meet in Hampstead Heath in London, who they met regularly, one day offered them a forest in West Sussex, about two hours from London. He had inherited this forest and he felt he could not take care of it himself. And so that the Buddhist monks were the ideal people to take responsibility for this forest. That's how it all began. So the president of this trust went down to check out whether the forest existed or not. And find that about 15 minutes walk from this forest, there was a great big house on sale with another property, a huge mansion. And there it was, you know, on sale. So it wasn't, there had been several offers with a much higher price, but the owner somehow gave the chance to this man to buy the house with less money. That was a good sign. So they moved to that place, which was a complete chaos because it had been owned by a man who had a driving schools. And it was an old couple by then. And they had just dumped all the cars that were not working anymore in the garden, in the most beautiful garden. And the house itself had piles of newspaper and beers and wine bottle in every room, almost up to the ceiling. And this is England, remember? People do like old things, including their buses and taxis and, you know, and other things. Not like in America, where we like things that kind of keep changing, that keeps moving. So that's how the community started, you know, and there was only a few monks, maybe four or five monks. And what capital of lay women turned up and wanted to ordain was in that very same summer, I turned up too. Let's say within three months, four of us arrived at Chittor's, four women. There were already five monks there. And me, we didn't have much intention to ordain. You know, I still was wearing my kind of lay clothes and being French. You know what that means? You know, we like to dress well and to kind of, we spend a lot of time looking good, you know. So the idea of suddenly shaving my head and, you know, wearing a kind of sheets around me was in particular appealing, especially white. I hated white, you know, I hated white. So after three weeks, you know, Afton Sumedus said, well, I think if you want to all stay here, it will be good if you took the eight precepts, which we did. We had a wonderful ceremony and we were given names. My name before was Francois, that's a French name, and I was given the name Sundara. And as soon as I arrived at Chittor's and met the three women I was going to live with for many years, I realized I had just met the three women I had avoided all my life. You think it's easy, isn't it? I had been used to refine environments, you know, candles, sticks for supper, rock music in the background, all the rest of it. And I found myself in a kind of dump and a kind of building site for the next five years. You know, places being kind of gutted, you know, from top to bottom, and people working a lot and having to learn to paint, which I hated the first six months. I used to want to throw my paint brushes every time I had painted, kind of constant washing them. I didn't come from a handy family, so I did not know. I wasn't practical at all. I had to drill holes in walls, you know, to do a dump course in our little cottage in the monastery. I had to learn to wallpaper. I had to learn to cook for 25 people, 30 people. I'd never been a happy cook in my life, you know. I tended to go to restaurants as much as I could. And, you know, all that sort of thing. So there was a lot of challenges, right from the beginning. All the monks had come from the jungle of Thailand, you know, they all looked like, you know, kind of tough and, you know, well, not the academic world that came from, you know. They were all the hippies, you know, that had been on the road for years, you know. They ended up in Thailand and trying to look almost like those tough meditation masters, you know, like, really, you know, tough look, you know. And I like to smile and be charming, you know, and kind of enjoy life and, you know, have an easy going time. So there I was, you know, walking in the dark at 4 o'clock in the morning to get up to my puja at 5, which is the main community's place. Going down at 9.30, 10 o'clock, you know, 15 minutes walk down a very isolated country lane in that small little cottage, which was very pretty, but still also needed a lot of work. And we spent five years there. I spent five years in that environment. After five years, after four years, three or four years, our teacher decided that because those women who were living there were very committed and truly interested in the monastic life and the training, he offered us an ordination, which is the one I have, which is a new ordination in Thailand that does not exist. He asked the elders in Thailand to give permission to establish a new ordination for women, which gave them a training, which gave us a training over a period of years. This training was kind of got established very close to the bhikkhuni training of the ancient order of monastic order of women in the time of the Buddha. So thanks to Ajahn Sacheeto, who was quote unquote our mother superior for five, six years, and to my teacher, we got eventually a very good training, which helped us to train as almsmandikant women, which was completely a new thing in the west, in the east also. There are very few nuns ordained and living the life of an almsmandikant, which means not really holding money, having control over money. And this is a life I've led now for over 20 years. And so we've had a lot of interesting time. You know, the house itself was an extraordinary challenge. You know, people thought we were Ari Krishna. We were, you know, all sorts of, it was, we were part of the stockbroker belt of London, which was this very beautiful area. And just happened to, we just happened to be there because originally the monks, Ajahn Sacheeto and the trust, the English sangetros was looking towards wells where the land is very cheap. But somehow this house came up, the forest was given, and then we ended up in a stockbroker belt, one of the richest parts of England. So you can imagine what that did to the environment there, you know, this kind of, a lot of aristocratic people around, lots of upper class people around. And I remember Ajahn Sache spent a few, a little bit of time there before you went back to Thailand when you first got established and they had a meeting in the village hall. So they could meet the people living in the environment closely and explain to them, to the local people what they were up to. And it was wonderful because one of the, the president of the trust had a very good friend who worked for the BBC. And there was a video that was made very early on, right? So almost as soon as he arrived, there was a video made called the Buddha Comes to Sussex, which you can see from Abhayagiri. You can see, you can, you can get this video if you want to. And in this video, you see the whole scene in the village hall where you have a whole kind of range of people from the farmers to the aristocratic, the royals to the upper class, the upper middle class and so on, you know, a whole range of people. And you have one person that somebody at some point who say, well, if you guys can get a free meal once a day, well, good luck for you kind of thing. Other people were expressing all sorts of doubts and anxiety and, you know, and, but English people are generally very polite and very courteous and also friendly. So very, they're very respectful of human people, you know, so they're very polite and respectful. So that, that helps. So I can't go into a lot of details because timer is running, but we eventually cheaters was established and became is now almost part of the establishment of what our Sussex, you know, people come to anybody is goes to cheaters and it's like really the very respected monastery and for by anyone around the area. In fact, down the bottom of our field, we have somebody called Sarah mouse, probably one of you, some of you may know her. She was a very famous. She's still very famous actors. She was, I think, Brian, Ryan's daughter or something. Yes. So she lives just on the road, just just on the field. She's our neighbors, you know, and she's very happy to live there, you know, very good friend of our community. And so over the years, our nuns community grew and by four years later, we are eight nuns and I can submit it was looking for a larger place. So there will be to accommodate the larger community of nuns and also lay people. There was an extreme interest in this community. And by then it was beginning to be a little bit known. There's been a number of articles in fairly new newspaper and so on. And in fact, two weeks after we ordained, I don't know if anybody, anyone of you knows England, but there's a magazine called Women's Own, which is like a rule sort of, I don't know. I can't really explain. It's sort of, it's very ordinary magazines, really kind of, you will never imagine a journalist coming to interview Buddhist nuns, you know, but we got two weeks after we ordained, we got a journalist from Women's Own, very violent magazine in England. But kind of you'll find it more in the kitchen table of a kind of working class family, you know, not particularly educated or anything like that. But there we are. We were interviewed and got an article in there. And so eventually, you know, Amarawati was established in 1984. So we started in 79, the cheddar 1984 after a year after I had been ordained as a 10 precepts nun. And we went to Amarawati, the nuns went to Amarawati on foot. We decided that we wanted to follow the tradition of moving from one monastery to another on foot, following the ancient tradition of the Buddhist monks and nuns of the Buddhist time. So we spent three weeks walking from Chetters to Amarawati on foot with our rucksack and people came to offer the meal during the day from all over the place. It was quite magic. We managed to have a few adventures. We got arrested three times in one day at some point, accused of arson, held back at the police station for three hours questioned on the way we were on our way to stay with a man called John Coleman, who is an American, a well known meditation teacher, our next CIA. So you could see how we could have been in trouble. But we finally, just in the kind of gentleman fashion of England customs, the policeman finally drove us right back to where they had picked us up, picked us up. And then the next day we ended up in a monastery where they took us for young monks. And when they realized we were nuns, not so young, they were completely shocked and wondered what they should do with us. Eventually the old habit, long bearded habit, long sort of typical old wise man look, the old wise man look, invited us to stay in a place called the monks garden in their huge park they had, which was so beautiful. It was actually they lived in the house which had been the palace of Russian princes. See what monastery are like in England. And so we spend the night there in this. We find that later when we met Christian nuns who lived near Marawati, that she knew very well this place they had had conferences and so on and she was absolutely amazed that nuns had stayed there because none of the Christian nuns ever stayed there. I was just a mistake but we made history. So eventually we arrive at Chet Haast and it was also interesting at the time. I mean it's pretty pretty kind of gruesome story. But at the time there was a person in England called the Fox who was terrorizing the population. He was raping and doing all sorts of inflicting the most horrendous treatment to people of a sexual nature. And before we left, I still remember on the national newspaper there was a photograph of women with a gun saying the women of St. Margaret's are waiting for the Fox. And those women of St. Margaret's Lane was exactly what Marawati was. Just a little a little footnote. So that was interesting. A chance to me to told us he was very anxious all the way all throughout pilgrimage. Of course we carried Buddha relics and so on. And it was quite a beautiful time. It was in July and beautiful weather. And eventually we arrive at Marawati which was you know by the time we left Chet Haast, Chet Haast was the most beautiful house. No Victorian house and which had been renovated by the community. Our cottage also had been renovated. Everything looked beautiful and there we had to go. So talking about letting go, not attaching, you know we worked really hard for it. We made it beautiful and now we were invited to move on. And I just made it and said, oh, isn't it nice. We move moving to the next place and there's no work to do. So we all kind of. Then we arrived there and within within a few weeks we find that there were 600 windows that needed repair. So there we were for the next three years working on repairing windows. And we were very thorough because we had lots of time where we could do it very well. So I learned all about repairing all the windows from scratch. You know, you scrape the paint, you fill up the holes, you put the primer and then you put the second one coat and then second coat and those sanding for hours and all that. Three years of that almost daily. Beside being the guest nun, the senior nun and all that, you know. Still, since the Chito our mother's superior used to be kind of looked almost proud when people were looking for the senior nun and I would arrive with this kind of, you know, with this kind of close covered in paint and dirt and with a paint brush on one side and it was there. This is our senior nun, you know, it almost kind of. To see she's somebody, you know. And so we arrived at Chito's. She's a Morawati. Morawati was an old school, an old boarding school for children who had learning difficulties. So we saw that was an appropriate place for us to. Being so thick headed, you know, as we discovered in the practice, how stubborn we can be hanging on to our ignorance, you know. And we we arrived at Amara Wati and Amara Wati, as I said, needed a lot of work beside the fact that it used to be a school. And so because it was part of a state school, it could spend as much money as it wanted on the heating system, which was absolutely amazing. Very, very, very, you know, very expensive heating bills with the system they had. So what we could not afford it. And we decided not to use this central heating and for two years and to just use, you know, the heater we had. We had a wood stove in the nuns area with a French wood stove we would call the baby monster because he used to eat up logs about that long, that thick and about 10 of them in there. And of course, all the nuns had to kind of log it in, you know, we broke our back. I mean, most of us got ruined our back through that. We had to get up at three o'clock in the morning to get a whiff of heat at four o'clock, four thirty. And it happened that those two, nine eighty four and eighty five were the coldest winters of the century in England. So the monk still speaks about finding ice on their glass of water that they put on the side of their bed the night before. And we did to twelve degree, which is about maybe 40 degrees, 40 degrees, 45 degrees, but the highest temperature I got in my room at the time, you know. And that was only a few hours a day. The rest of the time in the winter time, it was more like 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you know. So, you know, this is what we went through, you know. And so people say, oh, you must have such a nice life, you know, just just just just not having to pay the bill, not having to do any work, not having to do what a wonderful thing. I love to be a nun too, you know, and I love to be a monk, you know, it's so nice. Just such a simple life, you know. And so we continued and eventually we finished the windows after three years and, you know, and then, you know, and then we and then the community's life. I mean, this is not to mention the dynamic of a community living with 30, 40 people. They all get on your nerves at some point 10 times a day. They step on your feet at the wrong time. This is the wrong word at the wrong time. This is the right word at the wrong time, you know. This is the wrong word at the right time. It's just kind of irritating kind of interaction. And so this is the life of monastics, you know. Our mother superior had never been a mother superior before. In fact, he'd been a hippie for many years and traveled the world and played guitars and was very bright mind and intelligent and a band, a strong band on asceticism. He loved wiping the snow off the toilet bowl. The ice, you know. And we ended up with Adjuncthichito was probably one of the toughest monk I've ever met. You know, very tough, very ascetic by nature. And there he had, got in charge, he was in charge of 12 women. Strong, independent, powerful. And, you know, so we had a very interesting training with him. Eventually we won't go into the details. It's probably better left unsaid. But we recognize that after a number of years, the result was quite interesting, you know, because he certainly softened, became a lot more gentle. And he helped us to be absolutely, you know, very, you know, to really live by very high standard. And he was not a, he's known for having been chosen because he was the only monk who could withstand the nonce tears. So whenever we cried, he would just sit there completely un... And we recognize later on that I think he was just going through terror. Because he did have any clue what to do with the women crying. And when he had 12 of them doing that at one time or another, then he had a very quick learning into handling women. A crash course. And so eventually you realize that women crying wasn't a problem. And when he got educated enough in handling women's monastics and not binding us crying, then it was, you know, very much easier. In fact, monks have to cry also many times, you know, in their life to go through the training. You know, Jan-Che said, unless you can try, you cry three times in your training, you haven't even started. You haven't really done what it takes to train. You have to come to that point of utter despair, you know, when you really are completely pushed against the wall and you don't know where to go anymore to realize some deeper aspect of the training, you know. Because the training itself is really letting go of the ego. And the ego is very frightened. It's a very frightened congromer- it's a conglomeration of fears and a lot of unskillful desires. And fears particularly. So you have to go through fear, you know, in the training. You have to go through feeling dejected, rejected, abandoned, hated, unloved, alone, lonely, despairing. All the worst things that we dread to experience, you know, the worst mental states, those who would do anything to run away from. You explain that in monastic life in a very intensive way. And of course because we do this training voluntarily, you know, because we're all there by choice, then the commitment is strong enough to pull you through those moments, you know, when you can actually go through. There is time, you know, where you spend- people in the early years said to Achend Samedo, you know, this will never work in the West. You need a pair of jeans and you need money here. Never work. By devoted Buddhists, you know, not any old body, by people who actually been practicing, at least more in the kind of what we call- we call in England the armchair's Buddhist, which means they used to read a lot, but not really practice much. And so Achend Samedo said, well, maybe so, but why don't we try, give it a try and see what happens. And Achend Samedo had asked Achend Samedo, you know, said to Achend Samedo after he inquired with Achend Samedo, you know, how could he live in the West as an arm's man, you know, when nobody is Buddhist, nobody knows what to do with a Buddhist monk. You know, in Thailand when they see a Buddhist monk, their eyes lit up, they go in Angeli, they have complete confidence in the person they see and they want to give everything, especially if he's a good monk, they will just give anything. People give BMW in Thailand, you know, just after listening to a talk. Of a teacher who maybe gave a talk that inspired them, some people will come and say, I want to give you a BMW for the monastery. I'm so inspired by what you said. That's the kind of faith that the Thai people have, you know, just quite amazing. And they're not that rich, you know, BMW means a lot for them, you know. People have given Mercedes, brand new Mercedes to what? Nombapong to Agin Shah's monastery, to a monk who couldn't care less about Mercedes, who is probably the most humble monk you ever met, who just couldn't care less about material possessions. And there he is. He's got a Mercedes in the monastery and he's got a driver too, who's driving him around, you know. So you get that kind of thing, you know, people will give you things, people build houses in Bangkok just for the monks to have a place to live, you know. And a servant will just go and offer food whenever they come, you know. Just that kind of incredible surge of love and faith and interest, you know, in monastics and monks and sometimes nuns, you know, nuns have got another, you know, it's another situation. I'll talk to you about this next year, if I come back, you know. But I spent actually two years and two and a half years in Thailand and I was basically, I could say I had a red carpet wherever I went. I was incredibly well supported. I had a lot of respect from people generally. And I lived truly as an alms mendicant in the forest, you know, I went on Pindapat. First year I was there, I could go Pindapat every day. It was my little alms ball alone in the countryside. My teacher gave me a little route I could go to. He talked to his disciples and I had a few houses. I'd go alms around and come back to the monastery, you know. So that was a very special time because not many nuns would go on Pindapat, even though that's more and more the case now in Thailand, you know, the nuns are much more empowered these days. Because a number of very educated women are turning to become nuns and starting their own nunnery, their own dhamma center and so on, you know. I went in Pindapat in Bangkok. I went in the slums of Bangkok. I actually received alms food from slum people, you know, really slum, you know, with a nun who's a good friend and who has a dhamma center. She's been in the Bay Area not that long ago. Last year she's called Mechi Sansani. Some of you, she went to Spirit Rock. She's a very, very famous nun in Thailand now and together with few nuns we went Pindapat every day for quite a long time when I was there, you know. So just to come back to England now, because if I start in Thailand I could be here all night. I love Thailand. So, you know, my teacher said, well, let's see what happens, you know, and little by little. We were two hours away from London, you know. It wasn't obvious that we would get food every day, was it? With no, people with no money. And in 24 years of my life as a nun we've never had a day without a meal and a very good meal, usually. Very well provided. All our requisites, you know. We did a lot of work at the beginning, huge amount of work, in fact, for at least 12, 13 years. Eventually there was enough fun to have contractors coming to do some work, you know. But the monks and the lay community, for example, re-roofed the whole of the Chittas house, which is a huge surface. You know, they spent three months re-roofing the place. We, you know, we did all the work for many, many years. I was an expert as at, we all the nuns, many nuns were expert at, you know, when you put plaster balls and you seal them together like that and you kind of, I was expert at that. You know, for somebody who never did anything handy and practical, most of my life I thought that was an achievement, really. I was able to paint happily, you know. I was able to sand all sorts of things, to, you know, to, I did even steps. I ventured into carpentry, something I'd never done in my life before. I actually made little kind of steps in front of the house, where the guest house, the lay woman's guest house, which really enjoyed doing that. It took me weeks of getting it wrong, and then right eventually, you know. But it's still standing, so it's obviously, you know, it's a number of years ago. So, you know, our community since then has moved, you know, we've had, we have four monasteries in England, one monastery in Switzerland, one in Italy, one at Abayagiri, Abayagiri in California. There's two, one in New Zealand, one in Australia, and so it has spread over a period of time, over 24 years, and the community are very well established, whether it's in Switzerland, most beautiful area in Switzerland, in Italy, about one hour north of Rome. It's a flourishing hunger. In fact, as a non-community, we always have a waiting list for all the young women who want to come and ordain. They come and go, they may not necessarily stay, but many people want to try it out. It's such an unusual lifestyle. And it's a shame we're coming to the end of the time, you know, but what I wanted to say is that the training, more and more as I look back after a number of, you know, several decades, when I look back at the training, what I'm amazed is that what the monastic training affords is something very, very special. Very little situation will give you a chance to really let go of the world. In a very intentional way, in a very conscious way, you know, to really drop what I call the worldly concerns, praise and blame, love and hate, success and failure, fame and defame. You know, when you commit yourself to not following those forces, even though they still course through your mind daily, you know, in a sometimes very heavy way, you know, you have a time to really understand yourself from a completely different angle, you know. You have a chance to go deep in yourself and to start finding a true refuge in something that is not dependent on the ego. And this is something unique and very rare. And you have to go through a dark night to get there. You don't get there so easily. The ego clings to itself endlessly. But if you have the practice, a good teacher, a good community, you can go through the moment of despair, the moment of, you know, of the worst difficult moment of the mind and come out of the other side, free from anger. You have a little bit more self-identity. So I leave you on this. Hopefully you have a bit more understanding of what monastic life is about. There is a lot of joy also in this life. Of course, we will not be doing it otherwise. It's a joy of following the heart. The joy of realizing the Dhamma and seeing for oneself from direct experience the result of practice in its deepest sense. That brings a huge amount of joy. You remember the joy, the pity in one of the seven factors of enlightenment? That joy is very, is a foundation of this life, you know. It's not particularly a feeling of elation and happiness. It's just a buoyancy of the heart that is joyful. So maybe if those who want to leave at nine o'clock are here, please go. And those who want to stay behind for a few more minutes and ask some questions, I'll be very happy to answer within my capacity. Do you want to be a nun? No, sorry. You know, you have shared so much of the challenge, a critical challenge that you have gone through to build your community and to build yourself. What I have missed that some of you are inexperienced, how you challenge, how you will challenge emotionally and how you face your anger when you are thinking, it's different. I did one question. And since my background is from a Rumi culture and I do know Sufi dance and you as a dancer, I just don't understand why you had to give up dancing to be a nun. Wouldn't you be a dancer like me, nun? So you are not mind reading, obviously, are you? Because if you are mind reading, you will know that I have never stopped dancing. See? I danced, I danced making lots of flower arrangements. I never did flower arrangements in my life. But my reputation went all the way to Thailand, believe it or not. I started doing flower arrangements at the monastery. And my goodness, did they dance? And I said to my teacher, I don't think I have given up dancing. I still care, I am still dancing. My flowers, I can do dancing all over the place, arabesque and jumping. So, the heart that made me a dancer is the same heart that made me a nun. Not different. Just the same. As crazy as the one I had before. You have to be crazy to be a nun, really, a little bit. If you knew what you get yourself into, you will never get in there. But you have to have that kind of something. I think I was a bit eccentric, I think. Even though I like to look very fitting in somehow. But deep down, I think there was a part of me that did not mind the challenges, that was going to come along my way. So, I love Rumi, you know. So, it is not so far away from our practice. Dealing with anger, dealing with that, that is a good question. Yes. Well, this is why I say, maybe I will talk to you more about the external side of our life. But practice, I am talking to a group of people who are practicing the Dharma. So, I assume they would know that when I talk about practice, they know that I am practicing awareness, mindfulness. And facing anger, just with acceptance, loving kindness, mindfulness, and learning to let it go. From moment to moment. And now, we have become more sophisticated. We have non-violent communication groups in our community. We have all sorts, I will not tell you what we have, we have all sorts of means to help us, besides the traditional form of practice. Because monks and nuns living together, it is not evident, is it? That it will work. We have had a few, you know, I am not even talking about sexual lust or anything like that. When Achendel Sichito was asked, you know, we had a lot of fairly attractive women, you know, in Arceme Atene. Somebody asked Sichito, did you ever feel like, you know, any attraction to those nuns? And he said, I don't know if anyone of you knows him, he is a wonderful teacher, he kind of put his face and we said, well, no, I think murder became more awesome. So how much form of like sitting and meditating was it doing when you were 18, six times? Well, our year is like this, our day we have morning sitting, evening sitting and once a week we had an all night sitting, okay? And then our practice is really integrating mindfulness and everything we hear of the teaching in our everyday life. The sole purpose of monastic life is to develop the practice, remember that. We are not there for anything else. There is nothing that comes before that. And then few months of the year we do a retreat, like nowadays every three months of the year we do formal retreat. And then in the summertime we have maybe two weeks, two months retreat again, you know. But, yes, okay? Yes? For the community, our community is open, our monastic community has done, we are completely part of our community that surrounds the monastery but also from all of England. People come from all over England to stay with us. We have guest houses for male, for female. At Amarawati we have a retreat center where we have maybe 20, many, many retreats, many, many retreats, like maybe 10, 10 day retreats throughout the year and lots of weekend retreats, two weeks retreats and so on, taught by the senior monks and nuns of our community. We have held interfaith conference, interfaith retreats with other monks and nuns of different traditions, Christian, all traditions. And we have now a program for our lay community who spend many years wondering why they should not be as good as the monks and nuns, quote unquote. Finally, wisdom dawn on them that they could actually be very good practitioner as lay people. And there is a program of Upasika which all of our monastery have now, which is specifically designed for the lay practice. And they come regularly to the monastery to reaffirm their precepts, to get some teaching, they have a study program and so on. And they have in England, they are much more together in terms of newsletter. Our newsletter is getting thinner and thinner because there are less people that can do it. The lay community has a wonderful newsletter now. So it has broadened, the network has kind of really widened enormously. Yes? It's 20 minutes north of Ukaya. You know Willets? Have you heard of Willets? It's about 20 minutes from Willets, south of Willets. In England? In Italy. In Italy, it's one hour north of Rome. You have to look, we have websites of all our monasteries. If you go to a place called Forest Sangha on the web, you will find a lot of information about our communities. If you go to Amarawati, even Abhayagiri has a website. Amarawati has a website. Most of them have a website. And there's lots of information there you can have. People come from all over the world during our winter retreat, three months winter retreat, all over the world to support the monastic community for three months. They run the monastery for three months. But at Amarawati, for example, because there is a group of 15 people, they also do a great amount of our retreats with us. So they hear the teaching, they sit a lot during the day, and they also run the monastery. And this is what happens at Abhayagiri every year. A group of four people, or five people this year, spend a whole three months with the community. And they just love it because they do so much of the retreat with the community and hear the teaching. They can hear the whole teaching. In fact, sometimes the teaching is put at the time when they can actually come and hear it. So it's quite an interesting time for you to come to the monastery or to really learn about this life as a layperson. Any more questions before we go? Okay, yes, one more. Do you find the need for first seeing any practitioners of the monastic order practicing Chikon or Yoga? Oh yes, we practice Chikon, Yoga, Wuchi. Have you ever done Wuchi? We have. So it still only becomes a regular? Well, it's up to the individual. Now we've had people coming to teach us, for example, Wuchi, Taichi. We've had people doing all sorts of different exercises. My teacher actually has practiced Yoga for 20 years. Yes, we have had weightlifting classes with a trainer who lived at the monastery and was training the monks, training the nuns. We have all sorts of things. We're not supposed to jog in the light. We're supposed to jog when people don't see us around too much. But at Chittas, which is the most beautiful monastery with a forest of 140 acres of land there, a beautiful ancient forest of England, with beautiful bird tree and oak trees. And even it's a beauty spot on the maps. It's very pretty. There's a lake, there's a little gingerbread cottage for the nuns, there's this beautiful Victorian house and the park all around. It's a really gorgeous area. And so there you can jog through the forest in daylight. Because it's a private land. And now in the forest is about 12 kuttis, meditation huts, where most of the community lives now. In fact, the house is almost empty. Everybody has gone to the forest and the guests stay in the house. It's a very beautiful area. Okay. Thank you.
