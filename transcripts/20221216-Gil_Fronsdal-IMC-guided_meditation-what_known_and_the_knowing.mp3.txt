The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Hello everyone. Welcome. And those of you who are greeting on chat, thank you. It's very nice.
Those of you who are not, those on chat are doing it for all of you. I would like to think.
So the Insight Pentade, the focus being on the Insight part of it, how Insight works,
and one of the important places to have Insight to really see clearly is the difference between
what we know, what, for example, what we have insight about, what we know, and how we know.
So there's what we know and there's how we know. And many things that, the what we know,
many things, and what I'd like to suggest for today, that to have more attention to something
that's often not noticed. Often when we focus in meditation on what we can know,
like it's usually something tangible, something that we can, the senses can take in. We can,
in the present moment, something we can know because it's arising or it's occurring in the
present. So breathing, body sensations, feelings, thoughts, sounds, sensations. But one of the
things that are very important as the Insight deepens is to be aware a little bit of what is
absent. And certain kinds of things that are absent, we can feel when we know, recognize
their absence. There might be a short period of time where we can recognize the relief of it not
being there. So for example, before we rush headlong into mindfulness of breathing and body
here, we might take a little bit of time to notice that if there's any relief that you might evoke
sitting in your meditation posture, maybe you don't have to, there's things you're not doing,
responsibilities you put down for these 30 minutes, and things that you don't have to
address, things that are not present right now for you. And it's just so nice not to have them
here. And so the absence of them can have a little bit of a nice effect. They thought,
this is good. And to feel that goodness, to feel that, oh, yes, it maybe allows for a different
kind of relaxation to happen, a different kind of settling in. And then we can take one step
further. And that is, in the knowing of the relief, is that knowing pleasant or unpleasant? Does
that knowing carry with it some of the characteristics of the relief? Does that knowing
feel spacious or at ease? Or is it in a hurry ready to go on to the next thing? Is it kind of
pouncing or is it pulling back or filled with some kind of desires or aversions or doubts about
what's going on? And how simple can the knowing be to keep the knowing super simple? There's what
is known in the knowing. So simple, the direct knowing of what's here or sometimes what's not
here, the relief of what's not here. That the knowing is so simple that it's welcomed. There's
a good feeling. It's appreciated to know this way. So there's a knowing and what is known. So
assuming a meditation posture and gently closing your eyes. And take a few moments now to feel
if there's any relief of just being here in this way. Maybe identifying two or three things that
are not present. Maybe the regular part of your life. And they're not here in the moment as you're
sitting. And that's maybe part of the goodness of being here.
And if you feel some relief of being here, what's it like
to know that relief? The simplest, clearest kind of knowing of absence of relief without
commentary without judgments, just knowing the relief, knowing the absence of whatever is normally
present, especially the absence of the stress that you might carry, the preoccupations that you
normally carry, the impact that life events might have normally to feel the relief. And then also
to recognize a simple way of knowing that. And that simplicity of knowing, knowing that has no
stress within it. There you will find the path to freedom. Stay close to knowing in a way that
feels relieving, that feels releasing. No matter what you know, it's how you know
that you'll find the path to liberation.
that's how you know that you'll find that you'll find that you'll find that you'll
find that you'll find that you'll find that you'll find that you'll find that you'll
find that you'll find that you'll find that you'll find that in a way that's
