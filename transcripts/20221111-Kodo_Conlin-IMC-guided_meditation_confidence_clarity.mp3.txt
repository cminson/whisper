 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good night. All over the world, in fact. Warm and cold. Wet and dry. One Dharma. Good morning. Well, greetings. Let's begin with some sitting together. So, settling into our upright meditative posture. Upright and alert, whether we are reclined or sitting with a free spine. First, sensing into the support, the ground, the seat. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. And from a connection with that steady supportive base. Sensing our way up the spine, aligning little by little. As we do this, you may notice your breath adjusting itself. And now may be a good time to take a few long, slow, deep breaths, arriving with the body. Letting go of any obvious holding. And when you're ready, letting the breath return to normal, its natural rhythm. Good morning. Good morning. Settling in with the breathing. At ease with the breathing. Clear with the breathing. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. To clearly know this breath, this breath. Recognizing breathing in, recognizing breathing out, confident in the clear recognition, this breath. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Confident. Confident in the clear recognition. This in breath. This out breath. This out breath. This out breath. This out breath. This out breath. This out breath. This out breath. This out breath. This out breath. This out breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If there is wavering, if there is uncertainty, breathing in confident in clearly knowing uncertainty, confident in clearly knowing wavering, confident in clearly knowing wavering, confident in clearly knowing wavering, confident in clearly knowing wavering, confident in clearly knowing wavering, confident in clearly knowing wavering. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Clearly knowing this breath in, this breath out, confident in the clear knowing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sitting comes to an end. To relax, let go of, any effort with the meditation. To relax a body, a mind, and to appreciate any little bit of goodness or well-being that's arising, any little bit. So that recognition can nourish us. May we be nourished by confidence and clear knowing. May everyone we encounter benefit. May the benefits of our practice together extend far and wide. Thank you.
