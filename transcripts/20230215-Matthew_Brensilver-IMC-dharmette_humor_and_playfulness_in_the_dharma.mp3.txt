 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So I saw some some chats about the cyclone and Gil and Ajahn Sajito, and I haven't been in touch with Ajahn Sajito. Nancy's been in touch with with Gil and I reached out to the retreat center and they're safe and sound. They're still posting to to Dharma Seed actually. So, yeah. So, excuse me. So I was talking with a yogi after her retreat and they said something like, you know, I'm suspicious of spiritual teachers who lack a sense of humor. The lack of a sense of humor usually means they haven't reached deep into the mystery. And for a long time, I thought the Dharma was serious business and Dharma teaching was even more serious. So I'll tell you how I got my nickname, Captain Buzzkill. I have a lot of joy in my life, but little excitement. Even things that I wind up enjoying a lot. I'm not I'm not excited about in advance. And that's not because I'm like trying to be all Buddhist present or whatever. That's just probably more temperamental or something. And my brother is kind of the reverse younger brother more on the excitement side. And he was this is years ago. He's telling me something that he was excited about. And I kind of was like, one on the first noble truth is still true. But whatever age is like, you know, you are your Captain Buzzkill. That nickname is kind of kind of stuck with me. And so so today, today, theme of playfulness and humor that's that's next on my fake list. Monday surrender yesterday. Humor playfulness today. So there there is this sense that that the intensity and the poignancy of life is somehow in contention with the humor of it. That it is incompatible in some way. But one of the gifts of Buddhist practice is how quickly. Even strong forces can move through us leaving sort of no trace and opening us to a very different next moment. Poignancy and then delight, grief, and then humor. And the seriousness the seriousness is is often driven by ego, which is, I think, by nature serious. The kind of hallmark of ego is a subtle kind of defensiveness and territoriality. And the ego definitely doesn't think it's funny. Yes, it is. It can get tight. It can get tight in there and certainly in retreat. My meditation, my insight, my samadhi, my enlightenment, it gets serious. And yet this is a long path, a deep path, and playfulness humor is needed at various points along the path. So what are the what are the characteristics of of playing? What are the characteristics of playing to play in the way a child plays? There is non-vigilance. We cannot be playing when we're patrolling everything. There's an absence of self-consciousness. We play in the absence of that congealed sense of self. You kind of can't play if you're trying to look cool or smart or whatever. You cannot play. Right? It's a performance and play is not a performance. Play is the kind of inclusion of our of our whole being, at ease with ourselves in a kind of flow. It's a beautiful thing to see a child that play. It's a beautiful thing for us to play. And we're not it's intrinsically rewarding. We're not we're not getting anywhere. We're not we're not building towards something. We're playing. Winnicott, psychoanalyst, pediatrician said psychotherapy takes place at the overlap of two areas of playing. That of the patient and that of the therapist. Psychotherapy has to do with two people playing together. Where playing is not possible. The work done by the therapist is directed towards beginning the patient towards bringing the patient from a state of not being able to play into a state of being able to play. A state of not being able to play into a state of being able to play. And a lot of that can be said for the Dharma to. Where can you play? Where can we play? Where can we not? Can we play with our foibles? Play in the zones of clinging. Even maybe with our shame. As as the egoic framework becomes less and less of a kind of organizing factor in our lives we open to to humor and play because a lot of what is painful in the presence of ego is playful in its absence. As we we come to to take ourselves less seriously we can we can play with the conventions of self. With who we think we are we play with it. In other words, we become the joke. And it feels good. Feels good. I have always loved when people make fun of me somehow. Well I mean not when I was like in middle school or something but if they're making fun of me with with love. It's a delight. And just making fun of myself there's delight there too. Actually. And it's not like a casual making fun I'm like really actually making fun of myself. But from love from love. The Buddha says something like you know don't deprecate yourself when you're teaching and I get that but I am making fun of myself from love. And part of how we can relate to our defilements is actually through some sense of humor. And there is a kind of in our playfulness there's a kind of relief. We release some of that that affect. You know sometimes affect can really can really I was pointing to it in the set like it can go more than one way. It can become shame or pain or something or can become humor. Lightness. Where can we play. Where can't we. And where we can't. It is a signal that is a kind of signal little warning light of egoic seriousness. But our path is both serious and playful. I went to this kind of workshop is sort of more breathing kind of more more kind of pranayama ish sort of practice with a couple friends years ago. And a couple other Buddhist Buddhist people. And it was not a Buddhist practice but I got into to a very kind of interesting mind state that I hadn't known. I think it was a 90 minute session and we were in the dark and we're breathing and maybe an hour in. I think we were lying down. An hour and I start to hear this woman next to me start crying and it's just the kind of poignancy of it brought tears to me. I didn't didn't you know we had met very briefly. I didn't know who she was. But okay I'm hearing crying. Oh yeah I'm going to be crying too. I start crying. And coexisting perfectly in perfect harmony with that with those tears. That kind of empathic connection of whatever she was feeling was humor. Not laughing at her for sure not laughing at myself but humor and laughing deeply deeply. And coexisting with the tears and with the humor was this abiding piece. As if I were miles beneath the surface of the sea. So still and yet convulsing with laughter with tears. This is our life. So when may we. Yeah we may we find the coexistence of grief of seriousness of earnestness of play of humor lightness and keep going. Okay. It's good to be with you. So we'll gather back again tomorrow. I wish you all a good day and appreciate being being with you in this way together.
