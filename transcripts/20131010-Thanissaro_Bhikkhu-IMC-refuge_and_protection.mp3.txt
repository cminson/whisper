The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Now I'd like to talk a little bit on the topic of refuge and protection.
There's a passage in the can where the Buddha talks about the duties of a student to a teacher
and his teacher's duty to his students.
Of course, as a student, you're supposed to study diligently, try to master what the teacher taught.
You're also supposed to attend to the teacher's needs, which is interesting.
I mean, that was my life as a young monk in Thailand.
For the teacher, though, the duties are some of the ones you'd probably expect,
that you want to make sure that you don't hold anything back from the student,
and once you make sure the student has mastered something,
you have to test the student to make sure the student has mastered it.
One more interesting one, which is very unusual, from our point of view,
is that the teacher is supposed to offer protection in all directions for the student.
Now, this doesn't mean, like in the Buddhist case, he would go out,
and if anybody was beating you up, he would drive them away.
What he's doing as a teacher is providing you with a kind of knowledge where you can defend yourself.
That you take his teachings and you put them into practice.
And by doing so, you protect yourself from dangers.
Now, this was a common theme for all skills that were taught in that time,
that were designed to protect you from one danger or another.
And the Buddha in particular has what he saw as three levels of danger that we all face in our lives.
And he taught in ways that were supposed to help protect us from all three.
This is where the concept of refuge comes in,
that the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha provide protection on an external level
to protect you against the external dangers you face,
on an internal level to protect you from the internal dangers that you present.
I mean, we live in a dangerous world.
We all know that, but we're also dangerous people.
You think of some of the really stupid or harmful things that you could do.
You know, when circumstances are okay, you might not even think of doing them,
but when things get difficult, you might feel tempted, okay?
A couple of precepts you might want to break just because things are difficult.
And your ability to say no to that depends on the extent to which you've actually trained your mind.
So there are these internal dangers that you've got to gain protection from.
And then finally, there's just the dangers of aging illness and death,
and no matter how skillful you are in your actions,
if you haven't attained a higher level of safety,
you're going to be subject to repeated birth, repeated death,
all that comes from the fact that even skillful actions, ordinary skillful actions,
can only give you a temporary refuge.
And so there are these three levels of refuge that the Buddha was teaching.
And when you look at the Buddha and the Dharma and the Sangha,
each of them provides refuge on each of those three levels.
Let's take the Buddha, for example.
The Buddha talked about himself as being an admirable friend
and saying that having an admirable friend is the whole of the practice.
Now, again, this doesn't mean he's going to do the practice for you,
but it does mean that without someone like the Buddha as an example,
you'd have no idea that this kind of life was possible,
or this kind of practice was possible.
But the fact that there was someone who set that example
shows that it is possible for human beings to find a happiness that's true and harmless
and is totally reliable.
And this goes against a lot of the messages we're getting from the world,
that true happiness is impossible.
Settle for him or say he's bent.
Buy whatever we're trying to sell,
and that's the best you can get in life.
And there's so much of our society that's geared toward that,
is making us feel that putting the effort into finding a true happiness
is not really reliable.
It's impossible to forget about it.
I mean, the Buddha himself was told this when he was a young prince.
The great people of the past,
they accepted the fact that the best things in life are subject to aging, illness, and death.
So why don't you enjoy your riches and enjoy your power?
And he said if those were the kind of people who accepted that kind of stuff
as the best human life has to offer, they're not worthy of respect.
He wanted something that was not subject to these things.
So the fact that we have someone who sets an example like that,
that alerts us to the fact that this might be a possibility.
There are also teachings in his time that he would actually go out of his way to argue with.
Now the Buddha was not the kind of person who would seek out people to argue, ordinarily.
But there were three types of teachings that he would go out and actually argue with people.
One was that everything you experience is the result of past actions.
And you say if you hold to that, there's nothing you can do in the present moment
to protect yourself from, say, suffering that might come from past actions.
Everything is totally predetermined.
There's no way that you can even tell yourself that something should or should not be done.
And he said that leaves you unprotected.
Now it's interesting that that's the point he focuses on.
The sense that if you don't have a should or a should not, you're unprotected.
And this relates to his analysis of what happens when we suffer.
He says we ordinarily react to suffering in two ways.
One is we're bewildered and why is this happening to me?
And the second one is we're searching for somebody's advice or someone can help
providing that shows us the way out.
And you think back to when you were a child and you first encountered pain.
You had no idea what was happening.
And this has been our relationship to pain pretty much all along.
Why is this pain happening to me?
We may know that with aging the body breaks down, but it's a shock when it does this without asking permission.
So all of a sudden you find that you can't do the things that you used to do.
There's a great line in the canon where one monk is talking to a king.
The king was saying that back when he was 20 years old he felt like he had the strength of two men.
But now at 80s years old he sometimes thinks of putting his foot in one place and it goes someplace else.
And again it doesn't ask permission.
And you always wonder, well why is this happening?
There's a sense of bewilderment.
And if there's some way that you could act in a way that makes at least a guarantee that you not suffer from it
that's what offers you protection from the suffering.
But if everything you experience is already predetermined, you have no protection.
Similarly with the idea that everything you experience is the result of the act of a created God.
That the God has decided this is the way things are going to be and there's no changing it.
You're defenseless.
A third teaching that the Buddha would argue with would be the teaching that
everything is random. Happiness happens randomly, pain happens randomly.
There's really no pattern to these things that you can figure out how you might be able to counteract pain when it comes
or at least deal with the pain in a way that doesn't cause suffering.
And again if you have, there's no pattern, there's nothing you can learn.
You can never learn from your experiences.
And you can't really say that I did this yesterday and it's going to work again tomorrow.
You're left defenseless.
And these kind of teachings, the Buddha would actually go out and argue with people who were teaching that.
Because you're saying you're teaching a really dangerous doctrine here.
You're leaving people unprotected.
I'm thinking of another teaching that he might have argued with if it were around at his time.
He said everybody's basically good.
You can trust your inner self and it's because of your horrible conditioning that you do stupid things
but if we could erase your social conditioning you could trust yourself.
And you have to remember the Buddha's last teachings.
What was the topic, do you remember?
Heedfulness.
He didn't talk about mindfulness, he didn't talk about loving kindness just before he died.
He talked about heedfulness.
Heedfulness comes from the sense that there is danger out there
but that your actions can make a difference.
And not only danger is out there but also danger is in the mind.
You've got greed, you've got aversion, you've got delusion.
If anyone believes in the innate goodness of human beings, look at what's going on in politics right now.
Something really stupid is going on.
And it's not necessarily innately good.
And so I think the Buddha would have probably argued against that one too
because that teaches people to be complacent.
Trust your urges or trust your inner voice.
Your inner voice is you've got lots of inner voices.
I don't know about you but I've got lots of inner voices that say stupid things sometimes.
You have to learn how to say no, recognize them and learn how to say no.
So these are some outside influences that could actually be harmful to you if you acted on them.
And so it's good to have the example of someone like the Buddha who gave this Dharma as a teaching
that lays out the fact that you are responsible for your actions
and your actions really can make a difference.
And you can, on the one hand, take his advice as to what's skillful and unskillful
and put it to the test in your life.
And then work out sort of the details on your own.
Because a lot of the Buddhist teachings are pretty general.
He's got the five precepts and he's got what they call the ten guidelines about avoiding,
which include avoiding divisive speech, lying, harsh speech, and idle chatter.
Trying to develop skillful states of mind that are not overly greedy,
that don't involve any ill will.
And trying to develop right view.
These are kind of basic principles.
But you can learn through your own experience when you apply these principles in general,
how they actually work in particular circumstances.
And at the same time, you've got the example of the Buddha.
I mean, this is one of the reasons why when they wrote the Pali Canon,
they didn't just write down lists of teachings.
They actually wrote, this is how the Buddha interacted with that person.
This is how he dealt with this situation.
He tells his life story about how he saw that the way he was acting was causing suffering
and is not helping in this and more skillful.
And so he'd stop and ask, well, is there some other way I can do this?
And so he was constantly looking at his actions, seeing the results,
and then adjusting his approach, adjusting his way he was behaving
to try to make it more and more skillful.
You can take that as an example.
There are specific incidents in his life.
There are two in particular that I find particularly impressive.
One, of course, was when he realized that if he was going to find true happiness,
he was going to have to go into solitude.
He had to give up an awful lot.
He was willing to give it out, went out.
Even though the rest of the family was not happy at all with what he was doing,
he figured, this is really important.
I want to find something that really is a genuine form of happiness.
And if I find it, I'll have something to bring back.
And there's always that question about why did he leave his wife right after she'd had the kid?
And you have to remember, back in those days,
when he had the duties of a husband,
if he didn't find that there was a satisfactory treasure to give the family at home,
he would go abroad and go out and try to find the treasure and bring it back.
And he said, this is the treasure I want to bring back to my family.
So he made a lot of sacrifices for that.
Another incident which I find really inspiring was that he had tried austerities for six years,
and he got to the point where he said,
okay, I have no one who outdid me in terms of what I was doing in terms of austerities.
And we got to every time he went to the bathroom, he would faint.
He was going without food, he was going without all kinds of things.
And what keeps a person going when you're doing that kind of thing?
If not pride.
You can imagine, there's a huge amount of pride built up around this.
And then after six years, he realized this isn't working.
Now, if he had been unwilling to let go of the pride,
he would say, well, I'll just put out my shingle as the greatest austerity person
and make a living that way.
He said, no, this is not working, I've got to find something else.
And he was willing to deal with the opprobrium of his followers
with setting out that this guy is going back to luxurious ways, we're going to leave him.
And so he was able to give up that amount of pride
and actually find the right way to practice.
And I think that's very inspiring,
that many times we find ourselves set in a particular way
and we know that we'll lose face if we abandon it,
but realize what we're doing is not working.
And here's the example the Buddha said, yeah, lose face.
Be willing to look stupid in the eyes of other people
if you know what you're doing is wrong.
Just as an aside, I hope we have time tonight for this, for our sides.
There's a famous story in Thailand that has to do with the example that the Buddha said.
There was a king, I'm trying to make this as short as possible,
who had the Burmese attacked the Thais
and this king was going to go out and attack the Burmese camp
and he was going to do a stealth operation on an elephant one morning.
All the army was going to go out on the elephants
and attack the Burmese camp right at dawn
when the Burmese were not prepared.
And so he goes racing on his elephant
and when the dust settles, he's there in the Burmese camp
and he's the only one on the Thai army that's in the camp.
They could have very easily surrounded him, killed him and that would have been it.
But he sees the Burmese viceroy and he says,
okay, this is probably the last part time that we will have a chance to do duel with one another, one on one.
Do you accept my challenge?
And the viceroy got, okay, I'll accept your challenge.
And so the two of them had a duel on an elephant back
and the Thai king one killed the Burmese viceroy.
And just as he killed the Burmese viceroy,
the Thai army caught up with him and they dispersed the Thais, dispersed the Burmese.
If you go to Thailand, you will see this incident embroidered on pillows,
placed on people's walls.
I mean, this is the big event in Thai history.
And at any rate, that the king, when he got back to the capital, was really upset with his generals.
I mean, he could have died because they didn't keep up with him.
And so he decided he was going to kill off some of his generals just as a lesson,
that you have to be more up with the king.
And so this very senior monk heard about this and he said,
I'd like to talk to you.
Sent word into the king.
And the king came out to see him and he said,
do you remember the story of the Buddha?
When he gained his awakening, how many people were around him?
All of his students had left.
He was there alone.
The reason I remember him is because he did this alone.
The fact that your generals did not keep up with you
allowed you to go down in Thai history as the king who beat the Burmese alone.
Well, okay, the generals don't have to die.
So that's one way you can use the example of the Buddha to good purpose.
You're willing to lose face for sake of a greater good.
So that's one way in which the Buddha acts as an example.
He's a refuge on an external level.
He gives the example of, this is what a really good person does,
who really does find true happiness.
This is how they behave.
He left the Dharma as the way that this is how you think to get there.
These are the qualities you try to develop.
Now the Buddha himself is traditionally associated with three qualities,
which are wisdom, purity, and compassion.
And he gives instructions on how you can develop those qualities yourself.
In terms of wisdom, he says it starts with asking the question,
what when I do what will lead to my long-term welfare and happiness?
What when I do it will lead to my long-term harm and suffering?
Now the wisdom there is since seeing one,
that this is going to depend on your actions.
You actually do have the chance to affect your happiness, your suffering.
And two, long-term is more important than short-term.
I know one Pali scholar who said, this is just too simplistic.
Because everybody knows this.
Well, everybody knows this, but how many people act on it?
It's the ability to act on this. That's where the wisdom comes in.
That you really will weigh things as to what is going to be for long-term happiness
and what's going to be only for short-term,
and being willing to make the sacrifice.
In terms of compassion, there's an interesting story I may have told you here before,
but I'll tell it again.
It's about King Vasanade and his wife, Queen Malika.
And one day they're up in the palace, just the two of them in the bedroom.
And the king at a tender moment turns to the queen and says,
is there anyone you love more than yourself?
No. You know what he's expecting.
Yes, Your Majesty, I love you more than I love you.
Well, Queen Malika is no fool.
She says, no. There's nobody I love more than myself.
And what about you? Is anybody you love more than yourself?
No.
The end of scene. So it goes down to see the Buddha.
And the Buddha says, you know, she's right.
You can search the whole world and you don't find anyone you love more than yourself.
And at the same time, you have to remember that everybody else in the world loves themselves
just as much as you love yourself.
And the conclusion he draws from that is that never cause anyone any harm.
You can think about that in two ways.
One is that just in terms of, you know, you sympathize with other people's desire for happiness.
You feel it this way, you can sympathize with them, that's what they want too.
Secondly, you realize if your happiness depends on their harm, they're not going to stand for it.
So if you really want a long-term happiness, you've got to take other people's happiness into consideration.
This is the beginning of compassion.
When you think about other people's happiness as related to yours.
Finally, the quality of purity.
Those instructions he gave to his son about the very beginning of the practice.
When you look at your actions, you see, okay, what's my intention?
What do I think is going to happen as a result here?
If you foresee any harm, you don't do it.
If you don't foresee harm, you go ahead with the action, but you watch the results while you're acting.
Because some actions give the results.
You don't have to wait for your next lifetime for them to give their results.
They're going to give them right away.
You spit in the wind and it comes right back at you.
So you look at your action.
If you find that you're causing harm, you stop.
No matter how much you wanted to do the action, you see this is causing harm, you stop.
And this would apply, you know, you find yourself getting in a stupid argument, you stop.
This isn't going nowhere.
Even if you lose space.
And then after the action, if it looked okay, you go ahead with the action.
After the action, you review the long-term consequences.
And if you realize that it did cause harm, you go and talk it over with someone who's further advanced on the path.
To get their perspective on it.
And then you resolve, you're not going to repeat that mistake ever again.
And if you don't see that you caused any harm, then you can take joy in the fact that your training is continuing.
And then you can take, you know, continue in your training with a sense of joy and self-esteem.
In other words, you are allowed to pat yourself on your back.
And this way, he said, this is how people develop purity in their thoughts and their words and their deeds.
And it's not just that you have good intentions, but you actually look at how well do I actually carry these things out.
And if my good intentions, what I thought were good intentions are causing harm, I go to back and reset.
Check things out.
Okay, what did I, where was my mistake?
And so here the Buddha gives you the Dharma as guidance on how you develop those qualities of wisdom, compassion, and purity.
And it's by taking that instruction in and actually acting on it.
That's when you get to the next level of refuge, which is protection from yourself.
You know, you see that you have unskillful qualities, but you can keep the Dharma in mind
and you've trained yourself so that you can act along in line with the Dharma when unskillful urges come up
or difficult situations come up.
You say, no, I'm going to stick with this. That's your protection.
That's when you provide internal protection for yourself.
And so this is what we're doing as we practice meditation.
This is what we're doing as we practice the precepts.
We're providing internal protection.
You can think of it in terms of your committee of your mind.
You're changing the dialogue.
You're changing the balance of power inside the mind, the strength and the skillful members.
And if you can't convert the unskillful members, you let them join the tea party and go someplace else.
And so that's the internal level of refuge.
And I forgot to mention, of course, the Sangha.
We use the word Sangha very loosely here in America.
Sangha traditionally was two things.
One was there was the monastic Sangha, the people who actually devoted themselves to the practice
and maintained the teachings and hopefully maintained the good example.
And then there's the noble Sangha, which can be either monastic or lay.
People who've actually followed through the practice attained awakening
and they can be good examples for us as well.
Again, on an external example, they're the external refuge.
As you see their qualities and you try to emulate them, that becomes your internal refuge.
And then finally, there's what I call the third level of refuge.
And when the Buddha talks about Nirvana, Nirvana is not the only name he gives to the goal.
He's got a list of about 20 names altogether.
And many of them are revolver on the idea of safety.
One is called Harbor, Island, Refuge, Security, the Secure.
The fact being that if you can practice to the point of attaining a deathless happiness,
then you're totally secure.
Aging illness and death can't touch the mind.
There'll be no suffering at all.
And that's why the Buddha has gone beyond his promise to protect you in all directions.
I mean, the deathless goes beyond all directions.
Which is the name, by the way, of the new book that's out on the table.
But this is the protection that protects you even from the limitations of skillful actions.
And skillful actions can take you so far.
But even because they themselves are impermanent, they can't provide a total happiness.
Aside from the actions of the Noble Path.
And there's something special about the Noble Path, even though it doesn't cause the deathless,
it can take you there.
It's like the road to the Grand Canyon.
If you've ever been, approached the Grand Canyon from the South Rim,
you know the road to the Grand Canyon does not look at all like the Grand Canyon.
But it gets you there.
And it doesn't cause the Grand Canyon to be.
The Grand Canyon was there a long time before the road was built through.
But you follow the road and you get there.
And once you've got there, okay, then you're totally secure.
And this way the Buddha is, you know,
providing his duty, fulfilling his duty as a teacher,
and providing that kind of refuge.
So when you look at the practice that you're doing,
you know, try to think of it in terms of the dangers you're protecting yourself.
The outside dangers, the bad examples,
the kind of teachings that would make you complacent.
You've got to put those aside because you've got a better example.
And then for the internal refuge, you've got greed, aversion, and delusion,
all these other unskillful qualities.
But you've got skillful qualities as well,
which you've got to learn to do is strengthen the skillful qualities
so they can protect you against the temptation to follow through with the unskillful ones.
And you do this by practicing the Dharma.
Lord has lots of teachings about using the image of a fortress,
the image of a protector, the image of a protective charm,
to talk about the different ways that the aspects of the practice really do provide security.
And mindfulness as a protector, he has this image of a fortress out there,
and mindfulness is the gatekeeper.
And here you have to remember that his meaning of mindfulness was not just being aware,
it was remembering what you need to remember about what's skillful and what's not skillful.
And in this case, the gatekeeper knows who's allowed in the forest
and who's not allowed in the fortress.
I heard one person who was trying to advance the idea that mindfulness is just kind of accepting awareness.
He came across this example.
He says, well, all the gatekeeper has to do is just sit there
and that's going to keep the bad people from coming, even approaching the fortress.
And I think I'm thinking, it's like those police dummies they have.
And you see it the first time and you're taken aback.
And then you realize, this is a dummy.
And it's no longer effective.
And if that's what your mindfulness is doing, it's going to work once, maybe,
but it's not going to work all the time.
So you need mindfulness to remember what's skillful and what's not skillful
so that you know who to let into the fortress and who not.
And then the army inside the fortress is your effort.
What was interesting for him, discernment is a plastered wall.
The fortress had a plastered wall.
Now, why do you think it would be plastered?
So you can't get a toehold or a foothold on the plaster.
The enemy can't climb up the wall.
So you've got to have your discernment in such a way so that you can protect yourself
so that greed, aversion, and delusion don't get toeholds into your mind.
So the Buddha uses these examples of soldiers protecting you, being inside a fortress,
the qualities that protect you, that basically come down to three main types,
which is qualities of mind, the way you live your livelihood,
you want to lead your livelihood in a way that's not causing anybody harm.
And then finally, developing skills that you can be helpful to the society around you,
helpful to your family, helpful to whatever group you belong to.
These things protect you.
If you're helpful to the group and then something happens,
of course they're going to come and be happy to help you in turn.
And it's interesting to think of that, okay, learning these skills, this is a kind of protection.
So I think it's important that you realize that we are faced with dangers both outside and inside,
but what the Buddha offers here is a type of protection against these things.
If you take his teachings, look at his example, look at the example of the Noble Sangha.
Internalize that example and follow through to the point where you can find for yourself
that what the Buddha was talking about really is true.
There really is a deathless happiness and it really is safe.
Because then you've developed the kind of safety that the Buddha was offering.
That's why he became Buddha because he wanted not only to escape danger himself,
but he wanted to provide this as a teaching for anyone who was interested.
So those are some of my thoughts on the topic of refuge and protection.
I wonder if you have any questions or comments?
I gave the Sim talk in New York a couple of months back, it was five minutes before there was a question.
Do you want to talk about anything else?
Yes.
The first question, the one that kind of broke the ice.
Let's see, what was the icebreaker?
There are some questions about the idea of the Sangha.
The Buddha actually had a term for a group like this called a bodhisattva, P-A-R-I-S-A.
Basically people follow the teachings and as a group they get together as a group basically.
It's one thing to look for the Noble Sangha, for example, where people have been well trained as a refuge.
It's another thing to think you're going to get refuge in the person sitting next to you in the meditation hall.
Because we get all kinds of people coming in here.
But for refuge you want someone who can give you a reliable example.
Traditionally Sangha just was for the monastic Sangha and then for the Noble Sangha.
The monastic Sangha is not necessarily always the best kind of an example,
but at the very least there's a group that has an apprenticeship that gets carried on from generation to generation,
which provides a context.
When we look at a document like the Pali Canon, it was never meant to be used in isolation, just as a book.
It was part of the teachings that a community passed on as part of their life as a community.
So it's good to have the examples of, this is the etiquette of someone who practices the Dharma,
and this is the way a community should live together.
They provide an example that way.
And then whichever layer monastic people become awakened, they become an even better example.
But there are a lot of things that individuals cannot show as an example.
I've been working recently on the monks' roles.
I did a book several years back and I'm going through and basically revising the book.
The more I live this life as a monastic, the more I realize it was a very well-designed community.
It's basically everything that would give any indication of what social background you came from would be erased,
so that people would live as equals.
And that even though there was a hierarchy within the community on certain issues, there were other issues,
there was no hierarchy at all, everybody had equal votes.
And it's a well-organized community.
And John Sawat, one of my teachers made the point one time, he says,
the fact that we have a monastic order is not just for the monks, it's for the lay people too.
By interacting, and the Buddhist monks are not, as you can see, we don't live in cloisters and run away from the world.
We're there interacting with the lay people and providing an example.
This is how people should interact, how they show respect to one another,
as they're practicing the Dharma and give support to one another.
Yes.
Can you wait for the microphone?
I've heard the concept recently about some of the behaviors we're talking about,
about moral license, that once you decide, if you decide to do something to improve yourself,
you in fact may be more likely to do something in the future that's bad for yourself,
just by the fact that you've just made this decision in your mind to try to do something better.
And it's sort of a weird concept that's involved in willpower.
And so it seems to me that the idea of having an example is even more important in light of that,
that you have somebody who's really setting something visual or experiential
that you can use to help you overcome that dilemma.
Well again, a lot of times our ideas of improvement are just sometimes just our ideas.
We haven't really tested them.
If you see someone who's been on the path and tested this kind of thing.
And they help you with dilemmas of willpower as well?
Yes, because you see, so and so did this, and one, they can give you advice.
This is how they did it.
And then secondly, you can see the results down the line.
This was a choice that this person made, and this is how it worked out as it went further down the line.
There's nothing really wrong with willpower, if it's well directed.
I was reading someone recently saying that the whole problem of putting a lot of effort into the practice
means that you have to be highly motivated.
And when you're highly motivated, there has to be a very strong sense of self, which is bad.
And no, it's not bad.
In fact, the Buddha himself talks very frequently about using your sense of self in a skillful way to motivate yourself.
There's a passage on three ways of motivating yourself in the practice.
One is, he says, your sense of self, the sense of the world, and your sense of the Dharma.
Your sense of yourself is, I'm doing this because I really do want to find true happiness.
And in this practice, it shows I don't really love myself.
And so that's the way you can skillfully use your sense of self to keep on the path.
The Buddha was never averse to using a sense of self skillfully.
He never said there is no self, but he just said, you've got to learn how to use this really skillfully
and learn how to put that away.
You need that to keep you motivated on the path.
When you reach the goal, you're not going to need that sense of self anymore.
It's like that image of the raft.
You take the raft across the river, then you don't need to carry the raft around.
So you put it aside at that point.
Second way of motivating, this is one of my favorite ones.
Using the world to motivate yourself as you practice.
He says, in the world, there are people who can read minds.
How would I feel if they were reading my mind right now?
And then finally, using the Dharma to motivate yourself is, this is a really excellent Dharma.
It was founded by someone who was really admirable.
If I don't practice it now, I don't know what I'm going to have the chance to practice it again.
We're often trying to set good intentions,
but I find that an internal source of harm is intentions that are underneath the conscious radar,
and I need to root them out.
Do you have any suggestions?
I think meditating, just trying to stay alert helps, but is there more?
Well, the meditation is one of the best ways of alerting yourself to these other voices that are down there.
They're sort of really running the show.
But then you have to be very conscious to try to bring that level of awareness into your daily life.
It's not going to be automatic.
Some people just turn that off as they leave the meditation, and then they turn it back on when they meditate,
and it gets a very bifurcated kind of life.
And you have to say, okay, I'm going to try to bring this level of sensitivity into my life.
One thing that I found really helpful is thinking of the mind as a committee.
And so when something really unskillful comes up in the mind, it's not a sign that you're a bad person,
then you have to hide it from yourself.
It's just that's one member of the committee.
But I've got other members, you know?
And you start having a dialogue where there was no dialogue before.
So that's one thing I would suggest.
And that makes it a lot easier to live with the fact that there are some pretty unskillful things in there.
Because just as the Buddha didn't say that you were inherently good, he also didn't say you were inherently bad.
Because either way is debilitating in the practice.
If you think you're inherently good, you say, well, I'll just, whatever comes up, I might learn out of trust.
If you think you're inherently bad, nothing you will ever do will ever get you right.
You have to depend on some outside help to do the work for you.
Whereas having a committee where you have both the good and the bad members, you learn how to change the politics inside.
Don Jeff, I was curious about the comment you made about getting into arguments or getting into discussions that seemed, I don't know if you said silly or...
They're not going anywhere.
Not going anywhere.
I've certainly been able to recognize sometimes when that happens.
One time I was challenged by somebody who said, when I had mentioned Buddhism and the Buddhist path, that they said something along the lines of, well, was Jesus a liar or was he who he said he was?
Actually, it was like a trap.
Yeah, yeah.
It's like, when there's some other alternatives like the Jesus doesn't know, you know.
Right.
Well, I mean, I just responded by, I see that as a trap and I don't want you to fall into it.
Yes.
But there's other times when people say things and I realize that what gets triggered for me is a sense of insecurity.
You know, I feel pretty strongly about this, but I can't really articulate it.
So maybe you could say a little bit more of how do you respond in those...
Well, it's hard for me to imagine you ever not being articulate.
I have my moments.
Sometimes people do things that leave me speechless.
Yes.
Yeah.
But, you know, but it's, I mean, I think there are times when having those arguments, even when I don't exactly know, can be useful.
And other times when it's just like I'm just...
Yeah.
Well, if you go into it with the idea, well, let's explore this issue together.
And say, these are some of my concerns and if you feel the other person is willing to actually get into a mutual explanation, that can be actually very productive.
The Buddha has some guidelines for people that are not worth talking to.
And basically it comes down to two types.
One is people who really don't even know how to conduct an argument properly.
They're just too dumb.
And the other is they're too devious.
They know that the proper forms and everything, but they're going to try to work their way around them.
And, you know, they're not there to arrive at the truth.
They're there to beat you.
And when it comes like that, you say, okay, unless it's a matter of life and death, you say, right, I'm just not available for this argument.
And you may look dumb again.
It's a time to lose face, maybe.
This issue came up just this last weekend when we were having a course on the book skill and questions.
There's a whole section there on arguments and debates.
And talking about how, well, sometimes you know what you believe is right, but this is not the person to tell it to.
And they're not going to accept it no matter what.
And it's not that you say, well, we'll have to live together.
We have to say there are many levels of truth.
There are many types of truth.
And maybe their perspective is right.
And maybe they're really dead wrong.
But there are times when you say, I just cannot argue with this person.
And you do have to say, what's my purpose in holding on to this view?
Is it to beat the other person?
Especially with right view about the drama.
We're not here to beat other people.
We're here to practice to get rid of our own unskillful qualities so that we can actually put an end to suffering.
That's what the purpose of right view is.
It's not out there to bang somebody over the head.
And of course, in the back of your mind is politics right now.
And as a monk, I can say I'm not involved.
What you've got to do is, okay, I'm holding this view because I, you know,
what is my purpose in holding on to this view?
When is it appropriate time to express the view and when is it more appropriate just to be quiet?
You learn how to read this situation.
Because the holding two of you can be a kind of karma.
And if you come across as self-righteous, you've lost your cause.
This question over here.
I'm just curious, in your experience, what kind of impact does this practice have on physical healing and health?
Physical health.
I find it's, for me, it's been very helpful physically.
Especially the breath meditation that I was teaching just now.
When you're working with the energies in the body and you're learning how to make sure that all the organs of the body are well-nourished
and parts of the body that tend to get shut off for one reason or another,
for a physical injury or a psychological trauma or something.
You can begin to open it back up again.
And the more calm the mind is, on the one hand, the more sensitive it's going to be to the needs of the body.
And also you kind of create a greater level of energy that can sustain you through times when you really do need a lot of endurance
in order to finish a particular project.
And even if it's, you know, if you've got some serious illness where the breath meditation is not going to cure the illness,
it puts the mind in a much better place.
So the mind is not adding onto the problems of the illness.
And I had a second question about, you know, more about livelihood that doesn't harm.
Because that depends on what if you're already on a path like you're a lawyer of some kind.
Well, you can be a good lawyer.
I was talking, though, last night to someone whose brother-in-law is a lawyer and is a lawyer for an insurance company.
And they were sitting over dinner and the brother-in-law was talking about how there was this one woman
who had some sort of kitchen explosion, you know, destroyed half of her face.
And the lawyer was working for the insurance company and basically beat the woman.
And my friend here said, well, I'm happy for you.
There are those kinds of lawyers, but you don't want to be that kind of lawyer.
Okay.
I mean, there's a lot of, you know, public defenders and other people who are really trying to do the best they can.
But again, you have to, I mean, there are some occupations, you know, child trafficking and that kind of stuff.
Okay, you stay away from that entirely.
There are other occupations where you say, okay, there are honest and dishonest ways of conducting this particular kind of occupation.
I want to make sure I'm doing it the honest way, the helpful way.
Yes.
Would you share a little bit about your own decisions about pursuing a Buddhist path and ultimately choosing to become a monk?
Okay.
I first found out about Buddhism from a friend who had gone over to Thailand.
He was an exchange student and he spent two weeks as a novice.
And I'd never heard the Four Noble Truths.
I didn't know anything about Buddhism at the time.
This is when I was in high school.
And I don't know, just hearing about the Four Noble Truths got me intrigued that there'd be a religion based on just that issue of overcoming suffering.
I thought that was really fascinating.
And learned more about it in college.
I took a comparative religion course and they actually had a winter term.
This was at Oberlin.
They had a winter term where they brought a Thai monk and a Japanese monk to teach meditation.
So I signed up for that and liked it a lot.
And I said, this is a really important skill.
I really want to learn this better.
And so I got a fellowship to go to study and teach in Thailand.
My spare time, I was looking for a good meditation teacher.
I finally found one.
And it was more than I expected.
I mean, it was really impressive.
It wasn't just a meditation technique, but there was something about him as a person.
Quite a lot of really fine qualities I really admired.
And it was largely through his example that I finally decided, OK, I think I'd like to try being a monk to really give myself to this rather than just having it on the side.
It took a while for me to kind of...
There was a lot of back and forth before I finally said, well, here's my one chance.
I found a really good teacher.
How many people have this opportunity?
And if I don't take it, I'm going to regret it on the line.
So I took it.
And I haven't really regretted the choice.
Any other particular details or what?
It's a rare opportunity to speak to someone who's chosen to become a monk.
And so as you thought through, as you were going through that process,
especially of making that decision to commit yourself,
how did you...
I'm curious to know a little bit about kind of how did you think through what you might have to let go of?
Let go of.
As well as how you overcame some of those challenges.
A lot of it...
One thing that was really helpful for me was if I hadn't gone this way,
I probably would have gone into academia.
And after meeting my teacher,
the program that took me to Thailand took me back to Oberlin for a year
and gave me a free year of education at Oberlin.
And I was looking at all the professors and nobody looked happy.
Or as I kept thinking about my teacher sitting there in his little hut back in Thailand, perfectly happy.
And that seemed to be the kind of ideal that I wanted to follow more.
I did also have the opportunity to go to the American Academy of Religion.
They had a conference in Chicago.
And so I wanted to check it out because I think you probably might want to teach comparative religion.
Let's see what it's like.
What are the people like?
And they had a seminar on Thai Buddhism.
So I went and sat in the seminar.
And there were about 12 people who came to the seminar.
And there were three professors who got up and they all talked about their own little pet little projects,
none of which had anything to do with the other ones.
And I don't know if you've ever read any Jean Piaget, French psychologist.
He did a lot of study of child development.
And he had done a diary of his daughter's intellectual development from age, you know, from the egg on up basically.
And, well, birth on up.
And there was one particular story that he told about this phase that she went through when she was,
when I forgot the age she was, but every time she had a bowel movement,
you could not flush the toilet until she had made up a story.
She had named each of the pieces.
And there was a little story she told about, then you could flush it down, you know.
And that image went through my head.
As I was listening to these academic papers.
It was about three, yes.
And as soon after that, then I made the decision.
What do you think about the controversy in the Buddhist community about having women ordained?
I think it would be good if we had good women teachers for women to ordain and practice under.
And my concern is, how are you going to get those good women teachers?
That's my main concern.
I've had, I have some female students who would like to ordain,
but they went and visited the various communities and they came back and they said they could not study with those people.
That's the main difficulty.
I mean, this is one of the things you have with the living tradition is that there are,
you have monks who trained with monks who trained with monks who are all well trained.
Well, you don't have that yet in the women's community.
And I don't know how it's going to be brought about.
It's very difficult.
I mean, you get, you get inspiring individuals like Gyanana Yon in Thailand.
Have you ever read any of her stuff?
Yeah.
And Manchikau.
And they, they, you know, they stand out as really excellent individuals,
but none of them were able to establish a community that lasted more than a generation.
I mean, Gyanana Yon has a center that's still there, but
it's not a place to practice anymore.
But if the women were ordained, they could begin this process.
Yeah.
But in the meantime, you're experimenting with women, the chicken and the yank.
And what you've got, I've, one of the communities I actually visited and talked to the women and it's,
the woman, the woman who was in charge would ordain, you know, two or three years,
had a new student who was only there for a couple of months.
And the woman who had been there for three years was a very gentle and kind of timid kind of woman,
whereas the young student coming back was very self-confident.
And you could see, okay, the student was going to take over.
Because there's not that sense, okay, the teacher is well trained, so I will submit to the teacher.
So the dynamic is difficult.
Because for me, a lot of, my time with the John Furang was, it was not easy to,
okay, you tell me, I had to do something and it really went against the grain.
But I figured, okay, he's trained.
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.
Sometimes when I read Buddhist books, they talk about everyday life of trying to be mindful all the time, in a sense.
And I don't know if that's the most skillful way of approaching things,
or perhaps when you're in your everyday life, kind of having two planes of thought,
kind of being mindful and then kind of your normal, maybe, analytical working in this situation.
Okay, well, a lot of it depends on how you define mindfulness.
And mindfulness basically means keeping in mind what is appropriate to be done right now.
And if you're working at work, okay, you want to be keeping in mind what's your job.
But it's also good to have kind of a foundation, kind of a physical foundation to settle,
to keep you centered at the work.
Because even when you're focused on your job, there's still going to be random thoughts going on from other places.
And so take that energy that goes into the random thoughts and put it into having a sense,
okay, I'm with my body right now.
Stay with the breath.
And that helps keep you, actually, you're more focused on the work with less of the distraction.
And there's a greater sense of physical well-being that comes with that,
especially if you learn how to work with the breath energies like I was talking just now.
You can sense, okay, you're building up tension, relax it.
If someone comes in and says something stupid in the office, relax the energy.
And as long as you're more in touch with your energy, you come back at the end of the day
with a lot more energy left over.
But it's not just being aware, aware, aware, aware.
You've got a set of tools for dealing with attention, you've got a set of deals
with dealing with the part of the mind that tends to go off and get distracted.
Okay, you can pull it back in and have a sense of well-being right here.
It's a lot easier to stay centered.
Any last comments?
Okay, start.
Thank you for your attention.
