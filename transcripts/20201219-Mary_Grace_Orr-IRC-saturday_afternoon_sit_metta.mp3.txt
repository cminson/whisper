loving-kindness. I'd like to invite you just to sit for a moment as you have been
being present with the sitting, breathing body, with the heart, mind being here in
the present moment. Let's just take a few breaths together that way.
So I want to say just a couple of things about the Brahma Vihars as you sit,
about loving-kindness practice and the practices of compassion and gladness or
joy and equanimity. The way we're going to be practicing tonight, I think it can
be used with all of these and they are very much interwoven. Kindness sometimes
is sort of the umbrella meta-practice. You know, it covers everything, compassion
and joy are a little more focused and I think of equanimity as kind of the
foundation of the whole thing. But most importantly, I think to say that none of
these are feelings. Meta is not a feeling of kindness. Compassion is not some
emotional experience of compassion nor gladness and joy about the feeling of
joy, although all of those things may occur. What's really important to
understand is that it's about doing and intention. Sometimes I talk about seed
planting. You're planting the seed of kindness or of compassion or of
sympathetic joy or of equanimity and you surely hope that someday it will
sprout. But maybe it's not there yet. Maybe you're not feeling so kind or
maybe maybe you're stuck with regards to someone, but you can still create that
intention, the intention to be able to extend your goodwill, your friendliness,
the intention to have compassion and the intention to appreciate the happiness
of another being. Or maybe you're really, really wobbly and veering all over the
place and you create the intention to have equanimity. It does not magically
produce any of those things, but it sets you in the right direction, takes us
back to intention again. So the way I want to talk about it tonight and to
practice with you is a practice that's very similar to the Ton Lin practice
that is taught in the Tibetan world. The practice of sometimes it's called
taking and sending, and it's very often used with the practice of compassion. But
for myself, I like to use it for all of them. We'll stay primarily with loving
kindness tonight, but if you need, if you need a dose of one of the others of
compassion or sympathetic joy or equanimity, feel free to adjust to suit
your own needs. So let yourself be aware of the sitting and breathing body. And
breathing in, take that all in. Take in the awareness of your own being. And then
breathing out. Extend your goodwill, your friendliness, your compassion into every
cell of your body. It's possible that your body might be painful or might be ill.
So if there's anything specific, feel free also, of course, to send your goodwill
in that direction. So breathing in, the awareness of your own being. Breathing
out, friendliness, kindness, goodwill, compassion into every part of your body
and every part of the heart and mind. It's said that it's really important to do
loving kindness practice and all of these practices for ourselves. Because if we
can't hold ourselves with kindness and compassion and appreciation for our own
joy, how are we going to do it for anybody else? We can try, but you won't get
very far. And of course, it's also true that sometimes doing these practices for
ourselves are really hard. But again, even if it's hard, create the intention.
Breathing in, your own being. Breathing out, goodwill, compassion. Breathing in,
breathing out.
Breathing in, the awareness of your being, your body, your heart and mind. Breathing
out, your kindness and compassion. Filling your own being. Breathing in, breathing
out.
In traditional loving kindness practice, we often move from ourselves to someone who
has been a benefactor. I suspect that most of us have had benefactors of one sort or another,
the people who brought us to practice, who wrote the book, that woke us up,
who taught at different retreats, or maybe a family member, the grandmother who raised you,
or the father who was extra kind. It doesn't matter who your benefactor is, but someone
that you have a great deal of gratitude and appreciation for.
And so bring that person to mind and breathe in that sense of their own being,
however it is that you have known them. And then breathe out all that gratitude,
all that appreciation, all that goodwill. Breathing in, breathing out,
breathing in the memory of your benefactor,
their goodness to you,
breathing out your gratitude, your goodwill.
And then each of you have family and friends whom you love and care for.
You can bring one or two to mind or a group. And since you're all muted, feel free to say
their names aloud if that helps. And breathe in your awareness of their being,
your partners, your children, your parents and grandparents and aunties and uncles and
good friends and colleagues. Breathing in the sense of them, the feeling of them,
you might even say the vibration of them. And then breathing out your kindness, perhaps gratitude,
your goodwill, your wishes that each one of them might have ease of well-being,
your wishes that each one of them might be peaceful and happy.
Breathing in, breathing out,
breathing in, breathing out.
Breathing in, breathing out,
breathing out.
And then we might bring to mind our own Sangha here, all of us who have been in this
monastery that is not a monastery for these last days, all of the people that you've listened to,
some of the stories that you've heard, people that you've known from before.
And breathe in the awareness of our presence to each other.
And breathe out our goodwill, traveling over so many miles to so many places.
Breathing in, all of us on the retreat,
breathing out our friendliness, our compassion, our wishes for peace and awakening and ease.
Breathing it in and breathing out.
We might especially want to remember all of the staff who have supported us, all of the managers
and the people at IRC, the people who started at Gil himself, all of the support for this retreat,
all of those people. And breathing in the awareness of their presence, which might feel like the
awareness of support, and then breathing out kindness, compassion, gratitude.
Breathing in, breathing in, all of that support, breathing out gratitude.
And then we can perhaps begin to move out from our personal environment and our retreat environment
and begin to include people that we don't know tonight, I think, particularly to remember all
of the people who are suffering with COVID and all of the people who have lost people to COVID,
the people who are ill, the people who are dying, the families of those who are ill and who are dying
and who have died, millions of people. Breathing in the awareness of that vast group of suffering
humanity as best you can. Sometimes if it seems like too much, sometimes you can borrow the heart
of the Buddha if you need to or the heart of the Blessed Mother or the heart of Martin Luther King
or anybody who is big and compassionate that you can think of who would be happy to lend you their
heart. You breathe in all of that suffering, all of that grief and fear and loss and breathe out
compassion. Breathing it in as best you can and breathing out compassion, wishes for healing
and peace and ease. Breathing in and breathing out.
And let's also remember all of the healthcare workers who have worked so hard and so selflessly
and so many of whom have also lost their lives trying to take care of all those who are ill
and all of the other workers who back them up, the social workers and the therapists and the
hospital staff. Breathing all of that suffering in, all of that stress and breathing out our kindness,
our compassion, our willingness to be present with them in this suffering. But that's what
compassion is all about. Breathing in, breathing out.
And then we're going to get really, really, really big. So see if your hearts can get big
enough to hold the whole world, this whole planet, beautiful planet, the image we've seen so many
times of it floating out in space. And first we'll breathe in the awareness of all the people,
almost eight billion people, so many people who live and laugh and love and suffer just as we do,
who want to wake up just as much as we do, who want not to suffer. And breathe that in.
Breathe in all of those people and breathe out your friendliness, your kindness,
your compassion and appreciation for them. Breathing in all those people,
breathing out enormous goodwill and compassion.
And then remember that there are many, many other beings on this planet,
beings who live on and in the earth and on and in the water and on and in the air,
so many different kinds of beings, bird beings and mammal beings and bug beings and
little tiny one-celled beings, so many different beings. Breathing them all in,
all of these beings, all of this creation and breathing out your friendliness,
your goodwill, your wishes for peace to every being that inhabits this planet.
Breathing in all those beings,
breathing out friendliness,
compassion, gratitude to each one.
But not only those kinds of beings, but also the plant beings,
all the many different kinds of plants who share this planet with us,
who as someone recently said are smart enough to eat the sunshine and put out oxygen.
What a gift, all the plants, big plants, trees, grass, flowers, algae,
little one-celled organisms, many, many, many kinds of plants. Breathing them in
and breathing out your compassion, your gratitude. We would not be here without them.
Breathing in and breathing out.
And then the earth and the air and the water itself, themselves,
this planet that we have not taken such very good care of. Breathing in the awareness of this
planet, again, this beautiful ball floating in space. Breathing out our kindness, our wishes for
peace, our compassion, our sorrow, our gratitude, our joy. Breathing in the planet itself, breathing out.
Breathing in, breathing out. And then if you'd like, we can take one big step further,
knowing that out there in those trillions of galaxies, there may be other beings.
So we can bring in all of that mystery, breathing it in, all of the galaxies in the planets and
who knows what kind of beings are out there. And breathing out our friendliness, our goodwill.
Meeting the unknown with friendliness and goodwill, breathing in
and breathing out.
Breathing in, breathing out.
May all beings have happiness and the cause of happiness.
May all beings, everywhere, in any form, in any place, in space and time,
have happiness and the cause of happiness. May they be free of suffering and the causes of suffering.
They never be disassociated from the supreme happiness, which is without suffering.
May they remain in boundless equanimity, free from attachment.
May all beings come to awakening, not one left behind.
