Practice Note : Awareness Holds 
Everything

Since ancient times in Buddhism , the word ‘dharma ’ is 
said to come from the root meaning to ‘support ’ or to 
‘hold’ – that which supports and holds us.  Since we’re 
doing an awareness practice  here, one way of looking 
at it is that awareness  – our ability to pay attention  – 
also supports us. O ur awareness i s somewhat fluid; it’s 
not a single thing. It can be understood, felt, or 
experienced in different ways depending on how we 
focus the awareness itself. Sometimes  our awareness  is 
like a narrow laser that looks at something in particular. 
We’re  here; the fo cus is there , and we’re looking at it.  
 
But sometimes awareness can feel very broad and 
spacious , and can hold whate ver our experience is. 
Sometimes  it’s difficult to hold or to be present  for 
something  when we’re troubled by  it, and w e’re focusing 
on it in a narrow way. Then it  can be  useful to expand , 
so that whatever is going on  is being held by 
awareness. Awareness  is the container within which our 
life is experienced.  
 It might be interesting  today  to experiment to see if you 
can get a  feeling for a sense of awareness or attention  
that’s  very broad and spacious , like being at the beach  
on a bea utiful day like today. Should we all be at the 
beach?  You see this  beautiful  wide sunset, the horizon, 
and the ocean . The  mind almost feels expansive being 
there. In the expansive  quality , you might also see 
someone on  the beach in the distance walking , and that 
person is within  this wide field of just the beach . The  
awareness is as big as t he beach. I don’t know if that 
image works for you .  
 
So you might be following your breath , and r ather than 
getting narrow on it, being caught by some thoughts or 
concerns  that keep being insistent , or even getting rid of 
your thoughts, to instead open up the awareness – 
open, open , open . Make it really big , as if your 
awareness has the capacity to hold anything at all. 
Everything else is just a play within that wider field.  
 
If that makes sense, you might try that. If  it doesn’t 
make sense , do it the w ay you were doing it. I hope  you 
enjoy your morning. Thank you.
