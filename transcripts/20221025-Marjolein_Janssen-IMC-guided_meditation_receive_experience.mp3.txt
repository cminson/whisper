 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Just sit in a comfortable position where you sit somewhat upright, still comfortable. You can start with feeling the body sitting, knowing that the body is sitting, sitting posture. You can start with some relaxation of the body, starting with the head. Just a gentle invitation to relax, being around the forehead, eyes, jaw, and out of the throat and neck, shoulders. Just make this body part relax, arms and hands, and the upper body for so long. Just a gentle invitation to relax, feel the body, feel the body, feel the body, feel the body, feel the body, just relax in the feet. You can see what is up for you right now, what is in the foreground. You can see what is up for you right now, what is in the foreground. The only thing we need to do is just be present, whatever is most predominant in our experience. Being aware what's happening. What can sometimes help us to not go out and look for experience, to sit back, relax and receive experience just as it arises. A lot of things just naturally arise. We don't have to put any effort in just to receive what is there already. And if we just receive experience, it might not be too difficult to also receive what is unpleasant because it's just arising in awareness. Just like everything else. And just simply be with whatever is happening, whether pleasant or unpleasant or neutral. Just like a mountain, it's just staying strong, whether there is a wind or storm or rain or a storm, or a summer breeze or some... the mountain, it doesn't matter, it's just there receiving it all. And maybe we can be a little bit like this mountain, just receiving whatever is arising in our awareness. No preference. Just being present. Just relax. Receive whatever is most obvious. Be with whatever arises, whether pleasant or unpleasant or neutral. Just like a mountain, it's just standing there, seeing rain and the wind and the sun, the storm. Just like a mountain, knowing that I will pass again. Thank you. You. I think we lost a couple of minutes of meditation. We could send some metta or loving kindness towards each other, air in the zoom room, maybe those who do this meditation later from audio dharma. May all who listen to this be happy. We can repeat this phrase, this loving kindness phrase for ourselves or others. May all who listen to this meditation be free from suffering. May all who listen to this meditation be at ease. May all, because people, be free. We can share a phrase for all beings everywhere, may all beings everywhere be free. May all, because people, be free.
