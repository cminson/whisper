 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Meditation, you've never come to a center before or taken any meditation classes. I think Hanya said she's not. Hanya, you knew? Great, wonderful, welcome. This class is designed for you. And who has been taking Tanya and Kodo's intro to mindfulness meditation class? Great Sage and Cory and wonderful, welcome. Who took a prior introductory course somewhere? Yeah, okay, great. So for you, some of what I have to say may serve as refresher. And then how many have been practicing for a little while? Maybe you've been practicing for a few months, if you've been practicing for at least a few months. And about how many have been practicing for a year, or how about more than a year? Decades, yes, decades. Okay, so this day is for everyone. And what we're going to be doing is called mindfulness meditation. It's also called insight meditation, which you may have seen on the sign outdoors. What mindfulness, you know, there are a lot of teachers who say, I can't really define mindfulness, but I'll give it an attempt. It's paying attention on purpose to what is happening right here and now. Moment to moment, in the body, in the emotions, in the mind, in your surroundings. But largely, you know, we're turning inward and paying attention to what's arising in us. Now, over time, as we notice what's happening now, we may also be able to see some patterns, some conditioned habits we have. So what comes up routinely may start to teach us quite a bit about how we've been conditioned or what we've learned over the course of our lifetime. And over the time, this practice of mindfulness cultivates a clear, stable, nonjudgmental awareness. Awareness is a capacity we all have. It's a natural thing. Right now, I bet if we did a poll, we'd probably each be able to tell approximately what the temperature in the room is, you know, kind of a little bit about what the weather is, that awareness is functioning all the time for a lot of different purposes. But we're going to aim our awareness at specific things. So this mindfulness meditation practice that we do over and over again can certainly bring calm and clarity to our daily life and to the pressures that we experience in life. And it's also available as a spiritual path that helps us gradually experience more freedom and happiness. It sort of dissolves barriers to wisdom, compassion, and other beautiful human qualities. So it's twofold. Now, how we're going to proceed to begin today is we're going to go through the same sequence that those of you who have been going through the intro class have gone through. And we're doing one skill after another in the skills, build on one another, they complement one another. So we'll start with basics of meditation. And where people often start in this tradition is with mindfulness of breathing. So we'll begin with that. Then the next segment will do a little bit of walking. So we'll start to come into mindfulness of our bodies, in that case, with mindfulness of our feet and legs. Then we'll come back and we'll do a sitting where we develop mindfulness of the body and we take in different kinds of sensations, in addition to those of breathing in the rest of the body. We'll move into next into mindfulness of emotions, feeling. And then we'll do, and by the way, we'll have breaks during this, we'll have other walking meditation periods. So you won't be sitting without a break all day. You'll get plenty of breaks. And often the sitting meditations will be interspersed with walking meditations to help relieve the body and get the circulation going and change it up. We'll move into mindfulness of thinking, something that goes on quite a bit, perhaps. And then we'll have a mindfulness of open awareness. And what that is, is paying attention to the flow of what's happening. So right now, as you experience what's happening, as you sit here, there could be thoughts and then there could be a body sensation. There could be attention to the breath. There could be emotions. And all these things come and go, come and go, come and go. So with open awareness, we pay attention to that changing flow. As we focus on each of what Tanya called anchors, we're going to use each of these things as what we call an anchor. So if you think about, for example, paying attention or being aware of breathing. The way we use that is, let's say a sailor has been sailing all day long and they've been working hard at the tiller and they've been, you know, gauging the winds and doing a lot of work and they decide to come to a rest. They could weigh anchor. They could drop an anchor into the water. And the anchor provides a stable point, you know, so the boat is no longer going to be blown by the wind or caught by the currents or the tides. It's going to stay there. So similarly, we're using the breath to stabilize our awareness and our attention. And we'll, when we're practicing mindfulness of the breath, we'll come back to breathing again and again. And it's not that thinking might not happen or sensation of the body's noticed. Other things will come up, but then we just gently return the attention. When we're aware, the mind has gone off. We'll gently return our attention to the breathing. So there's many different types of anchors. The breathing is one. Then we'll shift to the body. The body could be your anchor of attention. You could keep coming back to sensations in the body again and again. So that's what's meant by an anchor or some people will call it an object of meditation. So please know, it's not that we expect that only breathing is going to be happening when we're practicing mindfulness of the breathing. It's simply that we're going to come back to that anchor again and again. And in doing that, we are training the mind. We're training the awareness to come back to something that will stabilize it. When we start out, we have what some people call monkey mind. It's jumping all around, all over the place. And if you experience that, no problem. There are no mistakes. There are no problems. We'll also offer, with these guided meditations that we'll do on each of these topics, we'll offer some time. We'll talk about them briefly. We'll do this lightly guided meditation. And then we'll offer some time that is just quiet so that you can notice what happens in your mind and body. Have people here, have anybody here been listening to a lot of the morning guided meditations that Gil's been doing at 7 o'clock? Yeah, guided meditations are wonderful. And these guided meditations serve to help give you an idea of what you might pay attention to. You know, to kind of train your mind in, okay, here's kind of how I go about this mindfulness of breathing, for example. But also, guided meditations are a bit like training wheels. And there comes a point where, if you want to ride a bike, you use the training wheels to get your balance. But then after a while, you take them off. And similarly, it's good to practice meditation with the guidance off and just see what happens. Because we learn a whole lot about how our minds have been conditioned and what's going on for us. So just briefly, I wonder how many people here are not so familiar with how you use chairs and cushions and things like that, if you haven't really. Great. I'm going to, and maybe some of you are, but I'm going to give a little brief review of it. It does not matter which, and by the way, when I talk about postures, I want to include that one of the postures that can be used at any time, if you're super sleepy or you just need a break, is standing posture. You can stand. Usually people don't close their eyes when they do this. They keep them resting at a spot on the floor. But you can stand while you're meditating. And you can feel your body swaying a little bit. But it's fine to use anything you need. So you'll see, I usually use a chair. And I'll show you this kind of from the side so you can see it. When you're sitting on a chair, usually what you're trying to do is have your feet flat on the floor and parallel, or you can have your legs splayed a little. If your feet don't reach the floor, there are some cushions and wedges out in the shelves and you can put them under your feet. Ideally, you want your knees slightly lower than your hips or level, but definitely not higher. So if you find your feet don't reach the floor or you need some hip height, you can put a cushion under yourself like this. And generally you sit free of the backrest. With all sitting, we're trying to establish a little bit of an independent posture. And this takes time to develop, by the way. At first, our muscles may feel the new activity. Some of us who have lower back injuries might prop cushions very low behind ourselves like that. So that can help. But then from there, you're going to place your hands somewhere where they're not pulling you forward. They're not pulling your shoulders forward or too far forward. They're comfortably resting on your lap in kind of a symmetrical way. Or when it gets hot, I do palms up so that I have one more evaporative cooling source. You can also rest your hands in your lap like this. Whatever is comfortable for you. Then some people prefer to sit on the floor. It's comfortable for them. And you have a lot of options there. So I'm not going to sit on one cushion because I know I'm not flexible enough. But some people can sit simply on one cushion. The idea with the chair of the cushion, anything, is that you're forming a tripod, a sturdy base for yourself. So I'm going to sit on two cushions. And what that enables me to do, what you want to do, is be able to have both knees forming two corners of the tripod and then the cushion forming the third, your sit bones against the cushion. Sitting on the front third is helpful for stability. And we tend to sit Burmese style or Taylor style like this with one leg and foot in front of the other. If I were sitting here and one knee was still a little high, I just didn't have the flexibility in my hips. I could put a cushion under so that I then have the stability. So use props as you need. And then with each of these things, with sitting on the floor, in the chair, it's helpful to have your upper body, allowing your spine to be alert. You want a balance between alertness, awakeness that helps you focus, and relaxness or relaxation. So sometimes what I do to kind of align myself is I think of additional space between my top vertebra and I tuck my chin just a little bit, not like this, but just a tiny bit down instead of, you know, our head is really heavy. And we can, if we're focusing on meditation, you can see people start to go like that. So what I do to help myself is I lift my shoulders and then drop them back, feel that little bit of space in my spine and feel this balance between alertness and relaxation. It takes time to find these things. People who've been doing this for years take their time to settle into this. So feel free to continually, you know, tiny little adjustments or even big changes. You know, if you're sitting here, like if I tried to sit here like this for the whole time, I'd be very hard on my arthritis and I wouldn't be able to get up off the floor. So another option we have are these benches. I have not frequently used a bench, but theoretically you can sit on it. Oh boy, my knees won't do that, but you can sit on it and balance that way. You can also turn one of these cushions on its end and sit on it like this, and I won't go all the way down because my knees won't tolerate it. Those give you a few options. And as I said, experiment with it. Try different things until you find what helps you find that balance between alertness and relaxation. People also will sometimes use, especially if they have physical challenges, may use lying down meditation. I'm not going to spend time on that today because that's more challenging. It's hard for most of us not to fall asleep. So you can talk to us individually about that. If it's a little bit uncomfortable, that's normal. As we start doing this, it's unfamiliar and it can be a little bit uncomfortable. But often we'll just hang in with it for a little bit to notice what we can notice about that. But please don't hurt yourself. So if something is uncomfortable after a while, a little while, you can intentionally, mindfully move. So if I've been sitting and I find that I'm getting uncomfortable, I may recognize discomfort, recognize I'm going to move, and follow what happens in my body as I make the adjustment. If when you get up from meditation your body hurts, still is in pain, especially after five minutes, that's a sign that you're possibly starting to injure yourself. And you don't need to do that. You can find other ways to support yourself. So just a little bit of an overview of all of this. With any of it, with attention to the posture, with attention to any of these anchors, we're developing our ability to pay attention to our immediate experience instead of being preoccupied with the past or future. As you study the monkey mind, you'll find that, wow, it's pretty frequent that we're thinking about the future or the past. And it could be innocent enough. We might need to think a little bit about tomorrow. But often our preoccupation with this contributes to stress, suffering, fear, and other things that kind of keep us from being free. So mindfulness is learning how to overcome those preoccupations by coming into the lived experience right now, what we're living right now. It relies on this natural capacity we have for awareness. And awareness by itself doesn't judge, it doesn't resist, it doesn't claim. It just notices. It doesn't mean that resistance or judgment might not come up. They might. And then we just notice those too. As I said, there's no problem. It's like, okay, judging is going on. Let me return my attention to what's happening in the breath right now. Our practice is simply to relax and bring forth awareness of what's happening. And this can include, I'm distracted, I feel disrupted. Wow. Yesterday I was foggy all day. It felt like my eyes weren't focused and I was looking through a layer of fog all day long. Fine. I included it in the mindfulness. Wow. Foggy today. There's nothing that isn't supposed to happen. We're not trying to achieve an altered state. We're not trying to be different than how we are right now. We're not trying to become somebody in particular. We are being with just the way things are right now with everything that arises, whether it's comfortable, uncomfortable, we like it, we don't like it. It's all folded into mindfulness. And the freedom is actually in seeing that. You know, you're no longer enslaved by something if you recognize, oh wow, I was just thinking for the last 15 minutes. Okay. Awareness, thinking, let me return to the breathing. There's a lot of disentangling ourselves that can go on from these conditioned habits and we can develop a friendlier, more compassionate relationship with the stuff that comes up. I've sat down here before and found that my breathing was just incredibly labored. I was like, wow, I'm just working at breathing. And instead of thinking, oh, I'm a bad meditator and that's wrong, I got the ability over time to go, okay, today for whatever reason, the body is really grabbing air. Or another time sitting down here thinking like crazy. Wow. And then recognizing, you know what, I just had an incredibly stimulating day. No wonder the mind is being pulled into thinking. Mindfulness of thinking, return to whatever anchor I was using. So this is what I mean by we can be compassionate and friendly towards it. It's just the way we human beings become conditioned. So mindfulness again, just attentively being present with what's happening here and now on purpose, no matter what it is. And it's called a practice in the same way that we practice a piano or a musical instrument. We come back and we do it again, do it again, do it again. We don't, we're not trying to get perfect the first time and there is no perfect or imperfect anyway. We're just practicing, practicing awareness and it develops. Well, if we can just set aside any expectations, any judgments, if they come up like, okay, I've got an expectation that I'm going to be peaceful. Okay. It's an expectation. And what's actually going on is, okay, there's some calm. There's some energy in the body. The breath is coming to support the speaking. The body's pretty tired. Just, you know, this is what's happening. So with that, that's just a little scope of why we're doing this, what we might be able to receive from it. And the biggest part of it, relax, enjoy the day, appreciate anything you're discovering or aware of. Welcome. Thank you. A lot to take in. I'm not going to move into a breathing meditation, but I'm wondering if you, if you need a break. Can you nod your head if you think, yeah, yeah, five minutes, please go ahead and take care of yourselves. Finding your posture. Finding your body. Giving it to your cushion, the earth, your chair, your bones to hold. Letting things settle. Just in this simple, direct way, connecting with your felt, lived, present moment experience. Your mind will think. Seeing if you can play with resting more awareness, on the directness of your experience. We'll start that with the breath this morning. Seeing if the breath can be sort of in the center of your awareness, the center of your experience. It can be helpful to start with some longer, slower, fuller conscious breaths. With the exhale it can be helpful to invite a letting go feeling. It can be with the inhale, bringing your shoulders up towards your ears, kind of squeezing in that way. And then with the exhale, letting the shoulders fall back and down. Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I calm my mind. So we'll become a little bit more intimate with our breathing experience. Maybe just starting with knowing your breathing in as you breathe in, knowing your breathing out as you breathe out. And you can know this by the sensation and the feeling and the flow. And if it's helpful, you can do a quiet noting in your mind of in with inhale and out with exhale. Seeing what's supportive for you, what helps you connect more fully with the inhale and the exhale. Thank you. Thank you. And if it's helpful, you can also start to include awareness of the breath as it leaves and enters, maybe noticing the temperature of the breath. Where it touches your nostrils. How it feels different coming in versus out. You might out of so notice the feeling of it in your throat. Or feeling the chest as it expands with the inhale and contracts with the exhale. Feel it in your belly. And knowing giving your belly permission to expand with the inhale for the belly to relax. I'm just being curious where it's easiest for you to feel the flow of the breath. What part of your experience of breathing can you rest into more easily? And there's no need to try and stop from thinking or stop hearing or. Feeling. It's more about trying to invite the breath to be in the foreground or in the center of your experience, your awareness. This may be holding a little bit closer to it. Maybe just three breaths at a time. Seeing if you can follow the full flow of the in and the out. Feeling. Feeling. Feeling. Feeling. Feeling easy with ourselves, with our experience. Feeling. Feeling. Feeling. Feeling. Feeling. Feeling. Just in case there's some struggle in the mind. Experience of breathing. Maybe. If you have a puppy. Not yanking it around and knowing that we need to be gentle and persistent. Maybe in the way that we learn to enjoy the puppy. While we're also. That it needs a certain amount of room. In the same way, can we give our own minds a little bit of room. While staying connected to the experience that the body knows how to do the breathing that is so natural. And the first thing we do when we come into this world. And the last thing we do when we leave this world is to exhale. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. A constant companion. If you're new to meditation you may see us bowing at the end of meditation. And it's just a way of acknowledging. I've heard it said that the light in me sees the light in you. So it's just an acknowledgement. You don't have to do it, but I want people to know why we do that. What we'll do next is have a chance to do a half hour of walking meditation. And when we do walking meditation, the anchor is the feeling in the feet and legs, or just keeping the focus on the feet and legs, or returning again and again. And generally what's done is we find a place we can go crosswise in the hall here. Maybe we can move some chairs out of the way. You can walk crosswise in the hall, or you can walk outdoors on the front porch, in the gravel, on the sidewalks of the neighborhood. And you pick a path maybe 15 to 20 steps long. And instead of taking a walk, what we're doing is we're walking back and forth. And that gives us an opportunity to stay focused on the feet and legs returning our attention. And to pick a pace that fits with the pace of mindfulness. So this varies by person. A lot of people like to slow down a little bit. Some people like to slow down a lot. But whatever helps you to, or supports you to return your attention to your feet and legs. And it's not that other things won't happen. You know, your eyes may be caught by some bright flower, or you may pick up a sound of a bird you've never heard. Anything like that, it's fine to pause. Notice what the awareness has been drawn to, and ah, hearing. Then come back, focus again on the feet and legs, and continue with the walking. So, one thing about being out on the sidewalks is just please be considerate of neighbors who might be walking by and actually taking a walk and, you know, move out of the way so that they're not struggling to pass you. I would recommend not walking in the parking lot. We'll be having practice discussions, so please don't use this parking lot. The dentist prefers we don't use the parking lot there or the one across the street. So instead it's better to find space on the sidewalk. And just taking your time and seeing what you discover as you walk. Some people, I'll just demonstrate a little, often what I do is I pause at the beginning of my walking path and allow my attention to collect. And for some people they're just noticing the movement of their feet and legs. They come, okay, you know, I notice my mind drifted off to a sound outside. Back to the feet and legs. I come to the end of my path, take a breath and pause, and notice the movement of my feet and legs as I turn around. For other people, sometimes the way I'd like to do it is I'd like to feel the lifting, the motion, the settling of the foot against the ground, lifting the other foot, the motion of the leg forward, settling the foot against the ground. So you can do it in a more general way or a more focused way like that. A couple of people have signed up for practice discussions during that time. So Tanya and I will be in the back parking lot in chairs back there to meet with you if you signed up. So meanwhile, please enjoy the meditation. We will come back at 11.35. And if you're somewhere nearby, Richard will ring a bell, focus on body meditation, and I'll start with a few comments. What we're doing today is we're building our ability to notice what's happening right here and now. We're starting with the breath as an anchor or the movement of our feet and legs and walking meditation as an anchor, using those anchors to stabilize the attention and bring it into the here and now. We're also noticing when the attention drifts away from the here and now and when it comes back. So we're going to move in this next meditation from the sensations of breathing to a broader sense of feeling in the body, the rest of our physical experience. The reason we do this or what's great about it is that the body is always operating in the present moment. It's breathing in the present moment, the heart's beating in the present moment, everything's going on in the present moment in the body. And when we bring the mind to those things that are happening in the body right now, they're working in harmony. And this is different than, for example, if you sit your body down here and your mind is planning what you'd like to eat for dinner and thinking about what happened at work yesterday, then these two are not in harmony. So first we'll in this meditation, we'll take in sensations of breathing as fully as possible and then we'll turn to the body. I want to make the distinction that the mindfulness or awareness we're bringing is not in itself commentary or judgment or evaluation of the breathing or sensations in the body. And not judging ourselves. We're just training ourselves to notice here and now how the breathing is feeling. Sensing sensations of the breathing, sensing sensations in the body. We could call that knowing the breathing or knowing the body. Now commentary and judgment may happen anyway. If they come up, you can just notice, ah, I'm judging myself a little bit. And then maybe release that, relax and return to the breathing or the body. For some of us, we spend so much time thinking that it may, you know, sometimes we're not so aware of our body and it may be a slow reawakening. Don't worry if that's the case. Just allow yourself to notice what you can. And sometimes we can use a word like here to bring ourselves back to the body here and now. So I'll go into a guided meditation now, giving yourself a moment to reestablish your posture in a way that's alert, alert spine and also relaxed. And taking time to make those little adjustments, maybe rolling the shoulders and letting the out breath bring some ease. Perhaps taking a few longer, slower breaths. And letting the breathing return to normal, whatever that is in this moment, there's no right or wrong way to breathe. It can be helpful to scan the body from head to foot, noticing sensations in the head right now, the scalp, the forehead, the cheeks and jaw. Perhaps bringing some ease to them, perhaps letting the jaw drop open a little, relaxing it. With the mask on, sometimes I find I breathe with my mouth open. With mask off, I gently bring the lips back together. And letting the attention flow down the neck to the shoulders, perhaps allowing the shoulders to drop a little, letting the weight of the arms and hands rest comfortably on your legs or lap. Letting attention glide down the back, upper, middle, lower back, noticing what's there. If it's possible to soften an area, you can soften it, or if there's activity there that remains there, simply noticing that it's there. It's not a problem. Allowing whatever is present. With the next exhale, perhaps relaxing the belly, softening the hips, if it's possible, letting gravity receive the weight of the legs and feet against the floor. You may become more broadly aware of the entire body sitting here. You might feel a sense of aliveness, a little bit of vibration or pulsing, some energy or some relaxation, sleepiness or alertness, warmth, cool air in some places. Just allowing yourself to take in that broader sense of the body sitting here in the home. Just to get an idea or a feeling for what it is to feel the sensations of the body, for a moment turning the attention to the sensations in the right hand, you might feel a light pressure of where the hand is in contact with your leg or in contact with your other hand. Perhaps there's some warmth in certain areas. Perhaps coolness in other areas of the hand. Perhaps you can feel a little pulsing or vibration in the fingertips or somewhere in the hand. Taking in whatever sensations are present in the right hand, that's what we mean when we say paying attention to sensations in the body. Sometimes we can be aware of an absence of sensation in a particular area of the body and that's also fine. We're returning the awareness now to a broader sense of the overall body as it sits here, the whole body. Becoming aware of how the body experiences the sensations of breathing. It may be through sensations of the chest rising and falling. Perhaps you experience the belly expanding and then releasing or sensations flowing in and out of the nose or throat. Wherever you feel the physical sensations of breathing, centering on those sensations. If there's any commentary or evaluation, simply noticing it and gently returning attention, centering it on the sensations of breathing in and breathing out. If it's difficult for you being with the breathing, simply acknowledge the difficulty and be with it as best you can. Returning to the sensations of breathing wherever it's most prominently felt in the body. Then letting go of any effort to be with the breathing and allowing your attention to turn to the strongest or most obvious sensations in the body. It might be the feeling of your hands resting against your thighs or your feet against the floor or cushion. It may be something else. If it disappears as you are aware of it, allowing your attention to be present for the next prominent sensation that arises.. The attention could return to the sensations of breathing if that is the most prominent until something else becomes the most pronounced in the attention, in sensation in the body.... If there is discomfort in the body, simply noticing that. No need to try to get rid of it or to focus in on it. Just include it in the global sense of the body sitting here. Just allow your attention to take in other sensations in the body as well... If the attention is drifted away into thinking or somewhere else sounds, simply noting where it went and gently returning to the most prominent sensation in the body right now... If there is a need to adjust your posture, remembering to be mindful as you feel the need, as you begin the movement, enduring the movement, just feeling the sensations of moving... If a sensation in the body is getting very strong, it's possible to be with it from a greater distance, imagining being a bird high above the building and taking in the strong sensation from a distance.. You can shift your posture if it's getting to be too much. If something is very strong, first maybe hanging out with it for a few minutes. And then if it's wearing the mind or exhausting the body, then mindfully moving to a more comfortable posture. Staying with the sensations of the movement and noticing what changes after the movement.... Renewing the attention to what the most prominent sensation is now. Perhaps entering the sensation more fully, feeling whether it varies or is steady.. Seeing if it stays or dissolves...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... So meditation, like life on planet Earth, can be likened to living here with all kinds of variations in the weather. We have periods in meditation when it's like a calm day with blue skies and no wind, just peaceful. Other times it's like a storm has arisen and suddenly we're in the middle of thunder clouds of emotion or a blizzard of thoughts. Or it's a very, very hot day and the body is very uncomfortable. Sometimes the analogy is used that the mind is like a clear blue sky and thoughts are like the clouds passing by. We establish mindfulness of the breath, relaxed, contented, and sooner or later a thought cloud floats by or a whole storm of thoughts come by. We may not even see it coming. We just suddenly aware that we've been caught on those thought clouds for some time. A really common one is planning. You know, that we're tomorrow bubbles up in your mind or later today bubbles up in your mind and you're thinking of what you're going to say or do. Or a thought comes along about the past and you start living in the world of regrets or beautiful memories, how wonderful the past was. You've still gotten on a cloud. The mind is caught maybe by these passing clouds and storms and some are beautiful. You know, thinking is totally healthy and appropriate at different times. And they can carry us away into areas where we lose our stability or our groundedness. And we lose our independence from what we're thinking about. We're really caught in it. So one of the things we're doing with mindfulness and meditation practice is we're returning again and again to the groundedness of awareness. We use awareness of the breathing, awareness of the body, awareness of motions, awareness of thinking itself. Thinking, thinking and learning not to get totally lost in the weather, whatever the weather is. So you can't stop thinking from arising and you need not try. But you don't necessarily have to pick it up. Maybe you had a little bit of an experience with this meditation that instead of picking up the content you could look at, oh, I'm noticing how my face and head tense up when I'm thinking or noticing the tone of the voice or the kinds of images that arise or simply noticing the fact of thinking. It's a huge and important part of human life. So we're not anti-thinking in the scene. And when we learn to clearly see it, we have a choice with it. We have a choice of how to relate to it. Instead of being dragged around by our thinking and wherever it wants to go, we start to become a little less identified with it. We are not our thoughts. During the class that Tanya and Koto have been teaching, they read this lovely book, You Are Not Your Thoughts, a child's book, but could be an adult book. It's a great book. And a lot of times we tend to believe for a while that we are our thoughts. That's who we are. But actually, if we, you know, it's kind of like if I stop thinking, then who am I? Where am I? So it can be challenging to let go of all the stories we create about ourselves, the interpretations we have of events, past, present, future. So an important, really important part of mindfulness is learning to see this phenomenon of thinking. We're not at war with it. We're not trying to push it away or say it's bad. But we can notice some thinking is painful. Some is pleasant. We get to be more grounded with it and start to notice things we haven't noticed before about our thinking. You know, are we ruminating a lot, stirring up a lot of anxiety, trying to rework the past until it works out just right? I used to rework the past all the time, like trying to make a more perfect past in my thinking. Guess what? It never worked. Or to control, okay, if I just configure this out, I can control the chaos that is life. So by learning to be mindful of thinking, we can start to notice those patterns. Oh, look at that. I'm planning again. Look at that. I'm ruminating. Look at that. I'm fantasizing and drifting off into this pleasant feeling. Just noticing the emotional quality that it can have, sometimes the tone of voice you hear, all these aspects are really giving you information about how you've been conditioned. And it's valuable every time you step back from thinking and just notice that it's happening. You're no longer enmeshed in it. And this is actually a huge movement of mind. And it takes time. It takes time because we've developed a lifetime of being enmeshed and engaged in our thinking. So it's not always easy. For a while, I had to deliberately think thoughts to be mindful while thinking those thoughts in order to catch the feeling of what this was like. Sometimes thinking just evaporates when you're all ready to work with it. Poof, it's gone. Or it can be quite clear. But when just this is an invitation, when it arises in meditation and it's easy to let go of, let it go and come back to the breathing, come back to the body, when it's difficult, sooner or later it's going to be difficult. And you're going to be caught and you're going to think, oh my gosh, I was just gone for the last half hour thinking. And when you come back, that's always a great moment, like Tanya was saying, I'm back. I was aware that thinking was just happening. And you can think, oh, I was caught in thinking. It's not a huge problem. We're just developing the awareness of coming back and then noticing as much of it as we can. And strengthening, every time we notice these things, we're strengthening our ability to be aware in the here and now, which leads to more freedom. So thank you for that. And we're now, you know, I agree. So we're going to take a 15 minute break. You can walk, you can stretch. So enjoy the 15 minutes and come back at 3.10, please. Maybe there were moments today of surprise. I remember during a walking period, the wind was blowing and the redwood tree, you know, it was like rain. It sounded like rain. And every little dried little thing that came down made me smile. I felt joyful. It was like I was so present for this delight, this surprise. The warm air, but with wind and the sound of rain, but knowing it wasn't water. Just maybe there were some moments like that to you that happened to you today. A different way of relating to a thought or a feeling. Just giving it some space right now. To be held in this maybe wide riverbank. Maybe some of the things that arise right now, they might need a little more snugly energy. They might need the riverbank to be a little closer. So playing with that too. Opening a little bit again. And then feeling what needs a little more tension, touching, a little more connection. And then resting back again. Just like the sky is incredibly spacious, so generous. Does the sky care that planes fly through? Does it care that there's a weather storm? Or that it's clear? No, the sky is fine with it all. It knows it's the sky. Nothing offends it. There's room for it all. And this is the type of practice we'll invite now. Spacious, open, open awareness. And when you find that you have a hard time being spacious, it's okay to find your anchor and breathe a little bit. Grounding, centering. And then when it feels okay to relax and open up again, no problems. Can't do anything wrong, no mistakes. Just being as easy as you can with whatever arises. And using the skills and tools we covered today as you need them. Just trusting yourself. Paying attention to the results of how you meet your experience. So maybe putting your hand on your heart. Just a sense of, okay, I can feel myself, I'm here. I'm going to bear loving witness. Just setting an intention really. Inviting the mind, the heart, the body to be open. And for awareness to witness. Witness it all. Can we be the knowing? Be with the knowing. Allowing experience, thoughts, emotions to move through and watch. But we don't have to be them. I'm not my thoughts, I'm not my feelings. It's a part of my experience and I can know it. Can be with it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's the nature of the mind to notice things. We come into a space and we notice the chairs or the decorations or the people. How someone's dressed or what we're trained to do. So in this practice the invitation is actually to do the opposite, to notice the space in between things. To look up around, to broaden, expand, to invite the mind to be open, spacious, to connect with awareness, knowing it all. And noticing the space, the emptiness, the allowing. The mind can be boundless. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It might be really helpful to notice the gaps. The end of a sound. It's fading away. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. New sounds will come and then noticing when they fade. It's very natural for the mind to move from one thing to the next. On the gaps, endings, sort of sinking into it, letting it soak in those moments of quiet or ease, noticing, receiving the space. If it feels appropriate for you, you might, I'll tell you this and you can decide if you want to try this. But you might actually very gently and slowly open your eyes and just notice where the eyes go, what they take in. And then see if you can't shift your gaze to something that is space, the gap, the openness, the light. And just try and hold your attention on that emptiness, that space. The objects are still there, but we're shifting our awareness to what we're taking in. In the same way, you may close your eyes again and just see how that helps you practice in the last five minutes with connecting with the spaciousness, the sky within. I'm going to ring the bell slowly and allow silence between the bells to allow you space and time before you come out of the meditation to stay with. causing light, WHY? Whether or not you feel your disappeared. It's very difficult. Thank you. Taking some time to stand and stretch or just shift the position of the body as you need. Noticing how the body is right now. Giving it whatever it needs. Thank you. Thank you for reflections, questions, anything that you'd like to share and I'd like to include the YouTube folks. So thanks Richard for noticing anything that they have to share. It just could be anything about the meditation or the meditations you just went through the day, a general question or a reflection on what you've been noticing and how that is for you. Yes please. So I've been meditating for a few months and I've noticed that it does help with the strength of thoughts and emotions but as you kind of dig deeper into some of the thoughts and emotions they tend to be triggered by specific strong negative core beliefs. So while meditation seems to help mitigate the symptoms of these core beliefs, it doesn't really feel like it helps really address the issue at hand which is like these strong negative core beliefs. So I'm curious how you work with that. Well first of all it's great that you notice that they're coming out of these core beliefs. You know we all get conditioned into beliefs, views about ourselves, about others and about how the world works over a lifetime. So the fact that you've identified that is great and I would say allowing time for yourself to see the manifestations of that is much more valuable than you might imagine because sometimes these play out in how we hold our body, how we think, what emotions come up, how we interact. It's a huge world. So taking time to notice that world and then over time there may be something evident about what's underneath the core beliefs or what all is in there. You may gradually kind of unfold for you and ultimately it's just a process that I think requires a lot of patience. Great, great question. Great observation. I think I just want to offer something just to see because you know some people are more or less connected with this idea of core beliefs. Maybe a way to think about a core belief is sort of like the earth is round. It's like kind of a fact, right? For most of us, not all of us, but it's just within your own being it's so just unquestionable. It's just there. It's like almost you don't even know it's there because it's so just accepted. And a view might be more like or a general belief might you might notice it sounds like something in your head. It's more like you know it's really impolite to do acts. You're supposed to stop at the stop sign all the way, not roll. Like that's like more of like more of a kind of a belief that's just sort of you know something that you if there's more narration around it narrative. Right. So just to try and get a feel for how core beliefs exist within us they're very they're kind of structural. They're kind of structural so they can be hard to notice. And so you know when and they are very influential in terms of like very influential in some ways that are kind of I don't know out of sight almost. But just holding that just sort of saying oh there's a core belief and like sort of maybe doing some of this opening around it with this curiosity like is the earth really round. How do I know that it's around you know kind of idea and what happens if I believe the earth is around. What would it be like if I believe the earth was flat instead sort of just loosening it up a little bit and exploring it in that way can might be helpful. Thank you. One of the things I really appreciate the way Tonya opened that up just now and some examples. This is where practice often leads us. We may be going along noticing our thoughts noticing the patterns of our emotions and what happens and suddenly discover that we have a core belief. I'm not good enough or a core belief. Other people do stuff wrong and that's what makes me unhappy. So there are very many of these but that is actually what often what this meditation peels back to reveal that helpful. Great other reflections comments questions things you noticed today that you'd like to share with others as a gift. I would just like to say that I'm just kind of blown away with how moved I am just to be in the space again after covid and and the Buddha statue so unperturbed and the Redwood tree you know that it's just. I don't know just a lot of feelings have come up and I want to say thank you Liz and Tanya I feel very nurtured. Thank you Jan. Maybe I'll say to this moment that I also feel very nurtured by the YouTube people. It really helps me to know that there's this worldwide net of people connected to IMC and practicing with us supporting us and how important each of you are here to help. You know you're helping create the space that holds what we're all sharing together. So thank you Jan and every one of you and all of you out there. All right. Nina. Yeah to your question about the gift to give. It's mostly really appreciation for for both of you for the effort you have put into coming and making this space available for us. And I too have felt the care that you have put into it. And so so thank you. I'm so touched. Thank you Nina. So speaking of YouTube Diane is the last name working with emotions I sometimes tend to go down the rabbit hole of looking for why that emotion came up. Yeah that's a really good observation. And there's many different ways to work with emotions. One thing that's interesting about mindfulness is oftentimes we can let go of the Y and notice that something is happening. Anger is arising. Calm is arising. Joy is arising. Disappointment is arising. Just that we notice that's rising. We notice how it affects the body. We notice how thoughts may spin out of it. So that's one very amazing advantage of mindfulness that sometimes we don't have to know why. And things can transform just by noticing them and that they arise and that they're rising. Of course it can be very helpful to understand the origin of emotions as well. So sometimes meditators may spend time journaling or reflecting on the background of their emotional life. What you were taught to accept as common emotions growing up with the people you grew up with. What emotions surface most frequently. So this this is also a very worthy area of study. So there's no one way but there are many ways to work with it. Thank you Liz. Diane. Is that what her name was? Diane. One thing I want to say to Diane is you describe something so for me visceral which is the rabbit hole going down the rabbit hole which it describes actually to me it says you have an awareness of what it feels like to get entangled and caught in the emotion. That's sort of how it feels in my body. So that is a huge gift that you can describe it that way. And so again sort of the opposite of that might be the riverbed allowing things to flow through the opening up around the experience even if you find yourself in the rabbit hole. It's like this and then OK so I feel like this and then you know is it possible to open up around it. Is it possible to kind of create a little bit of space because emotion is an experience. It's an experience we're having but again it's not who we are. And if we're over involved in it we're we don't have the space to let it move through and we tend to be reigniting reigniting and then the teasing apart idea of that the raft practice where we tease it apart. Here is a memory. Here's a view. Here's a core belief. You know here's an image just trying to again it's like everything gets knotted up and tied up together. And it's pretty hard to deal with things when they're like that. So relaxing opening and then sort of helping sift through can be helpful. So I'll ask Diane if she feels that that was helpful and if she has any further questions she can. Well she's responded a little bit so great because she's typing and I'm speaking for her. So she says thank you. And then yes as you described the rabbit hole process and then she says the rabbit hole to me seems more like the thinking process around the emotion. And then Diane says the why of it sort of thinking about the emotion the why of it which is my view true too. Yeah really good points that she's raising that and that time and just alluded to that there's such a thing as fuel that we throw on the fire. We're in the rabbit hole and we throw more thoughts in and we're down further in the rabbit hole or we can have this thought of is there any way I can open out of this. So this is a huge area practice and I'd encourage patience infinite patience for allowing discovery over time about emotions. I have a great quote I want to share if I can find it. It's by Rick Rordon. You can't think your way out of your emotions. You can't think your way out of emotions. Doesn't work. Yeah they're already here for one thing. They and they are a record perhaps of our conditioning because they show us in a moment in a flash how we've been conditioned you know around the thoughts that have fed it the experiences that have fed it. They're kind of a flash reaction summarizing the past. Thank you. Great. Any other reflections questions comments. Great. There. Nana has it. Thank you Nana. Yes the question before kind of brought up. So if you like are with an emotion and maybe you don't really understand why it was triggered. Do you just kind of let that be and be okay with it. In summary. That's part of that. You recognize what you can about it. You allow what it is even if it's kind of unknown it's kind of murky. Allow it. Feel it however it feels notice where it is in the body. And even if you can't tease it apart that kind of accept allow feel will serve you trust that it's there for a reason. It's you know it's coming up for in response to something and you can be with the fact that it's there. Yeah that's it you know one thing to know it helps me sometimes to look at neuroscience and what we know from that about studying the brain and one way they describe the brain in neuroscience is that it is an organ and its job is to predict. And it predicts based on past experience or associations and so sometimes emotions can be triggered before we're even conscious of what's going on because the brain is predicting something and it doesn't come to be but the emotion still got triggered or we don't notice that it didn't come to be whatever we were expecting because we get so caught up in our our predicting our anticipating you know mind. So it's a tricky thing. Thank you and also thank you for taking the data set this is very helpful. Great. I think one of the gifts of mindfulness is it gives us choice having the capacity to sit back a bit to observe to pause gives us so much more freedom in our life so much more choice without it without the mindfulness without the capacity to kind of let go or sit back. Here's a quote a different quote about emotions I feel like this is what can happen to us it's not it's Elizabeth Gilbert says this and it I don't think it's a fact the way it is but without mindfulness I think is what happens. Your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts and you are the slave to your emotions and that's what happens without the capacity to witness to observe to know to let go to pause to breathe to choose. Pointing to something really valuable about mindfulness meditation practice and where this leads because you'll come to a point after you've done this for a while where you can see the rabbit hole. You can go I'm not going down that rabbit hole. It's not worth it. I could worry and worry about this thing that's never happened. Most of the horrible experiences in my life have never happened. It's just the mind has created these. And so you can see the choice after a time after observing these things for a while or the horrible experience happened once but I've really lived it a hundred times. And I didn't have to. Any last comments things that have happened that you're sitting with. So I'd like to invite everybody to take a moment to recognize how much you've been through today. You've actually been through a significant amount of practice and training a whole day devoted to mindfulness to seeing what's coming up and how that's been for you. Maybe some things you really found helpful you could use them it was really great and some things were challenging or maybe it was all challenging or it was all helpful. But just appreciating that whatever you put into today every moment of mindfulness matters is what that's what I've noticed in the years of practice that every moment every sitting it may not the fruits of it may not be apparent right away. In fact it often isn't but later something has suddenly shifted something shows up like wow it really was useful. It really was useful to sit and maybe reflecting for a moment. Are you. Do you feel different in some ways than when you came in this morning. And then how what's your relationship with how it was today. Meaning do you have an attitude towards it like you have that felt that felt really good and wonderful or. I'm worried I'm not sure I can get this thing or it could be anything but just taking a moment to notice what your relationship is with what has happened today is just information about conditioning. We could look at today as a day full of experimentation and play and just learning new things. One of the things that can be helpful is reflecting on any wholesome or helpful or good feeling that has come up for you today or is present with you right now. Now even if you're just a little bit calmer than you were when you came in this morning that landing on and feeling beneficial feelings or body states or states of mind or even the spaciousness that Tanya just invited us into just that quality of spaciousness. When we take the time out to appreciate those feel them that reinforces those beautiful qualities and they can re arise again. And if today showed you some difficulties some areas that were challenging I'd like to say that's also excellent that you saw that and to keep in mind that this is called the gradual path. It slowly unfolds us in our own time. Allow that allow it to unfold. There's a kind of story I'm going to paraphrase maybe not quite accurately but a story in one of the books that Gil Fronstall has written called the monastery within. That's about you know a monastic who's living in the monastery who's on fire to be totally free and asks the abbess. So how long will it take me if I really really focus on this and the abbess says something maybe seven years and the monastic says yeah but what if I really work on it harder. Oh it'll take a lot longer. So I love that story because you know we can we can move at a more natural pace and let ourselves unfold and show us what we need to look at and know we don't need to rush ourselves. Another thing Gil says that I really love is that if this practice leads us to full liberation in this lifetime. Wonderful. But if it doesn't we've lived a way better life in the process and I'll attest that the last 18 years of my life have been happier and happier and happier and more smooth and free of affliction. So what's not to love about that. One of the things you can do taking this practice back into your life is use some of these tools even during the middle of the day. I've known parents that have trained their young children to we're both going to stop right now and we're just going to take three breaths. I've had a practice for a long time of whenever I get up from my chair at work or at home I tune into the body and how it feels to walk to the restroom to the kitchen wherever I'm going. I just feel that walking. So there's these many mindfulness breaks throughout the day and as you pay attention taking breaks out to breathe paying attention to the body catching yourself in the middle of thinking or a feeling you could say you're building more steadiness more collectedness more sometimes it's called concentration. But by noticing these things in some of the questions we can notice what we're feeding. There's this story about the wolf you feed and the wolf you feed grows stronger and the wolf you don't feed grows weaker so we can watch what we're feeding. You know as we watch our thoughts as we watch our emotions and as we watch our attitudes we can understand what have I been feeding. Am I feeding things that are helping me or am I feeding things that are making things harder for me. These are just some of the things that may come up for you. So as we leave today this is a wonderful center that has a lot of programs that can help you continue this practice. Tanya is going to have a class in building a practice that's coming up so I'd encourage you to attend that and about a month from now I think there will be another day long with Kodo and Tanya. So that's a resource. There are sittings on Sundays, Monday nights. There's a half day on Wednesday that's wonderful to attend if your schedule has that flexibility. And there are all kinds of programs Tuesday morning Thursday evening. So there's a lot of ways here to continue to cultivate your practice. It's valuable to continue to build a daily practice of finding a time of day that you can do this sitting practice that works for you and sometimes it takes some experimentation. You know first thing in the morning is better or the evening or do I do it during my lunch break but even if you start small, you know start with a 20 minute meditation, do that for a while then maybe 25 or even if it's 20, 21, 22. You can build a practice but the daily quality of it can really help to reinforce what you've been learning today and it's very interesting but often the day goes better no matter what kind of sitting you have. It's quite an interesting phenomenon. We have a library here with lots of different books on Buddhism that can be checked out and brought back. There's as you know there are these online offerings, Gills Morning Sitting and Dharma Talk. So there are tons of tools and opportunities here at IMC and online. The YouTube folks I'm usually one of you. I don't live here so I'm normally out there in cyberspace with the rest of you. So I wonder if there are any questions about what's available here or about Tanya's class. Maybe you could say a little bit about when that's going to be. It started last week. But pretty much every Thursday night assuming people show up I'll be teaching a class one class after another. So that right now the plan is establishing a practice is the focus for the month of September. October will be let's talk about practice. November will be living the practice. December will be the Four Noble Truths. So each month will sort of be a class format where there's a combination of teachings, guided practices and small group discussions and Q&A. So we'd love to see any of you there at any time. And it will be on YouTube. Yes. I forgot to mention one of my favorites that happens here every night, every week night at six o'clock. Pacific time is called Happy Hour and Happy Hour is dedicated to some practices that we work with qualities of loving kindness or we could just call it kindness, compassion, equanimity, sympathetic joy. So qualities of the heart that are that really feel good. And actually that's the way we're going to end today. So some of you may never have heard of this practice before, but we'll just do a couple of minutes of it. And so you may find a comfortable posture this time. And allow yourself to take some breaths. Sometimes this kindness practice or loving kindness practice, which is also called Metta practice, is done in the form of phrases. So we'll do just a little bit of that right now. Bringing to mind the effort that you've put in today, the way you've come back to the breath, come back to the body and worked with what we've presented today. Really bringing that fully into your mind and heart, seeing that really wonderful effort on your part. And seeing that part of yourself that would really like to be more free in the world, be more peaceful in the world, happier in the world. And seeing to that part of yourself, may I be healthy? May I be happy? Sincerely wishing that for yourself? May I be safe and free from all harm? May I be peaceful? Even taking the part of yourself that may have had some difficult moments today or found some things challenging, bringing that to mind as a dear friend, thinking of your dear friend and wishing, may I be happy? Even in the face of difficulty, may I be healthy? May I be safe and free from all harm? May I be peaceful? Days like this are possible because you all come together in YouTube and here in the room. We've supported one another to do this practice, looking around and seeing each other sincerely working with this so we can extend these same wishes to one another. May you be healthy. May you be happy. May you be safe and free from all harm. May you be peaceful. In taking all the benefit that we've experienced from today that we know of and the benefits we don't yet know of, we can wish them for the world around us. May this practice that we've done today ripple out and benefit those close to us in our lives and strangers whom we don't know. By dedicating the benefit of this practice, whatever it might be, to all the people and creatures around us, may you all be healthy. May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful and free. May all beings be happy.
