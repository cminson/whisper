 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Dialogue box. So once more warm welcome to happy hour. We're delighted to see all of you here. And tonight I just have a couple of words to say. I've been thinking about the importance of non-contention, non-argument within ourselves and with the people we love. And by that I don't mean not having conflict. Conflict is a natural, normal part of being human and being in relationship. But I mean the sort of festering holding on to grudges or dislikes or irks about things we don't like about ourselves or things we don't like about those we love. Tonight I'm going to focus more on ourselves and I'm going to do it by reading this poem that's by Julia Fehrenbacher entitled The Most Important Thing. She writes, I am making a home inside myself, a shelter of kindness where everything is forgiven, everything allowed. A quiet patch of sunlight to stretch out without hurry, where all that has been banished and buried is welcome, spoken, listened to, released. A fiercely friendly place I can claim as my very own. I'm throwing arms open to the whole of myself, especially the fearful, fault-finding, falling apart, unfinished parts. Knowing every seed and weed, every drop of rain has made the soil richer. I will light a candle, pour a cup of hot tea, gather around the warmth of my own blazing fire. I will howl if I want to, knowing this flame can burn through any perceived problem, any prescribed perfectionism, any lying imitation, every heavy thing. I am making home inside myself where grace blooms in grand and glorious abundance, a shelter of kindness that grows all the truest things. I whisper hallelujah to the friendly sky. Watch now as I burst into blossom. The most important thing, Julia Fehrenbacher. So with that in mind, that invitation to find and be kind to all the little imperfections, any of the sticky parts, and start to meditate. And the invitation is to just the best you can be kind with whatever comes up. And if for some reason what my words aren't resonating, please feel free to use your creativity, use your practice, and do what works for you in this time. So, settling back into comfortable posture, making sure to have turned off any distractions, digital devices of various kinds, cell phones, Slack notifications and whatnot. And just taking a moment to notice how your body is, just as it is. Perhaps starting with a deeper or slower breath or two than usual. Letting go of any excess tension, energy that it took to get through the day and settling here and now. Inviting awareness of the present moment to the forefront of your attention. And allowing extraneous thoughts, leaning into the future or back into the past, to fade to the background, to invite awareness of this body, all its vibrancy, into the center of your internal gaze. And choosing whatever embodied anchor of attention works for you. I'll give a few moments of instruction on the breath before we start the kindness meditation. Inviting the breath into awareness. Using the breath exactly how it's showing up in this moment. Relaxed and warm and warm. Or perhaps shorter or shallower. It's all okay. Resting. Resting the attention of the felt sensations of this body breathing. Setting a resolve, an intention to meet whatever arises in awareness with kindness, compassion, goodwill as best you can. And notice how setting the intention feels in your heart. Noticing, appreciating all of the detailed qualities of the in-breath and the out-breath. Each in-breath, a gift, life-giving air. Each out-breath, a letting go, releasing more fully into the moment. Allowing the recognition of the sensations of breathing to spread beyond the obvious, the belly, chest, nose. Notice the pulsing and tingling, aliveness of motion and transpiration through your core. And allowing that gift of oxygen and life to be known as energies fusing the body. Thank you. You're now calling the attention, gathering the attention. At your heart center, wherever the seep of emotions are for you. Perhaps right around the physical heart or the center of the chest or elsewhere. Noticing, noticing the quality and sensation of breathing in this area and any other sensations that are there. And now bringing to mind someone who makes you smile, you feel safe and seen. Someone easy for you, simple. Could be a human being in your life, a beloved pet or child, or even a being, spiritual being of some kind. Notice how it feels to bring them to mind and to your heart. Could be a felt sense of them, your idea of them or an image of them. And perhaps like a gesture or a silent expression or an out breath offering wishes of love or kindness, goodwill, friendliness towards them. Perhaps breathing it out like soft light. And imagining that it is received happily well. It's helpful to focus your good wishes with words or phrases. Please feel free to use your own in your own language or you can use some version of the words I offer. I'll start with the longer phrases and then move to very short ones. As shorter words build momentum, stability in meditation. May you be safe from inner and outer harm. May you be happy. May you be healthy. Heal as much as possible. May you be peaceful. May you be easeful. May you be free. Be safe. Happy. Healthy. Be peaceful. Be peaceful. Free. Thank you. Thank you. And ending these good wishes to this dear one as benefactor. If you might, receiving the same goodwill, love, kindness, friendliness back from them. Perhaps exhaling your good wishes and inhaling theirs for whatever way works for you. It's okay to be creative. Be safe. Happy. Healthy. Be peaceful. Easeful. Free. Thank you. Thank you. Now still receiving these good wishes from this other woman. In their presence, turn the camera back toward yourself. But both of you are wishing you these good wishes. Perhaps radiating these good wishes through your body, heart, and mind on the out breath. And drinking them in, on the in breath. Safe. Happy. Healthy. Peaceful. Easeful. Free. Receiving metta, kindness through all of the corners of the body, heart, and mind. All of the sticky areas, the weeds, the rocks, the dark corners. Sending kindness, compassion to any insecurities. Any vulnerability. Any bits that are not so welcome. Receiving the non-judgmental, kind regard of this other one as well through all of these places. Nothing left out. You safe. Happy. Healthy. Peaceful. Easeful. Free. Easeful. Savoring, drinking that in. And together with the benefactor. Dear other one, turning those wishes outward, including yourself and also them. And sending those good wishes towards others in your life. Perhaps beings you don't know so well. Maybe neutral or a bit positive, maybe a tiny bit irksome, whatever feels right. Post office, cashier, fellow drivers or walkers or wafer. Re-de-eating outwards into the community of others. Be safe. Happy. Healthy. Be peaceful. Easeful. Free. Allowing the kindness to radiate outwards in all directions. Suffusing yourself, all the sounds, little bits of the body, parts of the heart and mind. Touching others. Softening. Meeting their vulnerabilities, insecurities, unresolved bits of kindness too. Feeling the goodness throughout your whole body, radiating these intentions, these wishes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Time to time, checking in to the body, the heart. Noticing any sensations associated with these beautiful intentions. Greeting whatever is there with kindness, appreciation, rededicating yourself to the wishes of Nata. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now expanding the circle outwards. Allowing these intentions to blossom forth as far or near as they want to go, outwards and unbounded, above, below, around, everywhere. Nourishing this body and heart and nourishing others like the rays of the sun. Safe, happy, healthy, peaceful, easeful, free. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for the sincerity of your practice. And as has become accustomed to my teacher, the invitation is to spend a moment or two in meditative space now wishing kindness to all of the other participants in happy hour. To people's photos or phone icons or names or little video squares here. And perhaps remembering and imagining past participants and future listeners of happy hour and sending them at that too. And as you send it, knowing you're receiving it from the other members of this happy hour Sangha. Thank you. So, time for any reflections people want to share any comments, questions that came up from the meditation or from the brief sharing before it. Yes, Jerry. I thought the poem was very helpful and setting the tone for going deep into loving kindness and, and then also your, your comment within the meditation direction. When you came to issues of health. You spoke about it wasn't just, you know, may I be healthy but may I, it was a, it was a more nuanced approach which I felt was it brought a deeper sense of reflection about taking responsibility or addressing being as healthy as you can. Less, less than just may I be healthy was more gripping in the sense of, may I help. I can't remember the exact phrase but I was in my mind it was like, Oh, this little more of a risk taking of this one that not just may I be healthy but me, some sense of responsibility to look after yourself in terms of trying to be more healthy. So, thank you. Was it helpful, then you want for you personally. Yes. Thank you. I love the thing you said about the personal responsibility. Another meaning that I've also ascribed to it in addition to that one is those of us who live with chronic conditions are less than perfect health or even terminal illness it's as much as possible may I be healthy may I heal. Acknowledging, you know, the wishes of met our wishes right. Yeah, it took it to it took it up. I was gonna say a level but I guess I would say it takes it up many levels in terms of exactly what you were saying there are more granular and personal approach with respect to chronic illness illnesses, you know that we manage. I'm in the professions of helping profession so you know I tell patients health is not a static concept. So what you're getting out there is that aspect, which is much more erudite. So thank you so much. Thank you, and thank you I love health is not a static concept I will be using that. Other comments, questions, stumbling blocks reflections. Thank you so much for those welcome here. I'll just add. Can you read back Amy asked Can you read back for us the first few lines of the poem and happy to give me just a moment to find it again. I used an actual book. I'm buried as welcome. Listened to release a fiercely friendly place. I can claim is my own. Thank you, Neil. Excellent to have the link. I'll leave that one. So, friends, we have come to the point in the evening where those who wish to participate in breakout rooms conversation with each other are welcome to breakout rooms aren't your thing you're welcome to stay here in the main room. Be quiet. We're about six minutes long with a one minute warning setting that up right now. Yes. You can talk about the poem practice or anything else about what has come up tonight in your practice of kindness yourself imperfections, broadly speaking, or you can talk about whatever you want. I'm not there to check on you. Look forward to hearing what you have to say when you get back. You are now in the main. Serena, we're all back in the main session deep bow. Welcome back everybody. Welcome back. I love hearing the laughter coming back in. That was great. So, friends, I'd love to hear how that was for you. You have any bits of insight that emerge for you or just knowledge if you just want to let me in on what you were talking about. You're welcome. Just have a couple minutes. Okay, I'm going to say it, there was not enough time, and I would hope in the future you would add a few minutes. Thank you for the feedback. Neil, yes. We talked about how through extended practice, we feel, I think someone said we're able to be the calm one in the boat when all's going bad. People shared life experiences where this was relevant, particularly relevant today. I won't share those, but it was just very sweet. People talking about how people were treating them and they were being cool about it. I mean, you know, worrying about bad things happening to those people. There was just a very touching session and I'm not to disagree with Michael but maybe just the right life. Okay, thank you. I will also take that feedback into account. Thank you. Yeah, you had mentioned conflict is something else I forget, forget the terminology but if you could talk more about like healthy forms of disagreement and even specifically like sometimes I feel like I have disagreement within my own mind. Thank you. So a big question when we have exactly one minute left, but spoiler alert this is what I'm talking about tomorrow is the between people conflict part. But just to say for ourselves I think the other term I used was inter contention or contention. And the most helpful thing I have found for that with myself is to have compassion for the different parts there in contention and just for the process of how yucky it feels to be in the contention. So to drop beneath it. Often, there's some kind of fear or shame or sense of longing or lack that is driving that inner contention. So short answer to it, what could be a treatise certainly a long conversation. Thank you, Jesse. It's a beautiful question. I'm on top of the hour friends. So, just want to express again my appreciation for each of you for your practice for this song. May the benefits of this practice, touch all of our lives and all of the lives we touch and all of the lives they touch. Be happy, be safe, be happy, be peaceful and free. blessings to all of you and go well, be happy. Thanks everyone. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Thanks so much. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
