 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There. So, hello and welcome to happy hour everyone. So as I've been experimenting together with you in the past two sessions, we just start with practicing together. We start with without a little darmette at the beginning and, and maybe I say a few words at the end, but I introduced a theme, uh, during our meditation. So let's, let's just practice together and be surprised by this being human. So, so let us arrive. Let us arrive in our bodies together, always individually in this seat, in this body that is, that is felt by me and, and also together as a community arriving coming together. Just turning our awareness for a moment with this, the beauty of the togetherness on this little blue planet we call home from different places. And coming together with our intention, cultivate goodness, kindness for the sake of ourselves and others and turning and turning our awareness now to this body, to this heart. Feeling the connection to the earth through our feet, the bottom of our feet, touching the earth, kissing the earth. I am here. Connection of our sit bones with the chair, the cushion in lieu of the earth. I am here. I am here. This earth be my witness, I am here. Relaxing, relaxing the body. So much has happened already before getting here in this moment. Letting it go. We can always pick it up later, but for now prioritizing to give our heart fully completely. To itself, to itself in this practice here. Wholeheartedly here, just here. When this breath is sensation. Letting this breath, the sensations, the song of this breath be the only song. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. I am here. Listen deeply. Listen deeply. Listen deeply. Listen deeply. Listen deeply. Listen deeply. Listen deeply. Let them go with a smile, not now, thank you, please come back later. Embracing, celebrating the nourishment of this breath. As good will, as mental, as kindness to ourselves. What's done is done. Future isn't here yet. Just this moment. Just here. Just here. you settling with each breath and now I'd like to invite you, if you would, bring someone to mind for whom your metta would well care, love whatever nuance of it is a lie for you, for this being flows with ease maybe you feel safe when you think of this being maybe your body relaxes choose someone with whom you have an uncomplicated relationship ideally that's her, simple, children and if they're teenagers now you can imagine when they were young simple someone you appreciate could also be a benefactor a teacher a coach maybe even someone who's touched you through their work their writing, their talks, etc wherever it's easy do you feel good will for this being for this person or being still connected to your body, to your sit bones, to your feet to your breath, invite them, invite them close as if opening the door of your heart, mind and inviting them close and see what arises in your body, in your heart maybe on your face, maybe a smile shows up and in this practice today as we evoke, as we invoke the phrases of goodwill and metta we're going to imagine them feeling that way so may you be safe bringing an image of this being where they are cozy, maybe it's raining outside they're safe from the elements from the rain, from the cold the image that conjures up safety may you be safe from inner and outer harm for the inner harm imagining that or at peace their thoughts are not bothering them you're safe from inner and outer harm may you be happy and have joy in your heart imagine this being happy, imagine them joyful they're doing some imagined activity they like maybe with people they appreciate may you be happy and see them happy see this being happy in your mind's eye connecting with your goodwill for them you wish them well, you want them to be happy, yay may you be healthy the third metta phrase and seeing them healthy or it's a human being, maybe see them strong, healthy maybe they're hiking, exercising something active, swimming, skiing, whatever they love to do or imagine them doing, if you don't know they're strong in their body, they're healthy right with energy, may you be healthy and the fourth metta wish may you have ease, may you take care of yourself happily and imagine them with a sense of ease and the tableau for this one could be anything you like maybe they're lying in a hammock on a beach or a sense of ease or they're sitting in meditation and there's ease, there's peace or whatever you want to imagine may you be safe and the third metta phrase may you be happy maybe they're with friends celebrating an occasion may you be healthy see them strong, healthy body and may you have ease an image of them with ease these images we connect with our good will strengthening our good wish, our metta our kindness for this person it's not wishful thinking or imagining something so that it definitely becomes true with attachment, no, it's just so our hearts can connect with this wish of metta, really feel into it you might notice that it makes you feel happy and well, imagine this being happy and well and if the four tableaus are complicated simply may you be well, may you be happy those true are sufficient may you have well-being your body, mind and heart may you have well-being your body, mind and heart may you have well-being your body, mind and heart may you have well-being your body, mind and heart may you have well-being in every way you'd be happy and healthy imagining them well, happy and healthy connecting with this image so your good will can flourish now, bowing in your mind to this being and bringing an image of yourself up as a beloved other and making the same wishes for yourself and imagining yourself happy and well seeing yourself happy and well and connecting with metta good will for yourself as this beloved other the same way you did for your dear being a moment ago may you be safe from inner and outer harm seeing yourself safe an image of yourself seeing, connecting with the good wishes for yourself may you be happy, have joy in your heart imagine yourself laughing, joyful and loving, loving and loving and loving may you be healthy and strong seeing yourself connecting with an image of yourself as healthy, strong, well-being in your body again, not attaching to any of these images not clinging, just offering offering good will through these as a way to open your own heart to yourself and the last metta wish may you have ease seeing yourself with ease in your life seeing yourself with ease your mind, your heart, your body at ease the four phrases are too much, just simply may you be well may you be happy may you have well-being in every way may you have ease in your life may you have ease in your life may you have ease in your life may you have ease in your life it's okay to bring a memory of a time when you are happy if it's hard to connect with an image, if it's easy to connect great, if not, you can bring up an image of you happy, healthy, from experience you've had not dwelling on the memory but feeling into the good wish the good will for yourself you will get caught up in reminiscing stay in the present may you be happy, healthy in every way may you be happy, healthy may you be happy, healthy may you be happy, healthy joyful, safe, with ease, wishing this being well, with all your heart, this being who is you this person who is you carries the sun inside them, inside their heart with good will, with kindness, with happiness, health, wish them well may they have ease connect with this image of good will may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease may they have ease be safe, happy, healthy, and have ease may all beings, including myself, be free thanks everyone we started by settling in the body with the breath as we always do and then we brought someone, a dear person, to our mind's eye and wish them well with tablos, with images, trying to connect with seeing them happy, healthy, with ease, safe and then we did a bait and switch after we had warmed up our imagination, our imagery, then we brought in an image of ourselves as this third person that we've been kind of playing around over the past week, last week as a beloved other, imagining ourselves well and connecting with that wish for wellness and at the very end I wish I invited you to breathe it in, to be like wow, this sense of goodness, can I actually bring it close as one way to access metta, there's so many different ways so, so I'm going to invite us to transition now into small groups and there will be time for reflection so remember how this practice was for you if you have questions, comments, complaints, confusions, aha moments, please save all of them and the invitation for small group practice is the following, that we, that you're invited if you like, it's in groups of roughly three, I hope you'll stay three, to say a couple of words but a couple of sentences, just a short brief and make sure you're not dominating the time, just say something about how this practice was, what did it open up, what was challenging, there's no right or wrong, you can say I fell asleep, I was distracted the whole time, it's perfectly fine you can also hold silence, perfectly fine and then next person will go alphabetically, the next person will say a few words, the next person will say a few words and then you have the chance again, so going round and round for about six minutes, seven minutes so, yeah, take care of yourselves, take care of each other, be kind, and I'm going to create the breakout rooms now, and as always, here we go, alright, it's taking a moment here, okay, there, alright again, you can offer your silence, and just hold witness with kindness, the idea of these groups is, again, for the practice to, well, for, it's really our goodwill, it's the, our goodwill meets the world, it's the rubber meets the road, it's the goodwill meets the world can we actually show up with goodwill for ourselves and others, that's the question, it's not about blah blah blah look at me, it's about can we show up with goodwill for ourselves and others, it's supreme practice, it's really supreme practice okay, alright, so I'm going to open the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other you can also type your reflections in chat, if you type them to me privately, I will only read your reflection, not your name, and if it's to everyone, then I'll read your reflection too so anything you noticed any aha moments or any questions or challenges from this practice or something you noticed in the small groups and again if you haven't spoken in a while I'm going to invite you to move forward and if you have spoken recently at happy hour, I'm going to ask you to move back Stephanie says, my relationships with dogs are uncomplicated, that's great that's sweet, the other others are agreeing with you, that's sweet, okay the other reflections, maybe we'll take a pause for one more, again if you haven't spoken in a while you're welcome to share reflection, how was the small group, how was the meditation for you Amy, I haven't heard from you in a long time I felt like my group was full of metta, so I felt it was really sweet, it just increased the energy of it, we were talking about baby elephants and puppies, all those things that can really warm up the metta vibe, so it was lovely you're so sweet, that makes me happy and you're smiling, you're beaming metta actually as you're talking right now, just hearing you and seeing you, it just makes me happy, it's very sweet, thanks for reporting back from your group, that's lovely, beautiful Thank you Amy, and thank you all, thank you for your practice, so I'm experimenting both with a slightly different form and trying to see if 15 minutes might actually make it a little lighter happy hour, so I'm going to end now and thank you all for your practice, for your cultivation, for supporting yourselves and each other, may all beings be well, may all beings including ourselves be free Thanks everyone, now I'm going to
