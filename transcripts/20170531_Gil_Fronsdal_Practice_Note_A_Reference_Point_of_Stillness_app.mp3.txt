Practice Note : A Reference Point of 
Stillness

I’d like to say a few words about the practice with the 
help of some analogies. When teaching mindfulness to 
children, teachers sometimes use a clear bowl filled with 
water and glitter, or something else floating in it , like 
mud. As long as they keep shaki ng the bowl, the water 
will stay full of glitter or mud. But if they hold the bowl 
still, everything in solution settle s to the bottom, and the 
water becomes clear. But one of the things required for 
this analogy is holding the glass bowl still. So the 
stillness of the container is what allows the glitter or the 
mud to settle.  
 
When my son was in preschool , I would go visit 
sometimes, and the kids would be running around as 
little kids do, and then it was time for a transition to 
another activity. The teacher would stand straight and 
still in the middle of the room, and would start to 
whisper ! And the kids wo uld get very interested, and 
would come settle down around the teacher, and they’d 
get really calm. It was much more effective than trying 
to herd cats , saying : “Come here! Come sit down!” The teacher held the stillness, and whispering in a quiet 
voice som ehow settled the kids.  
 
I don’t know if it’s the best example, but the analogy – I 
think it’s from  the old days ; I don’t know if they still do 
this – there was this idea that if you wanted to tame a 
wild horse, you’d tie it to a stake in the middle of a 
corral. The horse couldn’t go anywhere but run around 
in circles. It’s a wild horse; it wants to run away. But it 
runs in circles until it gets tired and calms down. And it 
gets quiet enough so that the trainer can come and put 
the saddle on. What you need  for this to work  is the 
stillness of the post in the middle of the corral. Without 
that pole being still,1 that horse is not going to calm 
down.  
 
So in our practice, sometimes there are lots of activities 
going on inside of us – physical, emotional, mental – 
and it's helpful to have a reference point of stillness – 
not to stop the movement, but to allow everything to 
quiet down and come to rest.  
 
It’s relatively easy in sitting medit ation, when we are 
actually holding still with the commitment not to move 
the body. Then , that stillness can allow  tensions to 
begin to dissolve and relax a little bit.  One of the 
reasons this works is the contrast between the stillness 
of the container or  the anchor, and all the movement  
 
1  Editor’s note: ( and without more modern, compassionate methods of training ). inside . Becoming aware of that contrast, you can 
actually see the movement better. When you’re in the 
movement, sometimes you can’t see how much it’s 
moving. But if you find a place that’s a reference point of 
stillness, t hen you can see it. And just seeing that 
movement  clearly , in the context of the stillness inside , 
can allow it to settle.  
 
I think that part of how this works is if we start not 
identifying so strongly with the movement. Often  we’re 
concerned with the mo vement, the thoughts, the 
feelings, the bodily sensations – we’re reacting to them  
– wanting to do something with them , get involved with 
them . And we identify with what’s going on , or we latch 
onto it , in a strong way. But if instead , we focus on the 
stillness that is here, it helps us to dis -identify, to unlatch 
ourselves from this world of movement and activity. And 
when we unlatch ourselves from it,  then it has a chance 
to settle down and quiet.  
  
As you sit here today, you might lo ok for: “Is there some 
sense of stillness I can find?” It can be as simple as the 
body not moving as you sit here. Or it could be a still 
place inside that feels like an anchor , or a grounded 
post, or something that’s still and quiet. All the 
movement can move around, but clearly it’s where you 
are centered that holds  the place of stillness.  
 
See what that does for you. See what that does to the movement  – just the fact that you can see the difference 
between a place that is still and the movement.  And 
then you start identifying with the stillness and resting 
there, more than in the world of movement.  
 
 In walking meditation, this can be a bit harder to do, but 
it can be done there too . Even though you’re moving , 
you can  have a sense of stillness in the body. Since as 
you walk  and the lower legs do the moving, t he upper 
torso is not moving so actively, and so the torso can 
provide a sense of stability, steadiness, or stillness . 
Sometimes in walking meditation, I imagine t hat I'm not 
actually walking, but I’m standing still and the world is 
coming to me. It’s just a little shift: “Oh, it’s coming to 
me.” Then I get a greater sense of stillness. Or 
sometimes you can find  a sense of stillness deep inside  
– a still, quiet plac e inside the body or the mind  – and 
that can be a reference point as we’re walking. So 
there’s a lot of movement, but there’s also a place of 
stillness that informs us, and creates a contras t – a little 
shift of identification , or latching on.  
  
As you practice today, you might see if that contrast of 
movement and stillness might be supportive of your 
practice, and might help the stilling process to unfold 
more strongly or in a more productive way for you here.  
 
Thank you.
