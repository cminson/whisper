The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Is this turned on? Oh, now I have power.
Good afternoon, we're on. I should stop making comments
we're being recorded. So welcome back to the afternoon.
This afternoon we're going to do a little more work on
what is it, how can we be with grief?
We're going to work a little bit more on wisdom.
We know now that grief is everywhere, that we share it with a lot of people.
We know that we don't have to hide it.
So okay, now it's sitting here in the middle of the room.
What are we going to do?
So we're going to spend a little more time talking about how we're affected by grief
and how to be present with grief.
So that's what we're going to do.
And I'm going to start by singing to you.
Hopefully this is going to work.
Anakavata Sankara Vupada Vaya Domino Vupakita Varnachanti Tasam Vupasamo Sukho
All things are impermanent. They arise and pass away.
Having arisen they come to an end.
They're coming to peace is bliss.
Again, again.
Anakavata Sankara Vupada Vaya Domino Vupakita Varnachanti Tasam Vupasamo Sukho
All things are impermanent. They arise and pass away.
Having arisen they come to an end.
They're coming to peace is bliss.
What we're going to talk about is the law of anicha, change.
Because really that's where loss finds its home, is in change.
Sometimes change is something we like.
And sometimes change is something we don't like.
It can be pleasant, it can be unpleasant.
It can be minor, it can be life changing.
But we're definitely talking about change here.
Sometimes change is of our choosing.
Generally when we're talking about loss, it is not of our choosing.
The very idea of loss is that something is gone that we were holding dear to us.
There is a lack of permanency in everything, everywhere.
We all know this. We all know this.
And yet. And yet.
Change, I once wrote a lovely poem which I wish I had brought.
The final line was, I'm totally in favor of change when it's my idea.
When it's not my idea, yeah, change is a little more uncomfortable.
But things change whether we like it or not.
They change.
We're in a shifting world. Things are not static.
They're not stable.
We have a myth about stability.
We talked about myth about grief this morning.
We have a myth about stability.
This feels solid.
This feels right.
This will always be true.
And this morning when I left home in a rush,
and the last words to my husband were, get out of the way.
That wasn't exactly what I said, but it was close enough.
He got the message, right?
I called him halfway here to say, you know, I didn't mean that.
Change. Change is with us all the time.
And we don't always pay attention to it.
The change may be quick.
It may be perceptible or imperceptible.
Sometimes change happens so gradually on such a scale
that we don't even see it.
And then we wake up one day and say, when did that happen?
How did that happen?
There we are with this major change in our lives,
and how did it happen?
Because there's change, there's decay.
I don't like to think of my body as decaying,
but let me tell you, this knee is worthless.
It walks me around the room, but at night,
it has trouble going upstairs.
This was not always true.
You know, there it is.
I live with that.
We all do.
We all have things about us that have changed.
You know, gee, I would rather that hadn't changed.
Decay, disintegration.
It happens, disintegration of relationships.
Decentigration of our bodies.
Decentigration of our plans.
It happens.
The bigger of youth becomes the weakness of old age.
The sparkle of youth becomes a little more hidden.
You may still be there, like New Jersey here.
Not that she's old, she's a lot younger than I am.
But it happens to us whether we want it or not.
Whether we want it or not.
Sometimes we actually want it.
Sometimes we lose things, and we say,
oh, I'm so glad I lost that.
You know, it was a burden.
And yet sometimes we don't even notice
how grateful we are to have lost it
because it was snatched from us.
We hadn't quite made the decision to let go of it.
We know the most stable features can be no more.
Crater Lake in Oregon, beautiful lake,
used to be a monster mountain until it blew its top off.
And now it's a monster lake.
It's fantastic, but it is not what it used to be.
You know, the other thing that happens is
we tend to think that there's a selection process.
This happened to me, and really it just happened.
This is a really tricky place for us.
We personalize things.
Change actually happens to everyone,
but we really notice the change that happens to us.
The things we weren't planning on,
the things that just weren't quite,
we weren't quite ready for.
It feels pointed.
It feels like this was me that was the target of this.
It just happened.
So I'm not talking about cause and effect here.
I'm just talking about things that happened.
It isn't that it's random so much
because it isn't always about me,
even if it affected me.
And maybe it affected me in a really big way.
But it's that the separation between what happened
and my relationship to it can have a lot to do
with how we suffer around that thing.
So it's worth just seeing.
Not good or bad, just worth seeing.
Impermanence leads to decline and decay,
but it also leads to growth and revitalization.
Change is a two-way street.
Change isn't all bad.
I'm retired now.
I don't have to drive to work every day.
This is really great.
This is really great.
My artichokes, I have a group of artichokes
that are planted in our yard.
They have been extremely prolific.
Love artichokes.
And now they're dying.
And the artichokes that are coming up
are coming up kind of deformed and ugly.
And we look at it and say,
oh, those were such great artichokes.
And now we have to cut the plants off
because they're not producing something that's good anymore.
So we have to let go of the artichokes.
I recently visited some friends from graduate school.
So, you know, these are people I met
when I was in my young and juicy 20s.
And now we all sit around the table
and talk about parents that are dying or dead
and children and grandchildren
and our aches and pains.
This is a really graphic change.
And we kind of look at one another.
And we say, what happened to us?
Because in our heads, you know, we're still saying,
oh, yeah, we're going to go see Mike and Linda.
It'll be really great.
And then, you know, they are these old people.
When did they get old?
God knows what they think of me.
You know?
Impermanence is something we actually understand.
We all get that. We all know about change.
Yet we somehow live with the notion
that it's not going to change for me.
You know, we have a plan for our lives.
This was not in the plan.
This was not in the plan.
This just isn't what I wanted.
Even if it's someone that we know
their path is approaching,
or we know that this thing is about to happen,
but it's somehow, we just don't think it's going to happen.
Somewhere there's that little piece of us
that's reserving about it.
We're surprised.
That's why loss is so devastating to us.
Because loss is unplanned.
It just wasn't what we were, not now, not yet.
Not now.
But of course, it's also, change is also
the source of all good things.
And sometimes good things come along,
and we don't even recognize them, much less expect them.
Good things.
Good things happen when we're busy looking
at something that doesn't feel so good.
It just happens.
And we're so focused on the thing that is traumatic
we don't even notice it sneak up on us.
In the same way that those plans that we've made
have been interrupted.
Sometimes things come up,
and they're right there beside us,
and all we have to do is see it.
Just see it.
So we need to just be aware.
Just every once in a while, look up.
Just look up.
See what's happening.
You know, things weren't impermanent.
We wouldn't be adults in this room.
We'd still be crawling around on the floor.
We wouldn't have gotten up this morning.
We wouldn't be here in this room.
Change is not a bad thing.
But when we're faced with loss and sorrow,
we kind of look for a way to get out of it.
I just want it to go away.
And we'll pretend it doesn't exist.
We'll say, I'm bigger than this.
I can deal.
We just pretend it's not there.
Or we deny the effects.
I'm nauseous.
Well, it must be the flu going around.
We give it a different reason.
We make up stories about it.
And say, well, this isn't really happening.
But it is really happening.
The real trick about change is being able to see it.
And say, this is what's really happening.
Because very often it's all the stuff we wrap around it
that is causing us suffering.
Sometimes we fear that if we let go of grief,
that we'll lose, again, what we've lost.
So I'm here to tell you, it never goes away.
It just doesn't go away.
It changes, grief changes.
But don't worry about losing what you've lost.
That's a lot of extra effort.
A lot of extra effort.
Sometimes we fear that if we let go of grief,
we're going to lose our support system.
There was some talk this morning about the support system
that didn't exist.
But there's also this, well, if I let go of grief,
there might be nobody here.
Maybe there's just one person that's kind of hanging around
being there with you.
And you're thinking, wow, you know,
if they're only here to help me,
what happens if I let go of that hand?
Then there's no hand.
It can be very useful to know what your fear is.
It doesn't mean you have to change anything.
But very useful to know what your fear is.
Know what the elements of your grief are.
Because then you can see them,
and they're not masquerading as something else.
At least for you inside, know what it is.
Ask what it is.
You know, there's a lot of pressure
when you're grieving to process.
Everybody wants you to take care of it, fix it.
Sometimes that's not what's needed.
Sometimes it's a quiet sitting in one place
and asking, what is it that I really feel?
What is it that I really experience?
What are my feelings?
What is my body telling me?
You know, I mentioned this morning the episode
when I was on retreat of remembering something
from my childhood,
and I felt really childish.
I have to tell you, it was really, really childish.
It was, you know, why can't I have a mother?
Which sounds quite poignant,
but it was actually a very childish feeling.
And to allow that childish feeling to be in the room,
I had to just sit back and say,
okay, that's a real feeling.
I don't have to wallow in it.
I don't have to be a child.
But being able to actually allow it to be in the room
was extremely valuable for me.
Because once I saw it, then I could say to myself,
oh, that's what that was about.
I get it.
That I could process as an adult.
But I had to let the child in the room
to be able to do that.
By the way, the grief I was working on at the time
was very far removed from what I was experiencing.
Being able to realize that some of the depth of my grief
had to do with something that happened to me as a child
gave me some freedom to look at what's happening now
with a little less baggage.
Just a little less baggage.
It didn't lessen what's going on now.
It just changed the flavor of it.
See it for what it is.
I get it.
That's why I was so mad at that person.
It was because I was reliving this.
Now, sometimes we sort of focus on what's closest in.
And it's very useful to ask the question,
what else is here?
What else?
What else is here?
We hope for wisdom in knowing how to be with where we are.
We hope for wisdom.
So how does wisdom come about?
You go, you get a shot for it.
You read books?
Wisdom isn't about right and wrong.
Wisdom kind of comes from another place.
It's about what's useful and skillful.
It's not just about knowledge.
It's what's useful.
What's wise for me may not be wise for you at all,
and vice versa.
So how do we discover what is wise for us?
You know, we read books.
We listen to talks.
We talk to our friends.
We talk to our neighbors.
We talk to our therapist.
We talk to our spiritual guide.
We learn about things.
And then we reflect.
We think about them.
We say, well, does this apply to what's going on with me?
Is this what's going on with me?
How is it different?
How is it the same?
And then we practice.
Say, okay, I have an operating idea about how this is going to work.
A hypothesis.
We practice.
And then we harvest the learning from that and say,
well, you know, that's not quite right.
Or, whoa, that was intense.
And then we reflect again.
And then we practice.
And then we get some more learning.
So we pay attention.
Pay attention to our experience.
And we don't get stuck in this is what's true.
This is what's true now.
I test it.
I look at it.
Oh, it seems to have changed.
You know, this new thing has happened.
Okay, I go back.
I reflect a practice.
This is how wisdom really arises.
It's about applying what you've learned,
both intellectually and physically,
experientially in the world.
Looking at it and saying, oh,
it isn't abstract.
It's very real.
And it's very personal.
It can only come from you.
Seeing things as they are,
as well as the clarity and depth of intention
are the beginnings of wisdom.
Seeing things as they are.
When we're suffering,
we have a story about our suffering, right?
I have lots of stories.
You know, the job I lost,
the husband that left.
Lots of stories.
And I've discovered that a lot of those stories
have served me well at certain times.
And you know, some of them aren't quite true.
Some of them are related to what I was seeing
at the time I formed that story.
And it's changed.
And those stories kind of define
and interpret our experience.
So I may have lost my job
because some manager somewhere said,
get rid of that program.
We're cutting, get rid of that program.
It has absolutely nothing to do with me.
But my experience of losing my job might be,
oh, I failed to deliver.
Or it's that comment I made last month to my boss.
I knew that was a mistake.
I never should have said that.
I've been fired.
And we have this story about it.
And not only that, that boss was,
he was a jerk.
That's why I told him that.
And now we're carrying around the anger.
We've not only lost the job
and there's the pain of losing the job
and the fear of not paying the bills
and all of the stuff that goes with that,
self-esteem.
But now we're also beating up on ourselves.
We're adding to it with this story.
We do that around a lot of things.
You know?
I had a marriage go wrong.
And my husband left me for another woman.
And I was pissed.
I felt betrayed.
I felt like a failure.
I was sure if I had done something different,
it would not have been true.
And it took me years to understand
that he left not because of me,
but because of him.
He left because of him.
But because I was experiencing the loss.
In my mind, it was all about me.
After all, I'm the person he left.
But it really wasn't me.
It really wasn't.
It's not, I can tell you that.
And there's no reason for you to believe that.
Your own experience about whatever has happened to you
is the only guide to what is true for you.
You know, it's sort of like you hear something,
you hear it over and over and over again,
and then one day it just kind of clicks for you,
and you say, ah, that's how I feel about that.
It actually wasn't about me.
But we tend to personalize what's happened, you know?
Why her? Why did it happen to her?
Why did she have to die?
What could I have done to make this less?
What could I have done to make this suffering less?
Did I do the right thing?
So we have a story around what happens.
My mother-in-law recently died,
and she was 97.
We were very close.
She lived the last year of her life with increasing feebleness.
And that's what happens when you get that old.
And she was not happy.
She was really not happy.
So when the occasion arose that she had an infection,
she refused antibiotics and stopped eating.
And I'm sitting there thinking,
okay, should I be trying to talk her out of this?
What am I supposed to do?
All of a sudden, her death was about me,
instead of about her.
And I had to step back and say,
no, it doesn't have to do with me.
It has to do with her.
And I've had to remind myself of that since then, you know?
God, I have done to make it better.
So not only have I lost her,
but I have all this other stuff that I've been adding on to it.
Seeing it has allowed me to let go of that stuff.
Recognizing that I was carrying that stuff around
has allowed me to let go of that stuff.
So now I think about her death and I deal just with that.
It was my husband's mother.
He's grieving.
It's complicated now.
Now we're sort of working with each other, right?
Grief is not simple.
But to be able to look at this is what's going on with him,
this is what's going on with me,
and separate them helps me.
So what I'm arguing for here is paying attention to what's really true
and kind of separating the weeds out a little bit
so that you can see what's actually arising.
So that we can ask ourselves,
what am I clinging to that I can let go of?
Very often it isn't the loss that I'm clinging to.
I am not clinging to my mother-in-law or the idea of my mother-in-law.
For me, I've lost another mother. I've been collecting them all my life.
But I look at it a different way than, oh, why did she have to die?
Because I'm separating what I see as a congenital thing
that I've been carrying through my life
and the loss of someone I love.
And they're really separable.
So I don't add them together and put the burden on top of my head.
It allows me to stand a little taller.
There was an article in the New York Times yesterday, the day before,
written by an art critic,
and he was talking about a painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
And it was a painting by Caravaggio called The Denial of St. Peter.
And it's a very dark painting with light on the faces of two of the three people in the painting.
So it's about St. Peter and this soldier that he's confronting.
So this art critic says he's been going back and looking at this painting every two weeks for years.
And he's been looking at it and he suddenly realized, for him,
the crux of the painting was neither St. Peter nor the soldier,
but the maid in the center of the picture who was looking out with a look of...
Now, let me tell you exactly what he said.
The longer I looked, the more it seemed to me that the saint
as a symbolic embodiment of the human frailty and faith that underpin Roman Catholic doctrine,
was not the lead actor in the drama.
It was the maid whose eyes, catching the light with pinpoint reflections,
somehow became the painting's center.
Her eyes seemed to have become unfocused
and she's not looking at the guard she's facing, but looking momentarily inward.
Whatever precise doctrine the painting was once trying to expound,
it is the maid's hesitation and humanity in the moment of accusation
that to me now remain as the painting's subject and its power.
Whether this has any historical significance
or whether it is what a broken down caravaggio near the end of his too short life intended,
no longer makes much difference to me.
One result of looking at a painting so long that you can see it in your mind's eye
is that it does in a very real sense become your own.
Not quite the same painting that anyone else will see.
This is how we should look at our lives.
Not what other people see, what we see.
Then it's truly ours. What do we see?
Everything is always in the process of changing into something else.
My garden's forever in need of weeding and watering and planting and unplanting.
Some of these changes make me happy and some are really disappointing.
I won't tell you about those.
My grandson is a baby becoming a little boy and I watch him.
He came over one weekend and he had just started standing up and taking his first steps
and by the end of the weekend he was running.
And I still can't tell you every moment of that change.
It was rapid but it was so slow I couldn't see it.
This is happening to us all the time unless we determinedly say,
I'm not moving. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
We tend to cling to what makes us happy.
Sometimes we cling to what doesn't make us happy.
We cling to it for a whole variety of reasons.
What would happen if I just let go?
I don't push it away. I don't grab it to my body.
I just stop holding on.
Let it just sit in the open hand.
What's it like then?
There's this poem called This Much I Do Remember by Billy Collins.
It's about a memory.
It was after dinner.
You were talking to me across the table about something or other.
A greyhound you'd seen that day or a song you liked.
I was looking past you over your bare shoulder at the three oranges lying on the kitchen counter.
Next to the small electric bean grinder, which was also orange,
and the orange and white crouettes for vinegar and oil,
all of which converged into a random still life,
so fastened together by the haspa color
and so fixed behind the animated foreground of your talking and smiling,
gesturing and pouring wine and the camber of your shoulders.
That I could feel it being painted within me, brushed on the wall of my skull,
while the tone of your voice lifted and fell on its flight
and the oranges remain fixed on the counter,
the way stars are said to be fixed in the universe.
I could feel it being painted within me, brushed on the wall of my skull,
while the tone of your voice lifted and fell on its flight
and the oranges remain fixed on the counter,
the way stars are said to be fixed in the universe.
Memory doesn't have to be sad.
Memory can just be what it is.
And we can choose what we look at.
We can choose what we look at.
There's a lot of freedom in that.
So here are the questions.
What's left out?
As you're sitting with your story, what are you leaving out?
What are you closed to?
What do you just not want to hear?
Is there something there?
What's that about?
What we know to be true asks the question,
am I sure?
Am I sure?
What I know to be true,
those are usually the places that we're holding on the most tightly to.
I know this to be true.
I'm not sure.
Consider how what you experience is influenced by your conditioning,
by the things you know to be true,
by the things that are habits of mind.
When you came here today, you had an intention.
Maybe it wasn't a strong intention.
Maybe it was a strong intention.
It was some intention.
I'm coming with the intention of whatever it was.
Intentions are very important,
because what they do is condition what comes after them.
Intentions are not the same thing as goals,
which are solid out there, that goal, which doesn't exist.
As a fantasy, it's not happening now,
but intention is happening now.
Intention is sitting right here in this room.
Whatever your intention is,
if it's sitting up right in the chair or falling asleep
or going shopping,
you showed up here for some reason.
You had some intention.
That intention is very valuable.
It's very useful to know what your intentions are
and to kind of ask what it's about.
Because that intention is setting up the condition
for the next moment.
People talk about karma like there's a sort of payback
for every action,
but really karma is more about intention.
It's about, what am I bringing to this moment?
Because that's what makes something possible.
Intention is a way of being.
It's a habit of the mind.
Intention is what causes us to look in a certain place
for a certain thing.
When I was a manager in business,
they told us that whatever you ask about first thing in the morning
is what everybody who works for you is going to pay attention to.
So if you want to know how the schedule is,
ask about the schedule.
Don't ask about did somebody order supplies.
Because if you ask about supplies,
they're not going to think about the schedule.
They're going to be worrying about the supplies.
The same thing is true in our lives.
Whatever we are thinking about,
wherever we point our attention,
that's what's coming up.
So my happiness or unhappiness
depends on my intentions and my actions,
not what others wish for me.
Despite what I might wish to be true,
things are as they are.
Things are as they are.
We have a choice in every moment
of being things as they are
or painting over them
and trying to make them something else.
I personally am more willing to be with my sorrow
than pretend it's something else.
Because if I'm willing to allow it to be in the room,
then I'm also willing to allow it to change,
to be something different.
I'm not holding onto it being the same way it always was.
So here's a quote from Jack Kornfield.
True peace comes with the discovery
that we can respect the seasons of life
with a spacious and undefended heart.
In it we learn to trust,
to rest in the truth of the way things are,
to willingly accept the measure
of joy and sorrow we are given.
True peace comes with the discovery
that we can respect the seasons of life
with a spacious and undefended heart.
In it we learn to trust,
to rest in the truth of the way things are,
to willingly accept the measure
of joy and sorrow we are given.
May you find joy.
Thanks.
So we have a follow-up to this,
but I thought I might ask
if you have any questions or observations
or complaints about that.
You know, I had the, yes, please.
You mentioned karma is more about protection
than anything else.
Could you elaborate on that?
Sure.
So the principle of karma has to do with
setting causes and conditions
for what comes afterward.
And the kind of pop culture way
of looking at karma is if you're a good person,
good things happen,
if you're a bad person, bad things happen.
Good and bad things happen to everyone.
But our experience,
there's a couple of, the first two chapters
of the Dhammapada go like this.
All experience is preceded by mind,
led by mind, made by mind.
Speak or act with a corrupted mind
and suffering follows like the wagon wheel
follows the hoof of the ox.
All experience is preceded by mind,
led by mind, made by mind.
Speak or act with a peaceful mind
and happiness follows like a never departing shadow.
So that's the principle of karma.
That if we enter the moment with a positive view of life,
an open view of life,
we're more likely to find that in the next moment.
If we, it's sort of the principle of doing metta.
You know, when we do metta,
it's about changing our own heart.
It's not about what's going on out there.
I'm sorry?
Metta, so metta is wishing,
good wishes for yourself and for other people.
So it is a way of conditioning your heart
for openness and loving kindness.
And that's what we're doing.
We're setting up the conditions.
Whereas if I am angry about something
and I'm sitting around saying,
well that, so and so, you know,
this should not have happened
and this is unfair
and you're building up the energy, right?
And you're building up the story around this thing
that is creating ill will
and how are you going to move from this feeling of ill will
to something that's not as constricted
and stomach wrenching?
You're going to do that
not by pretending it's not true.
Anger is here.
You just don't have to be the anger.
You don't have to reinforce the anger.
You can stop telling the tale.
So, so, so I'll give you an example.
When my husband left me, I was really pissed
and I wanted only bad things to happen to him.
And it made me a very sour person
because that's where I put all my energy.
And then one day I decided,
well, you know,
he was doing the best he could,
the limited person that he is.
Actually, he's a wonderful person, but anyway.
And so I forgave him, right?
And then one day I asked myself,
so what if he wasn't doing the best he could do?
Did you forgive him then?
And I had to reopen that
and look at that whole feeling all over again, you know?
Oh, I see. It was a conditional forgiveness.
I get it. It was a condition.
If he was doing the best he could do,
then I'd forgive him.
Now, none of this had anything to do with him.
It had only to do with my heart.
It had to do with what I was carrying into the next moment,
whether I was going to continue to carry the resentment
or whether I was going to be free of that resentment.
And the only way to be free of that resentment
was to stop telling tales about him.
That was the only way.
I mean, you know, in desperate circumstances,
when somebody was...
I do a lot of hospice work
and people have different cultural things that they do.
And there was a man who was dying
and his family came in and insisted that he be dressed
down to his shoes.
This is a cultural thing.
It was a Chinese family,
and it's important that you have your clothes on when you die.
It was so uncomfortable for him,
and it was so difficult for me to...
I was helping the CNA dress the man.
And I kept reminding myself
that this didn't have anything to do with me
and that this was a cultural thing
that he probably would have supported
if he had been capable of supporting it.
And so what I did was meta.
I said,
may I be filled with loving-kindness?
May I be safe?
May I be happy?
And it softened my heart.
It softened me so that I could just do this thing for them.
This thing I didn't want to do.
So that's the karma.
It's what follows from what is happening now.
It's setting up the conditions.
It isn't a quid pro quo...
quid pro quo.
I can almost say that.
So I'm sorry?
We knew what you meant.
Good. That's good.
So I think I've said more than I need to say about that,
but does that make sense?
It's okay?
Anything else?
Yes.
There was a point that it didn't mean
that it was possible.
I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear.
There was a point of confusion.
Okay.
You talked about allowing the sorrow.
Yes.
And by doing that, you actually allowed some change.
Yes.
But then again, and...
You also talked about...
It's all that.
You talked about not to cling.
So how do you reconcile that?
I didn't hear you.
I'm sorry.
The whole thing?
No, no.
Okay.
So I talked about allowing sorrow.
Right.
To allow change.
But not clinging.
But not clinging.
Right.
Ah.
Well, see, it's the principle of the open hand.
Okay.
So if I'm clinging to sorrow,
it's my sorrow.
I'm very sad.
This is...
Let me give you...
I want to give you a real example.
So one day I noticed that I was sad.
I was just sad.
It's not a big sadness.
We're not talking about a major grief here.
It was a small sadness.
I just noticed I was sad.
And I had this feeling.
I said, where is this feeling in my body?
And I had this feeling in the middle of my chest.
This just little kind of ache.
This kind of ache.
And I just watched it and watched it and watched it.
I didn't try to figure out where it came from
or what it was related to or what it meant.
I didn't know why I was sad.
I just recognized it as sadness.
And I just was watching it and watching it.
And pretty soon it felt like it was pulsing
instead of, you know, just a little pulsing feeling.
And then it became kind of like a caress.
I mean literally just, oh, oh.
And the experience for me was compassion.
It was just, oh, I'm sorry about that.
But it wasn't, it wasn't, oh, I'm so sad.
My life is really horrible.
When will this sadness ever go away?
It just changed because I allowed it to be there.
Instead of trying to figure out what it was,
I said, oh, there's sadness here.
So I wasn't putting a lot of energy into making it go away.
Now if you have a big sadness,
so that was a little, that was just a small thing.
Where you just have kind of, you recognize you're a little depressed.
So if I have something that's bigger,
then I look at it and I say,
rather than saying, okay, I've got to deal with this sadness.
I have to do something about it.
I have to, I have to go make myself feel better.
Instead of doing any of that stuff,
I just acknowledge I am really sad.
So I'm going to pay attention that,
that sadness doesn't affect everything else in my life today.
I'm really upset.
I recognize I'm upset.
I turn to my husband, I say, I'm a little upset today.
I want you to not take anything I say too seriously.
It's, it's, you know, if I, if I snarl,
it is not because you're doing something wrong.
It's because I'm really sad today.
So I make a place for it.
I don't make excuses for it.
I don't try to chase it away and it changes.
It's not the same.
It changes.
So I don't, I'm not, I'm not holding it that, that it,
you know, this is, this is a sorrow.
It looks like this.
It's shaped like this.
It behaves like this.
And therefore I'm going to be this way.
I leave the possibility for anything to happen,
but I don't chase it away.
Does that make sense?
Seem possible?
Seems like a story.
It's true.
This is what happens.
You know, it's just allowing what is true to be true.
Despite what I may wish to be true,
things are as they are.
There's a whole lot of freedom in that.
There are, there are things that,
there are people in my life I wish behaved in a different way.
I wish they would, there's a lot of pain around
by not being able to save them.
Things are as they are.
Their happiness is dependent on their intentions,
not my wishes for them.
That's the same spirit I take to holding sorrow and grief.
Things are as they are.
So not this, not this, not grasping,
not pushing away,
allowing it to be true.
Yeah.
Yeah, Maria, I'm going to ask you to take that a step further if you would,
because I think a lot of times we think we have to be angry
in order to make changes in the world,
and I know that allowing can, can actually help us to make change,
but could you talk about how that works?
Yeah, I think when there's an important thing about anger to be aware of.
I consider anger hurtful,
and that's because it hurts me when I'm angry.
I can feel it in my body, it hurts me.
One thing that is true of anger is that it's an energetic emotion.
There's a lot of energy and anger,
and it's important to separate energy from the cause of the anger,
which is different.
So if you recognize that you're feeding anger just because you like the surge of the energy,
or you want that energy,
know that that energy doesn't have to arise out of anger,
and when you separate them,
then you have the energy to carry forward for change
that isn't tied to something that is negative and hurtful and full of ill will.
Does that make sense?
Say a little bit more about how the allowing kind of allows you to take it.
Okay, so anger is a really big topic.
I'm sorry I used to word anger.
Can we just talk more about not accepting or not allowing?
A lot of times people will say,
I don't want to accept that.
I don't want that in my life.
And I say, well, if you accept it,
you'll be able to make changes more easily,
but I'd like to understand how that works better.
Okay, so I don't use the word accept very often.
I use the word allow.
And I think there's an energetic difference between those,
because in acceptance, there's a tendency to think it's okay.
When you allow it to be true,
it just means that you're not fighting reality.
That's what I mean by it,
that it is that I'm not fighting what's true,
not wasting any energy fighting what's true.
That doesn't mean that I think it's okay,
or that I won't work to change it,
or I won't try to convince somebody of something different
than what they believe is good or valuable for them.
It doesn't mean that I sit back and do nothing.
I'm talking about a kind of equanimity,
where equanimity is being present for what's true.
It doesn't mean that you sit back and allow bad things to happen to you.
You don't have to beat yourself up.
You don't have to stand in front of somebody.
There's a great story that I heard twice while I was on retreat,
so I'm going to tell it.
Sharon Salzburg was in India,
and she was writing in one of these rickshaws,
and it was flooded.
And as she was going along,
some guy came up and tried to take the rickshaw away.
And she was very distraught and didn't know what to do,
and she hurried the guy on,
and she kind of pushed him away,
and she got to her teacher, who was named Menindra,
and Menindra said,
you should have taken your umbrella,
and with total loving-kindness and mindfulness,
hit him over the head.
You don't have a responsibility to become a victim.
And in fact, what you're allowing in that case
is allowing that this guy is threatening you.
You're not pretending that he's not threatening you.
You're not being so peaceful
that you're allowing yourself to be dragged out of the rickshaw.
Does that make a distinction?
You're recognizing the truth.
You're recognizing the truth, seeing things as they are.
Yeah.
Anyone else?
Okay, thanks.
So now, we're going to do a little exercise.
I'm sorry?
No, let's stop that.
Thank you.
Can I say what's going to be done with the recording?
I'm sorry?
You want to say anything about the recording?
About the recording.
This recording is just,
that's the only thing that we've recorded.
