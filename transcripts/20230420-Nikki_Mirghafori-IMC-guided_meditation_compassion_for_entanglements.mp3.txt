Greetings, friends. Greetings to all of you from Mountain View, California, unceded Oloni land.
Hope you are well wherever you are in the world.
And I'm delighted to be joining you together, joining each other to practice this morning or in this moment in time.
So today we're going to continue our exploration of compassion cultivation as it is done in expanding concentric circles.
We start with ourselves.
Next category we extend to is the benefactor, dear friend, and then the neutral person, very important category that we worked with yesterday.
And now today we've come to a pivotal category, one we've been, I've been looking forward to actually, which is the person we have challenges with, the person we have challenges with.
And I like to use the long version instead of saying a challenging person because they're not from their vantage point, they're not challenging, they're just doing the best they can.
And maybe they think we're challenging, but the person we're having challenges with.
So at this moment in time.
So, the neutral person we worked with yesterday is really the stepping stone to to expanding our heart to bringing ease to our heart with respect to someone we're having challenges with.
So, let's just practice together and I'll give some invitations for us to explore and again this is for the benefit of the piece of our heart.
It's not, it's not necessarily for them it's really for us to have peace and ease and expansion of our of our compassion.
So, so let's practice together.
Now, arriving, arriving, arriving in our seat, arriving in our bodies, arriving in this moment in time.
Feeling our feet on the earth, our legs, our sit bones, our hands.
Feeling our entire body seated and receiving the breath.
And connecting, allowing awareness, inviting, inviting awareness to connect with the entirety of the breath.
And breath, pause our breath in the body, in the body, receiving the breath in the body.
Thank you.
And as we sit and feel greed, letting there be a sense of goodwill for ourselves, a sense of appreciation.
We're showing up, we're showing up in this moment as best as we're able to.
A sense of goodwill for ourselves.
The appreciation that we are doing the best we can, especially with respect to our challenges, our difficulties.
And with the same gesture of a mother holding a child in newborn lovingly.
Letting ourselves with our tenderness be held with kindness.
And now inviting the neutral person we were practicing with yesterday.
If you were not practicing yesterday, no problem, invite someone you don't know so well.
Appreciating their common humanity just like me, just like me.
They have joys and sorrows.
And sitting with them in your heart space with goodwill, with friendliness.
You might notice that they're no longer neutral, you've developed a sense of affection, warmth, kinship with them.
Maybe notice if that is present or not yet, which is perfectly fine.
These categories are so transient.
Now inviting someone you're having some challenge with, be not the number one person on your list, the most challenging person you're having the most challenges with.
Not somewhere lower.
Bring this person to your mind, to your heart.
And if you need to keep them a little further away, that's okay too.
But conjure them up, seeing them as clearly as you can while staying embodied, staying in your seat of stability.
If it's possible to see them as clearly as possible.
And see that just like you, just like you, this person suffers. Just like you, they suffer. They suffer a lot.
Just like you, they're the object of affection of other people, other beings.
They are dear. They have been dear. They are very dear.
They are loved.
Appreciate it.
They are a good friend to someone.
Maybe they're really kind, generous, loyal, caring.
Supportive to someone.
Just like me, they have hopes and aspirations. They have values.
Just like me, they don't want to suffer. They just want to be happy. They don't want to suffer.
They don't want to be free from sorrow and pain.
They are not condoning any harm they have caused you.
But we're letting go of that story right now. Just feeling into the common humanity. Not condoning the harm, but tuning into the common humanity.
Separating the behavior from the person. Our hearts, our minds can do that.
We are capable to see the humanity and hold this person with good will just because they're a human being just like me and they suffer just like me, wishing them well.
As much as available. As much as possible.
And again, if in your heart and your mind they need to be far away in distance, on another, on an island, for you to feel safe enough to wish them well, that's okay.
Or they might be able to be closer, really seeing, feeling the common humanity.
Just like me, they suffer. Just like me, just as I wish to be free from sorrow.
May this person be free from sorrow.
Just as I want to have ease and peace, as I meet my challenges, difficulties in my life, wish them ease and peace as they meet their challenges.
Find your own way with the phrases, with seeing common humanity. Trust that it's possible. Trust that you can.
Whatever amount available in this moment.
I wish you well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And also it might be helpful to see the two of you, you and the person you're having challenges with, in this entanglement, in the way you're entangled or have been entangled,
all these causes and conditions that brought you together and you got entangled in this way. And wishing both of you well.
Wishing both of you well and ease with this entanglement that happened or is happening. I wish both of us ease, peace, freedom from sorrow and suffering.
As we have been entangled, challenged.
I wish you well. I hold with good will, with understanding, with ease, with friendliness, both of us in this entanglement.
And offering ease to my heart. It's okay. It's okay.
I wish both of us being free. May both of us have ease in the midst of challenge. I wish both of us well.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And maybe your heart feels ready to release. And wish well. Release. Maybe just a little bit. Release this entanglement and wish well.
For both of you.
Thank you.
For the breath to the body, as we turn to close this period of sitting together.
And appreciating that we've showed up and we've done our best, as best as we're able to.
This moment in time with this practice. Giving our heart as much as possible. Cultivating good will, compassion.
Knowing that there are seeds of goodness planted, will ripen in their own time. Not our time, their own time.
Without attachment to outcome right here and now. Sharing this co-created goodness, offering it to all beings everywhere.
May my practice be of service, not just to myself and those whose lives I touch directly, but all beings everywhere.
May this practice be free, may all beings be happy, including myself.
You all. Thank you for your practice.
And as we transition their recordings and our session from the meditation to the dharma, you are invited. If you want to put one word as to what's coming up after this meditation for you, you're invited to put it in chat.
Thank you.
