Practice Note : Keep It Simple

It’s useful to always  remember that mindfulness practice 
is meant to be simple. So if it’s not simple , it’s probably 
not mindfulness. There are a  variety of ways to try to 
keep it simple.  
 
One is a very simple way of looking at our experience 
from the perspective of whether it’s pleasant, 
unpleasant or neither pleasant nor unpleasant. Our life 
and experiences  can be pretty  complicated. There is 
full-blown catastrophe  – our particular version of the big 
issues of life  that come up  – all the cause s and 
conditions , and all the things we can possibly do in the 
whole arsenal of Buddhist practice. It gets complicated  
very quickly .  
 
But if we take what w e’re experiencing here and now, 
whatever the complexity is , and distill it  down to:  “Is it 
pleasant ? Is it unpleasant? Or is it neither? ” sometimes 
if you see the simplicity of it . “Oh, it’s actually very 
unpleasa nt.” Then you  can see how you’re reacting to 
the unpleasant quality of this hugely complicated event. 
Let’s ignore how complicated it is , and just stay in the 
simplicity of “This is unpleasant. ” Then , how are we reacting to the unpleasantness?  There might be a 
pulling away . You’re attacking it , or getting involved in 
judgments. There  are all kinds of reactions we have to 
the simple unpleasantness of it.  
 
If it’s pleasant , it might be complicated . You  might feel 
some pleasant meditation experie nce, and it’s 
connected to the whole complexity of all your years of 
reading about the Christian saints and their beatific 
experiences. It gets complicated  very quickly. But if you 
just say , “It’s just a pleasant experience ,” then,  how do 
you relate to tha t pleasantness ? “Oh, I start thinking 
about all the kinds of associations I have with it. ” Let’s 
just come back and stay with the simplicity. Or , “I want 
more of it ,” and so you feel that.  
 
If it’s neither pleasant nor unpleasant  – which  is actually 
rare and more commo nly assumed than it actually is  –
then what is  the reaction to that ? Sometimes  people 
have interesting reactions when something is neither  
pleasant nor unpleasant. Somet imes they get confused, 
annoyed , or bored because it does n’t seem to relate to 
something important. There can be a reaction  to it.  
 
Those  reactions to pleasant, unpleasant, and neither 
are sometimes operating in the background. We can 
clothe  it, and add to the simplicity of that simple reaction 
to pleasant, unpleasant and neither  with all kinds of philosophies, attitudes, stories , and histories. We can 
make it much more complicated than it needs to be.  
 
One way to make the practice simple is to stay  close to 
the fact that things are either p leasant, unpleasant or 
neither , and stay with that simpli city without any bigger 
stories , or assigning meaning, purpose or consequence. 
Just see if that can help you stay more at ease, more 
simple and relaxed abou t what’s happening . in a way , 
perhaps that is more to the heart of yourself  and what’s 
going on . The reactions  we have – the pleasantness or 
unpleasantness – can represent something very deep 
inside of us that we could access.  
 
So I hope you enjoy the mor ning and that enjoyment is 
pleasant.
