So then we come to the last talk on the topic of Conditioned Consciousness. 
And our connection to being aware, to being conscious is quite variable. 
And sometimes we have no connection at all. 
We could be so caught up in something, so preoccupied, so besides ourselves that we're besides ourselves. 
We lose ourselves in what we're doing. 
We can end up saying, I don't know what I was thinking or what I was doing. 
I didn't even know what I was saying when I said it. 
We can be so wrapped up in something that the very idea that we can be aware and conscious is far from the mind, far from what we're preoccupied with. 
And it's possible to be in states where it's just so obvious that we're conscious. 
It's like the main game in town is being aware and conscious, maybe in a relaxing, wonderful day off, laying under a tree in the park and looking up at the clouds and the sky. 
And there's not much to see, but there's a clear sense of, wow, I'm aware, I'm present, I'm conscious, I'm alive. 
This is quite something. 
And the sense of consciousness there is really strong. 
And then from that place of being in a day off in the park, looking at the sky, something might happen in the park that we feel we lose some of that openness, that lightness, that kind of awe, because we get caught in something. 
Maybe the ice cream truck goes by, and that's enough to kind of, oh, that brings up all kinds of memories from childhood, and you get absorbed in that. 
And the fact that there are clouds and sky disappears, the fact that you kind of have capacity for consciousness disappears over the idea of memories or the idea of wanting ice cream. 
Someone gets up in a soapbox not too far away in the park and starts pontificating loudly about political views that are important to you, and you feel the contraction of the heart, contraction of the mind, and irritation. 
And with that, if you try to notice what's happened to that consciousness, you notice that conscious self might feel contracted or tight, or there might even be a resistance in the mind to even notice that you're aware in consciousness, because the strong pull into the world of irritation or anger or fear, whatever it might be connected to, so that our connection to consciousness, our connection to being aware, is quite variable. 
But I think that, having said it, saying it that way is a little bit off, or very bit off. 
It implies that consciousness is something, a stationary, static thing, that we can have variable how we touch it or know it. 
But rather, what consciousness is, is it is shaped by the state of the mind. 
So in the park, looking at the sky, what we feel is consciousness or awareness has been expanded, has been created, has been imagined, constructed to be broad. 
When we get preoccupied and tight, then that sense of awareness, what awareness is, has become tight and constructed. 
There's not an awareness that somehow exists offline or outside that's broad and spacious. 
Consciousness has become that way. 
And this is a theory, but it's just as valid as a theory that there is this thing called consciousness, which is always broad, and we lose touch with it. 
And my suggestion is that we're still in touch with it, but maybe, but we're in touch with something now that consciousness has become contracted and tight and narrow. 
So in this way, continuing this idea that our sense, our idea of what consciousness is, what awareness is, is variable and it's influenced by all kinds of things. 
It's influenced by the degree of agitation, but the degree of peace or calm that we have. 
It's influenced by how much clinging we have and how much freedom we have. 
And so we contribute to that creation of consciousness by the state of our mind. 
And if particular states of mind are valuable and useful, then we want to kind of create the conditions for that to be there. 
An open, expansive, free consciousness is invaluable because it's a protection from clinging. 
It's a protection from greed, hate, and delusion. 
It's a protection from fear oftentimes. 
It's a space within which some of the best qualities of who we are have a chance to surface. 
Love can come, for example, rather than anger or blame. 
And it's almost like the more consciousness is made to be broad and open and receptive, the more space there is for some of the deeper, beautiful workings of our hearts, of our minds. 
So to begin appreciating our contribution to how we experience consciousness, how we experience awareness, and to use that awareness that's more light, more open, more non-reactive, to be aware of how we cling, how we tight, how we resist. 
And that's a fascinating way to an alternative to collapsing into our clinging, getting sucked into it, rather to know it so we can be clinging and we can know it. 
And the image I like to have is someone, you know, a tight fist that doesn't want to release itself, and a hand comes from underneath it and just holds it gently, just gives it support, takes its weight. 
And as the fist feels the support, then it begins to relax. 
So this awareness that can know attachment, can know clinging, it's kind of like there to offer support, there to hold it, there to be its friend, to accompany it, so that the clinging is not condemned, is not fought with, is not denied, not trying to pushed away, but so the clinging has a chance to uncling, so that the way that we're entangled can be unentangled, can disentangle itself. 
And this way in which this broader, more equanimous knowing that's independent of what is known, that's not entangled with what's known, can meet then the clinging, is one of the great powers of this Buddhist practice. 
It meets it, and if you're patient, you can discover that you don't have to do the unclinging. 
You don't have to do the letting go, to know with nonclinging, allows what's clung to, allows the clinging, the attachments we have to slowly thaw, to slowly unwind, to slowly release. 
And so in this way, in this lesson, becomes more and more important, the further we go in Dharma practice, that as we get more and more concentrated, more still, more mindful, the mindfulness and meditation gets stronger, the more and more important it becomes, not to be the one who lets go, not to be the one who unclings, but rather to just allow the knowing to be the tenderizer, the dissolving agent. 
Just know, just know without any reactivity. 
So that becomes more and more important because we keep practicing. 
Early in practice, like the beginning of a sitting, please by all means relax, relax your body, let go of what is easy to let go of. 
But then over time, hopefully you'll discover how wonderful, how smile producing it is to know without attachment, to know without being caught into or glued to what is being known. 
What is being known is allowed to be as it is, and you can settle back and know in a way that knowing maybe will be smile producing for you. 
How lucky we are to be able to know this way, how delightful to know this way, how wonderful to know in a way that can bring forth all kinds of gifts for the world. 
And may it be that you will discover something about liberated awareness that allows you to be a gift, your full giftness for this world. 
So thank you very much, and I look forward to being back here on Monday.
