 1 Dharmette : Delight , Joy, and 
Appreciation  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on January 6, 2010  
 
 
So, I’m not sure where this dharma talk is going to go, 
but what I wanted to do is to explore, and consider a 
little bit, the conditions for delight. How do we feel 
delight or joy? What are the conditions that help that 
happen? Because I think it is a beau tiful thing to feel 
delight or feel joy. How can we avail ourselves with the 
opportunities of joy or delight more often?  
 
Years ago, when I thought about becoming joyful, I 
mostly would have thought that joy was a product or 
result of something that gave me reason to be joyful. It ’s 
a beautiful day, so I feel delight in the day, or a beautiful 
sunset, or something wonderful happens, or I ’m with 
delightful friends, so I feel joyful being with a friend. Or 
something happens, some success in something, and 
there’s delight in the success, or some thing is 
responsible for my joy.  
 
But with my Dharma practice has come the recognition 
that there can be joy and delight that are not dependent 
on the things out there. There can be joy and delight  2 that bubble up, tha t well up from within seemingly for no 
external reason whatsoever, and so knowing that joy is 
possible without the conditions of the world being a 
particular way. Joy is not dependent on the conditions of 
the world.  
 
One of the primary inner conditions, I think, that helps 
us find joy, both this kind of unconditional joy, but also 
conditional joy in the world, is being relaxed, being at 
ease. And the more at ease and relaxed we are, the 
easier it is to notice joy or to have space for it. If we ’re 
preoccupie d and really concerned about things, worried 
about things, planning about things, defending against 
things, remembering things, and being upset about 
things, then those things tend to interfere with the 
capacity for joy. If joy is like an open window, then  fear 
and resentment and preoccupation are like the blinds or 
the curtains; they get pulled in front of it. But if you lift up 
the blinds and pull apart the curtains and the window is 
open, then the fresh breeze comes in. So to be relaxed, 
I think, is real ly important.  
 
Another condition I ’m thinking about for delight and joy 
is appreciation – to be able to appreciate something like 
a beautiful day. You can appreciate the beautiful day 
even more after it ’s been stormy or cold, or difficult 
weather for a lon g time, and then you have this beautiful 
day. And you really appreciate it, and the contrast to the 
difficult, bad weather days. But then it becomes sunny  3 day after day after day for a long time, and the 
appreciation tends to fall away. And then we appreci ate 
the rain when it finally comes.  
 
But is there some way of having appreciation that is not 
so dependent on the vagaries of conditions? What can 
we appreciate that ’s deeper? I think that appreciation is 
kind of like joy as well. There can be appreciatio n that 
doesn ’t need a reason to appreciate. It ’s almost again 
like appreciation itself is an open window in the heart of 
something. And if the curtains are pulled open then 
there can be a sense of appreciation before there ’s a 
reason to appreciate. Isn ’t that great? I think it ’s 
fantastic. Maybe you think it ’s silly, to have appreciation 
without a reason.  
 
But then there ’s also the ability to see things, to 
appreciate actual things. I think that the deeper we 
appreciate something in ourselves, the better th en we 
can appreciate something in others as well. If we have 
nothing to appreciate in ourselves, then we can ’t see 
people, as deeply perhaps, and what ’s in them.  
 
One of the classic instructions around loving -kindness 
practice is to start with yourself. Th e reason that ’s given 
for starting with yourself is that if you start with yourself 
and develop a capacity to have kind, loving regard for 
yourself, then it ’s easier to have that kind, loving regard 
for others.   4  
If you see your own capacity to be loved, yo ur own 
capacity to be lovable or appreciate yourself, then it ’s 
easier to be able to turn that around, and see that other 
people have the same heart, the same kind of situation 
in their inner life, and you can wish them the same 
happiness, the same safety,  the same good will, 
because you recognise that place in yourself. So, to be 
able to appreciate something in other people.  
 
What are the barriers to appreciation? I think there are a 
lot of reasons why people don’t take the time to 
appreciate each other. S ometimes we’re afraid of each 
other. Appreciation means you let someone into your 
life. And they’ll take over, won’t they? And so better to 
stay guarded.  
 
So, there ’s fear. There can be all kinds of arguments 
that “That’s too ‘hallmarky, ’ too sentimental. And if 
you’re really astute person you would mostly realise that 
no-one can be trusted, and that everyone ’s out for their 
own good. And to be really wise is to be on guard  from 
being taken advantage of.  So all these things are then 
barriers for being able to appreciate someone else.  
 
Another barrier is to want to have something, get  
something from someone. There are  all kinds of things 
we can try to get from people: we can get things; we 
can get their attention;  we can get their approval,  5 support. We can tr y to manipulate them so they can see 
us in the way we want to be seen. And so we talk in 
certain ways, wear clothes in certain ways, and do all 
these things, hopefully, so people can see us in the way 
we want them  to. So we ’re trying to get something from 
someone, and desires like that also can interfere with 
appreciation, which arises most helpfully when we ’re 
quite relaxed, and we don ’t want a lot, just willing to take 
someone in, to experience something. When we ’re 
relaxed, it ’s easier to be in touch wit h ourselves. When 
we’re relaxed, it ’s easier to have that ‘intouchness, ’ to 
be in touch, to feel or sense someone else, and 
appreciate them as they are.  
 
One of the sources of appreciation in this meandering 
talk is – I have a lot of appreciation for people because I 
think life is pretty hard. I think it ’s a struggle. It ’s not 
easy to get through this human life of ours. And people 
do that, even with great struggle and difficulty. And 
because of that, people are engaged with trying to make 
it work. I h ave a lot of appreciation that people are 
trying, and working so hard at it.  
 
I have a lot of appreciation when people have a 
practice, like mindfulness or Buddhist practice, that 
they’re really trying to work with this difficult life and 
condition we have . I think there ’s so much goodness, 
and so much sincerity or strong effort that comes 
through in trying to cope and deal with this life of ours.  6 Some people are doing more than just coping; they ’re 
actually trying to do something very profound with 
liberat ion, with compassion and love, and looking very 
deeply at themselves. And I have so much appreciation 
for that; it ’s so beautiful.  
 
It’s an odd thing to be a teacher where people 
sometimes come and talk to me in interviews, and talk 
about how difficult the ir struggles  are, and what a 
terrible person they are. And I sit there, and I  just have 
so much appreciation:  wow. There ’s a disconnect 
sometimes between what they ’re saying and what I ’m 
seeing: “Wow, it ’s quite something to be with this 
person. ” 
 
And then , how many opportunities are there for joy and 
delight in our life that are really easily available if we just 
take a moment or two to relax and take it in? How many 
opportunities are there?  
 
There is the weather, for example , or other people, or 
really si mple things. There ’s a lot to appreciate, and we 
want to be careful not to be sentimental about it. Very 
careful not to paper over the difficulties and what isn ’t 
working. I know people who choose to look at the 
beautiful, happy, joyful, wonderful things o f life, and it ’s 
really just their way of avoiding the challenges, the 
difficulties, the dark side of life. And we don ’t want to do  7 that. We want to be very honest and complete and 
seeing reality as it actually is.  
 
But I see that more often than not, the problem is the 
opposite – that people have such a strong bias towards 
all the things that we don ’t appreciate, all the things that 
are reasons and causes for not feeling joy, or feeling the 
opposite. That seems to be the bias. I think we could do 
a little bit more encouragement to fill out the 
appreciation, the delight side of our life. And perhaps it 
just takes a moment standing in the line waiting for the 
checkout clerk in the market – and to look around 
noticing what can be appreciated standin g right the re. 
And I bet there are  an infinite number of things that can 
be appreciated standing there at the checkout counter.  
 
It’s a phenomenal thing that all these causes and 
conditions come together to allow us to buy bread, or 
whatever we ’re buying there; the p eople there are doing 
their work, and there ’s a lot to appreciate. Is it realistic? 
I think there ’s something that appreciation and joy and 
delight in each other and the situation gives us a more 
realistic picture of this life that we live in than if we on ly 
look at the challenges and difficulties and what isn ’t 
working. And if we have healthy appreciation and 
delight, I think we can hold the difficulties, and hold the 
challenges, and the faults that we all have – hold it in a 
very different perspective tha n if we only focus on the 
faults, the difficulties and challenges we have in our life.   8  
It’s such a beautiful thing, I think, to experience delight 
and joy. And I hope that all of you can take those 
moments and that time to relax enough, to begin taking 
in the joy and delight that maybe is much more easily 
available to you than you ’ve allowed yourself to take on.  
 
So, I offer that with my appreciation and delight in all of 
you.
