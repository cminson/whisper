 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's six o'clock in California, daylight savings time. It's really nice to be here again for the happy hour crew. For those of you who don't know, I occasionally step in for one of the regular teachers when they're not able to be here in this slot. I'm always happy to do so. Really glad. I'm wondering if Neil is going to put the link for the Google group in the chat. You can look and see there is a Google group for this worldwide sangha of a happy hour. You can connect and find out about things that are happening. You can disconnect with other people in the group and carry on with practicing goodwill with each other, friendliness in a more personal one-on-one way. Tonight I wanted to do a forgiveness practice. I know that's something that's been done often in happy hour. I think I might have led a forgiveness practice myself at least once before. We all have memories of things that happened to us that hurt us or harmed us in some way. On the other hand, we also have memories of things that we did or said that we don't feel so good about that maybe hurt or harmed someone else. I know some of us have probably experienced really serious trauma, but that's not really what I want to talk about tonight. I'm talking about the less serious kinds of harm that we experience and that we create ourselves. The kinds of things that have happened to us where we might say, oh, I'm over that, I'm done with that. But actually, if we're really honest with ourselves, there's still a little bit of a sting, a little bit of anger or resentment, a sense of unfinished business maybe. On the other side of the coin, I'm sure there are things that we've done that made us cringe a little bit, where we wish we could do a redo, a do-over, as they say, or maybe something that we didn't do, something that we omitted to do that we felt feel bad about, stand up for someone, comfort a friend, or maybe stop to help an injured animal on the road. Sometimes there's a little bit of a, not a scar exactly, but a little bit of a poke in the heart that follows us when things like that happen. I don't think anybody gets out of this life without having made a few mistakes in this area, the area of creating harm. And even small acts can leave a kind of a trace in the mind and heart, a place that's sensitive. So we can work with that. How do we work with that? How do we work with what's unskillful in others or in ourselves? What hurts, what still hurts when we touch it? How do we kind of clear the slate, maybe? Clear the slate within ourselves, even if it isn't possible to do that in the relationship where the harm took place. And forgiveness practice is usually part of the prescription for clearing the slate, for starting to heal those kinds of pains. So before introducing a practice for working with both kinds of harms, both the harms that we've experienced ourselves and the ones that we've created, I wanted to talk a little bit about guilt and remorse, because sometimes these two words are used interchangeably, but I see them as really different from each other in an important way. In my perception, the way I see guilt, it sees an unskillful or harmful action that we did as a statement about our character. It characterizes us. We say, oh, I'm a selfish person, or if it's someone else, she's a selfish person, or an angry person, or thoughtless, or stingy, or whatever it happens to be. So when we feel guilty ourselves, I think, excuse me, we characterize ourselves as kind of bad people, and quotes, and the same with others. Guilt kind of solidifies a particular view of a person, an identity by which we recognize them according to the action that they took that was unskillful. And I think that's true both when we assign guilt to someone else and when we assign guilt to ourselves. So I'd like to suggest that we can assign responsibility for an action to somebody, but we don't need to then create out of that a perpetually guilty person. And the way I see remorse, on the other hand, is that it arises in response to the event, the action that was harmful. When we feel remorse, it's prompted by, when we feel remorse ourselves, it's prompted by our conscience. There's an awareness of having done something that caused hurt or harm, and then there's an emotional response to that awareness that usually includes an impulse to want to make it better, to want to make amends in some way. And that's how I see remorse. It doesn't characterize us, it just acknowledges the responsibility for harm, and it wants to make amends. It's connected to the situation, not to a sense of our worthiness or our character who we define ourselves to be. And for those of you who are familiar with the Buddhist terms hiri and otapa, which are often spoken of as the guardians of the world, I think of remorse as the emotional aspect of hiri, a kind of pain that motivates us to do better in future. And this word hiri is h-i-r-i. It's often translated as conscience, so you can look at it that way. So with that kind of background, thinking of the difference between guilt and remorse, you know, just what we want to work with is remorse, and we want to just let go of the sense of guilt. And there's a classic forgiveness practice that I'm sure many of you have practiced before in Happy Hour and maybe in other contexts as well. And I thought we'd do a kind of a slight variation of that this evening. The typical forgiveness practice uses standard phrases that can be varied to apply to any harm that we've experienced ourselves, or that we've caused others, or that we've caused ourselves. And tonight what I'd like us to do, if we can, is to find our own words to address two specific incidents in the past that still cause a little bit of pain, a twinge of pain. One, something that you've done yourself that you don't feel good about, and then the other one, something that someone else did that harmed you in some way. So we'll go through them kind of in order, and then we'll kind of move from there into a more expanded place of metta, I think. The man who was my doctor when I was a child, just died last month, and he was 99 years old, very old man, really kind and wise. And something he said once that I read in his obituary, I thought was very wise. He said, what cannot be said will be wept. What cannot be said will be wept. And I think that it really speaks to the pain of not acknowledging our own pain. Both the pain that comes to us in life as a result of harms that happen to us, and the pain that we feel in recalling ways that we ourselves might have caused harm, the pain of hearing, of conscience. And when we clearly acknowledge what's happened, it helps us heal. And I think forgiveness is a practice that does that. True healing requires honesty, it requires acknowledgement of the harm that we've done, that's been done, if it's been done by someone else too. And remorse is a kind of a signal that lets us know we're not quite there, we're not really in harmony with integrity, we need to do a little bit of work. So my old doctor said, what cannot be said will be wept. When we don't acknowledge something that we've experienced or we've done, it's going to continue to cause us a little bit of pain, maybe a lot of pain. It's like a splinter poking in our foot or our hand, that every time we kind of bump into something, it gives us a little bit of a twinge. So with that introduction, let's move into a meditation practice, a formal practice of forgiveness. And we'll begin with a period of settling. So I invite you to find a posture that's comfortable and still alert so that you're awake to what's happening in your experience. And just be aware of what this moment is like right now, where you're sitting, what it's like in your body, what it's like to be in the posture you're in with the temperature in the room you're in and any sounds that are present, just being present to the environment. And then also present to what's happening in your mind and heart. What's the kind of weather that's arising in your mind and heart right now? And inviting a sense of settledness in your body and ease, inviting the mind to be at ease. Just take a little time with the breathing, your breathing, aware of the flow of the breath as it comes in and as it goes out, settling into the rhythm of that. If that's a help in settling the mind. And just practice that simple way for a few minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And now, if you would bring to mind an occurrence where you acted unskillfully, something that gives rise to an ouch, maybe, when you think of it. It could be something that happened long, long ago. Maybe it's something you said or an action you took or neglecting to take an action that would have been kind or helpful. Just recall the other person or other being who was there, who was part of the situation. See if you can really remember what it was like. What was the actual action or the words that prick your conscience a little bit. Just keep those in mind. And once you see that clearly or have a sense of it, a clear sense of it, ask the injured being for forgiveness. And I'll suggest some possible phrases, but you might find some more specific ones that work better for you. Here are a few. I spoke harshly to you out of anger and I asked your forgiveness. I know I treated you unkindly and I asked your forgiveness. I dismissed your concerns and I asked your forgiveness. I'm sorry for the harm I caused you. Please forgive me. Couple other suggestions. Please forgive me for not standing up for you. Please forgive me for not speaking up. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. And now you can say goodbye for now to this person or other being and wish them well maybe perhaps bow to them. And just settle back into your sense of the breath and your sense of yourself just sitting in the room where you are right now. Just feel the resonance of the practice so far in your body and your mind and your heart. And now I invite you to bring to mind a situation where someone else hurt or harmed you. And not the most painful hurts that you've experienced in life but something that comes back in a painful stinging way from time to time. And again it could be something from long ago or it could be something more recent. Harsh words, impatience, some kind of unkind action, maybe something more subtle like being ignored or not taken seriously. You can settle on a specific instance, a specific situation and bring it to mind as clearly as possible. Seeing the other person or other people in this situation as clearly as you can. And then again keeping the specific actions, specific words in mind offer your forgiveness just as much as you're able. Your intention to forgive if it's too hard to actually forgive now. It's important to be true to what's possible. No need to pretend. And here are a few possible phrases and please feel free to create more specific ones for yourself. I offer my forgiveness for the things you said to me that day. As much as I'm able, I forgive you for those unkind words. I want to forgive you for the way you hurt me at that time. As much as possible, I forgive you for not standing up for me. I want us to be reconciled. I forgive you for the harm you caused. I would like to be able to forgive you. I'm aiming for that. I've carried this pain for a long time and I would like to let go and forgive. Or maybe I'm not ready yet, but I'm willing to move toward forgiveness. I would like to forgive you for the harm you caused. And now you can bid goodbye for now to the being before you and once again just settle into your breathing. And notice the effect of the practice so far on your heart. You might find a release, maybe that's what it felt like or it's possible it could have been the opposite that you're more connected to the pain. It starts the healing, it removes the splinter that's causing a little ouch but sometimes we need to let go again and again and again before complete forgiveness is possible. Heart needs to be ready. Just invite a settled-ness, a knees into your mind, into your heart. You might put your hand on your heart if that feels good, feels right to you. Offer yourself some metta. May my heart be at peace. May my intention to forgive and to be forgiven, may they both be a balm to my heart. Just sit for a couple of minutes feeling your own kindness, kindness towards yourself, kindness towards the being that you might have harmed. Have harmed in any way in my life, have a peaceful heart. May they be at peace. May they be at ease. And may I one day come to forgive all the beings who've hurt or harmed me in my life. May my heart be free of blame, free of resentment. May my heart be at peace. May my heart be free of resentment. May my heart be free of resentment. May my heart be free of resentment. May my heart be free of resentment. May my heart be free of resentment. May my heart be free of resentment. May all beings be safe and protected, protected from outer harm and from the inner harm that comes from ill will, from greed, from aversion. May all beings know peace and happiness. May all beings be free of enmity and blame. May all beings be completely free. May all beings know peace and happiness. May all beings know peace and happiness. May all beings know peace and happiness. So I'd like you to have time in breakout groups, but before you go into breakout groups, I'd love to hear any comments or questions you have about forgiveness, anything that was useful to you or not useful in the practice. Yeah, Padma, unmute yourself. Hi, thank you, thank you. The first category is on the next category, where I chose somewhat more difficult situations or situations. I've been doing that for a few minutes as well, even before this session. When I see that person, I encounter that person because those are still here. Sometimes that hurt, it's nice. How do we go about that? So those are two questions. In regard to the first question, I think when people are gone, is the person no longer alive? Is that, yeah, sometimes it takes time. I think forgiveness is always a practice that takes time. It doesn't happen immediately. To have the intention to let go of a hurt, that in itself is really beneficial. To continue, sometimes what helps is to bring to mind the conditioning that gave rise to the person's being, to your, whatever the mistake was that you made, whatever the unkindness was that you did. Recognizing the conditions at the time that were affecting you so that there is that sense of just having remorse and not feeling that there's something bad about you because you did something that was unskillful, because we all do, of course. So that, I think, it just takes time. And then with the other side of the question, yeah, it's definitely, often when we see a person who has harmed us in the past, it's going to trigger a little bit more of the pain. So it could be a little bit more intense, but we still work with it, I think, in the same way, just maybe not when they're present. Maybe we can't ever be in their presence. Maybe it's not safe to be in their presence in some way, emotionally, for us, but we can still have our heart be not, you know, not constricted and tight as a result of just continuing to practice and practicing metaphor ourselves, too, is helpful, I think. Thanks. Yeah, thanks. Anybody else? If you want to put your hand up. Is that Diana? Did you want to say something? Yeah, if you could unmute yourself. I had a very interesting reaction. I didn't feel, I don't think, much in the way of forgiving or... I didn't feel much of this. What came to me was the fact that I could do this practice. In other words, I felt that I, in actually facing situation number one or situation number two and thinking about what I've done, I felt, I truly felt that there was a possibility of the courage just to be with something and not just go around avoiding it. Ah, that's great. Just like saying these phrases. Yeah, that's terrific. I think they weren't big deal things. Maybe some are, but these little festering, which is one of my habits. I just felt all of a sudden, gee, I can do this. It's not such a big deal in this case. Thank you. That's terrific. I think that points to something. I think when we're really acknowledging something that we've done and we really feel the unskillfulness of it and recognize the conditioning that went into it, then it sort of, it removes the need for forgiveness in a way. It just, okay, you just can be kind of in contact with the experience, recognize it as unskillful and go on from there. That's real healing, I think. Just doing this, I felt, is kind of freeing. Great. That's great. So now, okay, thank you. Yeah, that's great. Thanks. Nice comment. You have Vardra? You know, for me, it was something that I feel terrible about, but I was in a situation where I couldn't do otherwise. Uh-huh. And so I'm left forever feeling what? Just sorry. I mean, sometimes you're in a position of responsibility and you have to do something because that's your job. It's caused terrible pain. So maybe you need to forgive yourself, then. Okay. Yeah. And if it's hard to forgive, just start with metta, and then move to forgiveness. So recognizing, like I said before, recognizing the conditions that came together to create the situation where you had to act in a particular way, recognizing that not feeling guilty, but just having that sense of, oh, you know, I wish I hadn't done that, but that's what was required, you know? And then just coming to forgive yourself, sometimes that's the hardest. You. Yeah. Uh-huh. Thanks, Vardra. So now it's, I'd really like us to have some time to share in the group. So I'm going to create some breakout rooms. There are 32 of you. I'm going to create eight rooms. So that's now, we're down to 30 now. I know this always happens. Okay. I'll create six rooms and seven rooms. And you'll have about 10 minutes. And if you could, you know, make sure everyone who's in the group, there should be three or four people in the group. Make sure that everyone gets a chance to speak and just, you know, share about this practice, share about whatever else you'd like to. That's up for you right now. And here it goes. Okay. Okay.
