The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So warm welcome, warm welcome everybody to a happy hour.
And one thing that sometimes we hear about or read about in the suttas is about anger,
how anger is generally viewed as unhelpful and that it can be poisonous.
It can eat us up inside.
And I know there's lots of different views about anger and some people think it certainly should be angry about the injustices and prejudices and biases and all kinds of terrible things that are happening.
But the Buddhist tradition and this early tradition, they're not denying that, but they are pointing to how it can really eat us up inside this anger.
And sometimes if we if the anger is directed towards us, somebody's yelling at us or whatever.
And then we sometimes get angry back when we start, you know, find ourselves raising our voices, speaking harshly or whatever it might be or try to squash them in some kind of way with our words.
That's a natural response but I'm sure there's that much wisdom in it because then where do you go from there.
And instead you might say things that you later regret and doesn't necessarily like create the conditions in which some greater understanding might occur.
Or something another way we might respond if somebody reacts towards us with anger is maybe we're like indirectly trying to point them to their error their ways.
It's really obvious that we're trying to do that.
You know, sometimes when people will ask, well, do you think that all people should do that every everywhere or who do you think you are. I don't know.
There's some way in which people can not yell in their response, but the way that they respond is they're trying to like poke the person and has a little bit of that anger attitude or something like that inside of it.
And that also isn't helpful often because people can just close down. I know I certainly do.
When I feel like somebody's like indirectly they're not really saying what they want to say but they're hinting at it and it's a kind of frustrated but what can we just be clearly here or plainly or if you're angry with me or upset.
Can we just talk about it.
There's a third way, of course, in which we might respond if somebody is angry towards us.
And this works as well if we are angry at ourselves also, but that is to meet this negative energy is however it's getting expressed.
Whether it's with yelling or indirectly or with an email or however it might be.
But to meet it with space.
With space.
And within that space that has an attitude of some acceptance of, okay, here's here's anger.
As opposed to immediately feeling like we have to respond in any particular way.
And then I know that allows something else to unfold and it might be.
I don't know what the chances are it's different in different situations, but it might be that within that space.
The person who is expressing their anger they might have an opportunity to reflect on this or to notice it or to get back in touch with themselves.
Oh, yeah, I'm angry.
And to feel it and to be a little bit less just taking away that.
Instead of just being carried away by the momentum at the moment, if we can as best we can, provide some space that has this sense of acceptance or some warmth to me.
We might do this we might give people some space that has a quality of warmth and what does that look like will look different maybe it's sometimes with our body language.
If that's appropriate at the time if they can see us is to look and see that.
But I can hear that there's a little bit of background noise so I'm just going to mute to few review. Just, I think sometimes this happens.
So, that we can have with. So, one way we can do this space is with our body language to still clearly be present, clearly still be engaged.
Maybe we don't say anything, or maybe we say something like can you say something more, or something like this, and maybe the person who's angry will have just continue ranting and raving and being anger and will not take that space
and will not reflect back on themselves they will not change their trajectory there on and they'll just keep on going until they run out of energy or something like this.
We have no control over this right, but it might be that if we can meet with some space.
Maybe that means that we don't respond directly to what they're saying or more asking them to give them space to say more, or the invitation to say more.
There might be, there can be the opportunity for something different to unfold for there to be a shift.
No guarantees no guarantees we don't get to control other people.
But we're helping to create the conditions in which the anger can be mitigated the anger can be softened brought down and things can shift and maybe a conversation can happen.
So there's no guarantee that giving space to negative energy will resolve situation no guarantees.
But it does give the other person the opportunity.
It does give the other person the chance to maybe work with it.
And, and the alternative to respond with more anger or to completely close down and run away or to try to indirectly poke them or manipulate them in some way.
That pretty much is a guarantee not for not always that something profound won't happen.
But they won't have a new understanding we won't feel like we understand things better but if we give space.
There's the chance that something profound will happen that they'll have a greater understanding that will have a greater understanding that we will understand them better.
So, giving space.
And I keep on using this phrase and it's a vague expression, and it takes so many different forms.
Maybe it's being silent. Maybe it's encouraging people to say more, but we say it in a way that has warmth and care in our body language or tone.
Maybe if not explicitly in our words, but to give space is one of the best things we can do for other people is one way we can care for them.
Help them and it's a noble thing to do.
And it doesn't mean that at the moment we're condoning what they're saying is not saying that we're agreeing with them.
We're creating the conditions in which they might have a different understanding than which they might grow or something.
So we might consider it as a gift, a gift to others and a gift to ourselves.
So this idea of getting space to others, of course, this is one way in which loving kindness can be expressed. And our having practice loving kindness and equanimity allows us to tap into allows us to have the capacity to not be reactive when people are angry to us.
Allows us to instead respond with some warmth and care and space.
So with that as an introduction, let's do some meditation practice.
I'm going to adjust my chair here.
I'm taking a posture, comfortable posture that's alert and has some comfort with it, but also some uprightness.
And just feeling into the moment, what does it feel like to be sitting here now.
The pressure of the chair against the body.
And the body breathing.
Can we tune into the experience of breathing in a way that's
very peaceful. We're not straining or bouncing. Just a relaxed, easy and yet committed way being with the experience of breathing.
Feeling the rhythm of breathing.
Feeling the rhythm of breathing.
Feeling the rhythm of breathing.
Feeling the rhythm of breathing.
And when the mind wanders, we just very simply, gently begin again.
We don't have to make it a problem. We don't have to make a big story. Just begin again.
Feeling the rhythm of breathing.
Is there a way that we can give ourselves space when we notice that the mind is drifted away from the breath.
Feeling the rhythm of breathing.
We begin our living kindness practice. We need to mind a loveable being.
We can wear some being whereby it's uncomplicated to feel warm hearted towards them.
We know about imaginary kittens, puppies, babies, pets, whomever.
Connecting with this loveable being.
And then to support the cultivation of living kindness.
We can say these phrases.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
And then to expand our living kindness.
To include ourselves.
Taking care of ourselves.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Of course we can modify the phrases.
But these words don't quite work for you.
No problem.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And somebody who's a little bit irksome.
I'll offer a few phrases.
Even with equanimity practice we just choose one.
You can do what feels right for you.
So bringing the irritating person to mind.
And say this phrase.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices.
I care about you and I cannot keep you from difficulties.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot keep you from difficulties.
Your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your actions.
Not upon my wishes for you.
Your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your actions.
Not upon my wishes for you.
Your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your actions.
No matter how I might wish things to be otherwise, things are as they are.
I wish you happiness and unhappiness depend upon your actions.
Thank you for watching.

When we are experiencing anger,
I would like to put you into rooms of three or four,
and we'll meet for like 13 minutes or so.
It's helpful to not say every idea you have about this topic,
but maybe there's a,
maybe you have just one idea, something that you could share,
and then as opposed to a big, long story, and then it goes to the next person,
and they say just one thing, and then it goes to the next person,
maybe something new will arise in your mind.
Maybe you'll hear yourself say something that you are a little bit surprised about,
like, wow, I didn't even know that I thought that or something like this.
So we can, if it's helpful in the circle,
you can go in the order of the day of the month you were born.
If you were born on the first of the month, you would go first.
And here we go.
Okay.
Let's see.
Welcome back. Welcome back everybody.
Anybody have a comment or a question or something that they'd like to share after that breakout group?
Anybody have something they'd like to add?
I do.
It's like to provide an opportunity just in case.
I have a comment that might be helpful to everyone.
Yes.
In one of these sessions, the teacher gave us four things.
I remember the first two or three, and maybe that's all that's needed, but if things are bad, don't make it worse.
If you're making it worse, stop.
If there's a way to make it better, see that.
That might be number four.
I'm missing number three.
There you go. Thank you.
Let's see. So this is a shorthand way for the right efforts. Let's see.
Number four is keep it.
If it's going well, keep it. I think. And the number three is if it's continue.
I don't remember exactly it is, but it's kind of like just create the conditions in which the bad stuff or don't make things worse and if you can make them better.
I think that's what you were saying too. So thank you. Thank you.
That's in the Eightfold Path. For those of you who are familiar with this Buddhist teachings, it's one way to understand that.
Some of Yama, I think is that right effort.
But to put our energy towards.
Okay, so here we are at the top of the hour. So thank you all for your practice.
It's a beautiful thing to practice together and that we come together and explore and grapple with maybe some of these teachings.
So thank you.
And I'll see you next week.
So bye-bye.
If you like it, you can unmute and we'll see you guys.
Bye-bye. Thank you everyone.
Bye-bye. Thank you.
Thank you Diana.
Bye-bye everyone.
Thank you all. Thanks so much.
Bye-bye.
Thank you Sangha. Thank you.
Thank you. Welcome.
