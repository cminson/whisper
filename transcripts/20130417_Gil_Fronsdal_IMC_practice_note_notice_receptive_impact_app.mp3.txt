Practice Note : Notice Receptive Impact

In mindfulness practice it is useful to distinguish 
between the impacts our experiences have on us , and 
our responses or reactions to those  experiences . 
Sometimes they happen so fast , that we don’t always 
see the difference between them. In the practice of 
mindfulness,  it is sometimes useful to intentionally linger 
with and be curious about the impact s that things have 
on us  in the moment.  
 
The word ‘impact ’ is an alternative for what in Buddhism 
is called “contact” or “sense contact ”. For example,  if 
you hear a really loud car rumble by, you experience the 
contact – which you can feel and sense – of that sound 
wave hitting your ear . Then you can  ask, “What is the 
impact on you of that sound contact? How is that 
received in your system? ”  
 
If you immediately go into your judgments about loud 
cars and IMC being in this kind of neighborhood, then 
you lose touch with the immediate , receptive impact of 
the car sound . If you  have an ache in your knee,  you 
could go int o how you should go to a doctor , or your 
knee might fall off , or “This is terrible !” But before you go into the reaction, linger with the im pact. What does it 
feel like in your feet , leg, and knee ? How is the 
receptive impact if you don’t go into all the stories and 
ideas around it?  
 
If you go out and stand in the sun rather than in the 
shade, the impact  on you  will be different . It will be 
received in the system differently. Standing in the sun, 
you might feel warm and relaxed , before you start 
thinking that you shouldn’t stand out in the sun because 
you might  get skin cancer. What is the immediacy of the 
experience? What is the impact?  
 
When you step in walking meditation, what is the impact 
on you of that contact w ith the ground? If you are there 
and receive  it, you feel the  receptive impact. How does 
it reverberate through your leg and system to feel that 
contact  with the ground ? You certainly feel the hardness  
of that contact , and the shifting sensation s in your leg. 
Maybe s ome people , feeling the solidity of the ground,  
have a sense of assurance.  
 
If you are sitting in meditation, what is the impact of the 
experience of breathing? If you are attentive to your 
breath, what is the receptive impact on you  – not just in 
the immediacy o f your chest or lungs  – but in opening 
up and expand ing the field of awareness in your body ? 
Is there a receptive impact ?  
 The idea of  receptive impact  is to notice it  before  there 
is a reaction to it. There is not a hard and fast line  
between the  impact and the reaction , but rather , the 
idea to see  the difference between the experience of the 
impact and the reaction to it.  
 
As you practice this morning, you might see if you can 
linger, stay with, be curious about the immediacy of the 
receptive impact  on you . Stay in the world of the 
sensory impact, and how it’s received in your system, 
whatever it might be  – even thinking.  You might have  a 
thought , or a story  – but if you relax and open up , you 
might see the impact on the system of having this sort 
of response . If you  have a tense though t, you might feel 
the impact  as unpleasant .  
 
What's the receptive impact on you? Can you h ang out 
there and receive the impact ? This exercise is not an 
exercise of doing , or making something happen , or 
changing anything  – but rather just be ing curious, 
staying in the present moment . What's it like to receive 
this experience in the system ? 
 
I hope that makes sense.  
 
Enjoy the impact of the world on you.
