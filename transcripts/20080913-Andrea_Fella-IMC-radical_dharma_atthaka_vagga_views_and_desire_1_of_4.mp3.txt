 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. If you didn't pick up one of the handouts, there's handouts there and the books, we have more of the books if you didn't get a copy of the book. The handout is the sort of flow through the text that we'll be taking today and the book contains the entire text that we're looking at today. So the subject for our study today is the Ataka Vaga and it's widely considered to be one of the oldest discourses in the Pali Canon and that's one of the reasons for its interest. That it's considered that it was actually composed fairly early in the time of the Buddhist teaching. So it's interesting from that standpoint because it may reflect some of the earliest ways that the Buddha taught, not only the content but the style of the teaching. And also today since we're such a small group, I'm happy to have it be kind of interactive. You know we don't have to have it be too formal. So if you'd like to ask a question, please do raise your hand because I may have a thought or something I want to complete before answering a question. So in terms of it being one of the oldest texts, there's some evidence that supports this so I'll just talk a little bit about that. The main evidence that supports it is that there are several suttas in the Pali Canon proper that actually refer to this text. There's one discourse in which a monk is reciting the Atakavaga to the Buddha and the Buddha complements him on his skill in reciting it and I believe he also states that it's a very good text to memorize. So I think this text or this discourse was seen as a teaching tool in many ways. It was a good text for monks to memorize when they went out into the forest. So there's three or so suttas that actually refer to this text. And then there is another text in the Pali Canon called the Mahanidasa which is actually a complete commentary on this text. It goes kind of word for word or word by word through the sutta and the style of the Mahanidasa is basically it's like a glossary of terms. It takes various terms out of the Atakavaga and explains them. It says this word means this set of things and this word means this set of things and in fact, nidasa means explanation or definition, something along those lines. So the Mahanidasa is simply a compilation of terms of the Atakavaga. But the fact that there are several texts in the Pali Canon that actually refer to this discourse indicates that this discourse was composed at least prior to those suttas, those parts of the Canon and maybe prior to other parts of the Canon as well. The other evidence that supports the text being a fairly old discourse is that the language of the Pali that's used in this text is a very simple and very simple way to describe an older or more archaic style. So that also, I don't actually know Pali so I can't speak to this but as I've been reading all kinds of scholarly studies about this text, this is one of the main reasons why it's seen to be one of the oldest texts because of the type of Pali that's used in this text. So widely through the scholarly community that those that study Buddhism and Buddhist texts for scholastic purposes, the Atakavaga, which is a portion of the suttanipata, the suttanipata is a compilation of several texts, maybe, I don't know how many suttas are there in it, maybe about 10, do you know Tony how many suttas are in the suttanipata? Something eight or ten? Yeah, I'm not sure. So there's not many, it's a pretty small work. This is the suttanipata. It's a lot of verses. It's mostly poetry actually. So the suttanipata, the Atakavaga is one sutta out of the suttanipata. So most of the scholars seem to believe that it is one of the oldest texts composed and that it does represent an early teaching of the Buddha. There are other opinions on this matter, Than Jeff in particular being one who has some other opinions on this, and he looks at those two bits of information and basically says, well, the first one about the texts, other texts in the Pali Canon that refer to the Atakavaga, well, there's like three or so texts. And he says, well, you know, so the Atakavaga was composed before three texts in the Pali Canon, you know, that's not a tremendous number. And the other piece of evidence about the language, he points out that in general poetry in the Pali Canon as a whole uses a more archaic form of Pali. And this entire text is poetry. So, you know, he feels that that also is not necessarily a reason why it was composed early. And he points out that this is common throughout history, that, you know, language of poetry tends to be more archaic than language of prose within the same, that's written in the same time period. So I don't know, you know, I cannot really judge this. I can imagine, actually, you know, when I think about the fact that the Atakavaga is a very, very, very powerful, particularly, you know, when I think about the verses in the Pali Canon, I think many of them may be referring to past teachings. But, you know, I don't know. So I just put that out there as a an interesting fact about the age of the teachings. And in any case, I think that the teachings themselves are extremely interesting, whether or not they're the oldest teachings of the Buddha. They are very interesting and they are also very unusual for the Pali Canon. They speak in a way that is much more, you know, worldly, this life oriented than much of the Pali Canon. So it's a very interesting teaching and we'll be exploring how it's different from the teachings of the rest of the Canon and the stand some of the standard Theravada views. And we'll be looking at the teachings of the rest of the Canon and the stand some of the standard Theravada views and we'll explore the teaching of the Atakavaga in and of itself as well. So the text is relatively short. It consists of verses 766 to 975. So 210 or so verses. But it's very dense. And we're not going to be able to cover it completely. We're not going to go through it poem by poem or line by line. Instead what I've decided to do is to explore several of the main themes of the Atakavaga and hope that you'll be interested enough for further explanation, further exploration yourself. And if you are interested in further exploration of the Atakavaga, this entire suta is in the in Tanjef's book and you might be interested if if you do want to make a further explanation at some point today to copy down the verse numbers which I have figured out on this printed out copy. Tanjef does not put the verse numbers in his texts so it makes it a little hard to cross check with other translations. So if you are interested you might just want to copy down the verse numbers or get a sense of what the verse numbers are. I'll leave this available for you to to make that transcription if you're interested. So my way of exploring a suta is to explore what it means to me to read the text and actually to read several translations of the text. And for this class I've been studying this text now for six months. I used three or four maybe translations. I used Tanjef's translation quite a bit as well as his notes. I used Norman's translation. He has an entire translation of this sutani pata. Norman. K.R. Norman. I used Sadatisa's translation and I think these these translations are fairly easy to get. These two are still available readily. And then I used one that I found online by Biku Virado. And I found this through Wikipedia believe it or not. Wikipedia had an article on the Ataka Vaga and it pointed to this translation. And I found this to be one of the most readable of the translations. Many of the others were a little hard to read. So I kind of used this to get my own sense my initial sense of the of what the meaning is. And then I went go to the other translations. I believe that Tanjef's translation and Norman's translations are the most accurate in terms of the actual poly translation. And as Gil told me he said when I read translations I'll always go to Norman because Norman is extremely accurate. Although he's not a practitioner. So you know the sense of the terms may not reflect the practice side but the language is correct. So that's an interesting point to know if you're interested in studying various suttas. The Biku Virado one I found to be very readable and I could get a general sense and I think that's that's helpful for some of these more archaic forms of poly in the translation. You know Tanjef's translation I think is fairly accurate but reflecting the form of the verses as it does it's also a little hard to read. So so I think it's helpful to look at some other translations. Now the the Virado translation unfortunately some weeks after I pulled it off the site disappeared. I can't find it anymore. You tried. Yeah I can't I can't find it anymore. But Virado I believe lives up in. I'm a lot of we live in Amravati it says so I may write him at some point and see if it can be put back online. But I you know if you're interested in it I can loan you this copy or make a copy for you. You know it's because it's this is the only copy I know of at the moment. But I used I used this one quite heavily. The Virado version. There's also several other versions out there. Three other versions I know of that I skimmed but didn't use as has heavily. So the way I do it is I read the suta. I go through the various translations try to get an understanding for myself of what it means. And and then I start thinking about it with respect to and as I do that of course I think about it with respect to what I already know from the Buddhist teachings. And I think about how it how I may understand it through my experience. So I you know I go through it in kind of different levels in terms of study. So the Ahtaka Vaga is basically it's 16 poems and primarily the subject of the Ahtaka Vaga is clinging and how clinging gets in the way of peace and purity of mind. So in the standard Pali definition of clinging there are four kinds of clinging clinging to sense sense pleasure clinging to precepts and practices sometimes called rights and rituals clinging to views and clinging to identity view. I'll just give a brief a brief. Is anybody not familiar with these four types of clinging familiar with what they are. I can give a little brief summary. Maybe I'll just do that just for the recording sake. So sense pleasure is pretty pretty easy to understand. That's the clinging to what's pleasurable. It's something that we all know. It's it's a way that we all live our lives essentially. We like things that are pleasant. We want them and we hold on to them. So that's clinging to sense pleasure. It's not the pleasure itself. That's the issue here. It's the clinging to it the holding on to it that the kind of demand that it stay. Clinging to precepts and practices is a basically a belief clinging to a belief that a particular kind of action purifies us or will lead us to freedom or liberation. So I believe in the Buddhist day there were certain kinds of practices that people did practice in this way. I think that bathing in the river Ganges was seen as a purifying and may even still to this day be seen as a very purifying thing that that action itself is a practice called the dog duty ascetic where the practitioner behaved like a dog in all ways eating food that was thrown to him barking crawling around on all fours and again believing that that would purify. So the the clinging to the belief that any kind of action will purify or actually ultimately to any kind of Dharma any kind of teaching the clinging to any teaching is seen as something that gets in the way of our ultimate freedom. And that's a very interesting point because it points to essentially that we can't even cling to the Dharma can't even cling to the Buddhist teachings. And we'll we'll talk about that more as we go on through the day clinging to views is basically all forms of views and opinions views basically are kind of like a filter on experience. They and we'll talk a lot more about this too as we go through the day. The views is one of the main topics I wanted to talk about. Basically, you know, we see our experience through our views about experience through our ideas or beliefs. It's as if you know our beliefs or beliefs about experience. Kind of filter how we take in our reality. That if I believe that I'm a I'm a miserable person, then all of my experience or much of my experience will be filled with the same experience. And I think that's a very interesting point. I'm a I'm a miserable person, then all of my experience or much of my experience will be filtered through that lens. And then there is identity view or personality view. This is basically view of view of who we are, construction of an identity. And once we have an identity or a belief in who we are, there's a way in which that limits us in a sense. It limits us if we think that we are capable or not capable of some particular thing that that that limits us in terms of what we may or may not believe we can do. So this identity view filters again like it's a view. So it behaves in the same way views do. It filters our experience. We we come up with an identity and then not only do we have this view that filters our experience, we believe there's some way in which we need to protect that identity, that it becomes almost like a part of our body. We're afraid of having it challenged or threatened in some way. So the Ahtaka Vaga highlights two of these in particular. It talks about all four of them. But in particular, it really highlights the clinging to sense pleasure and clinging to views. And, you know, if I think about it, the beliefs and the rights and rituals and the identity view are basically forms of views. That the rights and rituals is a view that a particular behavior will purify and the identity view is a view of self. So I think that by focusing on views and sense pleasure, the Ahtaka Vaga really covers the entire range of the teaching on clinging. I'd like to talk just a little bit about the structure of the Ahtaka Vaga, since we're not going to go through it, the whole thing. Basically, the Ahtaka Vaga has three main, well, it covers these two main pieces of clinging to views and clinging to sense pleasure. And it does this in three main ways. It talks about the ordinary person and their relationship to clinging to views and sense pleasure. It talks about the person who has become liberated, become free from clinging and their relationship to views and desires. So a large part of the teaching, much of the teaching is simply descriptions of people behaving in the world and whether they are ordinary people or people who are in training, essentially, or whether they are awakened people. Then there are the verses that describe training, how one moves from being an ordinary person to being a liberated person. So it's fairly simple in structure. And it alternates the themes. So the first couple of suttas are focused on sense pleasure, then there's a few suttas on views, and then a few more suttas on sense pleasure, and a few more suttas on views. And it just kind of goes back and forth like that. And then the last three suttas are really focused on the topic of training, how one moves from one to the other. Now the theme of training is pulled throughout. You'll find verses on training throughout the suttas, but they're really focused in those last three. So in an exploration of this text, if you choose to study it yourself, you might take an interest in what each verse is doing. Is it talking about a person who's on the path or not yet awakened? Is it talking about a person who's awakened? Or is it talking about how to move from one to the other? So in terms of the content, moving into the content a little bit more now, there's a few themes I want to discuss. First of all, I'd like to discuss a little bit about what the text has to say about being liberated. What does it have to say about that freedom of mind? Then I'd like to talk a little bit about the desire teachings, and then about the views teachings. So that this roughly this morning, I'll talk about the liberation teachings. What does it say about, have to say about liberation? What does it have to say about desire? And beginning to talk a little bit about views this morning and then the afternoon more on views. And then the last piece I want to talk about is how the Theravada tradition viewed this teaching. Because as you'll see, as we move through this, it's more bare or in some ways a more radical teaching than the Theravada teaching. Or it's radical from the perspective of the traditional Theravada teaching, let's put it that way. So what does the text have to say about liberation? Given the way the text teaches that it focuses on people in the world and whether they are in training or already liberated, it primarily describes liberation in terms of people who have reached liberation. So the descriptive qualities are very much things that people do or qualities that people have. So the first suta in the handout, well, we won't read this entire suta, but this suta is basically the first the first verse basically is someone asking the Buddha. I want to ask you about the perfect man. Basically, tell me about someone who's liberated. These people we call men who are calmed. Can you tell me how they see things and how they behave? So it's very much looking at how does a person who is liberated behave? How are how do they function? I just one one point in this translation, which is sattatises translation, the term calm translates the Pali Santi, S A N T I, which is also often translated as peace. So let's just read a few of these verses. So eight, eight forty nine through eight fifty three. Let's just go that far. A man who is calmed, who has extinguished all his craving before the time his body disintegrates into nothing, who has no concern with how things began or with how they will end and has no fixation with what happens in between. Such a man has no preferences. So this is the first piece of the person has no preferences. He has no anger, no fear and no pride. Nothing disturbs his composure and nothing gives him cause for regret. He is a wise man who is restrained in speech. Again, very simple description. No anger, no fear, no pride. These are just qualities of a person, a normal human being. Well, a very free human being, but something that we can kind of recognize. He has no longing for the future and no grief for the past. There are no views or opinions that lead him. He can see detachment from the entangled world of sense impressions. He does not conceal anything and there is nothing he holds on to without acquisitiveness or envy. He remains unobtrusive. He has no disdain or insult for anyone. He is not a man who is full of himself or a man who is addicted to pleasure. He is a man who is gentle and alert with no blind faith. He shows no aversion to anything. So it goes on in this form and the thing that really stands out, I think, about this is that the primary way that this person is described is by what they have. They are not. So they are not angry, they are not prideful. They don't hold on to things. They have no grief for the past, no views or opinions that lead them. No acquisitiveness, no envy, no disdain for people. So the primary description is what they have let go of. This reminds me of the... Oh, do you want to use the... There is a conflict, but there are two divergent interpretations of this and one of them is, this phrase, such a man has no preferences. It reminds me of the translation of that long poem. The great way is not difficult for one who is not attached to preferences and the whole discussion about nothing wrong with the preferences just don't cling to them. So the clinging there is described as something that happens once the preferences show up and here he seems to be... Is that second, is that not attached to preferences? That's the Philip Moffat version. Is that the current Theravadan line or is that just sort of what's floating around out there? You know, I'm not positive, but my sense is that that doesn't cling to preferences is probably the Western interpretation of it. My read on the suttas is like, you know, that preferences are about liking and disliking and that that's got some clinging to it so that the clinging is the preference, the preference is the clinging. So that's my understanding of that. Now, I think that it is and what this text, I think, really does go to will seem over and over that this text is not a world denying text. It doesn't... Over and over, it talks about how people live in the world and are free. So it's not retreat from the world, escape from the world, move into complete detachment from the world. It's about being free within the world. So it is the pleasure, the pleasant and unpleasant can be there and interacting with sense pleasure, but the clinging to it. Weeding to preferences or the preferences being a manifestation of the clinging. Yeah. There are a few in this text, a few positive descriptions of a person who is free. So they are like calmed or peaceful, which is that term shanti. Then in verse 8 53, gentle alert. A little further down, I believe there's a wise, mindful, even minded. So there are few, a very few positive descriptions, but mostly it's about what they have let go of. Throughout the Ahtaka Vaga as a whole, there are a few of these positive descriptions. There's peace is one of the main ones, seclusion is another one. And there's some verses I have in the next the next page, some verses that describe some of the positive qualities of someone who is liberated. So peaceful. So peaceful. Verse 9 14, he's peaceful amidst all things, whether seen, heard or thought. So again, it is talking about the quality of being awake within the world. Peaceful amidst things, peaceful amidst seeing, hearing, thinking. The next one, knowing the cooling of desire as peace. And again, this is the same term that's translated as calm in the suta that we just read, knowing the cooling of desire as peace. So that's a little bit more, it's again still in the world because the cooling of desire happens in the world that that that action of mind letting go of desire results in the peace. So here it's equating essentially the release from desire with the goal of the path, the peace. Purity is another term that's often used for. This quality of this equality of someone who is liberated. So one who is pure has no preconceived view about anything in the world. Purity. I like the term purity in some way, because when we think of pure, you know, like we have a pure glass of water, it means there's nothing extra in it. There's nothing extra in that water. So that's what purity is. And many times in talking about purity in the this teaching, it talks about. That one who is pure is not pure because of adding anything. That it is only through the letting go of things that purity comes. So again, this is again kind of the pointing to the non clinging through this term of purity. Knowing and wisdom are seen to be as important qualities or qualities that manifest in someone who is liberated. One of great wisdom who has penetrated the Dhamma. And this is contrasted with a person who is bound to ideas, a person who's bound to ideas and undertaking religious observances goes high to low. But one of great wisdom who has penetrated Dhamma does not go high to low. And there's no particular description of what high to low means. But it's a kind of a felt sense I get of somebody who is pulled down into the mire of struggle. In discovering he is a knower of the highest, having found Dhamma, he is emancipated. So it's the knowing here is talking about knowing the Dhamma, knowing the truth. Now, this this is an interesting thing, actually, all of these terms. Well, let's just talk about seclusion first, this last one, a person who does not cling to the future nor sorrow over the past, who finds seclusion amidst sense contacts and is not led astray by views. So, again, it's talking about here, it's not talking about physical seclusion from the world, something that seclusion amidst the world. Many of these terms here that we that we're looking at as describing someone who is liberated in the Ataka Vaga, there are times when these same terms are used to describe someone who is caught. And this is one of the interesting pieces about this text, that there seem to be some paradoxes or seem to be some kowans almost to to work with. So the quality of knowing at times is seen to be a manifestation of someone who's liberated. And at times, it seems to be describing someone who is caught by their knowledge. So it's it's something we'll explore a little bit more later on. But just so that you know, these terms, as we as we use them here, they're not used consistently to describe someone who is caught by their knowledge. As we as we use them here, they're not used consistently through the text in terms of when you see the term, you know, one who is pure, you need to really look at the context to see whether it's talking about someone who is fully liberated or someone who is caught by their own idea of purity. So that's an important piece in the exploration of this text. One way to explore the text in these terms is, Tanjef makes the suggestion, and I followed it in my own reading, to read through the text with an eye to whether the verse is describing again, there are these these modes of description, whether it's describing someone who is liberated or someone who is training to be liberated. And the terms again, the terms of people, sometimes there's Brahman, Muni, Muni meaning the silent one, I believe there's some other terms, the secluded one, there's several terms that refer to someone who is liberated. But again, an expert that's sometimes used someone who has a lot of knowledge expert. These terms are used both ways, they're used to refer to somebody who is, well, they're actually used in three ways, they're used to refer to somebody who is in training, they're used to refer to somebody who's fully liberated, and they are also at times used to refer almost with like quotes around them, a so called expert, or a pure person. So that it's, it's interesting to read this text, because there's so many ways in which it engages your, your thinking around what is actually being said here. Is that peculiar to this text? I do not know of another text that does it, but I cannot say that it's completely peculiar. I've not really seen it. Well, there are some places where it does talk about the other, some of the other views that people hold, but it's not, it's not quite so stark in this way of that I that I know of, but I definitely can't say that for sure. Yeah. Excuse me, could you say a little bit more about seclusion? I didn't quite get the difference between being secluded from the world. But, so you said, it's not about being secluded from the world. So what is seclusion pointing to? Seclusion is essentially pointing to not clinging to sense experience. So that as our sense experience comes in, what was the, who finds seclusion amidst sense contact. There's other sutas that talks about not adhering to what is seen, heard, cognized, not clinging to what is seen, heard, cognized. The other translation, not being stained by what is seen, heard, cognized. And that I think is what it's pointing to by seclusion, that the sense contacts come in. It's almost like, you'll sometimes talk about Teflon mind, you know, that when sense experience comes in, it doesn't stick to anything. It doesn't, it doesn't catch on views or opinions or an eye or a mind. So it's secluded from the suffering. That's maybe a good way to look at secluded from the suffering of clinging to sense contact. That's my, that's my understanding of what seclusion means. So it's not, it's not about, it's pretty clearly not about, not necessarily about going off to a cave and just isolating yourself. Although he does, he does encourage that for his monks. I have to say, he does encourage that. I'm planning to go and visit family in a few days. So I'm thinking about the notion of being secluded from the views of others, you know, being in the world and interacting with other people. How does one, you know, I don't think I can formulate this very well, but it's the kind of thing that's going on. It's kind of the notion of taking in what other people are saying. I guess I'm getting confused about how, how do you interact with others and still be secluded. It's, I think it's about, I think it really all comes down to eye, you know, looking at it, it comes down to can we be with people and not have what they're saying, bring up a me, I identity that has to be protected or defended. That there is a seclusion, essentially, from suffering that would go into getting puffed up or feeling contracted around who I am. So it's about, I think it's really about just allowing things to come in, but not to stick to not to cling. And I think probably it is probably the most difficult interactions with other people. It's maybe a little bit easier walking around the woods by yourself. So the thing that I really want to highlight here, just point to is that these ways of describing someone who is liberated, do not represent some kind of abstract idea or transcendent reality. They, they are, they're described in terms of the qualities of a person so that it's not metaphysical, it's not transcendent. It's very much here and now the description of freedom in the Ataka Vaga is very much in this world. So it does emphasize freedom in this life. It emphasizes the possibility for freedom in this life. And for the Theravada, we'll go into this a little more later, from the standard Theravada perspective, this is kind of an unusual teaching. It doesn't say much about transcendent reality. We'll go into this later. It talks about, maybe has a few places that could be considered as talking about transcendent reality. Has a very this worldly emphasis. So if we go back to verse 914, he's peaceful amidst all things, whether seen, heard or thought. A person who does not, who finds seclusion amidst sense contact. And this contrast fairly strongly with the standard Theravada view of someone who's liberated, which describes or the standard Theravada view of someone who is liberated is described as someone who has essentially gotten off the round of rebirth. That the notion of being reborn over and over again and becoming free of that cycle is one of the main benefits of becoming liberated. And the Ataka Vaga does not address this so much. It doesn't speak much about rebirth, if at all. And again, we'll talk much more about that later, but I just want to really highlight the this worldly teaching of the Ataka Vaga and that it does contrast with the standard Theravada description. Do you want to say more about that in the way? Do I want to say more now? Well, just just offhand, I don't see the contrast or that you see what I mean. Oh, OK. For me, it seems the same. Well, the there are there's kind of opens up a whole set of questions that have to be understood if one also thinks about the freedom from clinging as free as having a metaphysical component as as essentially altering the metaphysical or the transcendent experience of a person that it's not something that can be directly pointed to in this life. It's something that maybe some say that they can experience those transcendent experiences. And you're using getting off the wheel as transcendent. Well, the the the idea that I mean, if if there is in the standard Theravada view, the clinging basically the manifestation of clinging is that we cling when we die to the next life and that we are reborn and that the abandoning of clinging is the abandoning of that next birth. And so that the that essentially most people, the normal people just go on being reborn over and over again. And that if they are free of clinging, that it alters the manifestation of their their being. I mean, it actually changes something fundamentally in their being that they would no longer be reborn so that it's a it's a it's a it's somehow changes. The whole nature of human of what it means to be human to become liberated. I mean, I would add or go a little farther and say if your goal is to not be reborn, how other worldly can you get? I mean, instead of being something attainable in this life, the goal is not to have a life at all. In the usual sense. And then of course, then you get fuzzy. Well, what's usual sense? I mean, the life without clinging might not be a usual sense, but still in all, you know, I mean, if taken pretty literally rebirth as the fundamental of the freedom from rebirth as the fundamental goal, what what you're really aspiring to what the Arahants have achieved means that whatever they you know, you can't use words to talk about it, which is the problem that but whatever it is you're aspiring to it something this outside this world. And to me, that's inherently other worldly. So it kind of conflicts with, you know, the two points you are making about, you know, the goal here is something that we can experience in this life. And not some trends in reality, that in some senses somewhere else. So I had a lot of trouble with this last year with the Majima study group, and I'm not resolved at all. And you know, I might my preferences very definitely freedom from clinging sounds cool. The descriptions of Nirvana do not sound cool to me sound like you might as well be once and for all dead. Essentially you are. Well, just just as a go ahead, Chris, but let me just say one thing, you know, the description in, I think it's in the Majima dikaya. Somebody is asking about this very thing. And what happens to someone who's enlightened when they die? You know, are they reborn? Well reborn, do they do they reappear? No, well reappear doesn't apply. Well, do they not reappear? Well, not reappear doesn't apply. Do they both reappear and not reappear? Well, that doesn't apply. Well, they neither reappear or not reappear. That doesn't apply. And the guy says, Well, I'm confused. What does it mean? And so the Buddha resorts to an analogy, which I won't I won't go into. But it's not I mean, I think that typically we think about that description as a form of annihilation. And the Buddha said it's not annihilation. So what is it? I don't know. Again, it sounds kind of transcendent. It sounds kind of otherworldly. Definitely not in the life of living yet. Go ahead, Chris. Oh, I was just going to point back to the verse you already read here, where it says a man who has extinguished all cravings before the time his body disintegrates into nothing. Such a man has no preferences. And you can so easily imagine a Theravadan text going on to say we'll never be born again. And so forth. So that's sort of, you know, it points right back to how he is before his body disintegrates, not after. That's true. Thank you for for recognizing that one. Steve. Also, Tom Jeff is constantly talking in the teachings, there's the personal and the transcendent of the teachings that one can look at. We're always birthing certain identities. You know, so you go see your family, and you're birthing being a son or a brother or something. And that dies. So the personal level and this transcendent level. And also the Buddha talks about, you know, if you believe in rebirth, and not really be rebirth, it says to the person, does it really matter? What are the implications of your behavior? If you don't believe in rebirth, and they would still do good actions, because they don't want to suffer. And then if you do believe in rebirth, well, have a better rebirth, or you may not be born or something. Either way, he always looked at both sides, the personal and the transcendent. That's true. And that's a piece I will talk about that a little more later. So I don't want to get too into the afternoon's discussion now. I guess for me, there's just not a difference. For me, it's both. It's the freedom in this very life, which also means no future. I'll talk about that also later. And the image that came to my mind, I don't remember what the Buddha's metaphor was at that point, the part that you decided, but the metaphor or the image that works for me, somehow I was just thinking about this morning, is the wave in the ocean. There's a wave in the ocean. The wave is seen briefly and then goes, but nothing changes. Did the wave disappear? Well, but it didn't change. The water didn't change. It's the same. So pretty much where I. Oh, is my is my mic on still? Is it going? Okay. I'm not hearing myself anymore. No, that's okay. It's good. I just wanted to make sure it's going. One of the scholars, I'll just close this section around talking about these liberation teachings. One of the scholars on this kind of summarizes this. This is a Louis Gomez. The attack of Aga sets out to describe a practical solution to human sorrow, not merely the abstract sorrow of rebirth, but the everyday sorrow of strife and aggression. That's really where the attack of Aga lands is in the everyday reality.
