Practice Note : Coming To Our Senses

One of the little, catchy phrases for this pr actice we do 
is the phrase , “We’re coming to our senses. ” The 
senses  – eyes, ears, nose, and tongue , etc.  – are seen 
as windows , or ways to experience the world. Imagine 
that there are windows with curtains . Sometimes  we can 
pull the curtains open , and then we can see, hear, smell 
and taste. The curtain s are probably our thoughts, th e 
things we’re  thinking about or preoccupied with. One of 
the things we can do in this practice is to open the 
curtains to our senses , so that we can see without the 
filter of the thoughts, ideas , or preoccupations we carry 
with us.  
 
Sometimes  it’s possible to touch ve ry briefly into a 
feeling of com ing to our senses  – being open to sights, 
sounds, smells, touch, taste , and to the whole inner 
world of our being  – and being  aware of them  without 
any commentary, judgment , or interference. It is a  
feeling of just being open and present in a very simple 
way.  
 
Some  of us can touch into this very briefly before a rush 
of thoughts comes  in. A common thought is , “But this can’t be enough. There’s more that has to happen , or to 
be figured out, planned , or remembered. ” You might 
experiment this morning with pulling the curtains , and 
opening the windows of your senses , and just be.  
 
When we do walking meditation , a lot of it is tactile. It’s 
the touch sensations  of the body , the legs , and the feet 
touching the floor. What  is it like to clear the air for a few 
moments of your thoughts and  ideas , as if you’re 
stepping  through  a door into a whole new place you’ve 
never been ? It’s so unfamiliar that you have no word s, 
thoughts, concepts , or ideas t o go along with it. Just : 
“Here I am . This foot touching the ground ; this breath in 
meditation ; this next moment, whatever it is. ”  
 
What’s it like to meet it as if the curtains have been 
pulled  – and the  thoughts, judgments, ideas, stories, 
and evaluation s of the min d have been paused for a 
moment?  How do we see the world then?  
 
So, if you like this morning , try pulling the curtains , and 
see what that’s  like. Thank you.
