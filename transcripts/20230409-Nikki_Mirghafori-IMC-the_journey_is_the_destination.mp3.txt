Thank you, Hillary. Thank you so much. And thanks for all that you do.
So, hello. Greetings, everyone here and online. Hello.
So, for today's reflections, I wanted to offer some thoughts for your consideration on the theme of
the journey is the destination. The journey is the destination.
It's a saying that you might have heard before in different contexts.
And in the context of our practice, actually, in Buddhism, in our spiritual practice,
it takes particularly special meaning.
So, I wanted to explore that a little bit, and not just from a cognitive stance,
but also offering some tools of, okay, so what if we, how would our stance,
how would our daily, perhaps, practice shift if we worked with this practical tools.
So, news you can use. So, that's my intention today.
And also some engagement. I'd love to have some engagement on the topic,
because we all have had some experience with both the opposite
and also wisdom with the journey being the destination.
So, let's explore this together. How does that sound? Not for it? Okay.
So, let's start by actually exploring in an embodied sense,
because embodiment is first and foremost.
Exploring everything in the body is the foundation of the practice.
It's the foundation of practice.
And in the Satipattana Sutta, in the four establishments of mindfulness sutta,
where the Buddha talks about the four establishments of mindfulness,
the first one is the body, the first and primary one is the body.
It's really exploring mindfulness of the body.
And as many of you might be familiar with body scans,
which are drawn from the mindfulness of the body.
So, basically embodiment, really having this basis of the body is the very first foundation.
Whereas in the West, we like to think of mindfulness as, oh, thoughts and mind.
I want to do the third Satipattana, mindfulness of mind first.
Whereas mindfulness of the body is first.
Second is mindfulness of feeling tone, Vedana, pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.
Just this constant push and pull we have towards everything, right?
That's the second establishment, second foundation.
The third one is the mind, mindfulness of mind, mind states, etc.
Exploring that.
And then the fourth one, the fourth Satipattana establishment of mindfulness,
is mindfulness of Dhammas or basically various conditions.
For example, the Four Noble Truths is part of that.
The hindrances, basically knowing the algorithms, the awareness of how it happens, how it goes.
After you've got the basics down, it's kind of knowing the processes.
Dhammas is kind of the fourth one, mindfulness of the processes.
Processes of liberation, Eightfold Pathosinder.
So, but coming back, I just wanted to mention the four as a review.
The first one is mindfulness of the body.
The body is so important.
Embodiment, awareness of the body, exploring the body, the body as a tuning fork.
Also, we get to know so much about our state of minds, about our state of emotions,
based on what happens in our bodies.
And in the West, we're often cut off from our bodies.
We're like walking heads, the body's kind of disconnected.
Whereas the body really both supports, embodies us, grounds us in our practice.
Have you noticed if you're stressed, if you take a breath, body, right?
Breath in the body.
And if you've been in your mind, blah, blah, what I do about this, blah, blah, blah, blah.
There's a sense of grounding, there's a sense of awareness.
Okay, maybe I know how to do it, but I don't have to spin out in your mind.
You can become embodied.
So, basically talking about how important embodiment is.
Not the focus of this talk yet.
We're going to talk about the journey as a destination.
But we need to start with the body.
Otherwise we'll get all too heady, right?
Okay, so now that I've espoused,
I've sung the praises of really becoming aware of your body and embodiment of practice.
In fact, as you're sitting right now, can you become aware of your body posture?
More aware.
What's happening in your body?
How are you sitting?
Where are your feet?
Do you feel embodied?
Is there a sense of integrity in your body?
Would it help to shift, to feel more of a sense of, oh yeah, really sitting.
And engaging with the Dharma right now.
Does your body feel that way?
So now, as I invite you to feel into your body in this moment,
as I feel into my body, yeah, I'm sitting, sitting upright.
There's a sense of uprightness in the body,
which also magnifies the sense of wholeheartedness,
wanting to share the Dharma with you.
There's a connection between the embodiment and the mind.
So now, if you drop in this reflection,
that the journey is the destination,
what if you drop that into your body right now and see what happens?
My journey, let's make it personal.
My journey, my journey in this moment,
in this moment of being alive, is the destination.
Drop that in and breathe with it a few breaths.
My journey, in this very moment,
my journey in this very moment of being aware, being alive,
is the destination.
They're not separate.
Dropping it in, feeling into,
what arises in your heart, what arises in your body,
what realizations, what reflections.
What does it feel when you really connect with this?
Let's drop it in one more time, a third time.
My journey, in this moment in time, however it's showing up right now,
my engagement, the way I'm showing up on the arc of my journey,
the way I'm aware, the way I'm responding,
the way I'm receiving, perceiving this moment of my journey on this path,
it is the destination.
They're not separate. They're not different.
Then notice what arises, how your body feels, how your heart feels.
Dropping it into your body, not your mind.
Let it reverberate.
This is it, this is it, this is it.
The journey is the destination.
So, if you want to open your eyes, if it feels okay now,
there's a lot I want to share with you, but I would also like to.
Maybe at this point, as we're kind of exploring this,
what comes up for you, what came up for you as you explore this,
what reflections.
If anyone is willing to share any thoughts that came up,
any shifts, any realizations, wow.
Yes, please.
Yes, yes, definitely.
I was assuming we're going to use the mic for the benefit of people online.
Thank you so much for being the mic runner.
Well, it just showed me the presence is it.
It brought me to the present.
Real gift.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you so much.
And exactly there's sense of presence.
It's like, wow, yeah, beautiful.
Another reflection.
You're going to get your workout today.
Actually, maybe the next person can pass it so you can rest if you wish.
Hi.
So, when I was embodied, I really felt it settling in.
I felt myself grounding.
And then it almost felt like my mind was like, no, no, no, don't do that.
We still have to figure out the future and you have to plan on it instantly.
I noticed that shift going back and forth.
Like my mind almost thought it's unsafe to settle and let myself fully believe that.
Yeah, that's what I noticed.
Yeah, wonderful insight.
That is so powerful what you just noticed in this small little experiment.
Wow, that is powerful.
So powerful that there's some belief in your mind that it's not safe,
that it's not safe to settle, even for a brief moment,
because we're going to take it all back.
Like, this is just a moment, right?
Oh, sweetheart, it's okay, you can rest.
So that's a big insight that you've just had right now about your own psyche
and the way, and might have come up for others as well.
So one way to then work with that, because yes, of course,
there is planning and doing in the world, and yet we do need that respite.
We do need that.
And if we're always carrying that heavy weight, we never have the time to have a perspective.
We're always in the middle of it.
I know you know that.
We know that, and yet there's something, there's some belief, right?
Which is often unseen.
So it's fantastic that it just became seen right now.
Yay, you showed yourself, thank you, right?
To say, okay, thank you, believe, thank you.
You're trying to warn me, protect me.
I really appreciate the kindness there.
Don't worry.
It's okay.
It's really okay.
I've got this.
There's a moment of peace, and I'll come back.
Just right now I'm going to take 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, a day, a week to just be.
And I'll have a fresher perspective for a, as Einstein says, one of my childhood heroes,
we can't solve our problems with the same mind that created them.
And this is the same mind, right?
It just wants to problem-solve and problem-solve and problem-solve.
Like, okay, it's okay.
A different mind.
We want to cultivate a different mind.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for sharing that.
Yeah.
Any other reflections or insights?
That is so great.
As I was sitting with the thought, a lot of memories came for me, like my school days,
and some pivotal moment in my life that led me here.
And I'm happy today that I'm here.
I see people that kind of changed my life during those periods.
And I'm like, wow, it's all coming through.
And it brings me joy that I'm here.
So those are the thoughts for me.
Yeah, thank you.
Thanks for sharing that.
So for you, there was a sense of, oh, yes, these points of the journey, these various points of the journey.
And this moment is part of this.
How are these destinations, the people who have been significant being here, so all of it?
It's not just, I'm going somewhere, but it's just, it's all part of the joy of my life, the grace of my life, all of this.
Thank you.
Beautiful.
So appreciate your reflections.
Any last burning ones before we transition?
Last burning one.
For me, what came up was, like, when you were given those instructions, when you mentioned, like, in this very moment,
that's when I noticed that in this very moment, I'm free.
And then, just for a few seconds, I felt the freedom, and after that, worries about life outside this room came up.
But just in those few seconds, I felt free.
Yeah, beautiful.
Oh, thanks so much for sharing that.
That's so beautiful.
Roughly, just a moment of freedom.
There is a door opening.
There's light shining in.
Oh, yeah, right here.
Wow, it's possible.
It's possible, the sense of peace.
Sense of ease.
It is accessible.
It is accessible here.
Yay.
Beautiful.
That's it.
These are mini nibanas.
These are mini moments of awakening and freedom.
Right here.
It's possible.
And then they keep expanding and expanding and expanding, becoming more beautiful.
Thank you.
Thanks so much.
Lovely.
Yeah.
Thank you all for sharing your reflections, how enlivening to actually have this kind of an interaction from my son.
He will have more later in the talk.
I'll ask you more.
And also something else I wanted to say after Jeannie shared about feeling present with dropping this reflection.
As I've been actually working with this reflection for a few days, and every time I drop it in, in my daily life, I'm going about doing this and that.
And I drop in the reflection.
The journey is the destination.
Oh, wow, this moment of the way I'm showing up, the way I'm being, the way I'm about to send this email.
This, this is it.
This is all these moments.
It's, it's not just not, in fact, the sense of going somewhere, right?
And if we think of a destination, you know, sometimes we have this, this sense that are we holding back on our lives?
Oh, when I grow up, once I grow up, once I graduate, once I get married, once I meet my soulmate.
Once I get the job, the dream job, once I retire, once I resolve.
Sometimes there's once, that once this thing happens, then I'm going to start living.
I'm, I'm going to be, that's, that's where I'm going.
That's my destination.
It's kind of unconscious.
And, you know, or, or when I'm awakened.
Oh yeah, I'm going to do all this practice and practice things.
Whenever I'm liberated, I'm enlightened, once I'm enlightened, oh yeah, then I'll have, you know, I'll have it all figured out.
And I'll just be living in my happy retirement of awakening.
It doesn't work that way.
Of course it doesn't work that way, right?
So I'll say more about the, the awakening bit.
But, but a couple of things to say, one is I, I realized this, this mindset, especially when I was in grad school, when I was in grad school at Berkeley.
I remember there were some of my school, my school, maybe that was not the case when I was an undergrad, but in grad school, there was something about the intensity of it that people completely gave themselves to the grad school curriculum.
So many of my classmates had the sense of, oh, once I graduate, I'll explore my hobbies or I'll do this, which I love and I haven't done it for years and whatever it might be, once I, so, so there's a sense of, oh, putting off our lives, putting off,
like there is this destination, which is graduation, right, or whatever it might be.
And, and for me, it was so interesting and in some ways there, maybe it's more subtle for us in different ways.
It's not so, so big, you know, if I had seen it in myself at some point, oh, when I move, then, you know, maybe I'll give away the stuff and I'll clean up this corner.
Yeah, I don't have to wait until that happens, like I can do it now, like there is no, so there could be these subtle, these destinations we set up in our lives, instead of it being right here, this is it, this is it.
These moments that were alive, we have the grace of being alive and kicking, being alive, breathing, sentient, have agency.
This is it.
There was this title of this book by one of my favorite authors, Milan Kundera, the Czech author, and the title of the book was Life is Elsewhere, great book, Life is Elsewhere.
Such an interesting title, right, the sense of, oh, Life is Elsewhere, it's not here, it's whatever you're doing, this is not, this is not it.
Other people or other places, or, you know, it's like FOMO, it gets translated to FOMO, I think, nowadays, like, oh, this is something, Life is Elsewhere.
Life is not elsewhere, it's here, it's right here in this moment, it's right here in this room, this is it, the way we're showing up, the way we're engaging in this very moment is the destination.
It is the destination also as it relates to the teachings of the Buddha and the Eightfold Path, so I'll get a little more specific in a moment.
But in the general way, for each of us to feel into that for ourselves, there's no redo, there's no recital, there's no rehearsing, this is it, this is our lives.
This is our life, the way we're showing up and fashioning our lives in every moment, fashioning our karma, fashioning our legacy, our awareness, ourselves.
It's right here, it's right here, the journey is the destination, it's right here, it's not so separate, it's not so heady thinking about in the past or future, it's right here.
Liberation is not elsewhere, liberation is also right here.
So this invitation to consider this, to drop this in, actually drop this in reflection maybe every day, hopefully the rest of the day you'll drop it in and you'll experiment with it as you leave, it's one of my invitations.
It will invite us to stop sleepwalking because we're sleepwalking usually, we're always pulling towards the next moment, pulling towards the next moment, the next thing, the next thing.
Either we're pulling towards the back, we're regretting what we did or said or we're pulling back or we're pulling forward, usually we're pulling forward, the next thing, the next thing.
When's lunch, when is this, when's that plan, that to-do list, I finished that, the next thing is still left to do, next, next, next, it's like going on everything of a journey, a literal journey if you've gone on a trip,
either yourself you've seen that tendency in yourself or you've seen that tendency in your other travelers you've traveled with, travel partners,
there's sometimes a sense of, okay, the next place, we're going to go see that temple, we're going to see that site, next, next, next.
Okay, you go there two seconds, you go to the Eiffel Tower, okay, two seconds, okay, next, next place, next.
It's like, wait a minute, actually taking the bus there or walking there is part of this journey, it's the whole thing, it's not just getting there two seconds, next, next, next.
So we sometimes have this tendency in our lives, next thing, next thing, next thing, next thing, it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is it.
The way we are actually, the way it's not just ticking off the to-do list, the to-do list, we're all going to die with a to-do list, unfinished.
I've just accepted that, I'm never going to finish everything I want to finish, it's not going to happen.
So speaking of that, I love teaching mindfulness of death, which some of you know, mindfulness of mortalities,
it's one of the topics and themes that I love to teach on and when I teach courses, one thing that I've done is to invite folks to explore writing poetry,
writing death poems, which are very common in Zen Buddhism, writing death poems before they die.
So the equivalent of it in the West is the epitaph, epitaph being the short saying that goes on the tombstone of people
and given that the tombstone is small, epitaphs tend to be pretty short.
So I've invited people over time to write many and this is one that somebody wrote,
once I get the job, once I meet my soulmate, once I'm free, below me.
Quite profound.
So that tendency that we have, yes, always reaching for the next, once I do this, once I do that, once I'm free,
once I'm free, once I'm awake and liberated, below me, so we never know how much time we have, this is it, this is it.
So say some more specific things now as the path and the journey relates to the way we live within the Buddhist context,
making it a little more specific now.
So the Buddha taught about suffering and the end of suffering.
But the end of suffering is not a destination so much.
We think of nibbana as the end of suffering, like that's it, tata-ha, end of suffering.
But again, it's not so much of the place you go and what place you reach and then that's it.
Did you ever consider that the Buddha continued to meditate and practice after he was enlightened?
Yeah? Just think about that for a moment.
So it's not so much a destination, the practice that we do, the engagement and the way we live,
but also in Zen Buddhism there's this beautiful saying, before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.
After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.
So enlightenment again is not a happy retirement of, it's the continuation of engaging with life, continuing to engage.
And I love that you shared this moment of mini-nibbana, mini-peace, mini-freedom.
So freedom becomes a part of the path, not separate from the path.
It's not that we're doing all this practice to become free.
As you have, whether you're new to practice or you've been practicing for a while, if you've been practicing for a little bit at least,
you can tell that, oh yeah, there are things that used to perhaps bother you or get on your nerves or you lose your cool.
And now, wow, there's a little more freedom.
There's a little more freedom about those topics and those areas.
Maybe there are some areas that are still really challenging for you, but there are a few areas that are just a little easier now.
And you're continuing to practice. You're here. You're continuing to practice and engage.
So the freedom becomes part of our practice, becomes, there's more and more and more.
It's not like there's nothing in all of a sudden who rides, like there's more and more. Freedom becomes part of the path.
And in fact, the path itself, the path of practice itself, is the path of freedom, is the path of happiness in and of itself.
There's a beautiful, I want to read this quote for you.
This is from Sister True Dedication, who is one of the disciples of Thich Nhat Hanh.
And let me read the quote first.
So she says, in his later years of teaching, Thich Nhat Hanh revised his translation of the Eightfold Path to be not merely the path leading to happiness, but the path of happiness.
He taught that in the true spirit of the inside of interbeing, every step along the path leading to happiness must be happiness itself.
If we suffer along the way, we've lost the game already.
I think that's quite profound, that every step along the path leading to happiness must be happiness itself.
So if you translate liberation and freedom as happiness, that's another way to relate to it.
It's not the path just leading to happiness, it is happiness itself right here, right now.
The journey is the destination.
So I'm going to talk a little bit about the Eightfold Path.
And what I just read, by the way, this paragraph from Sister True Dedication is from the recent Lines Roar.
There are articles on the Eightfold Path, each author has written one article on the Eightfold Path.
One person from each tradition of Buddhism, it's quite sweet actually to see that.
So the Buddha taught suffering and the end of suffering.
Of course, sometimes people are on the outside, they focus on the suffering.
Oh, Buddhism is all about suffering.
No, it's about end of suffering.
And happiness, really happiness, and the path of happiness, just as Sister True Dedication was talking about, the path of happiness.
So in the Four Noble Truths, so the Buddha talks about, yes, there is suffering, there's stress in life.
That's the First Noble Truth, of course there is stress.
There's stress in life, period.
All of us have it, all of us have challenges.
It's just a part of being human.
And there are big stresses and small stresses.
There are the losses, there are the challenges, the tragedies, the griefs.
And then there are just everyday stresses.
You have to feed yourself and take care of yourself.
And all of us are like, oh yeah, that too, there's limited time and there's just little stresses, tiny little stresses, it's just part of being human.
And the Second Noble Truth is that grasping, clinging is the cause of the dukkha, the suffering.
Like wanting things to be a particular way, and clinging to it, or getting a rope burn.
A rope burn is when impermanence happens.
Things are shifting and changing.
So if you think of, you're grabbing a rope that keeps running through your hands, right?
You're holding onto the rope, and it keeps shifting and changing.
Stop, don't change.
You're getting a rope burn.
That is dukkha, that's another way that we heard when we tried to stop things from changing.
And change is the nature of life.
And the Third Noble Truth, that yes, it is possible to be free.
It is possible to have freedom.
It's possible to be happy.
It is possible.
In the midst of all this, in the midst of this craziness, that is life, human life, it is possible to be happy and free.
And engage, not that you're going to go sit on top of a mountain.
Okay, I'm liberated finally.
No, it's being engaged in the middle of it.
And, okay, and then people are on the edge of their seats.
Okay Buddha, tell us how?
Ah, the Eightfold Path.
Here it is.
This is how you do it.
This is how it's done.
The Buddha tells you how it's done.
That's the recipe.
Eightfold Path, okay?
All right, okay.
Eightfold Path.
But then Eightfold Path, this path, right?
It's like, okay, I'm going to do the first and then the second.
And I'm going to do all these steps.
And like, okay, and then I'm going to get to Nibbana.
No, actually Eightfold Path, if you've noticed, it's drawn as a wheel.
It's not a path.
Right?
Haven't you thought about it?
Well, it's taught as a path.
And the path usually is like, right?
When you go on a hiking path, right?
It's one step after another, right?
Whereas this path is drawn like it's a wheel.
It's an eight-spoke wheel.
Oh, that's an interesting path.
There is a sign, right?
That it's this.
It's right here.
It's your wise speech and it's wise perspective and it's wise livelihood and it's wise mindfulness
and it's all here.
It's all here.
And it's all together.
It's all intertwined.
It's all here.
The journey is the destination.
The way you engage is it.
This is it.
So the different aspects of the Eightfold Path with wise view.
And by the way, the translation often from Samma, the word Samma,
Samma which can be translated in the Eightfold Path as right view or wise view or appropriate.
The word right, remember at the beginning of my practice I had a little bit of like, what?
Right?
Like right wrong seems very puritan.
But actually the translation of the word really is appropriate.
What's the appropriate?
What's the useful view?
What's the useful speech?
What's the appropriate speech in the right time?
So think of the word right as the right tool.
You're not going to use the wrong tool, like if I wanted to use the striker,
a glass full of water would not be the right tool.
The striker would be the right appropriate tool, right?
So think of right as appropriate.
So also wise, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort.
I actually prefer the word engagement because effort sometimes in the West brings a sense of effort.
Whereas engagement really, what is appropriate engagement in the moment with whatever we're engaging?
And wise mindfulness, right mindfulness, paying attention.
And samadhi, concentration, collectiveness of the mind, the sense of stability.
Wise stability.
So the goal is the path.
The goal is the path.
The way we live our lives every moment, the way we pay attention, the way we meet suffering,
our own suffering and the suffering of the world,
the way in each moment we are engaging internally and externally.
This is the destination. It's not elsewhere. This is it.
So in some ways, it might seem like a paradox because we are practicing
and we're going to have more and more ease and freedom.
And yet this is it.
If we have the stance of, oh, somewhere to go, somewhere to get,
there's always this restless mind, this wanting mind.
It's actually the second noble truth, clinging, wanting, like, ah, somewhere to go.
Next thing, we're causing more suffering through our practice, whereas this is it.
So I want to invite you all to drop in the phrase into your body the rest of the day.
And if it works for you, maybe the rest of the week, this week,
that's why the journey is the destination or make it more personal.
My journey in this moment is my destination. This is it.
How am I showing up? How am I meeting the suffering? How am I meeting others?
With kindness, with generosity, this is it. This is it.
We don't know how much time we have. This is it.
So thank you all for your kind attention.
I hope some of these reflections have been supportive and helpful,
and whatever isn't helpful, let it go.
It's all good.
And maybe given that we have just a couple of minutes left,
I will ask if there are any final reflections.
Since I promised I would open the floor again,
if there are any final reflections or questions,
maybe we'll make space for a while.
If anything is arising.
Yes, Janie. Yes, it's coming your way.
In the beginning, I think I heard you say that there were four things,
and this was one of them, the first one.
But I don't know. Is that my miss hearing?
Yes, I think at the beginning when I was setting the stage,
I was talking about when I introduced the topic, the journey is the destination,
then I talked about how embodiment is important.
The four Satipatanas, the four establishments of mindfulness,
body, Vedana, feeling tone, the third one being the mind,
and the fourth one being the dhammas, the processes.
Those are the four that I mentioned at the beginning.
Okay, yes. Thank you for repeating.
No problem.
And then I invited us to really engage with the first one,
because that's the foundation, the body, and drop it into the body.
Not just the head, not just thinking about it, but dropping it in.
That was the entry way into our meditation.
Thank you.
Yeah.
There's one more.
I'll come to you.
I had an image of my son when he was little, and anyone who's a parent
would probably relate to this, is we're going to the library,
or we're going to the park, but for him it was a going.
But you have that you're going to, yeah, and so that was the journey.
Yeah.
Not being at the park.
It's going to the park.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
Thanks so much for adding.
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah, I feel such tender children are like that, right?
They're like on the way.
It's like, oh, they're just enjoying everything on the way.
They're going.
It's the going.
It's the go.
That's it.
It's the going.
Love it.
I love it.
Nancy, please.
Thank you.
I was just going to say the idea of dropping that in and sort of the
middle of the day and the middle of what you're doing actually seems
like a good sort of diffuser.
And that if you're reminding yourself that the journey is the
destination when you reach those difficult moments either with other
people or in yourself.
It is that at that moment that the practice is really the most
important.
Yeah.
And so, um, yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I appreciate what you said.
Exactly.
It's just a reminder because we tend to forget it becomes so focused
on the thing and the next.
Yeah, this is it.
Actually, this is.
These are the important.
Moments.
It's all important, but especially those moments.
