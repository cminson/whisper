 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So again, warm greetings from IMCE in Redwood City. And continuing with this series on, this week on mindfulness of breathing. If one is sitting still, being still, not moving the body, but then it was going to notice the largest movements that are still happening, chances are you become aware of the movements of breathing, even if the rest of the body is still not moving. The movements of the chest, the diaphragm, the belly, the shoulders, the back rib cage, all the parts of the body that come into play with breathing are still moving as they're supposed to. And so if we're sitting still and attentive to the body, one of the things that we will start noticing is the breathing. The breathing will make itself known. And this idea of what makes itself known is a very interesting idea because often we are directing our attention. We are having an agenda for what we want, what we're looking for, what we're concerned with and there might be a lot of will, a lot of directedness in our attention. And there's another whole way of, in terms of meditation, another way of being in life even, and that's fascinating and kind of deepening for the purpose of meditation, is what is it that is known? What is it that makes itself known? And so the breathing can make itself known. And there's a play here a little bit between our directing our attention to the breathing and our kind of receiving the breathing. It's maybe a little bit like we intentionally open a window and then we can feel the breeze coming in. So we open the window of attention to the breathing and then we start feeling that experience. That experience becomes known. And so it's a little bit less at some point of directing the mind on the breathing as it is repeatedly opening the window to receive the sensations of breathing. And then those sensations become known or felt. And one of the first things we can do is we can feel the breathing, feel the sensations. And the feeling of the sensations is one of the ways to develop concentration, is to stay close to the sensory experience. So one of those is the movements of the breathing. And other is the, as you breathe in, maybe the expansion, the pressure, top of the in-breath, there might be a tautness as we reach near the limit there. And on the exhale, there's a release, a relaxing, a smoothness, maybe. And sometimes that's the breathing in and breathing out feels like a smooth feeling. And sometimes it feels choppy, kind of like little segments that are going in and going out. And whatever it was to feel it, and to feel it where in the body it's most compelling, where the experience of breathing is easiest. And that sometimes called the home base. For some people it's the, it's the particular spot. Some people really love feeling it in the lower belly, just below the navel. Some people feel it in the chest, around the solar plexus, diaphragm area. Some people feel it at the nose, the sensations of air going in and out through the nose, and tip of the nose, the top of the lip. Some people find it very nice to just feel the whole experience of the body. So it's kind of a holistic sense, censoring of it all. As we get concentrated, there's a subtle shift that can begin happening. And now, in addition to sensing and feeling it, there's a very quiet, relaxed knowing that we can engage in. We know that that is moving, movement. We know that is pressure, and release of pressure. We know that that is a sense of expansion and contraction. We start kind of recognizing, knowing what those sensations actually are. And then to go further down as we get quieter, the knowing begins to fade away, or not as important, and it becomes a quiet observing, where there's not much recognition, just observing. And the intimacy of the feeling at the beginning is replaced by an intimacy of the observing. The observing has a clarity to it, and a beauty to it, at the right time, as it gets more and more settled. So to assume a meditation posture, and adjusting the posture to make it a little easier for your lungs to breathe, your diaphragm to move. And for some people, that's letting the chest be a little bit more open, sometimes sitting a little bit straighter, so that we're not collapsing in the front of our body, can make it easier to breathe. And gently closing the eyes, and relaxing. Feeling where in the body you can relax, maybe relaxing around the belly. And as if you relax a lot in the belly, you might want to readjust your posture slightly, so that the weight of your body through your spine feels just right. And relaxing your shoulders. And there too, maybe some subtle shifts in how your hands are, can feel good in the shoulders, let them relax more. And softening in the face, maybe letting there be a soft little opening in the mouth. Relaxing around the eyes. And then to allow the breathing to be known, almost as if the breathing comes into awareness more fully. Gently take a few two or three deeper breaths, receiving the full experience, sensory experience of breathing in and breathing out. And letting your breathing return to normal. And don't be too concerned what normal is, if you find yourself controlling the breath through the breath a little bit. Held in check, it's okay. For the purpose of mindfulness, it's just to feel it how it is. Without any need really to, for it to be different. It's okay the way it is. The task is to feel it as it is. What is the body's experience of breathing? There's the predominant place where you feel the body breathing. The belly, the chest, the nose. Or the whole body in a certain way, the whole torso. And the more you allow yourself to feel the sensations of breathing, the less the energy of attention goes into thinking about other things. Now's not the time to be thinking about other things, so at least to put those things into the background of the mind. In the foreground, receive the sensations of breathing, like the window is open. And the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out is like a gentle breeze or gentle waves lapping up on the shore. To feel the experience of breathing is to be intimate. The Mindfulness is never in a hurry. Mindfulness is as an attitude of, as you have all the time in the world to sense and feel what's happening.

Mindfulness is as an attitude of, as you have all the time in the world to sense and feel what's happening. As a gentle way of staying connected to your breathing, there's a very subtle way of thinking, alternative thinking to being distracted, is to very gently, with all the time in the world, recognize some of the sensations that come into play as you breathe, kind of like you're stroking the sensations or, like you're putting a gentle hand on them to just acknowledge their presence. It can be as simple as recognition of movement, tingling, warmth, coolness, pleasure if anything breathing is pleasant, or unpleasant if anything is unpleasant, pressure, tightness, looseness. Sometimes there's a little pulling with the exhale or releasing, or rugged, or smooth. A gentle little recognition that keeps you gently tethered to your breathing. And saying it in such a quiet voice that active recognition is quieting for the distracted mind............................................. Where the active recognition is not a final decision that's there, but rather it's more like opening the window. Almost like a question mark so that you feel it more fully.....................................................................................................
