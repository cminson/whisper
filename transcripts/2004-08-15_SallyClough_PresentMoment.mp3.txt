 Good morning, I am Sally, it's nice to be here with you. It's actually wonderful to see this community growing in the way that it is. I actually recently had cause to interview Gil Fransdale, the main teacher here, the other day because I'm part of a committee at Spirit Rock that is looking at ways to foster community. And he was immediately the person I wanted to talk to because he and you have done such a great job in creating this center together and bringing all of you into a sense of community with so many different activities and events. So it's always wonderful to come and visit. And we had a great discussion about things that he's done here. And actually one of the main things I got is that he hasn't done very much. He just says, okay, you want to do it? Find a way to do it. And it's really been a co-creation. And I think that's what's made it so strong, so powerful. What I wanted to explore with you this morning is one of the fundamental tenets of meditation. We're all here, I'm presuming, because we're interested in meditation, specifically mindfulness meditation. Yes? I don't think the FM system is working. FM system. Oh, the hearing-assisted thing. Is it working now? No, it's not working. I have to speak for you. Okay, thank you. And can everyone hear me okay? The back. So we're all interested in this kind of meditation, I'm presuming, which is mindfulness meditation, a central tenet of which is connecting with what's true in the moment, being present for what is. Ram Dass came up with that great line many years ago, be here now. And it's what we look to do, look to cultivate in our practice and in our lives, this capacity to be in the moment, to know what's happening here and now. When we do that, and I'm sure you've all had moments, if not extended periods, of that experience, it's amazing. It's rich, it's deep, it's satisfying, it's true, it feels like coming home, it's fascinating, fulfilling, all kinds of wonderful adjectives we can use to describe that experience. Okay, so if it's so good, why don't we do it all the time? That's the question I want to explore. What is it that takes us out of this capacity to be in the moment that we all have experienced? We all know what it's like and we all know the benefits of it. It's what this practice brings us back to again and again. Basically what all the Dharma talks and teachings are about is know what's happening, connect with your experience. What is it that takes us out of that? What often, where we often end up, there are only, there's sort of three choices we have here. There's the moment, there's the past, and there's the future. Reveries of the past, you know, the good times we've had, our hurts, our grievances, our memories, and the future, our worries, our hopes, our projections. We bounce usually between the two, perhaps skimming over the present moment, perhaps not even touching there at all, going between the two. So what is it about the present moment that makes it so difficult for us to actually be present for us? What are the hooks? What are the, what is the enticement into going into past and future? When I think of this tendency that I think we all have, the analogy that came to mind was kind of like a spider in a web. We sit at the center of the web and the web is the creation of our lives. And we've got our legs out and our feelers and all of our senses onto the spokes of this web that we've created. And around the edge of the web are all of the goodies from the past, our memories, our, as I said, our hurts, the good times. And they're all there, sort of bundled up securely. You know, as spiders do, they cocoon things up. But we don't just leave them there. If we did, they'd probably just decay away as things do. They just dissolve with time. We regularly get them out. We unpack them. We look at them. We examine them. We plump them up if we can. And then we wrap them up securely and put them back there on the edge of the web again. And we're constantly doing that. Oh, there was that, you know, in fifth grade. Oh, I remember what that was like. It's usually involuntary. It's not that we do this deliberately, but this is what happens. And of course, we've got our feelers out for what might be coming, just as a spider will do on the web. You know, what's vibrating the web? What's about to come into my field of experience? And depending on our temperament, we can be looking forward to that with anticipation or with fear. But that's kind of what we're like. We're holding on to everything with this sense of collecting around it or anticipating it. And most of the time, if we look closely at all of that construct, we'll see that that's what it is. It actually is a construct. It's our projections, our interpretations, our perceptions. There's not a huge amount of reality in it. Even if you try to share a memory with someone of something you did together some years ago, it's amazing how different your experience will be. Or have you had someone come up to you and say, oh, I remember when we were together and you said this and you did and you said, I did. And you have no idea, no memory of what they put to them. It was quite an important experience when you you shared that. It's so subjective. Yet we hold on to it. We concretize it with this sense of wrapping it up in our spider's web. In meditation, the idea is not to live in this sticky web, not to be constantly holding on to the past or anticipating, perhaps, fearful of the future, but really to have a sense of freshness, a sense of openness to the experience so that it's able to be fully experienced as it evolves, as it comes to us, not lost in the past, not not falling forward into the future. This is the challenge that we face every moment of our lives, obviously not just revolving around our meditation practice. So where we often go in this tumbling out of the present moment is into the past. For those of you that have sat residential retreats, especially longer ones, a week or more, you'll probably have had this experience. It's so common where unbidden these memories will come up. And usually they're painful. Usually they're things we kind of cringe about when we remember them of things we've done. Sometimes it's things that have been done to us, but often transgressions that we have performed where we've hurt other people or even hurt ourselves through our actions. This is where the mind tends to go to. We call this process a life review. And I think it's a very important part of the meditative process, in fact, an important part of any spiritual deepening, to have this sense of being able to look at all of the causes and conditions that brought you to this moment and to be able to accept them. As difficult as they may have been, as painful, as suffering causing, whether, as I said, to ourselves or others, to be able to come into acceptance of those experiences, I think, is really an important part of our spiritual deepening. Because if there are places in our lives, places in our experience that we close off to, obviously there can't be a full sense of acceptance, of openness, of integration of our experience. So this is really a strong component of the deepening, this healing, this bringing into the light of our awareness these experiences that were sometimes deeply hidden. We've completely forgotten them and they come up in the full light of the mindfulness of retreat. And we re-experience them, but hopefully we do it from a place more of balance, of equanimity, of some maturity and wisdom, where we can bring a sense of acceptance to that experience, bring a sense of equanimity just to acknowledge whatever it was. It happened. If it was something that I did at the time, I was doing the best I could do. All of those kinds of understandings are really helpful, important to bring, that we were doing the best you could do at that time. Often it brings up for people a deep sense of compassion for themselves and the past situations that they were caught in in their younger days. If it's around things that were done to you, hurts and injuries that you experienced, obviously then there's the need to cultivate a sense of forgiveness. Out of a place of strength, not giving away your sense of yourself and taking care of yourself, but really wanting to heal so that there is this possibility that this wound can become closed, can become a place of strength, not a place of hurt and fear. Sometimes the places that draw us into the past are memories of loss or grief. And of course if we have losses in our lives, and I'm sure we all do, greater or lesser extent, sometimes deep, very overwhelming losses, there's a natural process that needs to be honored when we have a loss in our lives, loss of a loved one, loss of some capacity that we had, loss of love, loss of love, loss of love. Whatever aspect of our life that we miss, that we love to have when it was there. The grieving around that, as I say, is a very natural process. It's part of the healing. But sometimes people get stuck. Stuck in the grieving, stuck in the resentment, stuck in the loss. And I think at core of that stuckness is a refusal to accept that the loss has happened. Whatever form that loss might take, if the grieving goes on over extended periods of time, and I mean years, not just the natural process of sadness around the loss of a loved one, or as I said, some capacity, it's the refusal to accept that really keeps the grief continuing, keeps that sense of dissonance around our current experience perpetuated. So again, this sense of acceptance really needs to be cultivated, that we need to come into this place of wisdom that says this happened. This person, as much as I loved them, as much as they were part of my life, has gone. And the best thing I can do to honor them, to honor whatever it was that was in my life, is to live it as fully as I can, not still linked in that strong way to the past. So many of us get caught up in the terrible phrases, what if, or if only. If only I'd made this choice. If only I'd done this with my life. If only I hadn't done that. And of course there's a place in our experience for looking at what we've done with, as I said earlier, from a place of wisdom, understanding that perhaps we did something that caused suffering, perhaps we were not so skillful, remorse, seeing the impact of our actions and wishing to be wiser in the future. Very skillful. Guilt and shame, will we use those past actions to beat ourselves up? Not so helpful. I'm actually reading a wonderful book at the moment by an English author, Graham Swift. He has written a number of books. I think his most famous is probably Waterland, that I made a movie from. This one is called Last Orders, won the Booker Prize a number of years ago. And it's a magical story, it's a very mundane story in some levels, of this group of elderly working class Londoners, men, who one of their close friends has died and they're taking his ashes to be scattered at sea. And it's just a series of narratives from each of these individuals. They're all about 70 years old, we're in the Second World War. And just to get the sense of lost possibilities that they all experience as they tell their stories in these little vignettes, and especially the central character who's died, was a butcher. And he reveals on his deathbed that he always wanted to be a doctor. And it's a wonderful aspiration to have, but you have to think how realistic was this idea to be a doctor. He was destined to be a butcher, I think he's a family business. I probably didn't make it past high school, yet probably held all his life, this if only. I should have been a doctor, not a butcher. And it's not to say we shouldn't have aspirations, but when we use them to denigrate our current experience, it's actually causing ourselves more suffering. So there's a lot of wisdom that needs to be brought into this experience of integrating our past hurts, our past regrets. How do we do that skillfully so that we're able to move on from those experiences, actually use them to grow and to strengthen and to heal, and not to constantly belittle where we are in this moment. I have another friend who's really obsessed. I shouldn't say another friend, there was a fictional characters. I have a friend who is really, they feel like friends as I've been reading the stories. It's such a well written book. I'm really enjoying even though it's a little morbid, actually. A friend who really had a difficult childhood, one of those very painful extended periods where there's a lot of abuse in different forms, and out of that has acted quite unskillfully. She's now a wonderful person with many great qualities, but she's so caught up in this identity of both the victim and the perpetrator of harm that she can't let it go. And she's really trying to work on it, but it's so central to how she sees herself that she can't really see the possibility of not being that victim and perpetrator. And it's painful because I see in her so many good qualities, and also the potential of who she could be if she could let go even just a little of that sense of identity. But it's so woven in, it's going to take such a sense of strength and a wanting to heal that she's quite caught in it. She's even caught a little in forgiveness practice. I've got to forgive, I've got to forgive, I've got to forgive. And she's not getting there because she's still so identified. Sometimes we need that sort of wisdom, Manjushri's sort of wisdom that just comes in and says, it's done, it's over, whatever I did, whatever is done to me. It's not to forget it, not to deny it, not to diminish it, but just to say it's more important that I'm here in this moment whole and healthy and I'm willing to move on. So again, a lot of compassion needs to be cultivated around this work of opening to our past experiences so they don't become places that we wrap up at the corner of our web that we constantly hold on to, that continue to define us. So the other place obviously we can tip is into the future. And depending on our temperament, whether we're basically optimistic or pessimistic, it will define which way we view the future. For those who are optimists, the future is always kind of rosy. It's better out there somewhere in the future and if only it would come, then I could begin to live life out there somewhere. The old grass is greener on the other side of the fence. And so we're always thinking about the next thing, the next thing, the thing we're hopeful about, anticipating, looking forward to. This can be obviously very overt and strong, people that have always got great plans for what they're about to do, but it can also be very subtle. And both can be just as much an entrapment, even more important to look out for the subtle ones because obviously we don't see them, we don't see how much we do that. We can have this sense of sort of being okay in the moment, as long as we have kind of a reservoir or a sense that out there there's something better. I can be a, I'm in the moment, I know what's happening, but there's kind of this back door that's going okay, it's going to be better if I can just get through this moment because out there there's a better me, there's a better situation, a better job, relationship, life, body, hairstyle, whatever it might be that you're looking towards. Sometimes this movement of wanting something better or different is just out of our restlessness. As human beings I think and as culture especially, we're really driven towards looking for novelty, to have things be different, where this message is put out a lot through the media that things of fashion is the obvious place, music, all of those sort of current cultural things that have always got to change. If it's last year, it's old, it's dead, it's gone, you've got to be on top of things. And it's interesting to see how as human beings we hold this interest in novelty and again just like past or future which way we go whether it's positive or negative for us, we can have this to lesser or greater degrees. But balance with that is how much we're creatures of habit. Have you ever noticed that tension in yourself? How often you want something new but in other areas of your life if something changes you get really upset? There's a real tension in that and I think it's a helpful place to look in our lives what are the things we look for novelty in and where do we want familiarity in? What are the different pulls, what are the different desires, tonne-ha, craving that are being played at there because we have a craving for the familiar and a craving for the new. Different parts of ourselves but very important to understand. My husband who's also a meditation teacher is very much a creature of habit and he can eat the same thing breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. And he does breakfast and lunch every day he'll have the same thing. Doesn't matter where he is even if we go out to a restaurant pretty much I know what he'll order he'll get the same thing in the same restaurant. I love novelty. I like going to different restaurants and trying different things. Luckily we've managed to make it work we've been together 20 years but it's just interesting to see these different tendencies into human beings. And it's not to say one is right or wrong better or worse but they're just preferences that play out in how we view the world. How we greet change how we look to the future do we want habit or do we like novelty do we like adventure. This kind of dynamic obviously really comes into play if you travel together and it's a good thing to check out if you decide to go traveling with someone. Are they someone that says well I've done all my research on the Internet and here's the 10 things we have to see if we're in Florence or the person who says let's just go and explore and it's obviously trouble bound to happen if you put those two together when they travel. I was reflecting on this this tendency of moving into the future and wanting something different because you I know I see it really strongly on retreat with basically day to day things stay pretty much the same I mean there's slight variations the meals may be a little different but variations on a theme usually retreat food schedule stays the same. The same time even if it's a different topic you know it's about the same kind of thing how much I would tip forward into the future as I was I was doing a long self retreat on the East Coast a little while ago and I really saw this play out when I was sitting. I'd be going and it would be all the time but I would just see this thought happen when is it going to end so I can go walk. You know that thought would come through and then I just say you know still sit sit sit and then finally sitting would end get up and go walk after 10 minutes when is it going to end so I can go sit. Whatever you're doing the other thing seems better and once I started to notice this tendency I saw repeatedly in my experience of the day sitting wanting to walk walking wanting to sit. You know I was walking waiting for the meal time and I get to the meal and there would sort of even be a sense of when it's just going to be over it's kind of noisy in the dining room and I want to get out of it you know just again and again this whatever I was doing there would be a sense that oh I want the next thing. And you know I was trying to practice with it so I was mainly in the moment I was just noticing the repetition of these thoughts meal times bedtime that was when is bedtime going to come when can I lie down you know a long retreat can really start to notice those kinds of things. I it became so predominant like everything like things on retreat can often be if you start to notice it you really start to see it more in the quietness is not a lot of distraction. I actually came up with a note for something to look forward to as I always get her STLFT I started to say because I would just see it again and again would just be this even the end of the walking path you like you get to turn around the view would change you'd sort of oh when will I get there. It became so subtle this tumbling forward into the future so I really started to explore this tendency and how it took me out of being fully present even if on this retreat as it was it was usually quite subtle I wasn't spending a lot of mind moments perpetuating but I noticed it endlessly it was there is that looking for something to be different preventing me from being present in this moment. Sharon Salzburg tells a story I think it's in one of her books probably. Which book it's in I just remember hearing it tell a story about practicing in Burma where the conditions are quite rigorous you take a precept at a minimum which means you don't eat afternoon and in Burma they take that very literally your main meal of the day is at 10 a.m. and you usually don't eat again if you get a breakfast you get it at about 5 a.m. and so she sit down and have this meal at 10 a.m. usually wasn't very appetizing but it was the highlight of the day and she would tell about walking back to her to continue meditating and she noticed her energy just sinking and sinking and sinking as she went back to her meditation hut and what as she started to notice this more and look into what's happening she realized there was nothing more to it. And she said she was not going to look forward to in the day there was just sitting and walking sitting till midnight or however long she stayed up from 10 a.m. in the morning there was no differentiation there's probably no Dharma talk on these long retreats in Asia there was just more of the same and are we just some if we don't have that thing to look forward to our energy can just drop if we can just stay present we're going to be still sitting and walking but it's painful if we're hoping to find something out there. That's better or different when it's not actually going to be there to just come back and be with the experience is the only antidote to that. As laypeople as householders you may find your life is full of what I call these STLFT something to look forward to you know if you're a working person it's the weekend or the time you quit work depending on how you enjoy your work for most people even if it's good work you like to have you know you free time time off and so it's always planning always anticipating what is it that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's out there that's better than what I'm experiencing right now and for so many people work is all about just getting through it so I can get to whatever it is I really want to do with my life whether it's weekends hobbies activities being with family or whatever it is yet so much of our life we have to spend working if we're always going to be half-hearted in it looking forward to the future as a place of escape as a place we can actually become alive that's a pretty gloomy way to actually spend a lot of our time what's really interesting to notice this gets perpetuated even if there's something we're enjoying have you noticed that you you'd be looking forward to a concert or some particular activity and you'll notice you're looking at your watch after about half an hour it's like I've been sitting it's very pleasant the music is playing but this sense of needing to move on not being able to just settle into being fully present sometimes in the midst of an experience like that we can find ourselves actually feeling a little disappointed or frustrated even betrayed you know this event that we had put so much store in this holiday this day off this time with a certain friend a restaurant meal that we'd anticipated this while we're in the midst of it this sense of it's not living up to all of the weight that I put on it in the anticipation brings a sense of disappointment brings a actually prevents us from really being able to enjoy it because we've with we're carrying the burden of the anticipation and we're also so caught up in that cycle that we're looking forward to the next thing we actually sabotage our capacity to be present through playing out this movement into the future so this is why I wanted to talk about this this morning is to see all the ways we actually prevent our access to being in the moment by perpetuating this movement into the future this looking forward to with anticipation it's a habit and it's if we keep going with it it's going to apply even when we're in the middle of something we should be enjoying like any habit it has a momentum and being willing to look at this habit see if we can let it go when we notice it will open for us that capacity to enjoy whatever it is we had looked forward to for some of us when we look to the future it's not with a sense of anticipation it's with a sense of fear fear worry dread anxiety whatever it might be and it's interesting to see how even though what what out there we're projecting a sense of dis ease about the mind still goes towards it's sort of easy to understand why we project into something that's pleasant there's a there's a there's a present we can get a present moment hit from projecting forward to something that's pleasant but how much time do we spit been projecting towards something that we're fearful about that we're worried about that we're anxious about and how strong a sense of self gets created out of that you know I have to do this go there be this do it this way be in control of this situation or you know whatever kinds of fearful thoughts we have about it oh no this is going to happen and I'll mess it up or I'll I won't be good enough I will I'll be shown up to be not competent we replay that in our mind and again just causing ourselves suffering as we do it at the core of it is I think this sense that we can control the future through worrying about it how many of you ascribe to that belief you know be honest we control the future through worrying there must be a reason that we think it's beneficial I really want you to question this belief that we can control the future through worrying about it of course we need to plan we need to have judicious use of our experience and skills to know what what's going to be needed what will be called on called from us in in doing something but worrying about it is extra this over and over and over and over again that we get into about planning for a future event it's all extra it usually doesn't contribute to our doing it whatever it is any better it just creates suffering in the moment it's such a strong tendency to let go of I know and the world can kind of feed this tendency because there's so much information out there now about what can go wrong you know we used to just know what was wrong in our family or our village or our clan now we know what's going wrong everywhere in the world instantaneously and of course it's good to have knowledge of current events and what's going on you know the hurricane in Florida that was just amazing so devastating and so many people suffering down there but these these reports of tragedy just confirm this sense that we're right to be anxious about the future there are all these tragedies out there but we worry about these these you know we worry about terrorism obviously and plane crashes where where is it more likely that we'll be hurt falling over in our home or you know crossing the street near near our house then then these greater tragedies but we get so many messages about what can go wrong that we buy into it there's messages about how how much crime there is you know the six o'clock news if it bleeds it leaves you know you turn on the news and it's an accident a tragedy and a fire and a and a kidnapping and if you actually saw the statistics on crime my understanding is there it's actually going down but the amount of information we get it makes the world seem an incredibly dangerous place so we get a distorted sense of what is worth worrying about but my deeper question to you is is anything worth worrying about you can really show me an example where worrying actually helped a situation I have a I love this story it's a joke that I've heard where the young daughter who's away at college and she comes home for a holiday and she rides it back home and you know comes in the door and the mother says you meant to be here at five minutes only three said yeah I got away only I was able to you know leave class or if she's me we're driving for three hours without me worrying about you we have this sense that I've liked the spider out tentacles are out there taking care of things if we're worrying about things this is not a true reality and there's so much agitation so much suffering caused out of this habit of worrying of a teacher so can you remember shade Tibetan teacher who says if you thought the same thing five times that's enough now if you have enough mind control to actually cut it off then more power to you but even just to have that thought how many times I thought this you know I'm going around in the washing machine I call it it's not helpful and to really take the time to feel into the agitation feel what that does to your experience to your mind as you play out these scenarios of doom and gloom about what might happen in the future one of the things that really for me helped to undercut this tendency was I took time and it was on retreat because especially towards the end of the treat it's great time to start playing out future anticipations I saw after their retreat how nothing I imagined at the end of the retreat ever came true in the way I had fantasized it while I was in the retreat no conversation no meeting with a loved one no dining out no you know indulgence that I had thought I'd really you know when I get out of this retreat I'd have to go and do X and got out and forgot all about it it really undercut for me this tendency to keep playing out these fantasies whether they're pleasant or unpleasant so as I said what I hope to encourage in you this morning was just this investigation into what pulls you into these time spent in past or future at the basis at the heart of it I think for me is a subtle or not so subtle dissatisfaction with my present moment experience it's not good enough it's not okay or even the sense it's sort of okay but because I know something better is going to happen or you know I'll get out of here I'll go do this this this sort of qualified okayness with the moment or around experiences the past there can be this sense of unfinished business can be quite obvious for us or it can be held in the body in enormous subconscious ways just a sense of disease or discomfort and not able to settle into the moment because of this unfinished business of the past sort of lurking there you know ready to come out at some unbidden time that can get triggered by something we see or something someone says to us or just out of a an experience out of a sense of mood or reflection these past experiences that come up can come up for us and because they're unfinished because we haven't fully accepted them we're like the dog with the old bone and even though it's dry and there's not much left we'll still gnaw away on this unfinished business we need to bring whatever that is into the full light of our awareness whatever process we need to go through to bring a clarity and an acceptance around that experience that's the work we need to do to not have not continue this sense of disease or dissatisfaction into the present moment so obviously to do this we need mindfulness I'm coming back full circle we need mindfulness to be able to be aware of these pulls these pulls into the future these tugs of the past most of the time they're playing out on subterranean levels and we're just operating in a superficial kind of way not really acknowledging that that's actually our experience all of these different pulls and pushes once we start to pay attention we can see and it can be quite dismaying to see how much time we spend in past and in future and how little time we're actually connecting with our experience right here with the person that we're with with our enjoyment of a meal with our appreciation of a sunset we need to cultivate what's known as wise attention you know so money sikara where we see what we do that leads to suffering and what we do that leads to greater and greater happiness this takes discipline to be willing to do that to track our experience to be willing to acknowledge that if I stew in this particular mind state I've been there before it gets me to X whether it's guilt or shame or regret or or anger or it leads me to agitation and perpetuates a sense of fearfulness we need to be willing to pay attention to that dynamic that movement to track what's happening and as I say this needs mindfulness this needs wise attention to be able to have the connectedness to our experience to see that and not just live way above our experience so this willingness to track what happens when I do this when I go forward into the future my lost in fantasy of how great it's going to be and because of that is that there is a momentary pleasure but it prevents me from fully connecting to my experience when I am doing something that supposedly pleasurable or am I always lost in the past in these reveries of regret or remorse about what went on neither one allow us to be fully present we've really got to make this commitment and it takes commitment to come back there are so many pulls in us to go into past and future so said my encouragement is really to explore what is your main tendency in these directions what are the the hooks what are the precipitating factors that may cause one or the other and your willingness to notice them you may take a particular one and make that a practice for some time I see I have this tendency of X whether it's going to the future with fear or going to the past reveries of my golden youth and how great everything was back when what is it about that that keeps me going there and what do I get out of it and how does it prevent me from being fully present for what is right now I was actually watching a video last night of the dull my llama giving a teaching it's a whole series of videos on his usual things deepening of wisdom and compassion and he was talking about compassion and how it's not pity you know there's this got to be this real sense of connection with the suffering that you're seeing in others and in yourself and he said more than just connection he said responsibility really that that suffering is is is central is important and he was talking about some past master I forget who it was who amplified that for him was was was really heartfelt in this and as he was just talking along about this person and this this sense of compassion and responsibility and all of a sudden he just broke down and started crying and he took his glasses off and he got his handkerchief out and he was sniffling away and it was quite I mean I was deeply touched just to see him so moved by his own words his own reflections on compassion and suffering and our responsibility about suffering and he sort of tightened himself up and I thought he would like most of us in the West would do he would make a joke about it or or or say something to make us feel a pull of that moment he just put his glasses back on and kept teaching and his eyes were quite dry and he didn't miss a beat and it was a really interesting moment to see how his heart was touched deeply by what he was reflecting on as he was teaching he broke down into tears he was fully present for that emotion of sensing I think it was a whole combination of the responsibility the degree of the suffering and hit that the beauty of the compassionate feeling where you feel that sense of union and connection that bit of sweetness of it yet the emotion passed and he just was completely able to continue teaching and there was such a great example of how meditation doesn't lead us to diminish what we experience doesn't lead us to be stiff and stilted and out of touch he was fully present and and so uninhibited that he could just break down and cry there's an audience of about a thousand people in this big auditorium and you know as they usually the rays of senior monks and nuns of other traditions as well and either side of him and he just broke down and cried and then put his glasses on and continued this is possible for all of us this ability to connect fully with our experience and to know that the beauty and the power the profundity of this present moment because as we keep saying this is where our life is lived it's lived in the present moment we can't redo the past we certainly can't control or fix the future by and by our imaginings about it it's this present moment and the more we give ourselves the gift of this present moment the richer the more beautiful the more powerful our lives will become so finished right on the dot about that so I'd just like to end with dedication of merit of our time here together may the benefit of all of our good deeds our aspirations the cultivation that is so important for all of us of wholesome actions a wise and compassionate heart may the benefits of these deeds and these aspirations not be kept just for ourselves and our own well-being but dedicated freely and wholeheartedly to the benefit and the well-being of all beings everywhere they all beings everywhere know the joy of being fully in the present moment they all beings everywhere experience the peace of being fully in the present moment they all beings everywhere be liberated which happens only in this present moment so thank you
