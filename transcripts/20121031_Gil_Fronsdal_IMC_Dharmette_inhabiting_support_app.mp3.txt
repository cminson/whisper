Dharmette: Inhabiting Support  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

I have been thinking about the topic of support  – how 
we are supported in the practice, and how the practice 
supports us . I think part of the motivation for this topic is 
that a lot of people I meet, feel unsupported  in one way 
or another . They feel they’re not getting enough . 
They’re not capable enough . There’s not enough time  – 
not enough something to get by  or to manage . Things 
are somehow out of control,  or too uncertain . There’s 
confusion . So people spin out, get agitated, and think a 
lot. 
 
For me, t he idea of support is a place where the mind  
and the heart  can rest , and feel at ease . When you feel 
supported, then y ou feel safe, secure, grounded . You’re 
not unsteady, not uncertain . The expression 
satipaṭṭhāna , usually translate d into English as the 
“foundations of mindfulness ” could just as well be 
translated as “supports for mindfulness .” We have these 
four places where  mindfulness is supported , where 
awareness can rest  – not go to sleep , but so that it can 
somehow flower , and be more fully here in this life of 
ours.  
 Support in our body is the first foundation of 
mindfulness . Do you feel supported in your body? Or, 
when you tune in and pay attention to your body, do you 
feel like it is agitated , not quite there , or unsteady? Is 
the body  a place of support , or is it not a place of 
support?  
 
There is the support that feelings tones provide  – the 
way we experience the world around us through the 
intimacy of direct feelings  of pleasant or unpleasant . 
There’s a way that feelings tones can be a support for 
awareness  – to rest in  and be with.  
 
There are all these different mind states the mind goes 
through . How can  they be a support , rather than a 
distraction or something that keep s us spinning ? How 
can we be supported by mind states ? 
 
The last foundation is the truth : being supported by 
different aspects of what’s true , the truth of things . 
Seeing directly into the truth of how the mind works  can 
be a support, a place to  rest, relax , and be settled. It’s 
important.  
 
Last week I was feeling agitated and restless . My 
approach to this was to go to my body, and feel how 
tense , tight, and agitated  it was . And then my approach 
was to inhabit  the tension and agitation I was feeling . 
“How can I inhabit  this? How can I enter into it , and really live in the middle of it? ” I could feel that my 
tendency was to pull back and be agitated about being 
agitated  – to be on the edges of it, unsteady with it, 
trying to fix it . I had various ideas and interpretations 
that kept me tottering on the edge . But instead, I 
enter ed into the mi ddle of it , which was counte r-intuitive. 
The expression I used for myself at the time was “How 
can I inhabit  this? How can I inhabit my agitation, my 
tension , and just be in the middle of it? ” In a sense,  I 
was asking,  “How can I come in there and find support 
for those unsteady feelings? ”  
 
The more I c ould inhabit it, the more I felt supported by 
something, and the more I felt it was a good place to be. 
It was counter -intuitive because in the middle of that 
was also a feeling of, “This is not comfortab le, and I’d 
rather pull out .” But pulling out of it felt disconnected . It 
didn’t feel right . So, I enter ed into it fully : “Let me live 
this, let me be this .” The more I could be  in it – the more 
I could enter into and live in it, or inhabit it  – the more I 
felt supported . Less and less , I felt unsupported by my 
experience . And as the experience became something  
safe, it became meaningful – something that could 
unfold , and resolve itself.  
 
To feel unsupported is common . There are many ways 
of feel ing unsupported . The practice of mindfulness is to 
enter  into, to inhabit, to live in our experience. In this 
way, we find support in the immediacy of our experience. When people feel a lack of support, it 
usually has to do with ideations  and thoughts that are 
often not so immediate . These thoughts might  be 
immediate , but usually they’re  projecti ons into the future  
– fantasy ideas of what should be, or could be . The idea 
of immediacy is very different. When we  enter into the 
immediacy of our ex perience , we find that there’s a way 
in which it supports us, and that we can feel supported . 
This can be very helpful.  
 
To get to that kind of support through a willingness to 
enter into the experience and rest in the middle of it, it 
can be helpful to a ctually consider and reflect on how 
much our direct experience does support us . It’s 
remarkable how much of our life is supported by things 
we have no control over. I like to joke that we’re not at 
all involved in 99.999999999  percent  of what it takes to 
keep us alive . And we’re neurotically obsessing about 
the approximately 0.000000001 percent  of our life that 
we have some control ove r – as if it’s all up to us , and 
we have to do all this stuff , and figure it all out, or fix it. 
Maybe the 0.000000001  percent  is the part we’re most 
concerned with, and where we have  the biggest impact . 
But so much of our life happens outside of our 
conscious control , or even awareness.  
 
If you cut your finger , healing  is a very complicated 
physiological process, which involves  biolog y, 
neurolog y, and chemi stry. You have to do your part by keeping the wound clean and covered . But your little 
mind couldn’t manage to orchestrate the phenomenally 
complex processes that are involved in healing that cut . 
If you were directing all those things : “You go there and 
do that ,” it’s not going to happen. Mostly you create the 
conditions for the body  to do its thing .  
 
It’s the same thing with the heart and the mind . There’s 
a tremendous inner intelligence there . A lot of what  
we’re trying to do in practice is to get out of the way , by 
creating the trust  and support to rest in our experience 
in some meaningful way . Keep the experience clean . 
Keep it protected from the dirt so that this 
99.999999999  percent  of what our life is a bout can 
operate . It will be  much more effective than if the 
0.00000000 1 percent  tries to run around in circles.  
 
What supports you? Your body supports you to a great 
degree . Your world supports you in great ways . We 
have a tremendous amount of support in our society . 
Probably more now than at any other time in human 
history, we mutually support each other . We’re 
supported by other people . We don’t have to go out and 
chase down our own animals in the woods . It’s not all 
about us. 
 
I remember when  I was young , I visited  a few  farms in 
Norway that were  farmed in the old way , where the only 
thing that they couldn’t take care of themselves was salt. They would trade for salt , or buy salt because they 
were up in the mountains . Otherwise they were 
completely self -sufficient . There was a time and a place 
where people could take care of themselves and not 
rely on other people, except for salt . But nowadays , we 
have to rely on othe r people for 99.999999 percent of 
our life – for almost  everything . There’s so much 
mistrust , but then we realize how much we are being 
supported.  
 
I find it helpful to reflect on how much support there is 
for our lives . In considering how much we are supp orted 
versus  unsupported,  probably the biggest part of the 
percentage  is how much support we actually receive . 
And all the ways in which we feel unsupported are 
probably a much smaller percentage of the total . But 
often that’s  where people focus  – not remembering how 
much support there is.  
 
This i s certainly helpful for meditation . In meditation you 
can put to rest some of the preoccupation with the lack 
of support you may feel, and you see  that there  is some 
deep ly important , valuable, and nourishing support t o be 
found by coming in and resting here  – fully inhabiting 
the present moment.
