 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. See if you can hear me okay? Yeah? In the back? Okay? Alright. So today I want to share a few words about this notion of felt sense. I spoke a little bit before the meditation in the morning, but now I wanted to just elaborate a little more. And so in our mindfulness practice, often when we are offered instruction of being mindful of our body, being mindful of our breath and our mind, our thinking, sometimes we can be practicing with an orientation of kind of like, I'm doing something, I'm going to go to the breath, I'm going to go to the body. And so if you all like to use this analogy of as if we're kind of operating from a control tower, kind of like, you know, there's a kind of a sense of a hidden director directing the show. And I certainly recognize this myself. And so when there is this kind of a control tower, kind of a force happening, what happens is it blocks us from dropping into the experience as they are. And so the one of the meanings of word Dharma is the way things are. And when we're kind of always tinkering by directing here, directing there and calming this and doing that, then the way things are, it's hard to come by. And then they get blocked out by all those control tower directions. And so there's a different phrase that I want to offer today, felt sense. It's something that I learned from one of my Dharma teachers, Philip Moffat. And when I first learned about this, he would repeatedly guiding us to drop into the felt sense of your experience. It was quite something when that was offered and had this immediate sense that I'm shifting like almost like 180 degrees away from this control tower notion. And so by dropping into the felt sense, what is happening is that we're leveraging, we're tapping into the raw capacities of being human, being alive human. We feel, we sense, we don't have to do anything. It feels in the senses. And so there's a felt sense, an innate capacity that is available to us. So just to kind of do a quick experiment even right now, if you just, if you want to close your eyes, that's fine. If you don't, that's fine also. If I just say this few words right now and see what is the felt sense of your being right now. For me, there is immediate sense of feeling something and sensing something. I may not have words for them and it could be, oh, a lot is going on. It could be, I'm not sure, but that's also a felt sense. That's also feeling something. And then maybe it's a few moments later that certain sensations becomes very clear to you. And I could feel a real big stretch underneath of my legs right now, feeling really buzzed right around my knee and my lower leg. And so it may take a little while for some of the sensations become clear, but overall, being human, being alive human, we feel, we sense whether or not we have words for them or we have descriptions for them. They are there. And so from the perspective of our practice, it's totally okay and valid to feel and sense without having to have labels for them. And it's very much valid. Your experience is as valid as whatever labels you might be giving or not giving to it. And if the labels happen, the concepts and ideas come, that's fine too. But why feeling and sensing into our experience? I see three things associated with this way of practicing. One is that the feeling and sensing is a primal capacity within us. When we're doing our practices through felt sense, there is a simplicity to it. And we don't have to go busy, think about what this may be. And we just, you know, whatever it is, we could just let the felt sense happen and be what it is. And so what happens is a lot of higher level ideas and concepts are not necessary. Even the idea of breath, idea of body, they are very high level abstractions. But when we're dropping into the felt sense, we're almost as if we're trusting this alive body have millions of sensors within the body itself that will sense. And the knowing can just simply come from that. And so when we do this, what is also happening is when we're not counting on all of this high level concepts and ideas, we're less getting involved in the stories of our experience. The stories are even higher ideas. And so what is simply dropping into the direct experience, the raw experience of our being. And that is a very conducive for becoming collective, collected and centered. And so the sense of a composure can come in and much more easily through kind of dropping underneath of the higher level abstractions. And the second thing by staying with the felt sense is that it allows us to drop out of this directing meditation kind of a mode. Feeling and sensing opens us up to what is happening right here. And rather than kind of following particular direction, our mind or our brain kind of wants us to go. And so it's much more direct. And the last thing I want to point out is by dropping into the felt sense of our experience in a way, it's kind of a clearing the loud voices inside us off, kind of a clearing the mud off the clear water. And so we settle into a very raw and simple experience. When this happens, the knowing capacity can be lit up very naturally. We don't have to do anything. The knowing can happen and the insight can arise without us having to search for anything and evoke anything. And so in this way, the felt sense way of practicing can be conducive for insight to emerge in our experience very naturally. Usually, insights are not something we have to go look for. They emerge when things are very clear within us. And so how do we practice through the felt sense? So however you're practicing mindfulness, it's just fine to be with. The only refinement offer is at some point of your practice, see if you can let the sensing happen on its own by simply dropping into the felt sense. As if your breath has all the sensing within it, or the body has all the sensing that's within it. And you just kind of, for me, it's the sense, I'm just going to be open right here and being available and then let the senses come to me. And so that's a different orientation of directing, but really letting the sensing arise within us, letting the feeling arise within us. And sometimes it's helpful over time to learn some of the vocabularies of feeling and sensing and using maybe more primal, kind of elemental kind of vocabulary. So for example, right now the felt sense I have is there's a lot of a bubbly sensation in my lower half of the body. So the bubbly sensations are kind of a vocabulary that's at the lower level and quite immediate. Or maybe I'm feeling a lot of pressure in the lower half of my body with the floor. Or maybe you feel a certain kind of buzz, energetic feel in the body, the kind of flow. And so over time, our kind of a conceptual mind do want to articulate this, whether it's to other people, to the teacher. It has its function. But to see if we allow the vocabulary to be at the elemental level of our experience. And so that way it still stays at a very immediate level rather than kind of a big concept and ideas. And sometimes there may be a very immediate sense of inner image may come in. So for me that is sometimes a feel, the kind of a movement that happens as if it's kind of like a ripples on the water, surface of the water. And so allow yourself to stay connected with this elemental levels of concepts and a felt sense. Yeah, I think those are the words I have today. And so thank you for your practice.
