 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome, welcome everybody. And thank you, Neil, for putting that in the chat box. For those of you who haven't been here before, if you're interested, there's a forum in which people can connect outside of this setting. And that link is only made available within happy hour. So everybody who has that link has been here. If you're interested. And so much about loving kindness turns out to be, even though we don't talk about it maybe explicitly so much, part of loving kindness practice is this learning to be okay with ourselves. I like to soften this inner critic that often shows up or to quiet the voice or that sense of, I should do this, I should not do that, or these kinds of things. There's this way in which thoughts in the mind can feel pretty persuasive and pretty authoritative. And even though it might just be habitual ways that we approach things or berate ourselves or diminish ourselves, can be a way in which thoughts in the mind are unfriendly. So I'd like to share this poem. It's by Maddie Wankast, a poet who is inspired by some of the poems of early Buddhism, some of the women in early Buddhism. And I just, for me, this poem is very evocative. The picture it paints is one, in my view, is one of this gentleness and ease that with loving kindness practice allows us to find our way to that gentleness and ease. And this poem maybe reminds us that it's possible, it's possible to quiet the inner critic, even to have it go away completely end. So this poem is called The Elephant. And it's written by, from the perspective of a meditator. While walking along the river, after a long day meditating on Vulture Peak, I watched an elephant splashing its way out of the water and up the bank. Hello, my friend. A person waiting there said, scratching the elephant behind its ear. Did you have a good bath? The elephant stretched out its leg. The person climbed up and the two rode off like that, together. Seeing what had once been so wild, now a friend and companion to this good person. I took a seat under the nearest tree and reached out a gentle hand to my own mind. Truly, I thought, this is why I came to the woods. I was so happy to be here. I was so happy to be here. I was so happy to be here. I was so happy to be here. Our mind is very powerful. We can reach out a gentle hand. And in this way, loving kindness practice is one way in which this gentle hand can be reached out. One could say maybe all types of meditation, but here we'll be doing loving kindness meditation. So, that is an introduction. Let's do some meditation. I've been taking a bright posture that reflects both our intention to meditate, as well as some softness, some ease, no stiffness, as well as not any, maybe carelessness is a word. And sometimes this takes a little bit of effort to find this balance. I like to start with some settling into the body, the pressure of the chair cushion against the body, checking in globally with the body. Maybe there's some alertness, maybe some tiredness. Maybe there's some openness and ease. Maybe there is a feeling of a little bit of contraction and discomfort. Can we acknowledge, respect, whatever the bodily experience is right now? as best we can. Resting our awareness on the sensations of breathing. Noticing the experience of taking an in-breath. Feeling the stretching, contracting as we breathe. Working our way through the And when the mind wanders, as it's apt to do the end of the day, just very simply, gently begin again. Right now, there's nothing else to do, nowhere else to be. You're just here with the sensations of breathing. And then to begin our loving kindness practice, starting where it's easy, bringing to mind a lovable being, someone for whom without effort, there's a feeling of care warmth. Could be somebody we know, maybe somebody who has touched our life, but we don't have a relationship with them. An author, a teacher, maybe imaginary kittens, puppies, babies. Visualizing the lovable being and connecting with them in whatever way makes sense for you. To support our intention of cultivating loving kindness, to support this connection, we can repeat these phrases while having the lovable being in mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you live with ease. May you live with ease. May you live with ease. And just like we do with mindfulness practice, the mind wanders just very gently, simply with warmth and care. Bring it back to the phrases. Or if there is a felt sense of warmth and openness, you can connect with them. Part of the way we make friends with the mind. Is we nourish it with some warmth and care. The experience of having warmth and care. And the spirits directed towards this nourishing can be nourishing. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. And then to extend our loving kindness for a good friend, somebody in our life that may have warm feelings we appreciate, bringing this person to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be healthy. Tune into being a good friend and companion. Being friendly, being a good companion, how does that feel, the warmth of it, the goodness quote unquote of it, be friendly. Sometimes our relationships are not perfectly just one way, we're not denying or pretending, things are perfect. Right now we're just choosing to tune into a part that feels nourishing. Our being friendly is nourishing. Thank you for our hearts and minds supported. Thank you. And then to extend our loving kindness to ourselves. Of course we include ourselves in loving kindness practice. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. While walking along the river after a long day meditating on Vulture Peak, I watched an elephant splashing its way out of the water and up the bank. Hello, my friend. The person waiting there said, scratching the elephant behind its ear. Did you have a good bath? The elephant stretched out its leg. The person climbed up. And the two rode off like that, together. Seeing what had once been so wild now, a good friend and companion to this good person. I took a seat under the nearest tree and reached out a gentle hand to my own mind. Literally I thought, this is why I came to the woods. It's the first time I'll be looking in this water. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Can we extend our loving kindness even further? Maybe somebody in this Zoom call that you don't know. Maybe somebody you see in the neighborhood occasionally. Bringing them to mind. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Practicing loving kindness, whether it's for ourselves or for others. So to speak. And to some warmth, care, respect, goodwill. And we need to be providing some nourishment that our hearts and minds often need...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
