Hello everyone and welcome.
We're at a day for a natural turning of the planet.
It's kind of symbolic of it's beginning to get darker for many months now, days shorter.
And now, with no responsibility in our part, nothing we've done, the days will get longer.
It will be more light.
And it's a marvelous, wonderful thing that that's the case, at least here in the northern hemisphere.
And it's different in this other hemisphere, but I'll appreciate the same thing in six months.
That there'll be a turn towards light, towards something that's warmth.
And so the same way with meditation, we don't cause the light, the warmth, the goodness, the awesomeness to arise.
But we enable it, we allow it, we make room for it.
The unwholesome mental tendencies, thoughts, actions, motivations belong to a part of the mind that we do activate.
We do get involved in, kind of they're more the reactive part of the mind.
And the wholesome, certainly we can do it and activate it and kind of bring it about, the wholesome state sometimes.
But in meditation what we learn is that we are, that a lot of the wholesome that develops, a lot of the goodness that comes in meditation,
doesn't come from us making it so much, doing it, but more allowing it.
Creating the conditions that allow that, not what's reactive to occur,
but allow something which is unfolding and emerging and allowing the emergence, the wholesome emerges,
the unwholesome reacts, in a sense.
So what I'd like to offer today is one conditions that can be phenomenally helpful for the emergence of the wholesome.
And that is to really stay close to not knowing.
Stay close to recognizing what's happening, so in that sense there's knowing, being with mindful of breathing, the body, the experience you're having.
But beyond recognizing it, the simplicity of it, don't know what it means, don't know where it's going, what's happening.
Just get out of the way, so I don't know. This is what's happening. I don't know. Not knowing.
So that we're not riding close with the signing meaning, identifying, making it me, myself, and mine, operating from what should happen,
what shouldn't happen, expectations, desires for what's supposed to happen, desires for what's not supposed to happen.
Just know what's happening in the sense of recognition, clear recognition, and just not know anything else.
The kind of not knowing that makes room, that kind of empties a crowded mind of all its thoughts and concerns and projections,
and that emptying of the mind of all the crowded visitors makes room for something to emerge.
And what emerges from your depths?
Trust that. Trust the simplicity of not knowing while recognizing.
And the recognition can be phenomenally simple.
If there's not obvious what something is, you can simply recognize it as something.
Don't have to go digging or analyzing something.
And then over time, just something and I don't know, and then see what emerges, what becomes clear.
So to assume a meditation posture, a posture of feeling worthy of something important,
feeling worthy as a human being, a posture that expresses this, even if you don't feel that way,
because that sense of worthiness or dignity, nobility, is a condition that allows something from the depths to emerge.
That's different if we take a posture that's the opposite of self-worth or dignity.
Gently close your eyes.
And taking a few long, slow, deep breaths.
As you exhale, let go of knowing, let go of meaning-making, thinking about the future, past, what should be, what shouldn't be.
Let go and begin to let the visitors that crowd your mind begin to leave, to float away.
Letting your breath return to normal.
Just sitting here quietly for a few moments, finding your way into a wholesome, satisfying attitude of not needing to know so much,
not needing to judge or assign meaning or even assign a future to what's happening.
Being present, making the room of not knowing.
And maybe in the middle of this vast field of not knowing, your body is breathing.
A rhythm of breathing, a rhythm that moves through a mind of not knowing, a mind that's present.
Maybe the not knowing is replaced by a greater attentiveness.
A peaceful alertness to what is.
Maybe the not knowing is replaced by a greater attentiveness.
Maybe the not knowing is replaced by a greater attentiveness.
And if your mind starts thinking about something, you might take a moment to see or feel that the thinking is operating on some kind of thing that you assume you know, the mind assumes it knows.
Even if it's as simple as assuming it knows that it's supposed to know, it's supposed to figure something out.
Let there be a not knowing, the not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing, the not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
When you're lost in thought and recognize it, say to yourself, not knowing, don't know.
You don't really need to know whatever you're thinking about that's not right here or now in the simplicity of being with what emerges in the body and in the heart.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.

Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing that makes room to be with the depths of your being.
Let there be a not knowing.
Not knowing creates different opportunities than knowing.
If you go into the world knowing, it can be effective and have good results.
But if you enter the world not knowing, you expand the possibilities.
If you meet a friend and begin by not knowing, you get to experience more the fullness or the uniqueness of that moment of your friend.
And you get to have more room for yourself.
Knowing narrows possibilities often.
Not knowing, taking a few moments not to know but to discover, allows us to open to something new.
So at this end of this sitting, as we do the dedication of merit,
what would it be like to care for the world, where there's care, but also room for discovery,
where there's love but the space of not knowing what's supposed to happen and what's going on.
So I'll say the dedication, but maybe let it open you to not knowing
and not knowing that can be there together with love.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
May all beings know their respect
of others being available to know who they are without projections and judgments and even a past.
Let people, as you go through the world, have the respect of the not knowing mind as you bring your presence and attention
to take in another person and may that bring peace, then love and happiness.
Thank you.
