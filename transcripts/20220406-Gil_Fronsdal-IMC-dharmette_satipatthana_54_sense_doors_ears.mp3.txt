The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So the teachings of the discourse on the establishing of awareness has come now to the exercise on
mindfulness of the senses and sense doors and sense experience. And in the explicit
teachings that I've heard over these years on this particular Satyabhatana discourse,
my sense is the particular exercise that maybe the two exercises, maybe that I
are least emphasized, is the last one of the first of the mindfulness of the body, which is the
corpse meditations, and this one, the six senses. And it's a little bit of a pity that it's not
emphasized more because the sense experience, being really grounded in our sense experience of
hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, tasting, and the clear seeing or knowing of what happens in
the mind is really at the heart of classic Vipassana practice. And we're learning to stay present in
the simplicity of our sense experience because that's always in the present moment. And as we do
so, as we come closer and closer to be able to do that, it's a process. We do, you know,
progressively closer and closer, just a simplicity of sense experience. At the same time, it's more
and more letting go of our entanglement, the way we're caught and reactive and spending our time
thinking. There's less and less attachment as we're able to stay more and more just with the
ongoing flow of the current of the river of sense experience as it occurs. And the little
teaching from the Buddha that's repeated a lot in this insight world, teachers, is the instructions
in the seeing, just the seeing. The seeing, what's seeing? Just the seeing. In the heard,
just the heard. In the cognized, just the cognized. In the sense experience, just the sense
experience, just the seeing, just the hearing. That's simplicity. It can be quite liberating,
quite delightful to have put down our preoccupations in reactivity. So today the topic is hearing.
And this is maybe because much of these teachings were done, were composed before the written
word became popular. The name of direct disciples of the Buddha is Savaka. Savaka can be translated
as the ones who hear, the ones who heard the teachings of the Buddha directly. But I like to
think that it's a deeper meaning, the ones who hear deeply or attentive as if they're hearing to
everything. The Christian order of monks called the Benedictines, apparently their kind of code
of conduct, their rulebook discipline begins with the word askolta in Latin, meaning hear, listen,
hear, listen. So to listen, there's a lot to be learned from listening and hearing, hearing in
particular. If we can hear receptively, openly, and I like this idea of the 360 degree panorama of
sounds and to settle back and allow the sounds to appear from whatever in that big circle that
they occur. And sometimes I have the sense that my awareness is sometimes as big and as expensive
as the distance from where the sound originates. And that happens when my mind gets very relaxed
and open. And there's very little sense of boundaries to the mind or location for things in
the mind. And so the sense of location just tends to become expansive and open. And it's a
delightful feeling to feel the mind so receptive and relaxed and open that it just takes in sounds
in a very spacious way. Well short of that, as we become aware of hearing, we could become aware
of how we get entangled in what we hear, the knots that get formed. There's a sound, there's the
ear that hears, the eardrums maybe. And then there's the knot, the fetter that gets formed between
those two. And this can happen when someone's speaking to us, someone's saying something and
we stop listening because we're grabbed onto a branch of how we feel hurt or how we have some
new fantasy, a new idea. And we go off thinking about something triggered by them, but we're no
longer really listening. And so we've formed a knot around our thoughts. Or maybe we don't like
what we hear. And so there's tension somewhere in the body. Maybe we like what we hear and we
want more of it. And so there's a kind of starts plotting, planning how to have more and let it
continue. There's all kinds of judgments that can arise. There's all kinds of preferences. They're
bias. There can be ideas of self that the sounds is impinging on me. I'm a victim of all these
sounds. I'm the one who hears it. There's kind of an analogy that's used that if you hold your
hand flat, and then something comes and strikes it, then the stronger the strike, the more it's
going to hurt your hand. But if you keep your hand open and relaxed so that things can just go
right through, then you're less likely to be hurt. Just let it go through. Or even better,
is you lower the hand and then the sounds just go right through. And they don't touch. They don't
hit anything. And the equivalent of the hand in the mind is sometimes is a very strong sense of
self. Strong sense of me, my experience. I'm the victim of it. It's happening to me. Why are they
doing it to me? And to be able to lower that concern, that tension, that preoccupation around
self, me, myself, and mine, is one of the great fruits of this mindfulness practice. And then
as this selfing, self-relaxes, then the sounds go right through. Or we start seeing what the
sounds strike, where the knot exists. And it becomes a mindfulness spell for us to notice
that knot, to notice our reactivity, our reaction, our entanglement with it. So if you hear anything,
the ears are hearing, you are in the present moment. Sounds are one of those phenomena
that only exist in the current, the flow of the present moment. And so to be aware of sounds
and listening, and to be open to it and receive it, is to stay present here and now. And it can
be a way that we begin to recognize the forces of the mind that take us out of the present
moment, the branches we hold on to. And it's not so much that we have to then analyze what
we're holding on to as it is to let go, to come back to this receptive awareness of listening.
And to learn to do this around sounds, some people find this is the laboratory in which
it's easiest to learn, relaxed, receptive, unentangled awareness and mindfulness. And then
learning it and hearing, and then to apply it to other things as well. So for these next 24 hours,
I'd encourage you to give a particular attention to hearing and maybe find some times through the
day that you can sit someplace in a park or open window or someplace and just kind of allow
yourself to hear sounds. Kind of like you maybe lay in your back on the grass and look at the clouds,
you know, float by above in this very relaxed way. So kind of settle back and just take some time,
just hear sounds. If you like listening to music, you could try to choose some music that is
pleasant, relaxing to listen to, that maybe is just a delight to listen to in this way,
maybe even listening with your eyes closed. Sometimes with the eyes closed, there's less
entanglement and more ability to just receive what's happening. And in the course of the day,
you might also practice this listening someone speak. How simple can you hear? How fully can
you be present in a hearing way so you can hear and listen to what they say without the
entanglement so that as you listen to them, you hear from a deeper place in your heart,
in your body, in your mind, that you hear the other person, you allow those words to come.
And because there's no entanglement, it doesn't hit anything on the way in. Maybe it can resonate
some deeper connectivity, some deeper place that may be a place of love and compassion, care, peace.
May hearing be a doorway for freedom. Thank you.
