 So hello everyone. A lot of familiar faces. I've seen a lot of you before. I'm Gloria Ambrosia, also known as Tarania. My poly name. Really looking forward to being here with you this week. I'll be here tonight and oh tomorrow night for your wonderful ceremony or program and Sunday morning and I'd like to try to get here you know once or twice a year if I can. I sure had a good had the good fortune of being here for the whole month of July which was lovely. So good to be here again. Just trying to tune in and think about what might be useful tonight. For myself I find it really helpful to talk about the meditation practice itself a lot. I think what I've seen over the year certainly in myself and certainly in the people that I talk to is that you know we tend to get a definition or like a model or a prescription of the meditation practice maybe even from our first meditation class or our first meditation retreat and our understanding of what it is that we're doing and how we're doing it and why we're doing it and what it affects over time can sometimes just remain pretty static. It's like we're not really tuning into what it is how it is that we're growing in our understanding and you know reapplying that and sort of tweaking the meditation practice and I don't know about you but for me it was well it's still very much in process but certainly for the first five even seven years of meditation you know there would still be so many times where I'd be going now what am I doing you know and where am I supposed to be and how am I supposed to be doing this you know and so I think it's really good just to keep an ongoing dialogue with your teachers and with your meditation companions and just keep talking about your understanding of how you're coming to see mindfulness concentration you know what what the four foundations of mindfulness are and what these what you're noticing as an effect or an outcome of your practice over time so I just wanted to offer some thoughts and hopefully we'll have some time for a little discussion about this as well I say hopefully because I can go on sometimes I get I get excited and I get too caught up in it and then I don't leave enough time so I'll try to be more careful tonight so let's just start with the whole idea of mindfulness and concentration I have found myself that I've actually started to try to avoid these words because I've gotten so entrenched in my mind and my understanding as to what they are and I think this is quite common because what we tend to do the nature of our minds is such that we hold things conceptually we hold things in the abstract so we get an idea about what mindfulness is we get an idea about concentration and then we don't realize that we're actually living the meditation in that idea and not actually having a direct experience of what it is that we're even talking about you know so I really want to invite you to look at this I've stopped using those words and actually have have tried instead to go to the experience of what it is that I'm trying to affect as a meditator and and find the word that fits that it might be mindfulness it might be concentration but for instance this sense of of concentration it's really it's really like a settling you know a sense of ease a sense of tranquility you know can you feel that it's like that that that experience remember the practice is directly experiential so it's this experience of dropping out of all of the stuff that the mind keeps picking up and settling it's like you know I feel it sometimes it's like dust settling out of the air or like you know the fish food in the fish tank as it kind of floats on down you know there's a you know are you feeling that do you have a sense of that as you sit here on the cushion is that what you uh attempt to establish as you begin your meditation practice and is that what you're endeavoring to sustain and recollect throughout the course of the day it's like a i feel almost like an exhale you know it's not an inhale it's it's a it's a release it's a letting go so you know can you can you feel that it's tranquility it's ease it's a sense of being settled but you know if you hold that conceptually like concentration i've got to get concentrated what does that do to your mind you know it's like it does just the opposite of what it is that we're trying to affect you know you get all tight like for many months and maybe even years in my meditation practice that's what it would be like you know be like this um you know get concentrate and get this big headache you know you get this tight tight constricted feeling in your forehead and your shoulders get all hunched you know and and uh and that's absolutely not what we're going for so uh just endeavor to have a sense of the experience of this rather than our idea about that what that is and then mindfulness is the is the is in that space you know in that settled and relaxed space you know what's happening it's far out you know just look and see it's like when you get settled there's automatically an alertness that occurs and and and it's it's like there's there's something that's knowing it's like oh i you know you get this kind of thing you know oh i know what's going on i i feel it i can see it i'm aware i'm aware you know there's and you that becomes much more a brighter function in the mind i mean it's possible to get settled and not have that you know so so look and see um but settled with a sense of alertness awareness whatever you whatever you want to call it mindfulness knowing seeing clearly you know but these the effort is to get these two things going and to kind of fan the flame of them in your certainly in your formal practice that's what we're doing in the formal practice is saying you know this is a time i'm going to set aside to really try to really folk you know focus on that and give it some juice give it some energy um but all the time really not just you know meditation practice is 24 7 you know it's it's see if you can get a sense of that as much as possible throughout the course of the day is certainly when things are very disoriented and scattered you know these become a refuge don't they you know ease and and awareness become quite a refuge from that kind of activity in the mind that that get that is actually constitutes our suffering so you know just tuning in and getting a sense of that and and just one more point on this i think it's it's important um ajahn chah used to emphasize this a lot in his talks in his teachings that um there we seem to have gotten caught somewhere along the line and like an artificial separation between these two like that there's there's concentration practices and then there's mindfulness practices and yes there are practices that you do where you really endeavor to uh fine tune the very absorbed states but if you're an insight meditator or when you're doing insight meditation that's not what you're doing you know and and so these are going hand in hand this sense of ease and the sense of knowing what's happening and i think what happens is that you know the buddha was just such a brilliant teacher it's just it's we're so fortunate to have this body of teachings uh that come from him he was very skilled and you know one of the forms that that takes is you know he put things together in neat little packages a lot didn't he you know the four of these the three of these the two of that and that really makes it easy to remember but he even said himself that this is this is for the sake of understanding in an intellectual way what it is that he's trying to communicate but that experientially you know that it's not quite it's not that static it's not that categorical you know so i think that that's true even of this the this definition of the meditation practice as as mindfulness and concentration or ease and awareness these these really go very much hand in hand when you're you look at your experience and you'll see you know try to separate that out one from the other they're right there together right so just getting clear on our understanding of what it is that we're talking about you want to use the use our head use our noggin to understand but that is much more as a tool to help us to know what we're experiencing and tweak that experience you know going back and forth between intellect and experience okay so you get a get a sense of that and that's one thing that uh might be helpful really too i think that sometimes this sense of ease can be understated the importance of it can be understated and missed you know that really and i've often had the feeling that if you do nothing else in your formal practice but just sit here and every time you notice that you're contracted and tight just kind of loosen up and relax you know breathing deeper throwing the shoulders back expanding the chest just opening up that your time would be very well spent because this this not much happens without this sense of ease without even just without you don't need that much of it but you need you need some you need to be relaxed because the mind is so prone to pick things up and to go off to things they get completely lost in the body and feelings in its own thoughts right i mean you could say here come on let's be honest we can sit here for the whole meditation practice like just kind of off in la la land you know it's uh it's very easy to do and that tendency is very strong so this sense of being settled and relaxed creates an environment a context in which that is less likely to happen you know so not to underestimate or understate the importance of um this experience so just keep endeavoring even if it takes years to get a sense of what it is we're talking about and a direct experience of it and you'll find that you know as this grows it has a powerful effect on us in our lives we're very we become a lot more relaxed a lot more happy and um that out of that state you can receive just about anything you know and life has its knocks you know it has its jabs and uh where are you going to find the staying power to be with what presents itself you know it comes out of cultivating just this kind of state can you feel that very very important so then we have this um uh what it is that we pay attention to and here again we see we see the brilliance of the buddha you know he he's uh giving us given us these four foundations of mindfulness where um you know he's he's saying i mean it seems so elementary at one level notice that your experience includes sensation includes things going on with the body it's it includes feeling the experience of things as pleasant and unpleasant and it includes um thought mental activity the mind so these are the first three foundations of mindfulness and you know it as i said it sounds it can see seem elementary he's saying you know what are you going to pay attention to or pay attention to these and but the thing is we there's there's a there's a sense for for us that there's there's more to it than that that there's more going on than that and and yet there isn't it's just from one moment to the next it's all just sensation feeling and thought you know but what what we do with that what the mind does with that is what we get caught up in and so what he's what he's endeavoring to do in this instruction is to to simplify that and to begin and to facilitate a process of pulling us out of all of the stuff that the mind does with sensation feeling and thought and just notice now there's a sound now there's a feeling now there's a physical sensation now there's a thought that this is incredibly profound you know because it's all a muddle in there we're very confused it's like we're relating to the body out of the head we're relating to the head out of the body and and all the the the levels of experience are completely caught up in each other so he's saying see the body as the body see feeling simply as feeling see thought see the various states of mind that you get caught in simply as that and that's what you're doing a lot you know you may for those of you who may have learned mental noting or whatever tool you use you know you're endeavoring to sit here in meditation and notice that that's just what's happening aren't you just that's that's what's going on right now there's a thought there's a feeling there's a sensation now that in and of itself doesn't sound like a whole lot it is but it's very important it's foundational it's not ultimately where the meditation practice leaves leaves us but it's a start because what's gonna what's gonna happen as you're looking at the mind in that way you know little by little it's like in the beginning it's more like withdrawing out of a lot of the proliferation of the mind so that you can just see things simply like this so a lot of the practice is just going oh you know it's not all this this this this this it's just a thought it's not all this this this i'm just experiencing this as something unpleasant you know so there's that there's like a withdrawing out of a lot of the mental gibberish that goes on in the mind and just simplifying the moment simplifying the experience but gradually that matures and it's not just a withdrawing there's the mind is really beginning to see things more clearly and there's a natural detachment that begins to develop you know you don't it's like you might see angry states but not get caught up in them right you might you might see jealousy and now you're beginning to go oh oh that's jealousy this is radically different than being jealous you know can you feel that so so it's like this this pulling out for a period of time and for every everybody it's different you know how long how long do i have to keep doing this before i start to put it together you know before it takes a leap to another level but it does and it will it reaches a critical mass the mind by disengaging by not getting caught up in its own creations gradually begins to position itself differently in relation to those doesn't it it's just it just starts to go oh oh that's interesting you know i keep look at that look at what i do look at what i keep doing i keep getting caught up in that every time i get caught up in that i get a stomach ache or a headache or you know i you know i get a loss for a day or a couple of days you know depression anger hatred you know lust how many hours have we spent lusting in our minds after things you know but but gradually through the months and years of practice you start to notice these phenomenologically you know it's like this is a phenomenon this is an arisen phenomenon it's not who i am you know something something different is happening isn't it you know you've got a different relationship going this is why this is getting great now you know this is what it's really getting juicy getting interesting because now it's like the mind is going well well what is hatred you know what is this this mood that i keep finding myself in you know it's a dominant mood i've been in this mood for 37 years you know it's like what is this thing anyway you know could i could i get you know if i could just get out of it enough to to get some perspective then i can begin to understand it you know begin to have a different way of relating to it and then from this position here's where it's really the the shift the shift is i mean it's magical it's like we're not so caught in the content of our lives and of our minds and of our experience but now if you can feel that what's happened is there you're going you're looking at it at a process level you're going well how did it do that how did i get there and how do i keep staying there and well wait a minute i've seen myself when i'm not in it how did i get out of it you know and and so that the the potential for insight now is getting huge you're building this critical mass you know and the more that you begin to see your experience in this way the more we're shifting out of the content of it and looking at it as an object you know something to understand to examine to investigate to evaluate then the the more we're going to be able to see what the buddha is talking about in the noble truths for example that it's not the stuff that's the problem it's the it's the fact that we're we we keep buying it you know we keep picking it up that's the problem you know but you this is this is quite mature practice you can't you know you can't see that until you can go through this process of disengaging long enough to begin to look at it in this new way you know so that yeah i don't care what it is people situations our own mind states our own thoughts and feelings these do not constitute suffering in and of themselves you know and this is a radical experience i know it was for me when the first time that i actually saw that this it was a guy who was really irritating the heck out of me in my life you know and every time i would hear him coming it would be like everything you know everything would just tighten up and cringe you know because up until that point it's this person who's the problem right but as you develop the capacity to see your processes which i was doing i was at the monastery at the time and practicing very hard with my inner world you know in a moment here came the person and i saw a rise here this you know and that was like wow the first time in my life i've actually seen very directly that this tightening that is about to be my suffering is happening here it's coming up here it's not out there you know but i can't see that until i develop some skill in knowing the sensations feelings and thoughts in some objective way and tuning in to the processes that create suffering so you know what are these processes you know when there's a lot that can be said about it but i think i'd just like to boil it down to to two for for tonight so we can talk about it a little bit but the the the buddha talked about the experience of sort of longing you know going after things that we want and that we don't have and the experience of of getting away from things that we don't have or don't like or you know are experiencing that but that we're finding unpleasant so these dominant ways of relating these are these are two dominant ways of relating we call them greed and hatred but i think people can get confused and think of greed and hatred as much more coarse experiences than they are very very subtle you know it's just it's this and this you know it's whether it's your thoughts that you're picking up sensations in your body in the world situations that one is is just not letting be you know this is relating to them with this or with this you know so that the process of liberating ourselves from suffering is one of finding a way of relating to our experience in a way that allows it to be allows it to be what it is the implications of that are huge because that means that you know he's saying very clearly there is difficulty in life there is difficulty but it doesn't have to become a huge problem so that if we're not hating it or not wanting something else then it's free just to be what it is so that means you know i'm sorry to say but that means you'll you'll have to feel it you know you'll have to feel the difficulty but it's it's just life you know it's not it's not a big problem and so what you cultivate through the processes of meditation is the capacity to just be with the jabs and the joys you know it's like that it's like this and it's like that and it's like this and it's like that and so we settle down and receive the totality of our experience and these ways of relating so as to make a problem out of that or what we get free of you know to make a problem either by pushing it away or thinking that we don't have enough of it something like that so you know gradually you just the mind just gets fortified it gets stronger and it's not caught up in its own trappings it's not caught up in its own creations and you know meditators experience that increased happiness and contentment a sense of ease and tranquility relaxation in their lives so what what happens through the course of the the months and years of practice is you find that the mind just begins to get stronger and stronger and stronger and and it also gets softer and i love this it's like there's this this juxtaposition it's almost like a masculine feminine quality uh coming into complete balance you know where you know i remember ajan chai used to say that the mind um the mind is weak in the unawakened state it's very weak and it's weak because it just keeps following moods it just keeps whatever whatever comes yeah you know you know hate this like that don't like this get this don't have that you know it just whatever mood arises it doesn't it isn't able to relate to that as a phenomenon it just picks it up and and we become it and so that you can just feel that you you just caught in the compulsions the impulses of habit of habitual states of being and so it's you know a mind that's in that kind of state is very very weak it's like it's spread too thin it's like it doesn't have any substance or stamina of its own you know it's completely out of control in the face of what is really just arisen phenomena it's good but it's completely lost in it and you know buddhist said that we're enslaved to the sensations feelings and thoughts it's like we're in the unawakened state we're enslaved so you know the effort then what happens through the process of meditation is that that that tendency disengages you begin to see things a lot more clearly and from a distance and yet the irony is i think what's what's a paradox in this is that as we become more detached from arisen phenomenon you feel it you feel them more clearly sounds like a paradox doesn't it but but just look at that as you become more detached let's say it's hatred you know hatred arises in the mind and you are able to see the experience of hatred without what feeds hatred is either getting caught we relate to it with greed or greed or hatred we either get completely caught up in it or we hate that it's there and then you got this double tightening going on you know hating ourselves for being hateful you know so if that's not happening then what you have is the experience of it's almost like a wave you know and arisen you know that the full momentary direct real experience of hatred and if there's nothing obstructing that number one you'll get a sense of what that is and from that direct experience we learn very in a very real way it's not a pleasant state and not something that i particularly want to engage in and so the the tendency to get caught in it weakens just by not obstructing the fact of its having arisen but the other thing that happens is it's free to move because all of these conditions are impermanent and so it just it will arise and you may experience it momentarily and it will move through it may come back it moved through but gradually over the months and years of practice one is shifting radically one's relationship with these kinds of states of mind i understand you're doing some people are doing a course on the hindrances now so you're probably looking at this so you get this sense of the mind becoming stronger in relation to a risen phenomenon but you also get a sense of it getting softer and i find this over the the years it's just been a lovely side effect or outcome of practice it's like you know just this for example taking this simple practice of trying to be settled and relaxed and be with the breath and how many times have you have you done that and how many times have you lost it you know how many how many times i mean millions of times you know do we do we oh wait a minute you know what was i doing you know and and realize that we've been lost in something and aren't it all here you know well just think about what that's got to do to you over time just have the stamina to hang in there with meditation you know over over time it's like you've got to get softer it's like you know meditation my teacher used to call it exercises and failure you know it's like you've got to get softer and eventually the the battling the struggling the fighting it will release of its own accord you know you we're not we're not by nature warring people it may feel that way sometimes but it's because of the ignorance you know then the nature is good the nature that the raw nature is kind and so this battle in the in the face of of that our true nature we just get weary of it you know i say you you you over time what happens is that the heart just stops getting caught up it just gets softer and softer and softer so the and the more we come back without judging and without criticizing you see i mean you know this is part of the meditation story just come back without judging without criticizing just come back to the breath you know and take that to heart what's that what's that doing to you it's actually training us to to lose lose the hatred lose the criticism lose the judging it doesn't it has no useful purpose it has no value it doesn't affect anything but suffering you know so so you lose it put it aside and and we become more and more vulnerable and open and okay with the things that we see arise in moi you know i really like that yeah i'm i can be pretty hateful sometimes yeah yeah there's jealousy yeah yeah know that one yeah yeah okay you know so none of the states that arise can can uh uh get us going anymore it's like it's or um you know get us into that critical hateful place so um you know what what i've experienced over time and this is something that i came to uh um sometime during this year i think it it it was really a wonderful awakening um it was sort of just coming to the realization the full realization that i'm not awake you know that i'm not awake and that i find myself in the somewhat embarrassing situation of being on a whole planet full of people who aren't awake either you know and we're just kind of bungling around here trying to get our act together you know and with that realization i mean if we can hold that and find find some hold it with some lightness you know we we we you know then it's like i find it's almost like i've lowered my standards you know i don't expect myself to be doing it better than i am i'm doing the best i can that expecting something else is so creates so much suffering whether it's of myself or of other people of world leaders of world situations you know it's like you know we're out to lunch you know you can't expect it all you can do is keep practicing and keep endeavoring to wake up and be an example for other people as well and in in our practice by practicing well it serves as that and it affects tremendous outcomes just endeavor to to be peaceful you know instead of fighting for peace all the time that kind of thing you know it's a very dramatic difference i think the buddhist teachings are an invitation to be peaceful to be peaceful people and find that's huge find out what that means and endeavor to accomplish that through our meditation practice so i find that the the system then over time it's like one of the biggest impediments for for me and my own meditation practice has been trying to get somewhere you know trying to attain some kind of goal trying to get to where the meditation practice takes me and and what i've learned over the months and years of practice is that i don't have to worry about that that it all that we have to do is pay attention and everything that needs to happen will happen from that and so like the system gets tweaked but it happens out of mindfulness you know it doesn't happen out of me who thinks she knows where she needs to be and what she needs to do you know it just it just happens out of being here not there here being here for the experience and letting the direct experience of this moment have its habits moment and what i need to know what needs to happen will happen from that i find that a tremendous relief don't you it's like oh oh i don't have to get free freedom happens through mindfulness through paying attention can you feel it it's a very very very rich subtle aspect or approach that the buddha is offering us so let's let's see if you have a few questions a few questions I find a couple of things about the moves and that i have a hard time explaining to friends in mind specifically in terms of of dispassion or you know detachment yeah and when i hear you know the fact i mean i've been able to in a couple of instances negative That's all well and good, but I guess I'm still the unawakened human that says, you know, that's not right and I want to fix that. Or, wait a sec, you know, why did you do that to my son? Or, you know, what the heck does Bush come in? I find that... But I mean, I find that then I say, gee, are we as students of a practice of peace doing nothing because we're supposed to be just unattached and dispassionate about things? Does that make sense? Yeah, no, and that's a great question. And it comes down to getting a clear sense of what it is that we're talking about when we're saying detachment or nonattachment, you know, because it's not in action. In fact, it's incredibly active. Look at it like... Say, let's use the example that you gave of anger. The nonattachment has to do with... It's quite subtle. It has to do with being able to be in a position in relation to that that knows anger and doesn't get caught up in it and doesn't hate that it's there. The attachment is in that way of relating. So that what you're managing through that is the way... The state of mind, the state of being out of which you will act. So it doesn't mean that you don't go to anti-war rallies or write letters to Bush or deal with people who are harming your son. It doesn't mean you don't do that. But what Buddhism endeavors to affect is the quality of heart with which you'll do that. And that's where... So it's not... It's not not acting. But it's acting. It's acting with... Yeah, it's not automatically acting out of arisen states, which you can't trust. This is karma. And most of it unwholesome. It's like to react out of hatred to things that arise is an unwholesome, unskillful response. So... How are you going to get in there? If there isn't any practice, if there isn't any effort to approach that in a new way, then one is going to go about dealing with things through violent, reactive patterns. So you're endeavoring to try a new strategy. I think that the easy examples are anger and greed. Where I start stumbling is, I guess, being attached to creating, you know, enjoyment and how to be this passionate about certain things that you're told she should be passionate about. And I can't give a clear example. Well, like, I think maybe what you might be alluding to is like, I think some people think that the practice, it means detaching from pleasure as well, detaching from enjoyment. And actually, it doesn't mean that. It actually... I think you'll find as you mature in practice that you're a lot happier and that pleasant experiences are felt, are infinitely more pleasant. But the thing is, you're aware that they're impermanent. And so the tendency to cling to them, which actually interrupts their flow, is what you're giving up. So I like to put that out as a carrot, you know, because if you're giving up that tendency to react in a way that disrupts it, you're actually going to feel pleasure more. Yeah. What else? Yeah. There seems to be almost a fight against learning. Basic human learning, I say, the apples from this tree taste much better than the apples from that tree. Therefore, I'm going to go to this tree more often. And we're sitting... I don't know what the meditation I'm having today. I want the meditation I had two days ago. I was much better. Yeah. So there is that... there's a sense of grasping at it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's what I was talking about, holding it conceptually. And we have a lot of ideas about practice. We have a lot of ideas about what we should be feeling, what it should be affecting. And there are some of the biggest impediments to actually practicing and getting free. Because practice isn't about getting to some state that is better than the state that we're in. I'm sorry to say. It's about waking up to the state that we're in. So that may not be pleasant. It may be that this meditation isn't as good as the other one. Isn't as pleasant as the other one. But it's real. So how are you going to open to... how are you going to have insight into Dukkha? It took me a while to realize that insight into Dukkha wasn't going to be pleasant. But it's a powerful insight. It's like a little tap on the shoulder that says, you know, Oh, by the way, life has both pleasure and pain. You know. It sounds so obvious. But we do not get that. So meditations will be pleasant and unpleasant. And the objective of meditation is to be with things as they are. And what's beautiful about it is, though, just to give you another little carrot, is that, okay, if you can be with things as... you cultivate the capacity to be with things as they are, whether they're pleasant or not. What you discover is that that state is very, very nice. You've actually gotten deeper. You're actually under this place that doesn't like it when it's this way. Can you feel that? It's like you're like, Oh, I see. There's this little bit of me that doesn't like it when it's that way. But where are you right then? It's like, Oh, yeah. I noticed I don't like it when it's this way. I like it when it's that way, but I don't like it when it's that way. And it's actually a very, at least neutral state, if not even mildly pleasant. Right? And that's what we're endeavoring to affect. Being with things from that place. It's subtle, isn't it? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Just smiling, I'm saying I experienced that setting in the way that you were just talking about. And for me, I could feel that my heart just in the past few days, especially, so much fear coming up and surrounding different aspects of life that I'm actually more aware of. It's like you said, comes up and being aware that it's there and then letting that energy go like a wave. So because you know, it's important and it's not an estate. And the same thing I felt that almost like rhythms falling away from the heart, that kind of settling. But it's taken me the past few days, if not the past five years, of practice to actually see this process. And I have trust in the process and I have faith in it. It doesn't mean I don't get caught up with those things that arise, but with the awareness. But I know there's maybe no real answer to the question, but I guess since I'm only really like, go quicker than I'm having to, you know, I know I do trust it, but it's so nice when that letting go happens. But what makes us hold on for whatever length that process takes before you actually fail that learning? And what do you have to see a more subtle aspect of it or to let that energy keep on? I think it kind of reaches a critical mass. You know, you just do it enough and fail to do it enough. You know, we really have to pay attention to both of those. And that's important. Like pay attention in a neutral way to like this time that you're expressing now where there's a little bit of, you know, why can't it go quicker, you know? Pay attention to how that feels and pay attention to the times when you release easily and you feel the delight of that. Because both of those will be instrumental in leaning the heart. It's like the heart just leans. It's almost like you're using the system to get out of the system. You're using pleasure and the experience of pleasure and pain to free the heart. Because skillful states are pleasant. Unskillful states are unpleasant. And if you are there for the experience of those, there will be a natural leaning. And the more you can, all I can say is the more that you can actually just be there in a neutral way with what has come up, it'll do its magic. Yeah. Just like I have a little night of that feeling that I can't just like, you know, just remember that whole night now? But it's gone. Yeah. Yeah. That's okay. You know, it sounds great. Yes. I found, you know, when you are on stage, it's very difficult to say neutral. You see me neutral. I can be neutral when it comes to me. Yes. It's hard for me to say neutral sometimes. You know, you are the one way or the other, but you know, dishes can be neutral. I mean, if you try to be detached from it, sometimes it's just, you're so deep in pain into it. Yeah. It's just very difficult to get detached. Yes, it is. Yeah. So what do you do? You just, you keep working at it. It's not, I didn't, don't want to pretend that it's easy. You have to have a healthy respect for the force of karmic patterns. They come in like tidal waves, don't they? Whoa. You know, sometimes you can't even get any footing at all in relation to what arises in the mind and heart. And that has to be said. And so, I mean, my teacher used to say, I was asking him pretty much the same question one time, and he said, you know, it has to be said that sometimes you just have to wait it out. Wait it out. Wait it out. Yeah. And if you can feel that in that waiting it out, you're actually cultivating or experiencing a certain piece. It's patience. Patience is peace. It really is. It's the same root, comes from the same root word. Yeah, you know, I just seem to be thinking to the fact that sometimes you want to make something happen. Yeah. And I understand that, you know, you said earlier that it's easier to wait things out and just work at the end of it and make things happen by itself. Yeah. Well, that's just our idea of what the real world is. That's just our notion. That's just an overlay, you know. I'll give you a story at one time. One of the nuns was telling me that being a nun, she has the good fortune of being in a relationship with a community of people. That she's going to be with for the rest of her life, probably. And so when things come up, when they do things that drive each other nuts, you know, they have the good fortune of just being able to say, well, I guess we're going to get to that next year. You know, or, you know, it may take five or seven years for that thing that we do to each other to soften or to flatten out. And that'll be good. That'll be good. You know. And I don't know, for me, it just put a whole new, it's like, what's the hurry? You know, it's only going to happen in its own time anyway. And what's going to determine how it shifts is the quality of our presence of mind, our ease, relaxation and awareness. And if we're hating it, they are going to be there. So it's only like, you know, getting in your own way to have an attitude like that towards it. It doesn't, I mean, as strategies, things like the five hindrances don't make sense. They don't work. You know, hating it doesn't work. Oh, let me just hate it. That'll get me, that'll get me free. You know, that'll ease my pain. It's like, what? Can you understand the fact that you try to be at peace with yourself by trying to make that thing happen? But in reality, society, I don't think that it fits very well. Right. Right. But you have to, I think with this practice, you have to be willing to take on society. I mean, you have to be willing to question some of the values and the notions that it sets up. I mean, maybe there's an example that I'm not answering your question appropriately for. There might be something that, yeah, we do have to deal in the conventional world. But there's a lot of things that we take for granted as real that are just ideas, social values or mores that in reality don't have substance. They're ultimately true. Like, I have to do this by next Friday. There's no ultimate truth in that, you know, that kind of thing. The mind won't get caught on those very quickly. You know, it's like, how many times have you made a list of things that you have to do by the end of the day and then driven yourself crazy to accomplish it? Not realizing that you just made that up. You know, so that's what I mean by you have to take those kinds of things on. You can't, you can't take them. But you know, there's a few things that need to be done. I mean, if it's not done, you can be punished by the society. Right. Right. Right. You know, it's just not like, you're trying to be a priest and it results in everything. Yes. Yes. But when you get out of society, you put all the people in the society world. Exactly. Yeah. No, and you can't. And so, maybe we could talk a real, a real example, but the, I know what you're saying, and yes, of course, you have to deal with, it's kind of like the render to Caesar, the things that are Caesar's and to God, the things that are God's, you know, there's, Ajahn Chah would say something very similar to that. There's conventional reality and there's ultimate reality. And as a meditator, you're endeavoring to affect your understanding at that ultimate level, but you're still a human being interacting in society and there will be things at a conventional level that you do and need to do. Yeah. Yeah. You're sometimes trying to realize something, ultimate reality, and you know, you're just kind of wanting something to happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're just, you're going very hard towards something. You're just, you know, you're just, you know. Yeah. So, how do you deal with that? I mean, I don't want to say patience, but I mean... Well, but you can, you can also stop wanting it to happen. Excuse me? You can also stop wanting it to happen. Stop wanting it to happen? Yeah. That's the honest one. Yeah. So, oh yes, one more. I don't want to hold people over time. Yeah. Sort of thinking about the last two questions, and I'm just wondering what has been my experience in this. I'm a prodigious clinger, you know, and can just really cling on to something. How you said, you know, 37 years or something. And then that experience of finally one day going, oh, I don't have to care about this anymore. It's just so extraordinary. And I've noticed that the only, the only change I can see is that I'm now doing that with sulfur things, with smaller things. The really big things in my foot are smaller things. And the only thing that seems to contribute to the process is just paying more attention. If I paid, it's somehow as though you just get fed up with yourself, and things just kind of sag of their own weight after you've paid enough attention over a rough time. That's really true. Yeah. I find a lot of the shifts that I've seen in my own practice are just that. It's like, you just get sick of hearing yourself whine and complain. And that, at some level, you're feeling the pain of doing that. And if you can do that without any view, just actually just do feel the pain of that without wishing it wasn't that way or wanting it some other way, but feel the pain of that. That's right where you want to be. And that the shift comes out of that. Right? So that's what you're describing. Yeah. Lovely. Yeah. So I'm happy to stick around for a little bit if people have some questions. But our time is up and I don't want to hold you longer than we need to. So thank you for your attention. Thank you for your practice and time. I look forward to seeing you again.
