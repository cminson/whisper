The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So this evening I thought to take a question, there was a question that was
submitted to the form that I offer to submit questions to. And the
question was about some of the supports for our ethical conduct, supports for
our navigation of our moral life. In the Buddhist, in the Pali, these two terms
are called hiri and otapa. And they're kind of, what I would call actually,
I call them kind of our moral compass. There, these, maybe we could call them
almost warning signs, you know, a compass is kind of like, you know, it's
directing you, it's taking you to a good direction. And the, these two qualities
of hiri and otapa, which I'll translate for you in a moment, but I'm holding off
intentionally right now, these two qualities are kind of like our guard
rails. They help us, they're, they're, they're feeling qualities that help us
know when we're about to do something that will cause harm. So they're, they're
kind of like, and it's interesting because they don't, they don't feel so
good, you know, they're kind of these warning bells, they go off and they say,
hey, you know, that's, that's gonna, that's gonna cause somebody harm or
that's gonna cause you harm. So they, they, they're these kind of warning signs
that go off. And so they, they have a kind of a, of a, of a query quality to them, a
quality of, oh, something's off. Something feels off here. It doesn't feel good.
Something doesn't feel good about what I'm thinking about doing or getting ready
to do or have done. I think even, they even tell us after we've done some
things, after we've done things, that, that this was not a good thing to do. So
the Buddha called these qualities of hiri and uttapa. He called them the
guardians of the world because they are so fundamental to our ethical life, our
moral life, our taking care of each other, of not harming each other. They're
kind of the foundation of, of our, our ethical behavior, these qualities. And
they're described as protections that they protect us from, from causing harm. So
the translation, the typical translations for hiri and uttapa are, I don't, I
don't resonate so much with the typical translation for these terms. The, the
typical translation for hiri is something like moral shame. And the typical
translation for uttapa is something like moral dread or fear of doing something
wrong. Bhikkhu Bodhi, a, a Pali scholar and monastic and practitioner who's
translated a lot of the sutras for us, he says that hiri is an innate sense of
shame over moral transgression. That's how he defines it, an innate sense of shame
over moral trans, transgression. And that he talks about uttapa as being the fear
that comes when you reflect on the results of what would happen if you did
something wrong. So it's kind of, it's reflecting on that. So these two
translations, shame and fear for these two, you know, in English those, those
words, you know, they, they bump up against something that sounds very
aversive. Those words tend to, you know, sound like guilt or, you know, shame
sounds a lot like guilt. Fear sounds a lot like, you know, the the aversive
reactivity to things. And, and yet, since these are wholesome qualities, the
Buddha praises these qualities, he says these are worth cultivating and that
they are the guardians of the world. So they're not imbued with aversion. They're
not imbued with greed or delusion or aversion. So, and partly what I want
to explore today a little bit is what these might feel like. I'll give a
different translation, one that has been a little easier for me to connect with,
Tanasaro Bhikkhu uses a translation for Hiri for what Bhikkhu Bodhi calls moral
shame or shame. Tanasaro Bhikkhu uses conscience. And that, that resonates for
me in that, you know, if, if I think about, one way I think about Hiri is if I
think about things that have happened to me in the past where I may have done
something wrong, you know, it's like there's a quality or sense of, oh, that
doesn't feel good to have done something wrong, you know, it feels off
to have done something wrong. And it's very close to the quality of shame when
we've done something off. So the quality of Hiri for me feels very similar to
shame, but doesn't have the, the feeling of I'm bad or I'm wrong. It's, it's more
the action was not helpful, you know, so it's got that quality. And to me that the
quality of conscience speaks to that. It's like, my conscience has been tickled.
My conscience is saying, yeah, that wasn't so good. So that's a, that's a
translation for, for Hiri that maybe is a little easier for us to resonate with
conscience. And then for Otapa, the fear of wrongdoing,
Tanasaro Bhikkhu uses the translation concern, you know, concern about the
effects of our action, you know, how we naturally can be concerned about what,
how our actions might affect others. So conscience and concern are, are kind of
alternate ways to think about these ethical guardrails in a way. The, the,
the teachings point to, in a way, the teachings point to the Hiri as being a
sense that it, it either was wrong or is, is not helpful, you know, not
skillful to engage in unwholesome actions. Just, just ethically kind of
innately, intrinsically the feeling of that offness or wrongness to, to cause
harm. And then the, the Otapa is the sense of the, the results, the results of
what might happen, you know, it's kind of the, the concern for the results of what
might happen given that action. So they're just slightly different flavors of
these guardrails. Bhikkhu Bodhi points to these being kind of innate qualities. He
says that the Hiri is an innate sense of shame overdoing something ethically
unhelpful, unwholesome. And I can see, you know, that it might be, there can be a
way that we would naturally have an ethical kind of warning system in a way
because we are naturally empathetic. Our systems are naturally, they naturally kind
of mirror each other. And when somebody experiences something, we can kind of
feel it in our, in our, in our system. And so this natural empathy that's, I think
it's, it's a part of our human system that gets a little bit papered over, that
gets a little bit obscured by delusion, that gets obscured by greed and a
version. But it is there, I think, this, this natural empathetic quality with our
fellow human beings, with our fellow living creatures. And when we have access
to that, when we are in touch with each other in this way with empathy, if we
think about causing harm, we feel, it doesn't feel good to think about it. And
that's because of that empathetic response. And so I think of Hiri in
Ota Pa as connected to the empathetic resonance of the heart with our fellow
human beings. Very akin in a way to the Brahma Viharas, to the qualities of
meta, of compassion, of sympathetic joy, where when we see somebody suffering, our
heart kind of resonates when, when our heart is not constricted with greed or
aversion. When we see somebody suffering, our heart will naturally feel a kind of a
wish to alleviate that suffering. There's an empathetic resonance there. When we
see somebody experiencing joy and delight and our heart is not constricted, we
have an empathetic resonance with that joy and delight. That's the quality of
Mudita, of sympathetic joy. And I think of Hiri in Ota Pa as being the empathetic
resonance when harm is being contemplated or happening. That, that sense of when we
can contemplate doing something that might cause harm. That empathetic
resonance gives us that warning. It's like, yeah, don't do that. That's not
helpful. So that sense of potentially Hiri in Ota Pa being innate in a way, kind
of based on that empathetic resonance, I can see that. I can see that. But the, the
the Suttas also give an analogy for each of these that I find really interesting
and interesting to unpack. I like unpacking the Buddha's analogies. They
give a little bit of like depth to the teachings. So he compares the quality of
Hiri, this conscience or, you know, the sense of, we could call it skilful remorse
also. We could call it something like skilful remorse. He compares that to the
moat around a castle. That it protects the castle from invaders by, you know,
creating this wide and deep thing that surrounds the whole castle. Something
wide and deep that's, you know, filled with water so that it's hard to cross. So
the, the moat is a simile for, for Hiri and the simile for Ota Pa is a patrol
path at the top of a castle. You know, at the top of the castle there's a ledge
where people can walk around and keep their eye out on the surrounding
countryside and see if, if dangerous things are coming. And so that's the
simile for Ota Pa. So in the simile for Hiri, that unpacking that simile a
little bit, thinking about it, I think, you know, a moat is not something innate
with a castle. You know, you really have to work to create that moat. You know, it's
like you have to dig, it's a wide and deep moat. You have to do a lot of work to
make that moat be there to create that protection. And so to me, that speaks of
some work potentially that we need to explore around Hiri. And for me, the way
this has happened and the way it feels resonant to this moat is to reflect back
on things that I have done that were unskillful and feel the sense of the
offness of that. Recognize the offness of that. I had an experience a number of
years ago where I was, you know, I was needing, wanting to get something done
and somebody had asked me to do something and I thought, oh, this will be
easy. I just need to send out an email and I sent out the email and I was doing,
I was, it was, I was a little bit time-pressured and I would did it a
little bit quickly. And, you know, I, but I did not, you know, did not like think
there was anything wrong with what I did at all. But, you know, I just, I sent this
email out and sending that email out had ripple effects that were so massively
painful and difficult. It was kind of like, I felt like by sending that email, I
had dropped a match into a pool of gasoline. And I did not know that that
pool of gasoline was there. And so there was a tremendous amount of regret, a lot
of sense of, wow, I, you know, and I learned a little bit later by, you know,
talking to a few more people that if I had taken some time to check in with a
few people before sending the email, I would have found out the pool of
gasoline was there. You know, so, so, you know, doing it a little quickly, doing it
a little quickly, I, I, you know, missed the opportunity to avoid causing that
harm. And so, you know, a lot of harm, a lot of harm was caused by that, that
email. And it was very painful. And I spent a lot of time feeling into the
feelings around it. And at times it did feel very like shame. There was that
feeling of that, oh, I did this thing. I'm to blame. I'm like, I'm a bad person. And
so there was a very, you know, that sense of shame did come up. And so I was
observing the sense of shame, noticing it, paying attention to it. And then at
times the sense of it's about me fell away. It's, it was like, oh, these are the
conditions. This is what happened. This was a kind of, a series of cause and
effect tumbling's on. And my actions, these actions from this being participated
in the tumbling's on. But, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't, it's not, it wasn't
personal in a way. And so that, that sense of shame, it was interesting. The
sense of shame, it wasn't like it went away. And it was like, it was like, oh
yeah, everything's good now. There was more of the sense of, oh, it really hurts
to have done something that created that much harm. Like, so there was the pain,
that empathetic resonance. That's what the feeling shifted to as the sense of, of
identity around the shame fell away. And so it became much more of a skillful
kind of regret. And I spent some time talking to a whole bunch of people about
the situation and what I could learn from it. And so I learned a lot from that,
from that situation. So that is a kind of a way to explore theory, I think. And for
me, the, the exploration of those, what we might call the near enemy to
theory, we could call our guilt, the near enemy to theory. So exploring those near
enemies, we may, we may feel or recognize the piece of that quality that's all
tied up with I, me, and mine, and I'm a bad person, and I'm to blame. And what
part of it is really the empathetic resonance with, oh, harm has been caused
here. So that's a little bit of a reflection around theory. And for me, the
reflection around theory has come through looking back at things that have
happened. And so to me, that's digging them out. You know, it's like, it's, it's
things have already happened and exploring the, the memories and the
relationship to that. So the, the mind can begin to understand the more wholesome
side of that skillful quality of theory, that the quality of that skillful regret,
that the conscience. The otopah, the analogy for otopah being like a patrol
path, you know, in contrast to the moat, once it's dug, once the moat is dug, you
know, it doesn't take any, any, anybody to monitor the moat, right? I mean, the moat
is there, it's acting, it's protecting just by its very existence. And that to me
is kind of how the reflection on theory feels. It's like, you know, that's, that
those, that recollection of it really feels painful to cause harm. This
experience, it feels painful to reflect back on the harm that has been caused. It,
it hurts to have caused harm. That like is the moat. It's like, I don't have to do
anything. It's the, the memory of that is, is right there. It's right there. So it's
kind of like the moat. The, the patrol path takes somebody actively monitoring the
patrol path, takes somebody looking out over the landscape and seeing, is there
danger coming? And so this is more to me about looking at choices that we're
making. It's like if I had, you know, not been in such a rush in that moment, maybe
Otopa could have said, hmm, you're getting ready to send an email. Maybe it'd be
good to check in with a few people first. You know, that, that could have been
Otopa at work, you know, looking out at, at the, at the landscape. So the, the, to
me, Otopa is kind of thinking about or reflecting on things that we might do,
kind of looking into the future as the patrol path, the person on the patrol
path is looking out into the landscape, out into the world, things that we might
do and, and feeling what might happen if we took that action. So we might
recognize, oh, those would be the consequences if I took that action. And
there, there can be the sense of, ooh, yeah, those consequences. I don't want that
to happen. So there's that, that sense of concern for our fellow human beings, for
ourselves, to not take actions that will cause harm. So this does take a kind of a
reflecting on it. It, it points to, in a way, what the Buddha instructed and his
young son to do, you know, reflect before, during, and after you have acted. Is
this going to cause harm? Is this going to create affliction for yourself or
other or both? And acting, you know, reflecting before you act, that to me is,
is nourishing the quality of Otopa, of the, of the concern for, for ourselves and
others to not cause harm. Reflecting during and after acting, to me, is more
cultivating and supporting the quality of Heery, that, that conscience, that this
did cause harm or this is causing harm. Let me stop so that it's, it's, it's, it's
looking at how are we in relationship to the world and are our actions causing
harm. So that's the, the nourishment of Heery and Otopa, combined with that
empathetic resonance, that empathetic connection with our fellow human beings.
So that's, that's, that's enough for me, I think, and we're almost out of time, but
I'm curious if there's any, any thoughts or comments?
I'm thinking about, that this Heery Otopa, as a, in a quality of the heart, it would
need, it seems like it would need the conditions of someone, the words traumatized,
being numb, if someone's numb, because all these, I'm still thinking about
conditions recently, that how hard it is, and, and that there may be some numbness
happening, and so there isn't that access to those, those qualities right now,
maybe, and maybe it's a precondition for that, perhaps. I think so. I mean, as I
said, you know, greed, aversion, and delusion will kind of block that capacity
to that empathetic resonance. I think our capacity to resonate is, is natural,
the capacity for empathetic resonance is natural, but it's easy to block it, you
know, numbness can do that, anger can do that, hatred can do that, greed can do that,
you know, that, that when we're just thinking about ourselves, conceit, you
know, when we're just thinking about what's good for me, that can block it, and
so, yeah, I mean, that, I think that, that's a lot of what the, the practice is
helping us to do, is to connect again with that, that resonance of the heart, not
just to connect with ourselves, but as we connect with ourselves, we also
naturally begin to connect with others, you know, as we connect with ourselves in
a deeper way, rather than in a familiar habitual way. So, yeah, I think it, it
does, and, and I think we can use that knowledge or recollection or recognition.
I'm not resonating right now. What is this that's here? You know, what is this? Oh,
this is numbness. What does that feel like? And, or, or this is an ache of, of
anger or frustration or fear. That's what's here too. And so, that's a little
bit of a doorway if we can meet those feelings with mindfulness, with, you know,
not with resistance and not with leaning into them, but, oh, this is what it feels
like to be a human being that feels numb. You know, the quality of mindfulness can
resonate with that, which then gives a little bit of that capacity. It opens us
a little bit of that capacity to that capacity for resonating with what's
here.
