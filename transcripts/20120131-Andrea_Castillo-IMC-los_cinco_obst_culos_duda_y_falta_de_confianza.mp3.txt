As I said, doubt and lack of confidence, the fifth. 
But what I want to do, and especially because most of you have not been in each class, is first to make a little review of each one before going to doubt and lack of confidence. 
If you hear a little bit of echo, I'll hear it. 
Do you remember the first obstacle? What we said is the one that is most common and constantly appears in our lives, appears in the first place in many of the lists. 
Sensual desire, sensual desire. 
You will remember that we saw that it covers a whole range of sensual desire, from the most innocent to wanting to sit in a comfortable chair, to wanting to steal or kill someone so that I can achieve the drug I need or want. 
So it's a very extensive range. 
Now, I ask you, having sensual desire is or is not an obstacle? Yes, any sensual desire. 
No, exactly. 
When does it become an obstacle? That's it. 
Any obstacle that arises, if I see it and realize that it's not harmful, that I'm not going to harm anyone, and consciously I do it because there is no problem, it's great. 
I'm not attached to any desire, it's not a problem. 
But if I'm attached or I'm going to harm someone, if I end my desire, it's definitely an obstacle. 
It's important to be clear. 
I also want you to be very clear about how the Dharma relates to the taste of sensual desires. 
First, I want you to be clear about what Dharma is. 
Dharma is Buddhist teachings. 
We're going to use that term a lot. 
Dharma, the teachings. 
So, how does Dharma or Buddhist teachings relate to sensual desires, to the taste of sensual desires? Is there a problem or not? No, exactly. 
I was just going to say, no, of course there's no problem. 
We don't bring anything from asceticism or guilt or anything like that. 
We practice full attention to fully enjoy what we're doing at the moment. 
We listen to music, we dance, we eat good food, but we don't close ourselves to what we have to have, X or Y. 
There's the difference. 
Now, we also bring discernment at the time of desire, if it's something that's able or not able, if it's something that I'm going to bring to the end or not. 
The second of the obstacles, who remembers? It's the opposite, the opposite of sensual desire. 
In sensual desire, I desire something, in the wrong will, I reject something. 
It's expressed physically, even in meditation, clearly. 
When I'm thinking about wanting something, my body moves forward. 
When I'm in meditation with something that I don't want, we tend to, even if it's slightly, move the body back. 
In both cases, the body is not in balance. 
It's out of balance. 
The wrong will in Pali is vyapada, and it's eliminating or causing harm. 
Its motivation is hostility, it manifests itself as wanting to hurt, attack, discard or do something. 
Just like in sensual desire, there's a whole range. 
It can be as subtle as, if you remember, we can use the example of cleaning and cleaning with the Mubra version. 
It would be a bad will, or a version, in the most subtle or the most extreme, to want to attack someone, simply by eye, whatever it is. 
Is it a problem that arises from the wrong will? No, not at all, just like in sensual desire. 
Not because it's part of our life. 
Just like positive things arise, negative things arise. 
Therefore, it's very important that we don't recriminate ourselves when there's bad will, simply there's bad will, but I'm not saying I'm a honest person. 
Does anyone remember what Nivarana means? I mentioned it several times, which is the term pali, which means covering something. 
Nivarana is the term used for the obstacle in pali, and it's interesting that it means covering something. 
That means that with the obstacles, normally, we're covering something that we don't want to look at. 
For example, what am I evading or covering when I focus obsessively on what I don't think is around me, my environment. 
Does anyone have an idea? I'm the kind of person who constantly criticizes what's here, what's there, I don't think this is right, I complain about this, I complain about the other. 
What I'm covering is that in reality, something here with me goes wrong. 
I don't want to face it. 
That's where that term comes from, Nivarana, covering something, covering something. 
Now, the joke when we're aware of this, of the bad will, is in this situation of putting the focus outside, the bad will, I bring the focus of the bad will of the object towards me. 
Instead of focusing on that it's wrong, and look how wrong this person is doing, I bring it and look at how the bad will is operating in me. 
From my body to my mind. 
How does my body feel when I'm under the bad will? What does my mind do when I'm under the bad will? The third obstacle. 
I think we saw it as the last one before the holidays. 
That, laziness and laziness. 
And do you remember that this one also has its logic? Why does it appear in third place? Do you remember that we talk about a certain energy in desire and in rejection? That it works for us as the caffeine of our life. 
And when there is no desire or rejection, we fall into a delay. 
Not always, but many times when there is this absence of desire and rejection, we fall into a delay, that's why it appears in third place. 
I don't know if you remember, but we talk about this. 
What is the difference between laziness and laziness? It has to do with accessing the energy. 
In laziness, our energy is really over. 
If we empty the glass that was filled with water, now it's empty. 
There is no more. 
With the delay, the energy is there, but we are not able to access it. 
We are simply lazy. 
Therefore, we hurt in a very different way with laziness and with the delay. 
And we have to differentiate them to know how I adjust. 
If I'm tired, I have to go to bed. 
I'm going to bed and I sleep for a while. 
But if there is laziness or laziness, what I need to do is to know how I connect with my energy. 
That's what we talk about in class. 
There are several ways. 
Meditation is a way through breathing. 
Through this posture, this posture does wonders. 
This posture of meditation not only gives you well-being, but if there is depression, sitting like this with the chest open, the back to the right, it changes you. 
It gives you the message, the brain, I'm fine, there is dignity, there is tranquility, there is an open heart. 
It is the same with energy. 
If I feel like this, I continue with the energy that is filling me. 
Simply sitting like this can make us connect with the energy. 
I don't know if you remember, because some of you weren't there. 
When we talk about laziness, it has a lot to do with laziness and delay. 
Lazyness is not more than a mind that is not being able to pay attention or focus on what is happening at the moment. 
In reality, there is nothing intrinsically boring in life, but the boringness is everything here. 
Do you remember that I gave you the example, that if you take a child to the supermarket and the child starts, I'm tired, I feel bad, I'm tired, I'm bored. 
And in one of those, you say, do you want an ice cream? And the child suddenly is no longer tired, or his feet hurt, or his stomach hurts. 
And that's what adults do too, just a little more sophisticated. 
That's very interesting, because you realize that everything comes with a mental evaluation. 
If I consider something interesting or exciting, I connect with my energy. 
If I consider it boring, I get bored, and I get energy. 
So it's very interesting to realize. 
The next time you feel bored, try to remember this. 
The fourth obstacle is the one we saw last week. 
Do you remember? What was it? Anxiety, that's it. 
Anxiety and worry. 
As a base, I want you to have a very present mind, that we will always have some reason to worry or to feel anxious. 
The reasons are not missing. 
This is important. 
Do you remember how anxiety can be projected towards the future or the past? When we project it towards the future, it becomes a concern. 
And when we project it towards the past? Sorry? Yes, it's remorse, chronic repentance. 
After we recognize that we did something wrong, we release it. 
But if we don't release it, that's the obstacle. 
If we continue, if we continue, if we continue. 
Why did I do that? I should have done it. 
How terrible. 
There it is. 
It no longer has something positive, it has already become an obstacle. 
It's something chronic. 
Now, let's see if we can remember the ways we can work constructively, with anxiety and worry. 
Starting from the realization that worry and anxiety are nothing more than an agitated mind. 
That's it. 
The agitated mind is anxiety. 
So, they are remembered as very basic, with a word. 
For example, the first is to recognize. 
I recognize that there is anxiety. 
The second is to observe. 
Then I accept. 
Exactly. 
Super important. 
Some more that you can remember. 
Something that I want to mention that came out of the talk with Maricruz is to recognize when it is appropriate to seek professional psychological help. 
Because there is a whole range of anxiety. 
And sometimes we need help. 
We need to recognize that sometimes we need professional help. 
Remember that we mentioned the lifestyle. 
It can also help or increase anxiety. 
Like eating, sleeping, etc. 
We don't need to repeat all of that. 
But another part that I mentioned was to cultivate a stable core. 
I really liked something that John Kabatzin writes in his book. 
It makes a comparison between this stable, harmonious core that we can have. 
And look where I'm putting it. 
This is our stable, harmonious core. 
It makes a comparison of this, a comparison of this that can be agitated. 
The mind that is agitated in comparison with this center, which is our center of gravity, that can give us tranquility. 
It compares it to the sea. 
This part here is the waves. 
The sea is always agitated. 
If you dive 4 or 5 meters down, there is silence. 
And a gentle flow of water. 
Imagine how wonderful it is to be able to connect with this, with this tranquility, the depth. 
And up here, which can also be the outside, if there is movement, we accept it. 
But down here, there is stability. 
Now, I'll read a quote from John Kabatzin about this idea. 
When we concentrate on breathing in our stomach, we tune with a zone of the body that is under the agitations of our mind, which is intrinsically more calm. 
It is a valuable way of restricting calm and inner balance in front of emotional counterattacks, or when we have many things in our heads. 
Ok. 
Up to here for the review. 
Now, the last obstacle, which is doubt and lack of confidence. 
So doubt keeps us in constant vacillation, which prevents us from acting. 
We see ourselves unable to commit ourselves. 
It implies a confused mind, which is unable to glimpse with clarity the option that promotes our well-being and happiness. 
This obstacle, more than all the previous ones, is especially harmful in relation to this practice. 
Because doubt as an obstacle makes us lose confidence in the teachings, or the Dharma in our teachers, and what is worse in ourselves. 
So this leads to abandoning the practice. 
Now, here are two points that made me interesting. 
When I studied this topic, to be able to talk about this, I realized that in the scriptures, both in the scriptures as Gyo, doubt focuses on the practice. 
If you take into account the other obstacles, it was practice and daily life. 
But doubt, in some way, focuses on the practice. 
I mean, I decided that I would do the same. 
However, I want to make an understanding of something that is tremendously important to me. 
This topic has no intention of washing the brain, or convincing, or making proselytism here. 
On the other hand, it is an invitation for you to investigate and learn by yourself what is presented here. 
Each one, each idea has to go through its own filter of doubt. 
And then it is up to you. 
And it is not only taken and brought to one. 
The definition of the word doubt in the Timological Dictionary is very interesting. 
The prefix of doubt comes from doubt, and it implies to be between two things. 
That is, to be between the yes and the no, to choose between this or that, or indecision. 
I also came to mind the expression in English, Straddling the Fence, which is to be mounted close to this way, that you have one leg on one side and the other leg on the other side, and then you do not compromise. 
You stay in both fields and remain undecided. 
Now, it is important to make a difference between two types of doubt. 
The doubt that is obstacle, the one that entorps, that implies vacillation, continuous indecision, and that results in lack of confidence. 
And the doubt that questions, that investigates, that makes us grow, is temporal, that is important, and leads us to wise actions. 
That difference is very important. 
To clarify, an example of doubt as an obstacle, a monologue that we have in mind, would be, for example, five weeks of introduction courses and five weeks now of obstacles, and I continue with the mind that I cannot apply it to the least. 
I am a disaster as a meditator. 
I see that others are sitting with a peace and concentration, and if they could see what happens in my mind, it would be an error. 
I think it should be better to register in a class of weekly Reiki, or maybe a weekly massage would be the best, or maybe not better, a weekly massage. 
And so we go. 
So, in that type of monologue of doubt, not only there is doubt, but there is judgment, we are criticizing, there is lack of confidence, there is impatience, there are high expectations, the feeling that what is worthwhile is always revealed to us, that it is a little beyond, always a little beyond, the not knowing how to put modest goals, that are in our reach, and that they can slowly reinforce our confidence. 
When we doubt our power, we give our power to doubt. 
There is a book, which I highly recommend, which is called El Cultivo de la Tensión Plena de Vante Gunaratana, and he writes, in meditation there is no failure, there are obstacles and difficulties, but unless you completely surrender and give up, there is no possible failure. 
That is good news, I would say. 
Now we are going to see an example of the doubt that questions, that investigates, that is constructive. 
Last week, for example, you will remember that there was a question here in the class about how to handle anxiety, to think if I am anxious, if I stop or continue meditating. 
We had a clarifying discussion, that some took part, we learned thanks to the question, the person who asked has greater clarity, conviction, and also enthusiasm increases to continue practicing. 
In this case, there is a desire to learn, there is energy, clarity, and instead of mining confidence, it increases. 
Our confidence grows when we see ourselves active, becoming the value of asking. 
Although sometimes we do not have clear questions in our minds, I do not know if you have that experience, or that many times you have a little fear of asking because you do not have it totally clear, do not worry. 
Try and among all we clarify the question, but the question is to take the doubt to be able to treat it and to advance a little in our clarity. 
The fact that each idea we adopt has to be able to survive the doubt is an interesting concept, especially here in practice. 
In this practice, it is always asked, question, not just accept. 
So you have to survive the doubt. 
Ideally, the doubt is a temporary suspension of our actions to consider ideas and knowledge. 
It is an invitation to re-capacitate before acting, but then we also have to find the balance because too much re-capacitation paralyzes us, and if we act without re-capacitating for nothing, then we remain living at a very superficial level. 
So how to promote confidence? We all tend to focus on what we cannot do and ignore what we can do. 
That is why it is of great importance to take the time to see this being done well. 
If two or three pairs of breathing were to be aware, now two pairs were to be able to do it. 
Super. 
Tomorrow I will try three. 
Imagine that each day a pair of breathing increases. 
In a month there are already 30. 
That is enough. 
Little by little. 
It is extremely important in this practice. 
Do not know how many people I know that I do not know, I cannot meditate. 
There you are already limited. 
Small steps. 
We are increasing little by little. 
So to finish I want to read the similes that appear in the Buddha's teachings, in which describe the effects that are given when we free ourselves from the obstacles. 
And these are for the five. 
To free ourselves from the sensual desire is to be free from doubts. 
To free oneself from the bad will is to recover from a disease. 
To free oneself from the laziness and the delay is to leave the prison. 
To free oneself from anxiety and concern is to free oneself from slavery. 
And to free oneself from doubt is to survive a dangerous journey through the desert. 
So, recapitulating the same as with other obstacles, having doubts as obstacles is not a personal defect, but a part of our lives. 
It is not necessary to define ourselves by their presence nor to judge ourselves. 
We do not want to be paralyzed by the doubt, but to apply full attention is one of the most effective ways to free ourselves from it and it is a way of helping us act with wisdom and compassion. 
And to finish, I am going to read a quote from someone called Muray, W. 
H. 
Muray, who writes a book called The Expedition of Scorsese to the Himalayas. 
He says, until one is compromised, there is an illusion, the possibility of retreating and constant inefficiency. 
The ignorance of this elemental truth that concerns all the acts of initiative and creation kills innumerable ideas and splendid plans, but when we are compromised with conviction, the providence presents itself to support us. 
A series of events result from this decision, arise in our benefit all kinds of unprecedented incidents, encounters and material assistance that no one could have dreamed of. 
With that, I finish. 
Let's see if there are any questions. 
This is the end of the obstacles. 
Some of you had to come to one or two of the obstacles. 
Yes, I have a question. 
Do you want to ask? I will answer the other ones. 
Is it because of the recording? Oh. 
Sorry. 
Sorry. 
This green one. 
When you mentioned that you have to keep the doubt, how do you reconcile this with what is said in the total delivery of having confidence? To keep, what do you mean to keep the doubt? When it is said that always that something is said, how do you reconcile this when it is said that you have to give up? Because if you give up, you can't have doubt. 
That's how I understand it. 
And the other question is the sensual desire when describing the sensual desire what other type of desire is today? The first question. 
When we talk about doubt as an obstacle, it is something that is chronic, that is constant. 
When we talk about doubt as something constructive, it is something temporal. 
You use doubt to discern, to keep a mind that analyzes, that investigates, and then this checks with me, I understand this, I ask this, I still don't get it clear, and then I understood it and now I progress to the next one. 
Let go. 
That's it. 
Doubt as a process. 
Doubt to take the next step so that I can commit myself. 
Do you get it? Well, there I understand it. 
But when you give up, and I've heard this in some things I've read, that there are people who give up, the teacher, they question absolutely nothing. 
Look, it's also a point again of what point in your process in the field of terrarium Buddhism, there is a very important point that is called stream entry. 
The next week I'll tell you how it is in Spanish. 
This is an event that happens with people who have practiced for many, many years. 
Many, many years. 
When someone has this experience of stream entry, there is no more. 
This doubt. 
There is no doubt at all in the Dharma. 
There is no more vacillation. 
But we have to get to that point first. 
And everyone, I mean, for me, and I'm not saying I've reached stream entry, for me that point where there was no doubt was when I went to my first retreat of 10 days. 
Something happened that I said as if the Pandora's box was opened. 
I can't close it again in my life. 
Something I saw that I knew that living as if this experience had not existed would be false with myself. 
This is explained already. 
I mean, it's something totally personal. 
Now, you said stream entry to the Master and I'm saying stream entry to the teachings. 
In the Terrabada tradition, it is handled a lot that you deliver to the teachings, but not to the Master. 
The Master is a tool to present the teachings. 
And the other question was about the sensual desire. 
When. 
. 
. 
Just to clarify, if it is said that there is sensual desire, to calculate the desire, what other type of desire is there? First, let's define the sensual desire. 
The sensual desire is the one that has to do with any of the senses. 
The smell, the touch, the taste, etc. 
So, but the interesting thing is that in Buddhism, it is added a sixth sense, which is to think, which is the mind. 
So, any experience that you desire, that is connected with thinking, looking, smell, touch, taste, it is sensual desire, point. 
I don't know if I can think of any that does not enter those categories. 
So, why call it sensual desire? Simply desire, then? Or why not simply call desire to any experience? But you cannot define things as sensual, because or, I don't know, or. 
. 
. 
I don't know. 
Could you, for example, wish to reach liberation? A totally noble desire. 
And that desire will serve you to a certain point, because it reaches a point that you have to let go of that desire. 
So, why do we call it sensual? Because it is what most commonly prevents our meditation. 
And that is what obstacles are. 
What obstacles do is try to summarize, give you the essence of five aspects of physical mental states that are given in meditation that prevent you from reaching the depth, the pass, the tranquility. 
Yes? Yes. 
Another question. 
Well, we finished very good moments. 
A little bit after 9 o'clock we started the central Tuesday in a new, tremendously central and essential in Buddhist teachings which are the four true nobles. 
So, I hope to see you all again very well. 
.
