 So thank you, those of you here, for being here this evening for the last sitting. Thank you for being here at the retreat. There are two qualities that I think are extremely significant for this retreat practice that we do that probably are underappreciated. Some people come here and think they're supposed to be mindful every moment or concentrated or something, some more classic idea. But two things that really carry the retreat and really make a huge difference, which I think is found in abundance here. Most people don't think they have it. But the first one is sincerity. There's a lot of sincerity here. You're working with yourself. You're working with the challenges that your own mind has, meeting yourself, and the sincerity to work with your own mind to try to wake up, to be present, to not be caught and swept away by the thoughts and beliefs is phenomenal. Even if you're not very successful, the sincerity to do so, to practice it, is I think what really is valuable. It reconditions the mind, the heart. It really is a powerful thing. And so to measure being here by how successful you are in some meditative way might be missing something that's even more important. And that is the growing capacity, growing maturity in sincerity that comes on retreat. Sincerity meaning to give yourself completely to the practice, to showing up, to working with what you have here. And sincerity is then related to the second quality that I think of. And that is the synonym that I like to have for mindfulness. Sometimes having other words for what we're doing can kind of highlight or shine a light on what we're doing in a new way that if we keep using the word mindfulness all the time, or awareness all the time, it might kind of get stuck in a certain rut of understanding. So another word for me that I like synonym for mindfulness is honesty. And that goes along with sincerity. This is a practice of honesty. To be honest about what's happening here. And that's kind of like the higher order of what we're doing here. Just a radical self honesty. And to value these two things, to be honest and sincerely be honest. Really try to show up for yourself and really name or recognize what this is what's happening. This is how it is. This is my relationship to this experience. This is how I'm feeling right now. Until sincerity and honesty kind of become stronger than self criticism or frustration or anger or greed or fantasy or whatever places your mind goes. And I feel, I'm saying this this evening because the contact I've had here with the retreat today, I do feel an abundant sincerity here. It's a lot of it. It's amazing to feel this. And you know, I'd rather be in this field among all of you than go down to the boardwalk here in Santa Cruz, the amusement park on the beach. I shouldn't have mentioned it. But this is really precious what we have here. And I also, I haven't talked to most of you yet in the retreat mode, but I'm confident that what you're trying to do is to be honest with yourself, with the world. So those two things, and those two things I think make this a, really a place that's safe for ourselves. And I hope that as you go to bed tonight, that you'll take time to appreciate yourself. Maybe you have other ways of appreciating yourself besides the ideas of sincerity and honesty. Or maybe you can appreciate yourself through my eyes. I see a lot of sincerity, a lot of honesty in showing up here. And it's wonderful. And may you kind of reflect on this and think about this as you're falling asleep and put aside any ways in which you're maybe upset with yourself if you are. But spend those last moments before you fall, falling asleep with appreciation and maybe even with gratitude for the efforts you've made today. So thank you very much. And may you sleep well and deeply. And if you can't, maybe you have sincerity and honesty to keep your company through the night. Thank you.
