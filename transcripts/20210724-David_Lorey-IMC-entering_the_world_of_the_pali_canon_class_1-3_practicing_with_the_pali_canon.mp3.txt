 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. What we'd like to do now is do a little practice with the polycannon, which, you know, we want to do this early in our study together, just so we can get a sense of what we're going to do. One among various ways of incorporating these texts and the canon in our practice, in this case in the meditation practice. And one of the reasons for this, and this is clear in the text themselves, is that one of the sort of almost principles of our practice is that the mind and meditation, the still mind that becomes available in meditation, sees clearly the heart that opens up in meditation as one that can open up to the whole world. And so you'll find in the text that frequently the Buddha gives a Dharma talk after a whole day of sitting practice. And you may have noticed that we continue to do this a couple thousand years later. Frequently, we sit in meditation and then we receive a Dharma talk. The mind prepared in a sense the heart opened by the meditation to receive the teachings to make sense of them to see them clearly to understand them in a deeply felt deeply experienced directly experienced way. Among the types of materials that Kim mentioned, along with things like the rules for monastic living, the, the, what would you call them the Dharma talks, right the lectures, the debates of which we have records in the text, the Q&A sessions with the Buddha, or with his disciples, and with meditation instructions. There is throughout these collections, a lot of wonderful poetry. And we're going to share in a few weeks time we're going to we're going to do a class like this three parts, dealing or looking to the awakening poems that Kim pointed to the Terry got on the terror got as a way of finding inspiration and insight in the world. And so I thought we could sit in meditation and I could drop in a few just a few verses from one of these awakening poems. And I'll give you just two pieces of background. One of these one is just that as being mentioned, this is a special day, we didn't plan it this way just happened this way. So full moon day. And the full moon is and moonlight and other aspects of the moon, and the moon and our experience are used in the text as similes as metaphors for various things, including the clear seeing that the mind is capable of. And one of the phrases that's used sometimes is the idea of the full moon released from clouds, like when the moon, the moon breaks through clouds when you're watching in the evening. And we're going to just take a couple verses from a poem by a practitioner who comes to the practice after many years of a checkered career of causing harm in the community. But after an encounter. I should say grievous harm in the community, after an encounter with the Buddha after an encounter with the Buddhist teachings changes their behavior, and is welcomed into the Buddhist community. And I think is provides lovely inspiration for anybody who's ever done harm in their community, which is probably all of us. So let's, let's close our eyes. We're not going to, we're not going to not going to provide lengthy instruction on the meditation practice but let's close our eyes bring ourselves here. Take a deep breath or two to connect with the breath in our body, connect with the central aspect of our lived experience, the breathing in and out. The first, the first foundation of mindfulness that were provided the first instruction on establishing mindfulness and our experience, just connecting with the breath. And as we do so connecting with the qualities of the breath, connecting with the ease the simplicity the balance of the breath. And we can perhaps in our minds I join the scene of a gully mala approaching the Buddha bowing down, venerating the Buddha at the Buddhist feet, and asking the Buddha if after this lifetime of ill behavior. He might be allowed to join the Buddhist, the Buddhist community of practice. And we can see the three verses which I'll drop into this meditative space. One after another with a brief pause to just let them sink in like pebbles in a pond creating ripples in our minds. Whoever among us was heedless previously, and afterwards becomes mindful. Such a person lights up the world like the full moon freed from a cloud. A person whose bad deeds are blocked forever brought to an end by skillful action. He lights up the world like the moon freed from a cloud. Any practitioner devoted to the teachings of the Buddha lights up the world like the moon freed from a cloud. A swifteline and us So the Buddha upon accepting this practitioner into the community of practice reminds him that regardless of unwholesome intentions and unskillful actions in the past, that taking the teachings to heart, devoting oneself to the Buddhist teachings, that wholesome intentions and skillful actions light up the world, our internal world and the world of our interactions with other beings, like the moon freed from a cloud, in a sense is the Buddha's blessing. To which this practitioner responds, practitioner who because of those past actions still has enemies still receives insults and has rocks and projectiles thrown at him, says, may even my enemies hear a Dhamma talk, may even my enemies devote themselves to the Buddhist teaching, may even my enemies hear the Dharma from those who speak of acceptance and practice acceptance and may even my enemies practice accordingly. beset prayer at Grace.
