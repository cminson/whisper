 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, good day everyone. It's nice to see all these names on the chat. Some of you I haven't met, but I've met your name and your greetings many times. And thank you for it. And also, thank you for all those of you who are going to be listening to this later. I think that our community, our meditation community, extends way beyond the people who actually show up here live. And I appreciate so much that there's this wide circles of community that gather around this practice together. So, the topic for today is respect in relationship to the basic mindfulness practice we do. And also this week, the focus is on the body. And so certainly it's valuable to respect the body. And I'll talk more about that during the little talk after this. But for now I want to emphasize that as we attend to the body, as we bring mindfulness to the body, that it's also important to respect the awareness that we're using, the attention, the mindfulness with which we perceive this body, that we're aware of this body, that we recognize the different aspects of the body that we focus on. And so I want to guide you through a little exercise that I've done many times before. Some of you have done it. And even though it's more or less the same exercise, I don't think of it as any different than just sitting down to meditate to focus on the breathing. We've done it before, but we do it again and again for some of us for decades. And so this is an exercise in respecting awareness, or to say it differently, in seeing if we can find an awareness that the attention, a way of being attentive, that's calm, and that it's free of, certainly hurry, but free of extra baggage. So the awareness is very simple and in such a way that we could think of it as being, awareness is very simple, not avoidant or held back, and not coming along with forcefulness or expectations without aversion, without resistance, without just very, very simple. And so the exercise is to guide you through this kind of simplicity that we might be able to do. And then that can be used for attending to the body as different body sensations come along in the meditation practice. So assuming a meditation posture and gently closing the eyes, and then gently taking a few long, slow, deep breaths in, and then with maybe a little longer exhale than usual, let there be a wave of relaxation through your body. And that wave maybe from the top of the head, as you exhale progressively kind of like moves down through the body, just relaxing, softening all the way down to your seat, down your legs even, and then do it again. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And maybe for the next three or four breaths on the exhale, continue with maybe a wave like relaxation moving through your body and then from the head all the way down to the feet. And then to begin this exercise, bring your attention to one of your hands, maybe the right hand. And if your hand is complicated, maybe it's hurt or in pain or arthritis or something, maybe you can find something else that's more neutral, maybe one of your feet or maybe an elbow, something that doesn't have any particular complications with it, pain or discomfort. And then feel the sensations of this place. Feel the sensations of your hand. Feeling the palm of the hand, the back of the hand, the fingers. And feel the simplicity of the sensations there. Simplicity meaning without needing to think about it or remember what it's been in the past or the associations and meanings you attribute to it. Just in the moment now. Maybe there are sensations of touch if your hand is touching something. Maybe there's warmth or coolness. Maybe there is tingling and vibration. Sensations of pressure, of weight, heavy and light. Some sensations might be hard and soft. And letting the awareness recognize or know how the hand experiences itself. In a sense the hand doesn't have a name for itself as the hand. It's just the sensations that it feels. And then notice how you are being aware. Are you perplexed? Are you eager? Are you trying to do this like a school assignment? Trying to do it right? Or are you disinterested or even resisting? All these ways of being have an influence on how we are aware, how we are mindful. Is your awareness pulled back? You're kind of watching or thinking about the hand from the control tower in the head? Are you intimate and close and touch almost like you're in your hand? And can you adjust your awareness so that it's very simple but clearly connected to the sensations of the hand? Maybe letting go of thoughts and ideas. Like you would if you quieted your mind, maybe closed your eyes to listen to a faint sound far away. And then calmly, deliberately, slowly maybe move your awareness to the other hand. And adjust your awareness, your attention, your mindfulness. So it has this little extra baggage, extra attitudes, expectations or aversions, desires. Just feeling the hand, feeling how the hand experiences itself. Respecting your awareness so your awareness can just be as simple and clear as it is when it's alone, when it's not influenced by attitudes, desires, aversions. When awareness is also not under the influence of ideas of self. Ideas that I have to do it right or I'm doing it wrong, I don't understand, I'm doing it great. Just simple awareness of the hand. So awareness, respecting awareness is allowing awareness to do its work without a lot of extra. And then calmly and deliberately bring your attention to some sensation in your body that's uncomfortable or unpleasant. Maybe not dramatically so, but calmly bring attention to it and see if you can be aware of that area of your body in the same way you're aware of your hand. And trying to respect the simplicity of awareness without it coming under the influence of your ideas about the discomfort, your aversion, your desires. And instead letting your mindfulness feel, know how that part of your body experiences itself. As if it's allowed to be just the way it is. Even discomfort is allowed permission to be there in this simple awareness. If there is impatience or worry or aversion, maybe on the next exhale you can relax that even for just for a few moments. Relaxing the reactivity and for a few moments just feeling the area where the discomfort is to feel the particularity of the sensations there. The pulsing vibration, pulling pressure, tightness. And then I'll ask you to move your attention one more time. And this time connect to your awareness, your attention, to see if again you can move it calmly, deliberately, simply. So this simple awareness now moves to experience that part of your body where you accompany your breathing. Feeling the area of your body where breathing is, where you feel your breathing, your body is, your breathing, your body breathing. Allow yourself to be aware simply of the sensations that come into play as you breathe. Maybe every breath is like a windshield wiper that moves aside any extra attitude that complicates awareness. Any wanting or not wanting judgments. So like the windshield becomes for a moment clear. So the awareness becomes clear. Clearly aware of just the breathing.
