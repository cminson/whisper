One of the key elements of mindfulness practice is 
recognition  – this simple recognition of what’s 
happening as it’s happening.  Recognition is the 
noticing, clear seeing, and knowing what it is that’s 
happening. You can be present – resting in the present 
– which is quite nice. But there might not be much 
clarity about what’s actually happening.  
 
As it gets more settled  and relaxed, at some point the 
clarity factor – the recognition factor – gets stronger. 
We’re clearly recognizing , “Oh, that’s a thought. I’m 
thinking.” As opposed to letting the thoughts flow along, 
happily, merrily on their own. We’re kind of in it, or we’re 
completely in it, and we don’t really recognize that we’re 
thinking so much , because what we’re thinking about is 
so captivating.   
 
At some point the act of mindfulness is this clear 
recognition: “ Oh, look at that, I’m thinking. That’s  what’s 
happening.” That moment of recognition – that act of 
recognition – is a kind of stepping away , getting some 
distance from it, or getting an overview.  Where you’re 
not really stuck in it or involved in it. It’s l ike the recognition is here, in one place, and the thinking is 
somewhere else. In doing that, we tend not to be as 
identified with the thinking. We don’t define ourselves in 
it; we don’t live in it as strongly.  There’s a freedom to be 
found in that clear r ecognition. There’s a strong 
emotion.  
 
We can be flowing along in it, but what we’re looking for 
is that place of clear recognition: “ Ah, this is what’s 
happening.” It’s not a denial. It’s not an aversion to 
what’s happening. It’s being very respectful of  what’s 
happening, and respectful of oneself because of this 
clarity of recognition. The uniqueness, the specialness, 
of this thing. As a result of that, the relationship we have 
with it tends not to be so sticky.  It’s like unsticking 
ourselves from it thr ough the power of recognition.  
 
Whether it’s a thought, a feeling, a desire, an aversion, 
a sound, or body sensations, there’s something very 
magical and special about the human capacity to have 
clear recognition: “ Ah, this is happening. This is 
happening .” 
 
As you practice today, you might see if you can discover 
the treasure, or the magic, of recognition . See if you can 
discover the treasure, or the magic, of recognition – the 
clear knowing of, “That’s this, or that.” See if you can 
identify or recognize the place from which you do 
recognizing. It’s almost like the acti vity of recognizing can be known in a way that’s satisfying. You might 
experiment, look, see what you can find about your 
capacity to recognize. I hope you enjoy the morning.
