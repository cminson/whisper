 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDarma.org. I feel quite fortunate to be able to spend this morning sitting with you and practicing Dharma and explore Dharma. So today we will continue our discussion around Sila. And we're going to speak about the fourth precept, which is to undertake training of abstaining from false speech. I wanted to expand this a little bit because clearly in our modern day societies, speech has kind of broadened out a lot more, right, with many different modalities with internet, social media, emails, lots of different devices that we use. It's not the same as 2,500 years ago, where verbal exchange is mostly the only way to explore the aspect of a communication. And now we have so many modalities that we're engaging in communicating, exchanging information. So this precept in our day and life now, I would expand that to include all of these modalities. So we're undertaking the training to abstain from false communication, or lying through all these different ways, or propagate misinformation, miscommunication. And this is under this training precept for our day and life here as well. And so again, I wanted to explore this from the dimensions of awareness and abstinence and alignment. And this is a AAA framework we've been talking about. All right, instead of speaking about lies or lying, today I wanted to start with truth, staying true, dedicating ourselves to truth in our guided meditation. I guided briefly for us to tune in to the truth of our experience, as we cultivate mindful awareness. We can become sensitive to our own heart and mind and body. And we can begin to notice what is true, what is the felt sense of truth within us, and what is the felt sense of not being truthful. And so for me, the felt sense of truth has some sense of alignment in my body, heart and mind, that my body, heart and mind are in harmony with each other, not like one wants to go one direction, the other one goes to another direction. And cultivating clear awareness is very important for us to begin to know what's true and what is untrue. Without cultivation of a clear awareness, often the state of evolution might cover up what might be true. So for me, I'm kind of very aware of a certain conditioning I have. I'm an Asian American, and sometimes I would notice that when I'm in a group with other people, with people with other kind of cultures that I'm not familiar with, and if I'm the only person who's not in that kind of culture, dominant culture in the group, when people say things, and that it feels like everybody also knows what they're saying, they're laughing, they're nodding, but here I am, I don't know, I have no clue what they're talking about, because I didn't grow up with this kind of culture that the group is expressing. And so there are moments that I would notice, but would I not, as if I know, or not. And so for me, this is a learning, I learned that when I actually not pretending that I know, there's something off inside of me, something not aligned inside of me. And so I learned in situations like this, to not give in to the tendency of simply following along, pretending, or maybe feeling embarrassed if you know I don't know something that everybody on, everybody else seems to know. And so there can be all this little kind of something going on that pulls us out of staying true to what we know and what we don't know. And so for me, I learned that it's okay to say I don't know. And in fact, many times the people are very happy to tell me what they know and I learned something new. And so, rather than carrying on the burden of this alignment in our heart and mind and our bodies, when we really tune in to our inner being in situations and began to discern this kind of alignment in us, we can become clear. And we can practice this precept with a lot of lightness in our bodies and heart. And I don't know if you notice this, if you observe little kids, especially for some, maybe when they're quite young, if they tell deliberate lies, sometimes you see that something is kind of off in them. They're not quite themselves. And in the same way, and that may be true for adults as well. And so this cultivation of awareness is to begin to get to know this felt sense of truth, truthfulness, and a felt sense of untruth, dishonest. And when we can stay connected with that sense of truth, we can then trust more and more what flows out of that place, our words and our actions. And there is a teaching in the Majmanikaya Sutra, MN 61, and that again is another sutra that the Buddha taught his son, Rahula. And this is the one, Rahula was about seven year old, a very young monk, apparently had had made a deliberate mind. And so the Buddha decided to give him a teaching. And I'm not going to go through the entire teaching here, but the Buddha ended a section of the teaching to Rahula by saying this. And he said, Rahula, when one is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no evil I say that one will not do. Therefore, Rahula, you should train thus, I will not utter a falsehood, even as a joke. That's quite a strong statement to a young kid, right? And so for me, it kind of made me pause just to reflect. But what is Buddha pointing at here? What does it mean to tell a deliberate lie without feeling ashamed of? So it just kind of take a few moment to pause just right there. What might this be pointing towards? For me, there was a vivid image of piling mud on top of thick mud. It's kind of layers of the delusions piling up. And the first thick layer of mud is the deliberate lies. And then not having moral conscience, it's kind of like a piling another thick layer on top. Now the truth is really far away. It's hard to get access to. And so I wanted to just see a few words about this having conscience. I do know, oh, no, then I may have an engagement action that wasn't wholesome. And this having a moral conscience in the classic teachings is essential to be the guardians of our heart and mind. So we can reflect about the consequences of unskillful actions and speech, communications. And then we can begin to have a choice moving forward from this point on. Without this moral conscience, without something that we feel in our heart that isn't aligned, it's pretty hopeless, right? Imagine that, can you imagine in the world where people will behave and behave in unwholesome, harmful ways, but there's no protection of some form of moral conscience? I have a hard time imagining living in a world like that. And so this having the moral conscience to know, and this moral conscience also have a dimension of care and wisdom in it. Knowing, oh, this wasn't skillful. And now I'm going to make a different choice now. And so now we have an opportunity to train our heart and mind in a different orientation. And so I also wanted to kind of go back to the importance of staying true, because lies break trust amongst human beings, lies break our own inner integrity. And so we human beings live our lives. We depend on trusting, some level of trusting of each other, right? So when we can really have that deep trust for our own actions and speech and our activities, and we can trust others. There is so much safety in us, so much well-being that can come from it. And so because of this, it's important to undertake this training precept, to abstain from false speech and false communication. And then we align, we align ourselves with truth. And we cultivate wise, skillful speech that are kind, unifying, beneficial, conducive for creating safety and trust. And so I'll end by quoting again this monk sutra, sutra for blessings. And it has this few lines, speaking to this, it says, education and the craft, discipline and training, and well-spoken speech. This is the highest blessing. May we all continue our journey of a practice. May our practice benefit all beings. And thank you all for being here today. And I'll see you tomorrow. Have a wonderful rest of the day, wherever you are.
