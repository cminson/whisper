Dharmette : Self-referential Thinking  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

I’d like to read you one of the stori es in my little book , if I 
may: 
One evening the Abbess declared that the next 
day every monk a nd nun was prohibited from using 
the words “I, me, mine and myself” unless it was 
required for answering a direct question from 
someone else.  
The next morning was chaotic. Feeling as if they 
were learning to walk all over again, the monastics 
kept tripping  over their words and stumbling in all 
their interpersonal interactions.  
By the afternoon some were humbled, confused 
and dismayed to learn how frequently their impulses 
to speak as well as their thinking were self -
referential.  
By the evening , the predom inant atmosphere in 
the monastery was one of relief as the monks and 
nuns realized  that they had survived an entire day 
without initiating any self -focused discussion .  
And as they laid themselves down to sleep, each 
person was amazed  at how clear and at e ase their 
mind had  become.  
 When  I wrote this story , I was inspired by my 
experience of being in a Zen monastery in Japan . I 
knew a little bit of Japanese when I started there, but 
not much. I ha d some Japanese language books that I 
was trying to study . But o nce I was in the monastery , I 
focused not so much on reading the language books , 
but rather I plunged in with whatever Japanese I knew , 
and tried to speak with the other monks. After a while i t 
became very clear that I spoke Japanese like an 
American would speak English , and  they spoke 
Japanese like they were Japanese, of course. The big 
difference is that in Japanese you almost never use 
personal pronouns , because they are understood by the  
context. So if I want to say, “We’re going to go ,” in 
Japanese I would just say , “Going” . I wouldn’t say “we” 
because the context of we is understood . And in order 
to say,  “Now it is  time for me to speak  or to give a talk ,” 
in Japanese  I would say , “Now is the time for the talk.”  
 
Because  my Japanese wasn’t very good , I would start 
pretty much every sentence with the word “I.” The 
Japanese word for “I” is a three -syllable  word that 
requires a preposition after it. So you need to say four 
syllables for “I,” which in Japanese is  “watashi wa. ” So I 
would start all my sentences with “watashi wa, ” and 
literally I’m saying “as for me. ” After a  while what I was 
doing  stood out,  and I saw how different it was from how 
everybody el se in the monastery  spoke . They never 
said, “as for me , me, or I” because that was understood  in the context . It didn’t feel comfortable. It felt like it 
wasn’t necessary. It was like all this focus on me.  
 
In English when we speak , we often use the word “I” 
very innocently. It comes off our tongues easily. We 
tend to use pronouns much more  because that’s how 
English is set up  grammatically . You state the subject of 
the sentence . But in Japanese the subject of the 
sentence is often implied or assumed. So in Japan I 
became  conscious of how often I spoke that way . I 
became conscious of : “Why is it so important to say 
things in reference to myself ? What I think? W hat I 
believe?  What my experience is ? What  I want? ” I saw 
how often the way I was talking  – and more importantly 
how I was thinking  – was self -referential. It was 
humbling , and I was shocked to see it all.  
 
It’s one thing to see it , but it’s something else to change 
it. There were  two things that helped  a lot to lessen the 
degree of self -referential focus in my mind. One was in 
essence to see how uncomfortable it was to think that 
way. T here’s a kind of stress, strain or agitation that 
comes with a fair amount of this self -referential thinking . 
“What’s i n it for me? I need to make myself safe. I need 
to prove myself. I need to plan ahead. I need to do this 
and that. ” If you really pay attention, you can see the 
strain of that , or how uncomfortable it is to do that. 
When I started seeing how uncomfortable it was, it 
became easier to want to let go of it. I couldn’t necessarily let go of it automatically, but this certainly it 
made it a lot easier. Who would want to do this? Who 
would want to keep irritating themselves?  
 
The other thing that really helped was to begin having a 
sense of well-being  that was an alternative to thinking 
about myself , planning around myself, building  myself 
up, and proving myself to others. A lot of my thoughts 
were self -apolo getic. I tried to defend myself  and 
explain why  I was okay to eve ryone , at least in my mind. 
But as I started to feel a sense of well-being  inside, that 
wasn’t needed anymore. The sense of well-being  was a 
place to rest , and was a reference point for how to be. 
For me t he sense of well-being  arose very  directly in 
connection to meditation. Meditating was the way I 
discovered experiences  of well-being  and peace , which 
previously I had had very little experience of. I had 
certainly  not experienced this in any way that I could tap 
into it regularly. As I got more settled, concentrated and 
calm  through meditation , this sense of inner peace  and 
well-being  became an important reference point for me. 
Then  it was easier to not go  into those kind of self -
referential thoughts as much.  
 
I still re fer to myself regularly enough , like I’m doing 
right now . Some of it I hope is just an innocent way of 
communicating. If I look at how I use the word “I,” I still 
see sometimes that there are  things I need to work on or practice with – how I’m caught by ce rtain identities, 
ways of being seen , or trying to get something I want.   
 
Tuning  into the word s “I, me, myself and mine ” has 
proven to be a very useful window into seeing 
something important within me. Probably , this may be 
true for many of you as well. I think that for many 
people , one of the primary forms of suffering arises out 
of all the self -referential ways in which w e think. More 
often than not , we take it for granted. They say a fish 
doesn’t  see the water it swims in. Human beings don’t 
see the self that drowns in all those thoughts [ laughter ]. 
So turning around and looking at that , and becoming 
conscious of it can be very educational and helpful , I 
believe.  
 
You might use this monastery example where the 
monks and nuns were told not to use the word s “I, me, 
myself and mine ” for one whole day. Y ou might see if in 
some appropriate context , you can experiment with that 
and actually do that as a practice. Unless  someone 
asks you a direct question that requires you to use 
those words , don't initiate a conversation with the words 
“I, me, myself and mi ne.” If it’s not really necessary 
don’t use them  at all. But don’t be so weird that people 
think you’re weird  – like, “What’s going on with you, 
you’re sounding weird. ” Hopefully no one else will notice 
you’re doing this. If  you start making these convolut ed 
grammatical sentences , “As for this person here  is arising within the mind a certain kind  of thought ” 
[laughter] . They’ll get sick of you really quickly. Talk 
normally . 
 
So within reason, try it for a day : avoiding the use of “I, 
me, myself and mine. ” See what that teaches you about 
yourself. See what it teaches about the impulse to use 
those words, where it comes from, and why you say 
these words . Chances are you’ll learn a lot about 
yourself from that process . And it would be great if you 
learn  something about an alternative to coming from “I, 
me, myself and mine. ” So have fun. Perhaps from that 
experiment, at the end of the day you’ll feel surprisingly 
clear and relaxed as you go to sleep .
