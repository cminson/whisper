 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone, welcome. Welcome to the start of a new week and a new series. This week's topic will be compassion following last week's topic on love. In preparation for talking about that, this guided meditation, I would like to make the point that the best forms of compassion arise out of being well settled in awareness, well settled in being mindful, that it's important not to have compassion in the lead, but rather compassion is awareness in the lead or awareness is the boat that compassion rides. And if we, if compassion is in the lead by swimming, it's a lot of work to keep swimming. There's not much ability to do much else, but if compassion is supported by awareness, then compassion can come to a kind of fullness. So awareness first and then compassion. And so we're here we are to meditate before this topic of compassion. So we have mindfulness first, awareness first. And perhaps to maybe interest you in your meditation, your awareness for this meditation. So you're curious like what is this? And maybe even a little bit of awe of this capacity you have to be aware. The question is how is awareness? What is about the nature of awareness? What's the quality, the properties of awareness? What are the benefits of awareness? That makes it a good support for compassion. Don't think about this so much, but enter into the world of mindfulness, the world of awareness, really stay close to it. And in the process of it, you might discover some of the answers to this. Maybe you'll discover it after the meditation. So assuming a meditative posture, and as I like to say lately is that it's a posture that is unobstructed, that nothing within us is crunched up or blocked or held in check. It's a posture that allows a feeling of openness in the body. And it's a posture that allows for a deeper relaxation. And the combination of unobstructed flow of life within us, and a deep relaxation go hand in hand. That which flows unobstructedly the way they were animated is what brings wakefulness, alertness, relaxation keeps everything calm, non-reactive, quiet. And together they make a wonderful partnership. Gently closing your eyes and feeling, sensing this posture of yours, this body of yours. As if all you need to do is to discover how it is right now. No need to judge it or be disappointed or try to fix it. Just become aware of this body. And awareness borders on being permissive. Just allowing it to be there and you discovering. And then to take some gentle deep breaths, maybe three quarters as deep as you can breathe. And exhaling longer than you normally would. Maybe a quarter longer than usual. As you exhale longer exhale, let there be a quieting of the thinking mind. Especially as you get to the end of the exhale. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And to continue relaxing the body. Maybe with each exhale. And then letting yourself breathe normally. And settling yourself into breathing. Almost as if your whole body can settle into the sensations of your body breathing. The movements of the body, the expansions and contractions. Maybe even settling into the belly. Soft belly. Where the softness of the belly varies as you breathe in and breathe out. And then sitting here quietly, aware of your present moment experience. Aware in a kind of silent way. Without discursive thought. Without conversations in your head or story images with your eyes. And you're aware of it all, including the thinking. Awareness that's independent of everything. It knows, it's mindful. Without being for or against. Without being identified or defined by what it's aware of. Without being identified. Without being identified. Without being identified. Without being identified. Without being identified. Without being identified. Without being identified. Mindful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Not thoughtful. Still quiet with the eyes closed. What has happened to you in the course of the meditation? Are you a little calmer? Do you feel more aware or sensitive to your experience here and now? Might you be a bit softer. For you to be kinder. Might you be more aware than usual of how involved you are in thinking and reacting to things. Whatever way you are, it's okay, but is there a way that how you are now can be a support for compassion? Compassion for yourself, compassion for others. Is there any way that you can build on how you are at the end of the meditation? To have more compassion for yourself, for the world. Both on its own, in some way that we consciously use the meditative experience. To support compassion. And then coming to the end of the sitting, to open your hearts, your minds to the world around you. And to consider how you can live this day with greater kindness and greater compassion, greater care for others. May it be that this meditation we've done today serves for the welfare and happiness of others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
