So, hello everyone and welcome to this final talk about the seven factors of compassion.
And we've been talking about compassion for some time, two weeks ago and now this week.
And one of the things I will try to convey is that there are many characteristics of compassion
or many supportive conditions that come together in order to have a healthy form of compassion
that maybe many people don't realize that if people have a capacity to feel compassion
they might just kind of assume that whatever way they happen to feel compassion is the way to experience it.
And it might be that in doing so having just one way that it might be a good way sometimes
but it might not be universally about the useful if, for example, the suffering of the world
kind of touches wounds that we have or insecurities we have.
If the being present for the suffering of the world frightens us
or distresses us or depresses us that all those things can happen
and if that's mixed up or entangled with the compassion
then the compassion is not, you know, is being kind of influenced by it
or the compassion might not be the most healthy way to be in the world
and to learn to bring in these other qualities to bear on compassion
and to have them included is a protection from the suffering of the world
harming us and causing us to be exhausted and fatigued and troubled and depressed.
It kind of keeps us fluid, keeps us open, keeps us kind of transparent in a certain way to the suffering of the world.
So the suffering of the world it doesn't land on the places we're holding on to a sense of self
or protecting a sense of self or asserting a sense of self
or the ways that we want to see ourselves or know ourselves.
And so sometimes it doesn't get interfered with our desires and our animosities.
And so to begin appreciating that these different characteristic qualities
that can come along with compassion, so for example that there's awareness that can come along,
mindfulness that can come along, that there is a sense of investigation
of really seeing the distinction between being present for suffering
in ways that cause harm to ourselves, limit ourselves, causes us suffering
in ways that being present with it is more opening and freeing.
To really feel that and see what's happening inside as we meet suffering,
to be able to make effort, to be able to choose the fork, the path of less suffering,
less strain, less tension, that the path of creating more space, more peace,
more openness around the capacity to meet suffering.
To appreciate that compassion can come with a sweetness.
In fact, if there's something that feels sweet or feels a rightness in it,
then probably the compassion is mixed up with things which are unnecessary.
And then we go back to the awareness practice to really see what's going on here
and back to making the distinction, seeing clearly the two paths
of what's leading us to feel stressed and what's leading us away from that.
And then choosing it, acting on one, living in one that's more beneficial.
And then compassion can have a tranquility for it.
And so if we're compassionate and we feel agitated, restless,
that's, you know, it's very easy to have that happen.
But to know that then the compassion is not going to be so clean or so spacious
or then we're more vulnerable to some of the kind of undermining ways
that we can be impacted by suffering if we're agitated.
And then the samadhi factor, a sense of being really at home,
stable, unified, centered in this bubble of compassion, of care, love.
It's kind of like our home. We feel like we're home with it.
As opposed to something that we should do or have to kind of gear up
you know, tense up to try to have it or constantly being distracted from it.
And then finally, today, the equanimity factor of compassion.
And sometimes it's hard for people to appreciate that compassion and equanimity can come together.
It can be a very strong kind of feeling or idea that we have to,
we're supposed to be distressed, we're supposed to be upset,
we're supposed to feel the suffering of the world in a way that we suffer as well.
And if we don't feel it that way and suffer, then we're not really connected to it.
But in fact, we don't have to feel the suffering of the world, the same suffering of the world.
The feeling or sensing the suffering of others is a kind of a loving recognition.
It's sensing without suffering. We're not suffering with them.
Then it's a kind of, I don't know if there's any hope then,
but it is feeling them, knowing them fully.
So there's a kind of accompanying, a kind of recognition,
a kind of sense of capacity of caring and accompanying and respecting others,
but without us suffering as well.
And equanimity is part of that heart of compassion,
the capacity to be untroubled or unagitated or non-reactive
in the encounter with suffering.
And for some people, hearing that, it can seem like,
and then the compassion isn't aloof or indifferent.
But in fact, it's the opposite.
The ability to have compassion have lots of breathing room for suffering,
lots of space for it without clamping down,
without creating limits and contractions and tightness and awareness
actually allows us to be more fully present, to be more sensitive,
to be more sensing and intuitive and attuned to other people.
So one of the meanings of equanimity is a very satisfying,
kind of peaceful, non-reactivity of the mind.
And I say satisfying and peaceful because non-reactivity by itself
can be kind of an indifference or disassociation or something,
like not caring, or kind of closing down neutrality.
But this is not a neutral state.
It's very satisfying, it's very, it's peaceful,
and it's available to be present for things.
And it's not reactive.
And it's such a delightful, kind of medicine relief,
joy for the mind to feel like the mind is not being hijacked by reactivity.
It's kind of like when we're no longer being having a reactive mind,
they can finally say, oh, now I'm home.
Now, you know, now I'm more fully myself.
Now this is a healthy state that we have a very reactive, agitated mind.
It doesn't really feel like, if you don't know anything else,
it might feel like that's who we are.
But the equanimity is more like, oh, now I am who I am.
It's that satisfying.
So these seven factors of compassion are reference points
for understanding the full potential and the full beauty
and the full strength of compassion.
And so to have this as a kind of list to kind of refer back to
when you're encountering suffering and feeling compassion and care for it
and bringing along mindfulness in the middle of it.
Don't forget to be mindful.
Or recognize that mindfulness is coming along.
Sense them.
Recognize how being careful about where the suffering is,
the freedom of suffering is, is the movement of compassion.
And effort and joy and tranquility and samadhi and equanimity,
they're part of the reason why it's such a beautiful thing, reference point.
And sometimes practice is to bring this along with compassion,
is that when compassion is strongest and most healthy and most, I don't know,
itself clean, these seven factors of compassion come along with them
effortlessly.
We don't have to practice them.
They're just there.
And so if they're not there, then, you know, then we know where to work.
We know what to explore and practice with so we can evoke
or release this natural capacity of compassion to have these seven beautiful qualities.
So it's a kind of a life work to explore this.
It's not something that we can expect to do overnight or do well all the time.
But rather compassion is a wonderful mirror for ourselves to see ourselves better
and see where we get hung up, see where we limit the mind,
limit awareness to some more contracted state.
And, you know, it's a lifetime exploration
and the idea of spending a lifetime on the journey of discovering
and practicing and enacting and living by compassion.
It's a great journey.
It's a great adventure.
It's a great kind of valuable treasure.
It's a gift we do to ourselves and a gift we do to others.
So may compassion be a heightened, these talks this week, may give you a heightened appreciation,
maybe even love for compassion as it does a heightened appreciation
and love for people, maybe all people that you meet.
So thank you very, very much.
And then I have some announcements.
There's three announcements about the upcoming 7 a.m. YouTube program here
and a program at IMC tomorrow
and then a community meeting we have at IMC online on Sunday.
So first, I'll be away for the next couple of weeks
and then I'll be away for a couple of weeks in May
and then I'm going on a self-retreat in June.
I'm going to do a month-long retreat in a cabin somewhere.
And so, you know, a good part of the next, I guess, 10 weeks or so, I'll be away.
And we have wonderful guest teachers coming.
I think they're all people who have taught here before on the YouTube.
And it'd be nice if you would remember to support them a little bit as they teach.
That kind of enriches the whole community in many ways.
The other thing is, so tomorrow, for those people who live close enough to IMC,
the Earth Care Committee at IMC is having a redwood...
The redwood city has a creek kind of running through it that goes down to the bay
and there's going to be a creek cleaning morning from 8.30 to 12.
And the city is organizing, but the Earth Care is going as a group to go and participate in that.
And if you're close enough and like to do that, you can look at the IMC website
under What's New and there's a description and there's also a little sign-up you can do if you want.
And the IMC members who are organizing it are Ram Apalaraju and Hilary Boris.
They'll be there and they're wonderful people and it should be a nice time.
Then Sunday at 11 o'clock here in California, we have an online community meeting
for anybody who's part of the IMC community or feels part of it or like to be part of it
or just simply wants to learn a little bit about what's happening at IMC
and the state of the Union for IMC and what's happening as we come out of the pandemic
and some of the issues around COVID here and how they're shifting
and some of the ideas as far as we go forward from here.
So I'll be hosting it and the Zoom link is, right now it's available on the What's New
homepage for IMC's website where it's there as a little announcement
and also on the IMC calendar for Sunday at 11 o'clock California time.
So I hope you come. I'd love to see you there
or participate with that kind of event.
Thank you all very much.
