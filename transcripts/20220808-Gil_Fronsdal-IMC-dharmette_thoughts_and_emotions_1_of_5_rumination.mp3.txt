So, good day everyone. 
Being Monday, we begin a new theme for the week. 
And I'd like to somehow continue with a theme, a general theme of emotions. 
It's in the background or the backdrop for what this theme is. 
And now, so the theme is going to be thinking and emotions. 
The relationship between our emotional life and our thinking life. 
Thoughts and emotions go hand in hand. 
And sometimes I've noticed, maybe it myself and in people I've talked to, a very strong division between emotions and thinking. 
Sometimes preferring one over the other. 
But the more that I've meditated, the more I can't really separate them out completely from each other. 
That they come together as a piece. 
Sometimes one stands out more strongly than the other. 
And sometimes one seems to be the catalyst for the other. 
Sometimes thoughts evoke emotions. 
Sometimes emotions arise, who knows why? And in their wake, there come certain thoughts. 
Sometimes emotions that we have are somehow fueling. 
The thoughts we have are fueling the thoughts that we have. 
Sometimes the emotions we have are giving energy to the thoughts that we have. 
So to really be able to kind of get a handle and learn how to be really mindful of the whole process of thinking, of emotions or emotional life, it really helps to take stock of this thinking world and start seeing the connection between the two. 
And today I want to emphasize the idea that you would study this for yourself. 
That you would begin during this week to really take care to notice, as you're thinking, what role, what relationship, what impact does that thinking have on your emotional life? And what, in return, what impact or role does your emotions have on the thoughts that you have? And for today I want to talk about one particular kinds of thinking that are very important for some of us to be mindful of. 
And that is rumination. 
And I just love this word rumination because of its bovine kind of reference that cows eat all this grass and they regurgitate the grass and then chew it. 
And so we take and regurgitate these stories, ideas, fantasies, all kinds of things and then we chew on it and chew on it. 
And this rumination is kind of thoughts turning in on themselves so that there's kind of a black hole or kind of trapped in them. 
And it's often very repetitive, repeating the same kinds of thoughts over and over again. 
And not just kind of an ideal daydreaming, but rumination is really chewing on something. 
It's really kind of working something or driving something home. 
Usually it's not very healthy for us. 
That's at least how I kind of used the term. 
Maybe there's other perfectly legitimate ways of using the word rumination. 
But the idea that we're spinning around, we're caught up in certain thoughts and this idea of being caught in thoughts and spinning over and over again is so powerful that psychotherapists will point out that one of the leading correlates or maybe even causes for depression or is, for many people, not everyone, is rumination. 
So how that works is we're telling ourselves a story about how terrible things are or how frightening and maybe telling ourselves how, you know, having self-pity thoughts or discouraging thoughts, depressing thoughts, that things are too hard or terrible things are happening to me. 
Terrible things do happen to people, but there's a ruminating about it over and over again. 
That's a very distinct way in which we become a victim. 
We become a victim of our own thinking, their own loops we're in. 
And it might be true, for example, it might be true that I am a. 
. 
. 
maybe there are certain ways in my life that I'm a careless person. 
And so it might be true. 
And the other day I spilled some coffee on the kitchen floor and didn't notice it and my wife, you know, pointed it out and she cleaned it up. 
So there's ways in which I'm a careless person. 
And so I can notice that and say, yes, guilt, you were careless today. 
Sometimes you're a careless person. 
And that's it. 
Or it's like, guilt. 
You're a careless person. 
People are telling you that this is bad to be a careless person. 
You're a mindfulness teacher, so you should really know how to be careful and be attentive and not be careless. 
And it's very important that now all these people know that you're careless and now it's really bad that, you know, I'm such a bad person. 
I'm a careless person and it really speaks badly for 40, 50 years of Buddhist training. 
And, you know, I'm really, you know, this really casts a very bad light on myself and who I am and my practice and my dedication that I should be a careless person. 
So I should stop now. 
I'm sure you're getting tired already. 
And so the idea being that I'm kind of like digging myself a grave. 
I'm kind of like each of those little, it's like a nail in the coffin. 
Like, oh, I'm so terrible. 
I'm so terrible. 
I'm so terrible. 
I'm so terrible. 
And maybe it's like, you know, each one maybe doesn't have a big impact on me. 
But the continuity of repetition of it just begins to wear me down and kind of drain me and take things out. 
So that's what I kind of, what I'm referring to as rumination, is kind of wearing down the same message over and over and over again. 
It might not be so conscious that it's thinking because it might be more of an almost like an attitude, like an emotion. 
But it is a belief. 
It is an idea that we have. 
And we're kind of repeating it so often in the negative quality of it is draining us. 
So the emphasis I want to make that is in case there's some truth to the statement. 
Say it once. 
Learn from it. 
Do a course correction the best you can. 
But there's no reason, there's no requirement as human being to repeat the same thought about yourself over and over and over again. 
Now it's very hard to stop doing that, of course. 
But one of the ways to change the direction of all this is start being cognizant that this is working. 
Recognize how repetitive your mind is. 
Recognize that you're kind of telling yourself the same story, the same message over and over again. 
And notice the impact. 
How is this affecting your energy level, your inspiration level? What emotions does it bring? Does it bring fear? And how does it affect your body? Some people who have very somatic based bodies, life, will concede that as they have certain thoughts that their body begins to shift and change, certain muscles tighten up. 
And, you know, energies in the body shift and change. 
And so to have thoughts about some frightening thing happen, fantasy of frightening things happening, and fear feelings in the body are triggered. 
Have thoughts of desire and ruminate about desire and sexual fantasies and other sensations in the body get aroused. 
Have fantasies and repetition about all the wrongs that have been done. 
And it starts feeling angry. 
And maybe wrongs have been done. 
But to tell yourself a story over and over and over again, don't confuse the harm someone else has done with the harm that you're doing to yourself. 
Because to say angry thoughts to yourself over and over again or critical thoughts against yourself over and over again or depressing thoughts over and over again, it's harmful to oneself to do that. 
And so this is the second arrow that we add. 
And so the first arrow is life, and that we can't necessarily control. 
But we can have some control over the second arrow. 
So along this line, it's very common for people to say that the meditation teacher is like me, that maybe you can't always control your thinking mind in terms of whether you think or don't think. 
But what you can do, just like you can't control maybe a big wide river, but you can be in the river and find the right place, the right current to be in, the right place in the river, avoiding the rapids. 
So we can be in the world of thinking and make adjustments. 
Get into a different boat on the river of thoughts. 
Go into a different current or an eddy. 
And where it's safe, avoid the whirlpools or the holes, the rapids. 
And so to notice that determination, notice the repetitive thoughts that are maybe sometimes debilitating. 
And then to just notice that, notice how repetitive they are, you can count them. 
It's fascinating to start counting how many times you have the same kind of thought. 
It takes some of the charge or the authority out of them to count them. 
By the time you get to 300, it's like they don't have so much authority. 
Or you can see the effect it has on your body, on your emotions. 
And you could offer different thoughts. 
You can consciously begin thinking about something that's more positive, not a fantasy in itself, but something that's true, that's kind, that's generous, that's soft. 
And one of the ways to even do it if you're by yourself, maybe driving or something, rather than ruminating difficult thoughts, is to start talking out loud to yourself in a nice, friendly voice, thoughts that are supportive, thoughts that are good, thoughts about what's coming. 
And because sometimes the voice that thinks comes from a different place in our mind than the voice that speaks. 
And so you're tapping into a different side of yourself when you're speaking out loud. 
And maybe there's more wisdom. 
Maybe there's more kindness. 
Maybe there's more access to a choice of how to be than if you just let your thinking keep going. 
But also start experimenting with shifting what you're thinking about. 
It might sound artificial. 
It might sound a little bit forced and effortful. 
However, if it's better than the alternative, try doing it. 
If the alternative you've done it long enough of ruminating and spinning and debilitating this kind of draining kinds of thoughts, maybe those are the ones who should be questioned that they're artificial. 
Those are the ones who should be questioned about how much energy we're going into them. 
So you might try to offer an alternative. 
Consciously choose what you think and think good things. 
This is not meant to be pollyannish. 
It's not meant to be an antidotal thinking, necessarily. 
It's not meant to be pretending that everything is fine. 
It could be very realistic thoughts about what's happening that sees reality, what's happening directly and right in the eye, but that meets it and thinks about it in wise ways and kind ways, supportive ways, compassionate ways, ways that maybe you would imagine the Buddha would speak or the way that some wonderful person that you know, wise, kind person that you're inspired by, how they might speak about the situation. 
So this is what I'm offering today, requires some mindfulness, but it is a practice that's kind of different than mindfulness. 
But I'm hoping that this investigation and this kind of practice of thinking in new ways will be a tremendous support for your ability to be mindfully present. 
If something can settle, the rumination can settle and you can be inspired by a different way to go forward. 
So I hope that you find a way to enjoy this and take up the challenge if you're one of those people who might ruminate in ways that are not useful for you. 
And if you're not one of those people, then tomorrow we'll take you to the world of thinking from a different angle. 
Thank you.
