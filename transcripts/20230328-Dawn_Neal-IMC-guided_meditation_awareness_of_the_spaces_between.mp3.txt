 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Just an invitation to settle into your chair, your cushion, your mat, whatever you're settling into. And find a posture that is comfortable, upright, and alert. You might hear me sip tea occasionally. My voice is going in and out, so it's in the interest of continuing to be able to talk. So the invitation is to notice, notice wherever you're at in your body. Now, the physical space, the sound in or outside the room, the warmth or cool, the moisture or dryness of the air, how all of that is for your body right now. And then to turn the internal gaze inward. Notice the internal weather. Maybe there's calm, contentment, maybe there's energy and distraction. Perhaps a bit of joy connecting with sanctum needs. Whatever's there, acknowledging, noticing. And then inviting. May this body relax. Perhaps allowing a deeper softening on a long exhale. And allowing the breath to be normal. Inviting a softening of the face and forehead. Oxaput neck and shoulders. Allowing a softening of the rib cage and chest. Upper back, mid back. Allowing the belly, the stomach to hang freely. And inviting a settling, a softening around the spine of the back that allows even the lower back, the buttocks, to relax. Noticing any tension or presence in the hands or arms. Allowing them to be still, soft. Allowing the big muscles around the thigh bones to soften. Softening around the bones. Honoring and acknowledging the strength there. Allowing energy to flow down through the knees, thighs, calves, shins, ankles, feet. Pounding. Simple. Relaxed. Allowing awareness to suffuse, to fill the whole body. And if it's helpful to attune to the sensations of breathing or body sound. The invitation is to do so. And to notice. Are you aware? What would be awareness of? Whatever's arising to be present. And turning the attention to the quality of the heart and mind in this moment. Inviting the heart, the mind, to relax. Open into now this. Thank you. And time to time, appreciating the quality of being aware. Any spaces between sensations, breaths, thoughts. Noticing moments of quiet in between. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
