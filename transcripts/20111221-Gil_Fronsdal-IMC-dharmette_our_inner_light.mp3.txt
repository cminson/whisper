Dharmette : Our Inner Light  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on December 21 , 2011  
 
 
I suppose for some people , today is a special day , as 
it’s the solstice . It’s the shortest day of the year  in the 
northern hemisphere – the heart of the darkness. You 
see people put up Christmas lights. People light 
candles. At this time of year , people  bring light  to all 
kinds of things in  their lives.  
 
For some people , the darkening in winter is quite  
difficult. But, there’s also  an opportunity at this time of 
year to come  closer to our selves. Unlike spring , this is 
not exactly the expansive time of year. But , it’s a time 
perhaps to be more settled, quiet , or a little more  pulled 
in. I think  there’s  someth ing quite beautiful about being 
– I don’t know if “pulled in ” is the right word – perhaps 
it’s “connected ” or “close in .” Stay close to yourself.  
 
There’s  a story from the time of the Buddha that when 
he w as getting close to death, he gave the inst ruction or 
the teaching to : “be a light unto yourself. ” The Pali word 
he used  was dīpa, which means  both ‘light’ and ‘island. ’ 
There  are various debates about this. Did he mean 
island , or did he mean light? But, for today’s  purpose , 
I’m happy with light  [laughs] . Be a light unto yourself.   
Is there an inner light  that represents  what’s meaningful 
or sacred for you – things that are  connected to 
yourself,  or to a place of feeling home?  Do you have  
something that  is inwardly or spirit ually a source of ligh t 
for you  – some  reference point  of meaning , value , or 
significance ? It could be a feeling of freedom, a sense 
of love, gratitude , or connectedness to others and the 
people  around you. It could be a sense of compassion , 
or the  path of practice. It coul d be your inner sense of 
wisdom, understanding , or intuition that’s very 
meaningful. It could be a sense of community  – of be ing 
connected to others : family, friends , or other 
practitio ners who are wise, loving , or compassionate.  
 
So, what is your light? What is your light that lights up 
the darkness for you in this life we live, which is often 
difficult?  Is there something that brings you a sense o f 
beauty, value , or inspiration, and that lightens you up , 
so that you don’t get so heavy?  I think that at this time 
of year , we’re called upon to get close to and remind 
ourselves of our light – to come home to it, and be 
settled. It’s a time  to feel connected in the darknes s. 
Maybe it’s  bit harder on a day like today in California 
with this  particularly blue sky [laughs].  
 
Be a light unto yourself , so that there’s something you 
can do , so that  you find yourself at home, safe, or 
connected to something meaningful. It’s not dependent on someone else. It’s not that someone else is going to 
do it for you. It’s  not like you’re going to place yourself in 
the middle of other people to entertain you or take you 
away from yours elf. But , find something that brings you 
home to yourself, so you feel connected to yourself.  
 
I find the darkness at this time of year to be kind of 
lovely , for coming in ward . I’m always so surpri sed at 
how early it gets dark. It’s n ot as dark as where I grew 
up in Norway , where you couldn’t even see the sun  at 
3:30 or four o’clock . It was dark .  
 
So, as the darkness pulls you in, be connected and 
here. D on’t go out so much. How you interpret this , I 
don’t know. But , those are my thoughts  – just the feeling 
sense of today  and being here with you. It’s kind of 
lovely to come here and sit. I hope that this time of year 
is one that is no urishing for you as you pull in, stay 
home metaphorically, and stay connected to your light.  
 
So that’s all I have ; I don’t have much more. What else 
is there?  We have a few  minutes . If any of you want to 
ask a question or say something, w e can take a little 
time.  
 
Participant : [Indecipherable ] my practice of and the 
reason I’m asking the question is so I don’t 
[indec ipherable]  So the instructions that [indecipherable]  
as practice just pay attention to the breath , and if I find myself thinking, come back to the breath . 
[indecipherable] Mahasi method. And I think I’ve found 
in this past year different instruction s both from Andrea 
and you about paying more attention to 
[indecipherable],  reflecting on it, [indecipherable],  
understand the threads of what’s going on in me, the 
emotion  that’s arising and so forth. And that’s different , 
as I said,  from the instructions that I practiced for a long 
time. Is what I’m describing a suitable method of 
practice?  
 
Gil: So, you’re saying that for many years you practiced 
what you call the “Mahasi  technique ,” which is to use 
your breath as the anchor of practice, to come back, 
and be there. And then if you wandered off in thought , 
to just come back to the breath, to let go of that  and 
come back. But the here at IMC, listening to Andrea 
Fella or myself give instructions , it seems we emphasize 
something more than just letting go , but also 
investigation , bringing mindfulness t o the wandering, 
distracted mind. So , you notice that there are different 
instructions , and you’re wondering is the way you were 
practicing good enough? Is it good? Is it right?  That’s 
what you want to know. You want to be reassured.  
 
Participant : [Indecipherable ] doing the way I practice, 
the Mahasi technique.  
 Gil: You want to know if that’s good enough or if it’s 
okay to keep doing it that way. Is that the question?   
 
Participant : Yes, the question is that prefer  paying more 
attention to my feeling, mood, thoughts, and try and 
unravel what’s going on. And I was told absolutely not to 
do that.  
 
Gil: Oh, by the Mahasi peopl e.  
 
Participant : Yes.  
 
Gil: Okay,  so what’s the question?  
 
Participant : The Mahasi style instructions were clear. It 
was simple, clear. What I’m doing now is not so clear.  
 
Gil: Well, that’s because your life is not clear. When 
your life be comes clear, it’ll become clear [l aughs] ! But 
most people’s  lives are not so clear. You can  see 
mindfulness as meeting your life as it is , and your life is 
complex and involved with many  things. And so , of 
course , you have to find your way.  
 
I don’t know why th is comes to my mind, but let’s say  
you’re a swimmer . Apparently, there are people who  
swim across the  gap be neath the Golden Gate Bridge 
from San Francisco  to Marin . I think there was a 
thirteen - or eight -year-old who did it. So, it’s possible to do it. But , I don’t think there is just one technique of 
swimming across , and that the time of day or anything 
else doesn’t matter  – you just jump in a nd swim across. 
One, two, three:  you do it,  right? It’s not that way. It’s a 
complex thing. You have to look at the tides, currents, 
wind, temperature, and the shipping lanes  [laughs] . 
There is a lot that is going on. So , if you have just one 
technique , you’re in trouble. Swimming across the 
straits  is complicated , so you have to take in to account 
all kinds of factors , and adjust what you do.  
 
Your  life is probably more complicated than swimming 
across to Marin . There  are a lot of changes and shifts 
that happen. So , to find your way with your life as it is , 
you’re probably not going to do so well if y ou just have 
this one technique that’s going to do it all for you. Life is 
messy , and so we bring mindfulness to it. We try to 
understand .  
 
A big part of m y understanding of Buddhism is 
investigation , and with that comes trial and error. We 
investigate. We look more deeply to try to understand 
what’s there. And then we try different things. If I try this 
or that in meditation, what are the results ? Is it helpful , 
or not helpful?  
 
There’s  a trial and error approach to meditation. The 
wonderful thing about trial and error is that we mostly 
learn from the error. So don’t be afraid of that. And in that way , we get to understand the actual dynamics of 
our own life , and how to work with it. As we learn, it 
becomes easier and easier. But , if we have o ne 
technique that’s too narrow  – it might be a very powerful  
narrow technique  – but it works well only in certain 
settings. Mahasi practice works  well in intensive retreat 
settings . But sometimes we  can’t get the sense of how 
to bring our practice to the complexity of  what goes on 
in life.  
 
The art of meditation is be careful not to get so reflective 
or so analytical that the mind just spins out. But 
hopefully , if you’re being mindful , it’s self -correcting , 
because when you’re mindful, you notice  that. “Oh now, 
I’m thinking so much. I’m trying so much to understand 
what goes  on in my thinking that I’m just tying myself in 
knots, and  thinking even more.” So t hat approach is not 
useful. May be I should go back to the Mahasi  technique 
for a while  – get really simple , and calm down  [laughs] . 
And then maybe I’ll go gingerly and look  more at what 
happens when I’m thinking.  What are the emotions  that 
keep popping up when I think?   
 
I hope that’s useful.
