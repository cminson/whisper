The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Arriving in your body.
Just letting yourself be with your experience as it is.
Just kind of taking in how you are.
If there is any tension anywhere in the body, it would be really helpful to soften that.
Allowing the body to relax.
Maybe to the mind could relax a little bit, letting go of worries or concerns.
I find so much of meditation is actually creating the container in which the meditation can very naturally unfold.
When we find a relaxation of body and mind, very naturally awareness will be there.
Whether you prefer to do directed practice, choosing a particular experience such as the breath,
or whether you prefer to do a more open awareness practice, receptive to just what is happening in this moment.
Beginning by finding a place where the body and mind are relaxed will support that.
It can be really helpful to take a few minutes at the beginning of a sitting and just attend to the container for the meditation.
Really that container is conditions, conditions that support the natural capacity that we have to be aware.
So relaxing the body, relaxing the mind.
And as there is some relaxation available,
we might notice there is an awareness of relaxing
perhaps being aware while relaxing supports being aware with relaxation.
Having awareness be relaxed.
And exploring, attending to experience which is already happening.
From that perspective of relaxed awareness, whether you are more comfortable choosing something like the breath or body sensations is a place to land
or receiving open awareness, perhaps the awareness that knows experience can have a quality of resting with whatever is happening.
Thank you.
