 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Okay, great. So, welcome everyone. Welcome. Warm welcome to happy hour, wherever you are in the world, whether it's your first time, we're welcome the first timers tonight, especially, or happy hour regulars welcoming you warmly as you welcome each other. So, so for the theme for today's practice together. The theme of the body and metta, metta loving kindness cultivating friendliness, goodwill, care, love. There's so many ways to translate this word metta, M-E-T-T-A, and poly. So many nuances. And, and the body, the body is so that the teachings on mindfulness of the body. Kaya, the task at the Kaya, the task at the cat, Kaya, body, got to Sati Sati is translated as awareness or mindfulness mindfulness gone to the body. Kaya, the task at the mindfulness of the body is is so important is really the foundation of so many other practices drawn from Sati Patanas to the four foundations of mindfulness. So, so on Friday, we did some practice of grounding in the body sense of grounding as metta coming to the body coming to the body as self care grounding the in the earthiness of the body, earth on earth. And many of you said that that was very supportive for you and grounding and, and, and this sense of establishment of all metta as care in in connection connection with the body. So, so along the themes of the but and for those of you who who missed it, you're welcome. It's on audio Dharma.org, and also on YouTube, you can go and catch up and listen, and no, no catching up is needed whatever is needed tonight will be shared with you during the guided meditation so it's all good you don't have to catch up for the sake of knowing what's happening now I'm just kind of letting you know these connections, just for background, just for background. So tonight, tonight, or this morning, whatever time zone you might be in the idea of grounding in the body bringing awareness Sati mindfulness to the body as an expression of care for ourselves, as well as leaning into it even a little more now. So leaning into it in the way of, oh, this body, this body, this dear body that I take for granted. A lot of the time, this amazing body that functions, it heals itself, it breathes it processes food in ways that I have no idea how it even gets done these amazing chemical processes. And also if there's any challenges in the body, any parts of the body that are challenged hurting, struggling to bring more care, love, metta to those parts of the body. So, both grounding in the physicality and as as a way of metta caring for ourselves connecting for ourselves. And then really leaning into that care, leaning into that care. The body both as a mother, and as the child, both kind of the stability of Oh, thank you body or the comforting soothing and oh sweet dear body you're also in some ways you're challenged and hurting. So both of those, both of those, both as the parent, as well as the child. So, so navigating that relationship tonight is the part of the invitation in this practice. And we'll let's see what shows up for each of us might be different. We always explore in this way of cultivating friendliness and goodwill. So, so without further ado, let's land into our practice together. Let's land into our posture. You need to move if you need to lie down. Establish a sense of integrity, a brightness. See what your body needs this unique expression of humanity. It is yours, and not yours. Relaxing, relaxing, softening into the body. Putting down, putting down. Whatever is not necessary in this moment. Thoughts, ruminations, plans not needed right now. This moment, moment of refuge, moment of refuge, this moment of simplicity of this body connected to the earth. Relaxed thoughts. And just being breathed, just being breathed. And each in breath bringing more presence, connecting with the felt sense of this body. Each out breath. Landing, releasing into the body more deeply. Each out breath, releasing a little more. Thank you. Thank you. Can each moment of connecting with this body, putting down thoughts, not that there's anything wrong with thinking per se, but choosing right now to give ourselves, our hearts completely to this refuge, to this moment of practice, simply connecting, awareness knowing, this body sitting, connecting, stabilizing, calming, grounding as an expression of care for ourselves, love for ourselves, affection for ourselves just here, just connecting, awareness, turned inward, feeling this whole body sitting, all these sensations of sitting, of breathing. Noticing how soothing it is, it can be. To turn the attention, awareness, just connect with the sensations of simply sitting and breathing. A radical act of care and love, self-care. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This body in this moment is a source of stability, care for ourselves. Imagining the archetypal mother or parent, the Buddha or Kuan Yin, the statue's sense of care, stability. Love as if your body's embodying that for you, as if your body was a Buddha statue, Kuan Yin statue, stable, emanating care, love, stability for yourself, tenderly, each breath connecting to it. And so too, this body often has challenges. I'd actually be having challenges right now. The part of the body in pain or not quite functioning in good health, perfect health. This body too, as a tender child being held the same way you would hold the little newborn, a baby. I'm having a hard time, perhaps, just tenderly. There, there, sweetie. It's okay. It's okay. Patiently holding the body of child. Same sense of metta directed also to this body. Especially to any parts that are struggling or have been struggling. It could be physical parts of your body or direct if your body is in perfectly good health, maybe directed to the heart center, the proverbial heart center, the center, the place of emotions, heartache. If there's any dukkha that has physical manifestations in your body, any stress, tightness, sadness, anxiousness, showing up in the body, holding that tenderly with metta. There, there, sweetie. There, there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What is more supportive, going back and forth, or holding both? This idea of the body as the mother, the stable, supportive source of connection care, stability, as if a mother, as if the Buddha or Kuan Yin, the embodiment of love and compassion. See if leaning into that is more supportive or holding the body as if a newborn. Tenderly, body, heart, mind. Oh, sweetie. It's okay. Directing love, care, metta to the body. At some point, maybe the two perspectives become one, they merge. See what's more supportive for you in this moment. Explore. Explore. Explore. Explore. Explore. Each breath, both connecting to the body and soothing, soothing, comforting, bringing ease, relaxation, sucker to the body. Don't work too hard. Let it be nourishing. Let each breath be nourishing, soothing. I invite you to put a hand, the palm of your hand, the middle of your chest, your heart center, making your physical connection, your stance of care, connection. Imagine it's your own hand or the hand of a loved one or the Buddha or Kuan Yin or chest. It's okay, sweetie. Calming, soothing, supporting, connecting. Let yourself be surprised. Maybe put the other hand, the other palm on your belly, holding your heart center and your belly. Oh dear heart, oh dear body. It's not easy. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. And for the last couple of minutes of this practice, both feeling the sense of stability, solidity, uprightness of this body, this posture, connecting with the support of the earth, the sense of integrity that's available, that holds the tenderness, with care, with love, tenderness in the body, in the heart, in the mind, with love and care. May all beings be well, know their own goodness, have all the support that they need. May all beings, including ourselves, be free. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. So change the settings so you're welcome to raise your zoom hand to share your reflections, what this was like for you, what you discovered. Your insights for the benefit of both yourself being held witness is quite profound. Also for the benefit of the Sangha, your insights, your observations, your questions, serve everyone. And also you're welcome to type them in chat. If you type them privately to me alone, I won't read your name and just I just read the reflection. And if it's type to everyone, then I also read your name. So. So wait for your reflections or your questions for your hands to be raised. Just say that again, what we did was at the beginning, just settling with the breath and the body, taking refuge, tilling the soil, calming the mind, and then turning to the body, both as the support, the stability, this connection, both the body as the mother, body as the child, or from many people, maybe Kuan Yin or the Buddha works better than the image of the mother. So, Wayne, please. I find that holding, putting my hand on my belly really helps me stay in touch with my breathing and helps me come back quicker from when I noticed my mind is thinking about something. So that's very helpful. Nice. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, that sense of connection, just the physical physically connecting with a hand on the belly with the breath rising, falling. Great. Delighted to hear that. And that's a support that's always available to you. I suggest that actually many times, actually to many students that yeah, it's fine. It's okay to put the hand on the belly in the sense of connection. So delighted to hear that was helpful for you, Wayne. Great. And Barbara, please. I welcome to that emotion, putting a hand on the belly, which was helpful. I feel that also you're saying that maybe Yuka and my heart center resonated with me. Because well, there's the Kri I'm not suffering. There is a deep center at the heart of the COVID being more threatening now. And in my life, that's where my family's going to be gathering. You realize that I'm carrying. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Barbara. Yeah. It's the heart, you know, the heart center, proverbial heart center carrying so much. You know, the dukka, it has ramifications in the body. You know, all these expressions we have, my heart feels heavy because we feel it in the body. It feels like, oh, this heaviness, this heaviness. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. And that's something that, you know, the COVID situation, of course, and the Delta variant. Our shared humanity, no matter where we are in the world, we're sharing this. So two reflections coming to me. One person says, I really liked the guided experience as if being embodied by Kuan Yin, then the Buddha felt so strong, grounded and stable, even if just for the moment. Beautiful. Yay. I'm delighted to hear that report from the field. That's great. I can just bring a sense of stability and another report coming in, thinking of my body as mother slash Buddha and sending loving support, Metta to myself. That way immediately led me to be more protective of my physical body, make it strong for long term care of my health. Smiley, beautiful. I haven't thought of my body in this way enough during COVID. Beautiful reflection, beautiful insights. Both of these in chat and also those who raised their hands with. Thank you. Beautiful reflections and very insightful. Lovely. So how about we turn. Oh, one more. One more coming when you Nicki mentioned something like instead of the back and forth holding both together came very much in handy. There was a ping pong going on between pushing aches and pains away and befriending them. Making space for all was then possible. Thank you. Oh, lovely. It's great. Making space for all. Lovely. Yeah. Beautiful. Thank you for your practice. Everyone such lovely reflections. And I'm sure there are plenty more reflections in here and turning into small groups. We'll have the chance to listen to each other and also share as much or as little as you like. Sometimes actually listening to each other brings more up like, oh, yeah, that came up for me. And I totally forgot that I noticed that during guided meditation. So these the group practice Sangha practice is is very important part of our practice here in happy hour. So so the group size is usually roughly three people, three or four depending. And we always start with just 15 seconds of silent meta for ourselves and for each other, for our bodies, for each other's bodies. And then you can say and then you can go around and say as little or as much as you like. There's about we have six, seven minutes in the group. So so I will open the groups now, the rooms now. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. OK, here we go. Welcome back. The rooms are closed. We have a few minutes for any reflections that might have come up from listening to others or listening to yourself. Sometimes when you hear yourself share your practice, no insights come up or no questions or shared understanding or no understanding. So especially if you haven't shared this evening or recently, you're welcome to raise your hand. I would love to hear from you. Or you can type in chat. Yes, Wayne. I am talking a lot. Well, it's your first time at Happy Hour. So you have a lot of catching up to tell us. I was when we were we were one gentleman mentioned about drinking caffeine in the morning. And I remember I didn't start drinking caffeine until I was about 22 years old. And I was at in a sashine at Zinn Center. And I wondered where all the people went in between or in between the Zazen periods. And so I thought, well, I'll follow them out. And everybody was heading to the coffee urn. And I was wondering about. I guess my answer is that, well, I should just try. Now I drink. I've been drinking coffee ever since. But you know, people I guess that's one of the things coffee has always been used for is for stimulation. And I was just wondering about mindfulness and maybe practice sometimes without drinking caffeine. Yeah, I strongly I strongly recommend it. I strongly recommend it actually without caffeine or without caffeine without without caffeine. Without to notice the state of your mind and heart without caffeine. And often when people come on retreat silent retreats and they've been used to drinking coffee and they intentionally go. They stop drinking to really be able to observe their mind. What happens without caffeine. And then if they drink the effect of it. So, yeah, I highly recommend it. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, definitely good practice reflections. Jerry says it is amazing how one feels much less isolated hearing the vulnerability of others. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Marie Christine says yes, this is true, Jerry. And yes, and an agreement from Patricia. It's so isn't it amazing how much less isolated one feels hearing the vulnerability of others such a beautiful way to practice in community. And Melanie says totally relate Jerry my professor wrote this to me in an email once and I think of it often among my own peers I find that the passage of time eventually corrodes the simplistic and conformist notion of success that we are fed at a certain age. We all realize that nobody's life has been perfect and that it's empowering to share our regrets or sadness or failures. Oh, beautiful Melanie. Thank you for sharing that. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, this conformist notion of success. It's simplistic and it corrodes. And when we actually share our vulnerabilities or sadness or regrets or pain or failures in quotes we come closer it's part of our common humanity, or all human. Yeah, so much more there it's, it's the first noble truth in Buddhism, stress, pain, failure challenges a part of human life. It's part of human life. So, thank you all such beautiful heartfelt evening of our morning. I will have to remember the different time zones or afternoons given Australia given Marie Christine of practice with all of you. So thank you all for showing up and cultivating your heart for yourself and others may all beings be well may all beings be free. Thank you.
