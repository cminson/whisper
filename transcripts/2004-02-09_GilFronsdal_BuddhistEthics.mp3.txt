 So, as far as I know, this evening or tonight, they're still scheduled in execution at San Quentin. And this was it? Was it tomorrow and I got changed? One, twenty-four hours? Must have been. It was a temporary step that maybe turned over so it turned out to be suspended. So I did not know the news today, but I'm glad to hear that. And it has a big kind of impression on me when California does these things, which I think they've done about nineteen times or so in the last years since they started up again. And so what I thought I'd talk about today is Buddhist ethics. It's kind of in that context and some thoughts about it. And I thought I would say that when this practice of Vipassana was brought to the United States, you can kind of say it in the early seventies, it was consciously brought to the United States by people who wanted to offer the power of the mindfulness practice independent of much of its Buddhist context because they thought that they didn't want the Buddhist context to turn people off from this wonderful resource that the mindfulness is for people. And so they did away with a lot of the rituals, so they just left it behind and a lot of mythology or cosmology and some of the things that aren't so, doesn't work so well in the West. And offered something relatively simple. I know there was also a fair amount of discussion in the early days whether even to have a Buddha figure at the IMS because they had people turned off by seeing a Buddha figure and they wanted their meditation practice Buddha free. And however, the mindfulness practice as it's offered by the Vipassana teachers in America is offered as a spiritual practice, as a spiritual path, part of a spiritual path. And I'd like to suggest that as a spiritual path, as it's taught here in the West, there are five major elements of that path. And they're major elements, kind of the foundations for it. And mindfulness of course is one of them. The second is the practice of ethics or virtue, cultivating our virtue or ethics. The third is the cultivation of generosity, the practice of generosity. And the fourth is the practice of loving kindness, of metta. And the fifth is the cultivation or the arising or the acting on the expression of compassion. So sati, sila, dana, metta and karuna. Five different very important aspects. So important in tradition, I consider them kind of the foundation of the whole tradition. As it's presented here in the West, especially. So if someone's interested in the whole path, this kind of mindfulness practice as a spiritual discipline, spiritual path, these other aspects of the path aside from mindfulness are very important. And I would say are at least as important as the mindfulness. One of the very beautiful aspects of these five elements is that it could be understood that in any one of them, the other four are subsumed within or included within. That you cultivate one of the five and the other four will come along with it, follow along nicely. So there are some people who primarily practice mindfulness. And as they do that, they find that in due time, that their interest in living ethically becomes stronger as their kind of sensitivity develops through mindfulness, as some of the impulses to act from greed, hate and delusion begin to wane. And as we touch into some of the beautiful qualities of the heart, that it becomes more and more natural and more interesting to express and live by that virtue. And the same thing with loving kindness, that as kind of the crust of the heart begins to dissolve through mindfulness practice, that both loving kindness and compassion is something that arises quite strongly for people in our in due time. And generosity also, the movement towards generosity becomes stronger as people find that they're not interested anymore in holding on tight to greed, to just kind of the holding tight, the resistance to offering that to generosity that can often be there. It also turns out that the other five are subsumed within ethics, are included within the ethical life of virtue. And the classic way of practicing in Asia is not to start with mindfulness practice, as people do here in the West, but it's to start with the practice of ethics. And when I was ordained as a Buddhist monk in Burma, there's a lot of rules that the Buddhist monks have to follow. For monks there are 227 major rules to be followed. And I wasn't really interested in those rules when I was ordained. And I just thought that, well, they just come with a territory. If you want to be ordained, you have to kind of follow those rules. I had no intention of avoiding them, but I was going to be dutiful and follow the rules as best I could. But to my surprise, those rules, those ethical rules or rules of practice of trading, were such a tremendous aid to the mindfulness practice that I began to love them in themselves. Because you had to be constantly mindful, vigilant in a sense, to pay attention to what you're doing and how you're behaving and what you said. Because the rules were there to be followed. And it wasn't so much that I valued the constraint of the rules or the legality of the rules, but rather it was a way in which they really called on mindfulness all the time. And remember once I slipped up. A number of times I slipped. Actually, the first time I slipped, I didn't even know I slipped. And it reminds me by using the word slip. The Buddhist monastics were a slip. They were this dress, this lower, it's called a lower robe. And the upper robe usually covers the lower robe. And the first day I was ordained. I was ordained, I think, probably late morning or so. And by evening time, this other monk, American monk, came up to me and said, oh, Gil. And we usually weren't talking much to each other in this meditation monastery. So the fact that he came and talked to me was kind of a big deal. He said, oh, Gil, you need to confess. I just feel with my watch, what could I possibly have done in the five, six hours since I had been ordained? As far as I know, I got ordained. And then I went back to my room and continued with my meditation practice, walking, sitting, walking, sitting. There wasn't much I could have done. And so he explained that I'd broken the rule of, apparently one of the rules was that your outer robe, the bottom hem had to be lined up with the bottom hem of your slip, of this lower robe. And it had slipped. It had some happening. And it's very cumbersome if you're not used to these robes like I was in the first day. There are just like these big rectangles you wrap around yourself. And they're kind of hard to stay on there. You have to roll them up a certain way and tuck them under your arm. And so it was kind of awkward at first. And it turned out there was a rule about keeping these things properly lined up. So I slipped up there. And I thought it was a bit overly done. I had to confess that. It was a pretty minor, minor part of those 227 rules. But anyway, I got down on my knees. We both get down on your knees. This is kind of the way you hunch down. And you, aham bhante, sabhe, apathyoro, karomi, you say. And then you. So then, but at one other time, I remember a monk's not supposed to receive any offering of food after 12 o'clock noon. And I was outside of the cabin, the house of my teacher. And some tremendously devoted, faithful Burmese woman with great enthusiasm and joy came over to give me a bar. I think it was a, I think it was a, I don't remember, a bar of chocolate. And which in some traditions, maybe it's okay to receive. But anyway, she just kind of came over and before I could even like, understand what was going on, she just put it in my hands. So I had this. So I went into the cabin to the abbot was and she, what do I do with this? And he was not very pleased because I wasn't supposed to receive anything like that after 12 o'clock. And so maybe if I had more presence of mind, I would have known that I shouldn't have done that. And I would have figured out some graceful ways. Excuse me, but I can't do that. So that has to be a very high level of vigilance. So certainly part of the function of the mind of the ethics is that they are the cultivation of mindfulness. And you would actually cultivate a lot of mindfulness. If you were very vigilant about the late precepts, living a virtuous life. If you wanted to live a life of late precepts, you would live a life training yourself, dedicating yourself the best you could. To avoid killing or harming killing. You would avoid stealing, taking what is not given. You would train yourself in avoiding sexual misconduct. And you train yourself in avoiding lying, false speech, and you train yourself in avoiding intoxicating yourself. So here, these are very essential parts of the Buddhist spiritual path is to cultivate these five. And if you just spend a lot of time carefully cultivating these in great finesse, you would go quite far in developing your mindfulness. And it has the advantage that as you do that, the mindfulness becomes more probably healthier kind of mindfulness, because it becomes a mindfulness that's rooted in healthy relationships with the people around you. And it's a mindfulness that's rooted in already having established a foundation of virtue for that mindfulness practice. Kind of strength that comes with it. So not to kill has a lot of different meanings. But literally, it means you don't kill living beings. And technically, you don't kill living beings that breathe. Because I suppose some people would say that maybe plants are living beings, but they don't supposedly they don't breathe, they don't breathe in oxygen. They expel it. So they don't count. So, but even so monastics are probably very careful about even that level of harming life. But not to kill and it's quite beautiful to go on retreats and, and see people regularly do things like an insect comes into the meditation hall, you'll see people carefully go over there with a piece of paper and carefully pick up the insect and carefully walk out and put it outside. And it's not touching to see. And, and, you know, it's not that often in daily life, you know, outside of retreat, you see people that kind of care about the life of an insect. I think I endeared myself to my wife when we first got to know each other, because she would come over to visit me in my house and my home sometimes. And there were mosquitoes around where I lived. And I wouldn't kill the mosquitoes. I would spend a fair amount of time chasing them and trying to cup them with my hands. And once I had one, I'd go outside and release it. And, and I like it very much that my son, who's now six, I said last year, oh, in my uncle's house, they kill insects, but in our house, we take them outside. So it can be that level of care about insects. And then people ask, well, what about termite in my house or slugs in my garden? And I don't know. I don't want to usually want to answer those questions for people, but I'm very eager that people grapple with those questions. And part of having the precept as a guideline is to not to kill carelessly or thoughtlessly or automatically, even level of insects, but to actually be considered and careful and sensitive to what you're doing. And maybe after careful consideration, you might still decide to do something about the termites in your house. But the fact that people would consider and think about it and stop before doing it automatically, to me, is very touching. Part of the definition of not killing is to avoid, to not encourage others to kill. And so what does that mean for us? I think that would mean not being supportive of other people's efforts to kill in any kind of way. So that you probably think in your mind, there's all kinds of implications in many areas, and maybe some of them you don't like to think about or you disagree with. But again, I think the request of these precepts is to really think deeply about it, consider deeply what you think is really important here. I got an email today from someone who was planning, I guess not happening now, we're planning to go tonight to give a talk at the gates of St. Quentin. It was the individual for the execution. And she sent me the text of the talk she was preparing. And in there she talked about a warden in Mississippi, jails in Mississippi, who had participated as a named person in executing prisoners there. And I think maybe he had administered whatever words they administered in Mississippi, the ejection, I don't know what they do. And at some point he said he couldn't do anything. At some point he said he couldn't do it anymore, because he felt it was killing him. And that he couldn't face going home to his family, to continue doing this, that kind of luck. And so he pulled back or refused to do it anymore. And then she goes on in her talk to say that one of the things that we don't think about very much, when people are executed, is a tremendous cost it has on those people directly involved. That the people having to do that work for us, for the citizens of California, the people who do the gas or the injection, or there's a whole crew of people involved directly. People who hold the prisoner down and make sure it doesn't bolt, whatever the prisoners tried to do at the last minute. And a lot of people participate in that event and make it possible. And the Buddhist analysis of this is that it takes a huge toll on the psyche and the karma of the people who participate in that. And that if you knew the toll that it took on the people who administered the death penalty, you would never want death penalty administered to anyone. Regardless of what you felt about what it should, you know, the value it has for the person who maybe committed a crime. So to be very careful about not only killing but also condoning or encouraging others to kill is one of the precepts that Buddhist spirituality feels is very important. The second is that precept is not taking what is not given. And that's, it's a little more refined than simply saying not stealing. Taking what's not given means if it's not offered to you, it's not clearly given, then don't take it. And so if you come along and it seems like, well, that seems like, you know, it's meant for people to take, but it's not completely obvious, 100% sure, then ask someone you don't take without making sure that it's offered in some way. And I find that quite beautiful. And again, you find that that's very clearly expressed in monasteries or in retreat centers, where for the most part, in the many years that I've been teaching, it's been one of the places where I feel it's completely safe to leave, you can leave your wallet, you know, in the public place, and you'll come back and be there the next day, or someone will take it to the manager maybe, you know, but you're, it's a place that you can really trust that people are not going to take what is not given, and it'll be there when you come back, you're taken care of. I did lose my wallet at a monastery in Thailand, right at the end, there's the gate going into the monastery, a place that was kind of like the Wild West, not the monastery, but outside. And I thought for sure that I'd lost it forever. And I didn't return to the abbot. So to be careful with other people's things. The third is to avoid sexual misconduct. And basically, this means again, being reflective and thoughtful, investigating what is it that is harmful? What could be harmful in our sexual actions? And then avoid those things that cause harm. Probably anything else that we say about it, sexualities, you know, in terms of rules and regulations, from the Buddhist point of view, are unnecessary and not to the point. The basic guideline is don't cause harm. The third is, the fourth then is not to lie. And not to say false speech. And this is considered so important that it's said that people who don't practice this one are capable of breaking all the other four precepts. But if you can keep this one precept, you're much less likely to break the other precepts. Because the other precepts, especially the first three, often come along with lying. People who harm, kill, people who steal, people who involve sexual misconduct, often they try to cover it up or not so free with saying the truth. You know, go home to your spouse and say, guess what I did today? If you had an affair. People usually are more discreet about it. So you have to lie. So not to lie. And again, to go back to the retreats, tonight I'm quite inspired by the context of retreats, about how incredibly sensitive and careful people can be about these precepts. And if only people were that way in normal life. And again, I've had people come on retreats, and retreats we do interviews. And people are coming to me when I'm a teacher and interviewing, telling me what's going on in the practice and stuff. And I've had people come to me at the next interview. They say, you know, I need to apologize, confess. Because last time we had an interview, I said something wasn't true. And sometimes it's so innocent, you know, it's like they realize afterwards they just misspoke. But sometimes, you know, they're people twist the truth a little bit. Joseph Goldstein tells the story of him doing it publicly. So it's okay to say it. Of he was practicing Burma with Upandita, who was a very tough teacher. And you had to report, you had to keep a journal with him about your meditation practice every day. And then you'd come and report your practice to him. And there was one day that he had diligently kept his journal. But that day he didn't report for some reason to his teacher. So that journal entry wasn't reported. And apparently some days later, a week later, someone got the other story? Someone got the other story? Chris? No, no details. So maybe a week later or something, or sometimes later, he had to go into report. But that day, nothing really happened of interest is meditation. So Itharwal just bring out the old report. And you know, read that as if that happened for the last day. And so he reported it and, and, you know, I don't remember, you know, did all the details, but I apologize, making up a little bit. But, but I shouldn't lie, right? But I remember if Andita would do these things to us, you know, so I can kind of imagine he would sometimes he would go just, I can't even do it. He kind of used to look at you and raise his eyebrow and you figure, uh oh. Anyway, but it told him that that couldn't have happened. You can do the busted him. That wasn't that's not right. Something like that. And he had to admit, no, that's right. I got caught this is this, what didn't happen in the last 24 hours, this happened a week ago, whenever it was. So, you know, sometimes people will kind of little bit, want to twist, you know, you know, the report just so that it's more desirable and more impressive or impress the teachers or whatever. And then people come the next time to argue because in the retreat context, people are just spending 24 hours a day, kind of very sensitive to themselves, it's tremendous sensitivity, not distracted from themselves. And you feel the consequences and the cost of maintaining a lie or knowing that you've lied. And it becomes very hard to in that kind of context to maintain and continue with that wound or that sore that it's created. In daily life, we could lie and then we're so busy and so involved, it's often forgotten. And so, you know, we don't feel the cost it has for ourselves. But the practice not lying. If it does, the only mindfulness practice you practice was being careful with your speech, our speech, my speech, I think it would go a really long way. And then the fifth one is not to intoxicate ourselves. And there are different interpretations of this precept. Some people interpret it very strictly as absolutely no intoxicants, no alcohol, no intoxicating drugs, recreational drugs. And some people interpret it to mean you don't take alcohol to the point of intoxication because the poly is little bit ambiguous about exactly what the poly, the original indic expression is, whether it's avoid, you can avoid drugs and alcohol which intoxicate or avoid drugs and alcohol to the point of intoxication. Grammar is not completely 100%. And as we know with laws and rules, the lawyers of the mind will argue the case one way or the other, depending how it serves us the best. So it's up to you to decide, you know, what or you can listen to some teacher and this teacher will decide for you what it is. But I'm reluctant to make that decision for people. Sorry. Just don't inhale. Just don't inhale. So what's beautiful about, there's a lot of really tremendous beauty about the ethics of the precepts. Part of the beauty of them is that the cultivation of these precepts, living by them, comes along, cultivates over time the opposites. And part of the reason to do them is to cultivate the opposites. So it said that loving, the opposite of loving kindness, the opposite of not killing is loving kindness and compassion. The opposite of not stealing is generosity. The opposite of avoiding sexual misconduct is contentment, being content. The opposite of not lying is being truthful. And the opposite of not intoxicating one's mind is to be mindful, develop clarity of mind. And so you find then in these five precepts, some of these other qualities that the five aspects of spiritual path I talked about at the beginning. And I believe that the five precepts, these ethics are also, part of the beauty is that they also express a generosity of spirit towards the world around us. They're a gift that we give. The Buddha talked about that, that living by the precepts is a tremendous gift we give to others. And we give them the gift of fearlessness in the sense that people don't have to fear us, don't have to worry about us, don't have to be concerned about trying to second guess what we really meant because we say what we mean, we're being honest with what we say, or we're willing to be accountable. People ask us a question and then we'll give a truthful answer. And so it's a gift. And again, to go back to retreats and to meditation monasteries and retreat centers and things like that. It's a phenomenal gift to some people that these places are known as places that live ethically. There are people who, for example, are struggling with ethical issues or struggling with addiction issues and knowing there's some place where we can go where they're going to get support and trying to live a clean life is very, very important for some people. And I saw that importance most clearly once when one of the Buddhist centers I was living in had an ethical scandal with the Abbott. And for some people, there was a whole range of responses in the community to the ethical scandal. But for the people who were kind of deeply challenged in their lives to stay off drugs or stay off alcohol, and were kind of holding on to this is kind of the lifesaver support as a refuge for themselves. They were the ones who are most, among the people who are most disturbed, most confused, most discombobulated by the fact that the very place of refuge was exhibiting an ethical behavior. So to maintain some kind of high standard of ethics, I think is a wonderful gift and support for a lot of other people, aside from the support it gives ourselves. It's also an expression of compassion and loving kindness, of our connectedness to others. And then the other five aspects, if you develop loving kindness, or if you develop compassion, I think naturally the precepts follow and naturally becoming more mindful follow. If you practice generosity, I think also that the ethics follow, the precepts, the mindfulness follows, the compassion and loving kindness follow. So it's possible to specialize in one, but I think that is more useful for all of us, not to think about which one am I going to specialize in, but rather think how can I cultivate all five. If the mindfulness practice, if you want the mindfulness practice to be part of a spiritual discipline, then I think reflecting and thinking about these other five and working with them, training with them, experimenting with them, studying them, discussing them, placing them in your heart are extremely important aspects of the spiritual path and spiritual life. It was a beautiful story that I've told now sometimes. Ten years ago, I was teaching a class on Buddhist texts. And there was a Chinese American, Chinese woman, Buddhist who was in the class. And she'd been born in Taiwan and raised in Taiwan and in Thailand and come to America and was going to school at Stanford. That's where I met her. And she was varied about Buddhist, as were some of the other people in the class. But I asked her one day if she meditated. And she said, because she said about she had a Buddhist teacher and she, you know, there's a whole lot she was studying, she was doing Buddhist studies at Stanford. It was a whole life as Buddhism in a sense. So I asked her, you know, do you meditate? And she said, no, not yet. I'm preparing myself so that I'm worthy enough to meditate. That almost knocked me off my chair. And she said that. It never occurred to me that you would, you know, spend years preparing yourself to meditate. So you're worthy enough for it. And my guess in that process of becoming worthy for meditating, she was cultivating a lot of mindfulness and her ethics and her inner life, her virtue, and preparing yourself because in one classic understanding of meditation, is it's really the pinnacle of practice. If you imagine a triangle, mindfulness meditation, a meditation is the top of the triangle. And the bottom of the triangle, which provides a firm foundation and base for it, are things like ethics and generosity and loving kindness and compassion. And so she was creating that very important foundation. There was a woman, a friend of mine who came back from being on retreat in Burma. She was there about eight months and she had kind of a psychic break on the retreat, which the teachers in Burma had no clue how to deal with. And they just in a sense, they made it worse. And she came back to America and visited her Zen teacher that she had here. And it was very clear that she was now challenged in doing meditation practice because of the difficulty she had in Burma. And so the teacher told her, oh, instead of meditating, just practice generosity. And so she started practicing generosity. And that became her practice and she found delight in it and great value. That she could do. She couldn't practice meditation because she can practice generosity. And that took her a long way. Not all the way she needed to heal, she needed to do other things, but it made a huge impact on her. Just to practice generosity and stabilize her mind and create a really good foundation. I want to read a couple of quotes. This is a very part of a letter written in 1993 by a group of people called Network of Western Buddhist Teachers. I think it rose out of a group of Buddhist teachers, Western Buddhist teachers, who went to 1993 to Dharmasala to spend some time with themselves, kind of a teacher meeting. They were kind of senior Western teachers. I don't know how many, maybe 20 of them or so, 15, 20 of them or so. And they met in Dharmasala and part of their meetings, Dharlama came and joined part of the meetings. And then in the discussions, their mutualities, Zen people, and the Vipassana people, and the Tibetan teachers, they wrote this letter, open letter, and kind of stating, kind of, like, I don't know, maybe like a position paper. And this is what they say. Our first responsibility as Buddhists is to work toward creating a better world for all forms of life. The promotion of Buddhism as a religion is a secondary concern. Isn't that great? Like, you know, like, let's get, let's do the important thing first and then, you know, we have time left over, then we'll, you know, do some Buddhist, teach people Buddhism or promote it as a religion. Then he goes on, kindness and compassion, the furthering of peace and harmony, as well as tolerance and respect for all, for other religions should be the three guiding principles of our actions. Kindness, compassion, furthering peace and harmony, and tolerance and respect for all religions should be the three guiding principles of our actions. So I think that's quite beautiful. And so the centrality of living an ethical and compassionate life is expressed here. And then Martin Luther King, who was such a great champion of non-violence. The nonviolent approach does not immediately change the heart of the oppressor. Remember, King was trying to change America, trying to change racism by addressing the oppressors. But the nonviolent approach does not immediately change the heart of the oppressor. The first, it first does something to the hearts and soul of those committed to it, those committed to non-violence. It gives them a new self-respect. It calls up resources of strength and courage they did not know they had. Finally, it reaches the opponent and so stares his consciousness, his conscience, that reconciliation becomes a reality. So I think it's a beautiful quote. So first change ourselves. And as we do that, it creates strengths and power within our own heart, qualities within our own heart. It calls up resources of strength and courage. Could it be that living an ethical life makes you a more courageous person? And becoming a more courageous person, does that create a sense of strength that becomes a balance, a support for the furthering of your spiritual life? I believe it does. And then finally, it reaches the opponent and so stares his conscience that reconciliation becomes a reality. So the whole thing is to develop reconciliation as the ultimate goal here. And you don't want to just simply win over or conquer your opponent or out-devote your opponent or get your way because it's a better way than the opponent's way. But you want to do it in such a way that you can have reconciliation with the opponent. And then, on a little bit lighter note, perhaps, this was an article in the Chronicle some years ago by John Carroll. Every once in a while, my wife hands me these articles. We should read this one because she and then she hand me this one. We arrived in Nepal during a festival called Durga Puja, which is a celebration of the Hindu deity Durga, who is an aspect of Devi and the goddess of warfare and other malevolent acts. The Hindu citizens of Kathmandu celebrated with parades and chaotic music making. I remembered standing in a doorway on a narrow street near midnight, crushed in a crowd, watching a statue of the Adamantan sow being born aloft by revelers. I thought, not in Kansas, me. Another aspect of Durga Puja was animal sacrifices. The American embassy, wishing not to offend the host country, slaughtered a goat near the entrance. Photos of this event were not encouraged. I often wondered how it was handled in the expense reports. The Buddhist residents had a dilemma. They were a tiny minority in the capital city. The Buddhist part of Nepal, they too wished not to offend, but slaughtering animals was contrary to the tenets of the religion. So what did they do? So they slaughtered melons. On Buddhist doorsteps all over the city were the pulpy remains of fruit that had been cleaved by machetes. It was important, it seemed, that it looked brutal. Not a clean slice as though one were preparing cantaloupe for dessert, but a great heedless whack with seeds adhering to the walls and pulp like pieces of flesh decomposing on the pavement. Thus the alien goddess was appeased, and another strange artifact of assimilation was born. So mindfulness, virtue, generosity, loving kindness, and compassion. May all of those be things that you care about. And I think caring about them is really the most important thing. You don't necessarily have to have them all the time or have them easily accessible. They come and go, and the times we have them more than others. But to really care about them, to feel like this is really important, that's really something. I think Buddhist ethics, the precepts, are things to be cared for. Things to be loved and nourished and supported. So may all your hearts be nourished by these five. Thank you.
