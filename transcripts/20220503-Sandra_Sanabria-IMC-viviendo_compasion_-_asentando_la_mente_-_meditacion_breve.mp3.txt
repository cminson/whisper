And it carries the tension, the sensations in the body.
Relaxing the muscles of the face, around the eyes, the mouth, the cheek.
When the shoulders fall, feel the weight of your arms and relax your hands.
It carries the tension, the chest, the diaphragm, the stomach.
Impressing the muscles to relax, to release.
If you are in a chair or a kitchen, feel the weight of the torso, the hips, feeling the contact with the chair.
And the measure that is possible, releasing the tension in the glutes and the muscles.
Feeling the contact of the feet with the floor.
Feeling the body, the weight of the body.
Impressing the mind to rest in the body.
Seeing the tension in the whole body, you realize the sensations in the body.
It can be the breathing, the sensations in the hands, in the feet.
Letting the tension rest where you feel more natural.
Some sensation is asking for your attention.
With a wide, soft attention, there is nothing to force here.
Resting in the body.
When you realize that the mind is distracted, you recognize that distraction
and returns to the body, to the sensations, to your ankle.
With kindness, with softness.
I invite you to realize how you feel when the mind is present with the body.
I invite you to realize how you feel when the mind is present with the body.
Seeing the sensation in the knees, your feet, your shoulders,
maybe thoughts, memories.
Let your attention be aware of this experience at this moment.
To finish, take your attention to the breathing, or your hands, your feet.
Notice how the body feels.
Don't realize any change you see. Maybe a little more relaxation, a little more calm.
Or maybe not.
It's fine.
When the moment is coming, open your eyes and return to the activity you were doing.
