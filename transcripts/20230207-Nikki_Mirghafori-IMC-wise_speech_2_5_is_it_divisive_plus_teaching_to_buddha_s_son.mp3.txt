 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Thank you all for your practice, and hello again. Greetings. So the theme for this week is Wise Speech. And it's both external speech, what we say in words, what we write. For example, even writing what we write in chat, just small nuggets of writing are also considered speech. And these days with social media, the one little comment or with a little tweet, our speech can have so much impact externally on the world with the spread, with its reach, with the speed of dissemination. So speech is quite powerful both externally and also how it shapes our world internally. Our words spoken or written, they shape us. It's a scaffold of shaping who we are, how we think, how we perceive. Fascinating research also about the impact of language on our perception, how we actually perceive reality, quote unquote reality, based on the words we use, based on our speech. So the power, really appreciating the power of speech both externally, the impact it has on others, we can hurt others, we can create factions, wars. Yes, wars have started based on words. And also our words can bring succor, they can bring comfort, they can bring unity, they can support people, heal people. So words are so powerful, so powerful, both externally and how they impact us, they form and shape us and they shape and form our karma and karma in the way of our conditionality. Person, we are the person we become, we keep becoming in every moment. That's our karma. Our words shape our karma. Very important. So yesterday we began with the first guideline that the Buddha gives, which is, is it true and factual? And I added the nuance of factual. If you missed yesterday, please listen to it. I do want to add a couple of things to the true and factual because this is such an important one before we move on to the next one today. And first one thing I wanted to add was I was not a good academic yesterday. I was so excited about the research that I forgot to give you the reference as to where you could find it. And the work I talked about yesterday that neuroscience research can be found in Nature Neuroscience 2016. It's the work that was done in the lab of Tali Sharat and colleagues. And and today I wanted to add one more teaching about truthfulness. And this is so beautiful. This is from Machima Nikaya 61. It's where the Buddha is teaching Rahula his son. And and this is what the Buddha says. So one day the Buddha came to Rahula, pointed to a bowl with a little bit of water in it. And asked Rahula, do you see this bit of water left in the bowl? Rahula answered, yes, sir. So little Rahula is the spiritual achievement of one who is not afraid to speak a deliberate lie. That's profound. But then the Buddha continues. So little water is so little is the spiritual achievement of someone who's not afraid to speak a deliberate lie. Then the Buddha threw the water away, put the bowl down and said, do you see Rahula how the water has been discarded? In the same way, one who tells a deliberate lie discards whatever spiritual achievement one has made. Wow. And continues again, he asked, do you see how this ball is now empty in the same way one who has no shame in speaking lies is empty of spiritual achievement? He's really driving the point home. You get this, right? He's just driving home in beautiful, different ways. Then the Buddha, this is the last straw, then the Buddha turned the bowl upside down and said, do you see Rahula how this bowl has been turned upside down? In the same way, one who tells a deliberate lie turns one's spiritual achievements upside down and becomes incapable of progress. Therefore, the Buddha concluded one should not speak a deliberate lie even just. So turning the bowl upside down, incapable of progress, incapable of progress. As I mentioned yesterday, commitment to the truth is so fundamental, so important to truthfulness, to speaking the truth internally, externally. The Buddha basically says, if you tell a deliberate lie, if you have no shame, you cannot make progress, you throw it away, you're incapable. And many of us perhaps hear this, like, oh, yeah, I tell the truth. Yeah, I tell the truth. And yes, yes, for the most part, telling the truth might be easy, but those nuance to those particular instances where it's not easy, where it's hard to tell the truth, those are the times to inquire, to settle in with our bodies, with our hearts, like, what is happening? Am I afraid of being judged? Is my self-sense in danger? Do I want to show up in a particular way? Do I want to be perceived in a particular way? Like, what is the rub on those moments, on those moments that's telling, we just want to, you know, a little bit not quite. Shade the truth. For our benefit or for another person's benefit or detriment, perhaps. Those are the times that it becomes kind of sticky and in general, maybe 98% of the time or 99%, oh, yeah, it's easy, we tell the truth. Yeah, it's raining outside with those tiny bits of time and can be bring a brightness. So, I remember actually years ago, I remember I noticed that when I got somewhere late, for example, I would have, and I had, so there would be traffic and then I had left later than I intended, but then I would be ashamed to say, actually, I left later than I intended, I would just say, oh, there was traffic, that's why I'm late. Then I thought, wait, that's not quite true. I left later. So, I made it, I made it a choice to say, I left later than I intended, I'm sorry, and there was traffic. So, there was just a sense of truthfulness or a sense of uprightness. It just felt cleaner, even though it was small, but still it felt more upright. Yes, I'm not, just like, and then the question really was, oh, am I not feeling comfortable saying that, yes, I left later because I don't want to be judged, I don't want to be seen as someone who doesn't have it together, whatever, runs late. No, I ran late. And there's an uprightness to actually say that, to not have that shame or whatever it is. So, having that inquiry. So, I've spoken a lot again about the previous topic, which is so important, so important. And maybe I would just add one more thing. Actually, I'll save this for later. Okay. I want to move on to the next question that we ask. So, the next question to ask ourselves is, is my speech divisive? Is it divisive, or does it create harmony? So, the Buddha teaches about why speech, there are always things to avoid and things to cultivate. So, this is what the Buddha says. Abandoning divisive speech, one abstains from divisive speech. What one has heard here, one does not tell there to break those people apart from these people. What one has heard there, one does not tell here to break these people apart from those people. So, the sense of breaking people apart, one does not do that. And this is kind of maybe old language, but how often do we speak behind people's back or divisive speech and slanderous speech? And slanderous and divisive speech is based on hatred and ill will. It has that as its root. And it's enmeshed with resentment, envy, intention to hurt, another, when respect and support for ourselves. And it actually carries doubly heavy karma because it involves forethought. It's not only does it have the root of hatred and ill will, but also since it has forethought, you've thought about it ahead of time. Like, oh yeah, I'm going to say that thing about that friend, the third friend to this friend of mine, so that they're getting very close and I'm feeling threatened. They're getting very close and they didn't invite me. They went out to lunch on their own. Oh, I'm going to just say, this person said something. It involves forethought. It involves some planning. So, it has doubly heavy karma. And then actually the Buddha invites us, the continuation of the sutta I read, he says, thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united. One loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord. Basically, creating harmony, speaking what creates harmony. That's what the Buddha is recommending. So, instead, if you see, oh, your friend, your other two friends are now getting closer. Oh, yes, yes, great concord. I'm so glad you're becoming more friends. You know, she, they, they're wonderful. This is great. So, it's concord, creating concord, harmony between people instead of breaking people apart. So, so notice, so today as you go about your day, these bring in this inquiry both about, is it truthful? Is it factual? Internally, externally, especially in those like maybe 1%, or maybe fewer percentage of the time when it's a little difficult to be completely honest. And then, and then with, is my speech divisive? Is it, or is it creating harmony? And, and, and in all these cases really inquiring with the body, what's going on? What's going on, sweetheart? Well, if I'm tempted not to speak aligned with my highest values, what's going on, sweetie? What's going on? Can we reconnect? Can we reconnect with our intentions? Can we reconnect with our highest intentions? So, so that is our time this morning. Thank you so much for, for your practice. Thank you so much for your practice. May you be well. May all beings everywhere be well. Take good care, and we will continue tomorrow. Thank you.
