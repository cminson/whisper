 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello again. Good morning. How are you feeling? I see nods. Give me a few words. How are you feeling? Happy. Happy. Thank you. Content. Content. Peaceful. Peaceful. Connected and joyful. Settled. Settled. Settled. Nice. Nice. What else? And everything is welcome. If you're feeling steered up, that's fine too. Bring it on. I'm feeling calmer than I entered too. More settled. Yeah. Anything else? Anything else in the room you want to bring in? Ah, connected. Yeah. It's also a sense of connection. It's so nice to sit with people. I love Zoom. Don't get me wrong. I love the little squares. I've been, I've fallen in love with Zoom over the past three years, teaching a lot on Zoom. And yet, it's just a goodness also to the embodied presence, to the embodied presence. Yeah. So I bring that in. It's not sharing my reflections, but also for us to feel that there's something, especially for those who are in the room. And if you are joining us from YouTube, there is a Sangha, there's a YouTube Sangha to really feel into energetically. And yet here feeling into, yeah, it is nice. Sangha, community. Yay. How wonderful. Other human beings were on this path. Source of joy. So today I would like to share some reflections on gathering, collecting the mind, the heart. It's this sense of subtleness that many of you gave a shout out for. The sense of subtleness, calmness, happiness, contentment. All of these are in each other's neighborhood. And formally, formally, in the title or the topic of this talk is the Pali word is Samadhi, Samadhi or often translated as concentration. But concentration brings up the sense of concentrate. Whereas this word Samadhi is actually, it means to put together, to place together, to collect, to gather in the Chan tradition. Actually it's often translated as calm, abiding. Oh, I like that, right? It's a different translation. So concentration, calm, abiding. Feel that on your body, right? Concentration is like, okay, I got to concentrate. Remember math class. Again, for some people that works. If it works for you, go with it. But the idea again with that translation of concentration is to gather. When the orange juice is concentrated, it's gathered, it's collected, it's essence, right? Whereas we have, it's like a word map. We have so many different associations with the word concentration that sometimes it's not helpful, but calm, abiding, collectedness, gathering. And in fact, the word itself in Pali Samadhi comes, is from the prefix Sam, which means together and the Ruddha, which means to put or place. So to place together, to put together, to bring together. So unifying the mind in a steady, undistracted awareness in the words of Richard Shankman in his book Samadhi. So this idea of collectedness, collecting ourselves, which is that feels delicious, doesn't it? Oh yeah, collecting myself. Instead of being scattered, the opposite is being scattered, being everywhere. Collected, scattered. And especially in our modern life, I think as the speed of technology and communication and just the deluge of information in so many ways has increased, has increased social media, news, outlets, etc., etc., even entertainment outlets, just the number of entertainment options available, just so many ways we can get scattered. So raise your hand if you felt scattered at least one moment the past week. Two moments? Yeah, it's all hands go up. Of course it's our common humanity now. And in fact, I should have asked you to look around. It's our common, of course we get scattered. This is the condition of our lives right now in the West, actually everywhere in the world it turns out, but especially here in Silicon Valley and then the West in general. So to help to support ourselves, we want to collect ourselves, calm ourselves, collect ourselves. And so the question might arise, well, okay, why do I want to collect myself? Let's do the why. Let's do the how. How do I collect myself? Is it by force? Is it like, okay, now I'm going to collect myself. And push away all distractions like to have an aversive fighting attitude with everything, like every distraction, every noise, like stop, I'm collecting myself. Is it that that I'm making fun of it? Clearly not right? That's not the way to collect ourselves, but collecting ourselves really is through enjoyment and falling in love with peace, with contentment. That's the way it's done. There's no other way. It's not by the force of will and the whip like, okay, concentrate now. You can try that. It doesn't. It's, I'll say more about in a moment, but in praise of collectedness and praise of collectedness, I wanted to also share this quote, which I love by Thomas Merton, the celebrated famous Trappist monk who was also a good friend of his holiness, the Dalai Lama. They were buddies. So Thomas Merton, many of you might already know his name. I love this quote by him. There is a, and he said this, gosh, how many years ago now? Decades ago. I don't have the date of the quote, but decades and he's been dead for a while. So decades ago, there is a pervasive form of contemporary violence to which the idealist most easily succumbs activism and overwork. The rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form of its innate violence to allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything is to succumb to violence. The frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace. It destroys our own inner capacity for peace. It destroys the fruitfulness of our own work because it kills the root of inner wisdom, which makes work fruitful. Powerful words from a wise, wise being too many demands, too many projects, want to help everyone in everything. Do you identify with too many projects? Raise your hand. Too many. Yeah. So this, this, this, what he talks about, which we recognize this inner capacity for peace, this cultivate this inner capacity for peace to maintain that so that our outer work in the world is inspired, it comes out of that inner capacity, that inner holding of of peace, of stability, of stability. So now motivating, I'm trying to motivate a little bit, probably doesn't, I don't need to motivate why practicing, calm, abiding, settling, gathering is important, but I will just spell it out. It is the way that we create this, this fort, this stability, this sense of this, this, it's like a foundation, a rock solid foundation on which our work in the world is based and also our inner work of insight is based on calm. So the practice of calm, abiding, gathering, collecting, concentrating the mind, settling the mind, I'll just use the word settling the mind, the practice of cultivating samadhi to any extent possible. And they're quite a range and levels of, of, of depth of settle settling that our minds can cultivate. But at any level, cultivating samadhi is the precursor, is the precursor to insight is the precursor to insight internally and externally. If we don't have a settled and calm mind, we cannot clearly see it's not possible. So imagine your mind, you have binoculars, right? You're, and you're trying to look at your life. You're trying to look at your habit patterns. You're trying to look at the world, right? The lens of insight, the binoculars of insight. But if you don't have a stable base, if you don't put it on a tripod, if it's just moving, moving, moving, you can't really look, the image keeps shifting and changing. There needs to be stability so that you can take a breath. Oh, that's what's happening. Okay. So that building that that that tripod that we set the binoculars on for the sake of insight, and insight, by the way, is also another word for Vipassana, those who have been practicing for a while, Vipassana insight practice, seeing things as they are arising, passing all of that. And the precursor to that is samadhi is calming, settling the mind. And also if we take insight, because insights really are personal, we always have in this practice many times, maybe beginners think, okay, all these insights I hear about, I hear about impermanence, and I hear about not self, I especially want that not self thing that how do I get to that, that insight, like that sounds or emptiness, that's what I want. That sounds so cool. Give me some emptiness. Okay, slow down, slow down. It's from it starts from the personal. And when you have the insights that are in personal nature, then it extends to then you can see the universal, but you can jump into the universal, become spiritual bypass. If you start if you want to just see the universal and poo poo that in the personal I don't even exist I don't Yeah, the Buddha says there's no self not so yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, come back gets quiet down, calm down, slow down, cultivate some somebody some stability of the mind and get to see the insights, your own insights insights in the personal level. Oh, wow. I'm suffering. I'm really attached to this relationship that did not work. I'm really suffering. There's a lot of suffering here. Okay. All right. How do I work with this? I'm not suffering here. There's attachment, there's wanting, there's anger, the resentment, there's self blame. Wow. Okay. Okay, I'm going to start there. It's not like, okay, that's all personal. Forget it. I just want to go and chill out and do the not self thing because no, no, no, start. You have to start right because what can happen many different ways. Different people have different, but I'll just give one example. You know, you stay with, you stay with say, um, with the, the, um, the pain, the suffering. Okay. So the teachings, right. Mindfulness of the body is the first satipatana, the first foundation of mindfulness. Okay. So you start to feel the sensations in the body. Yeah. This really hurts. Ouch. This really hurts. And then by actually acknowledging the pain that, oh yeah, this really, really hurts. I'm really hurting right now. Oh, sweetheart, that arises compassion, compassion. Oh, which may not have been there because you were just kicking yourself. I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have done that. I was, I'm really hurting right now. I'm really hurting right now. So there can be a sense of compassion that arises. This really hurts. I'm really hurting. Oh, if I have actually compassion, kindness, ah, things are easier. And also the heart, it's not just easier, but also you get a sense, the mind, the heart can get a sense that, wow, other people are going through that too. Then the heart can open up to compassion for others. This is hard. Well, that other friend of mine who few months ago was going through something similar and I just like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was checking, you know, Facebook while we went the phone now. Oh, that ouch, ouch. Then your heart opens up. Oh, that was really, so in that way through your personal suffering, you open up to compassion, not just for yourself, but universally. So it's through the personal becomes the universal, for example, with compassion. Especially with all the other insights with impermanence, things arise and pass away. You just keep having, you have to keep noticing, seeing in detail. Yeah, it arises and passes away. I woke up this morning. Oh yeah, I was really, really upset. Oh, that mind state, that heart state, it's gone away. And then it starts to become universal. Everything is impermanent. Everything is impermanent. And then the next time something happens and you're in the midst of fear, like, oh, what if this never, so everything is impermanent. Yes, I know, I deeply know everything is impermanent. And impersonal. So let's talk about, I'm not tough, not self. In personality, you get to see when you really slow down and you get to see the mind states, you get to see the sensations in the body, they all arise and pass and you have no control. When you get to see you have no control over, say, aging over how this body recovers or doesn't recover from, say, a cut, like, wow, I can't do this. The body is doing this or all the other ways that there is no governability. You can start with the body, but there's so many different ways to have all of these insights. A gazillion ways to have these insights. But the point I want to make is it starts with the personal. That's the point I want to make. I don't want to give a 24 hour or 48 hour discourse on all the ways to have these insights because there's so many different ways. But the point is it starts with the personal insights and further back, pull back a little further, starts with having a calm, settled mind that is able to have the insights. If it's binoculars, you cannot have, you're just kind of, you're in the whirlwind of thoughts and entanglement, untangle it. Stabilize, put your foot down, sit down, rest, calm the body, calm the mind. So, so many, so many why's, so many why, why's to do, to practice calming, settling the mind. Okay, so I could continue, but you might say, okay, I'm all right. Yes. I'm signing up. So how do I do this? How do I settle? Well, as I've been intimating and also, also as I've been leading in the guided meditation, it is through enjoying, through loving, through finding contentment. Because when the mind is content, when the heart loves what's happening, it doesn't want to go anywhere. Think of a hobby you have, something you really enjoy doing. You just get absorbed and hours can go by. You may not even eat because you're so absorbed, you're loving what you're doing. So that's the kind of relationship to cultivate with practice. It's not a grim duty. I have to sit, you know, science says 30 minutes a day is good for my health. No, fall in love with it. Fall in love with it. That's the only way to do this. So there are different methods. So there are different techniques, lots of different objects for developing concentration, for developing collection of the mind and different techniques and ways and do this and do that. And yet the ethos, the way to approach it, all of them is similar. So I'll talk a little bit about both. So there are many different concentration objects, many different ways to collect the mind. So in the West, we tend to practice with mindfulness of the breath. That's our primary object. Yes, familiar with that one? Yeah, that's usually the anchor, right? We go to the breath. We see thoughts and tangled as muddy, go back to the breath or tune back to the breath. Yes, you're with me. Yeah. Everybody's had instructions on mindfulness of the breath. Yes. Okay, so that's primarily the object. However, there are 40 different objects in the Visuddhi Maga, which is the path of purification, this thousand page manual, 2000 year old manual, practice manual, which is wonderful and wonderfully obtuse and great. There are 30 different objects and one of them is the breath. And then there are the Brahma Viharas, the practices of the heart, for example, Metta, loving kindness and compassion and all the four Brahma Viharas, the four practices of the Heart, Mudita, Vaikhira's joy and the equanimity. Those four are some of the 40 different ways to really calm and collect the mind when you sit and wish yourself well or wish somebody else well and engage, really engage, stay, you stay with that practice. The mind collects and settles and becomes happy. Then there are a bunch of other objects, 10 of them, they're called the Cassinas and there are basically visualization objects for this practice. And some people actually, their minds take better to the visualization object. My favorite visualization object is what is called the White Cassina. In fact, I taught an online retreat at IRC at the end of last year and I'm teaching another one online. It's on my website in beginning of March. So the White Cassina is a just basically the color white and the mind can just settle and be absorbed and find peace just collecting with a white disc, white circle and becomes expansive. And some people report that it's actually easier for them to connect with that, a sense of purity and calm and subtleness compared to the breath. So there are many, many different objects, many, many different ways for the settling to happen. One thing to keep in mind with calming and collecting the mind around an object is the difference between Samatha practice, Samadhi, Samatha is the name of the practice, Samadhi is the state. So the practice of collecting the mind versus insight practice also translated as Vipassana. These two are a little different. So let me decode it for you. So with collecting the mind, you keep coming back to the same object. Keep coming back when other things happen, thoughts, etc. You say not now. You let them go. You let them go. You let, you keep coming back to the same object over and over and over again. Okay, compared to that, insight practice is the mind rests on say the sensations of the body for a while, sees the three characteristics, sees they're rising and passing and then moves to another object, moves to thoughts, sees they're arising and passing, etc. So, so it keeps moving from object to object to object. So in the words of Steve Armstrong, concentration practice is like absolute monogamy. You are dedicated to one object alone. It's just breath or it's just a white casino. That's it. Everything else, like it's distractions, you're just coming back. Then insight practice, maybe you start here, here's where gets so actually, let me share his word. So he calls insight practice or the passana to be a serial monogamy. So your monogamous, you give all your attention to one object, you know, the sensations of the body and then, oh, maybe Veda enough feeling tone. Oh, this is how it's changing and shifting. And then maybe thoughts. So they're rising and passing. So you're giving your heart to one object. You're really dedicated to it, but then another object, another object, another object. Okay. So what tends to get confusing for Western practitioners hearing this is wait, wait a minute. That's not how I practice. I, I start with the breath. I'm just staying with the breath. And then I've been taught as a Western practitioner, okay, then thoughts arise. Okay. Maybe I noticed thoughts arising. I pay attention to them a little bit and then I let them go and I come back to the breath. Right. Does that sound familiar for many of you? Okay. So that, that is called drive a passana. That's essentially the style that there are many, many different styles. So it's going in one level deeper. So so let's, so there are two, let's just for simplicity, say there are two different ways to practice the passana insight practice. One way is to spend days, weeks, months, years practicing samatha, collecting the mind. And when you really, really have a collected mind, settled mind, then you practice the passana, right? It's always a precursor, right? It's always a precursor. So always has to happen first. Okay. Right. That's one way. Not taught in the West. That's so there are some teachers who teach this way. My teacher pox I had a venerable pox I had a whom I studied with, you know, you practice the concentration, some return tilt jhanas and absorptions. You might've happened. So really deep states of concentration arise. And then only then you switch to the passana. Okay. That's one way. However, in the West, the Mahasi method, uh, that's mostly taught is kind of interleaved. So the Vipassana that Samatha gets interleaved with the Vipassana gets interleaved. That's why it's called drive a passana. So you start with a little bit of Samadhi, you calm and collect the mind. Right. And then, Oh, thought arises. Okay. Now it becomes a passana. Now you actually go to the thought and you see like, Oh yes. Distraction. Maybe you label it even. Yes. Labeling, noting anyone. Yeah. Like, Oh yeah. It's planning a self judgment. You get to see it. Then so you were still doing the passana with me. Now we let go of it and we come back. So we're now doing what we're doing Samatha practice, right? Calming the mind, stabilizing it a little bit so that we have enough stability the next time. Oh, backache. Oh, tight, moving tension. Right. You get to investigate, investigate in the body a little bit. Now you're doing what? Vipassana. Yes. You were doing good. Vipassana. Then after a while, the body doesn't attract your attention this much. Right. The instructions are you let it go. You come back to the breath. Now you're doing what? Samatha. Yes. So you see how it's interleaved. Yeah. Whereas in this other style, you're just doing like Samatha day and night and day and night and like after months, like, okay, now we're going to do Vipassana. It's just like, okay, now you're ready. Now you're just going to investigate all, all phenomena. So and having said that it is helpful. It is helpful if your mind is, is, or heart is, is drawn to it to take some time in your practice to settle the mind a little more, to just create more settledness through these various practices. So I want to come back to joy. I also want to say because this is so important, so important. So this is from Ajahn Suchito, respected monk in, in this tradition. So about practice of Samadhi, this is what he says. I think of enjoyment as receiving joy and Samadhi as the art of refined enjoyment. It is the careful collecting of oneself to the joy in the present moment. Joyfulness means there is no fear, no attention, no out to, there isn't anything we have to do about it. So there is stillness. Just this. Right? So, so cultivating Samadhi, collecting the mind, of course there is engagement, right? You have to engage, but it's not effortful. It's enjoyment. It's tuning into the joy of the moment, joy of the breath. Remember I was inviting you to fall in love with the breath. You know, what is content? Can you enjoy this moment? Can you relax? So relaxing the body is very important. If the body is tight, getting it to settle is really hard. Here's another quote about, about the use of pleasure in, in calming, collecting the mind. It's from Tanisara Bhikkhu, another celebrated monk in this tradition. How do you use pleasure? Focus on the breath right now. Of course he's talking about mindfulness of the breath as the object. Focus on the breath right now and see how it feels. Then experiment with the breath to see how the way you breathe can produce either pleasure or pain. It may be subtle, the difference between the two, but it's there. We've learned to desensitize ourselves to this aspect of our awareness. So it's going to take a while to re-sensitize ourselves, to begin seeing the patterns. This is why we practice. Keep coming back to the breath. Keep coming back to the breath. Try to get more sensitive to this area of your awareness, more skilled at learning how to maximize the potential for pleasure right here and now, simply by the way you breathe, not only producing pleasure, but also maintaining it. After all, feelings of pleasure and rapture are part of the path. They are tucked in the Noble Eightfold Path, right under right concentration, right under right concentration. As part of the path, they may have to be developed and maintained. As the Buddha said, this pleasure is blameless. So there's a lot of pleasure and enjoyment through the practice, the cultivating samadhi, samatha, this calm, collected mind that for some people starts to get addicted, like, oh, I want that pleasure. Like, okay, let that go. That's also impermanent. But they get so much pleasure and so much calm, collectedness, which again, the point is not to check out in it, but to use it as a basis for our life, for our insight, for our service, for the way we show up in the world. Anyway, there's a lot more I can say and I think I'm going to end now. And maybe if you're interested, you'll come and I'll teach you about the White Casino online in a few weeks, but I think I'll end there. This is endless. This is just so, so joyous, this topic and this cultivation and sharing it and also just igniting perhaps igniting the delight and interest in others. It's a practice that's been so meaningful to me in my practice. Both dry vipassana, this interleaving, I've done that for many years before practicing with my teacher, Paksaheda. So I hope the reflections today were of service of to your practice, your awakening and let's dedicate the goodness of our practice to all beings everywhere. May the goodness of our practice, our attention, our inspiration, our co-created goodness, may they serve all beings everywhere in their goodness, in their awakening. May all beings everywhere be free, be awake, including ourselves. Thanks for your attention everyone. Thank you, Nikki. We also have a community tea. So if you feel like hanging out with a Sangha, I think that's happening today. Thank you.
