The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

I wanted to read a wonderful passage from the Teachings of the Buddha that the Buddha talks about.
It says, it is enough. It's enough to do this. This is a good enough wonderful life.
This is enough. If you just do this with your life somehow, something like that.
So rather than thinking this is like a high standard, something, but maybe it is, but this is enough.
This is a wonderful way. This would be enough. If you just did this, it would be enough.
Practicing for your own welfare is enough.
Practicing for the welfare of others is enough.
Practicing for the welfare of both the self and others is enough.
There's a little bit more than that. There's a little bit of a paraphrase of the text.
But here we are practicing, hopefully, for our welfare and the welfare of others.
And this week we looked at the Four Noble Truths.
And the wording of the Four Noble Truths is, to me, very simple, the wording itself, but very evocative.
So one way it's evocative is that there are no pronouns in it.
It says one understands the Noble Truth of suffering.
One understands the Noble Truth of the arising of suffering.
One understands the Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering.
And one understands the Noble Truth of the practice leading to the cessation of suffering.
And there's no pronouns there.
It's not emphasizing one's own suffering or the suffering of others.
And I like to interpret this to mean that when we practice, we are available to recognize suffering wherever it is in ourselves and the world around us.
And that it can be equally our care to care for the suffering of others that is care for ourselves.
Each of them is enough, this little text Sutta says.
And someone else, it's in the Samyutta, Book 12, Sutta 22.
And each is enough, but whatever we're at, paying attention to the suffering of others, if that's what's salient, that's what's prominent, that's enough, that's good.
Paying attention to our own suffering, that's good as well.
Doing both here it says is enough, but I think that doing both is really the best.
Because if we only pay attention to the suffering of others, but not our own, we can easily say and act in ways that cause more harm for ourselves and for others.
If we only pay attention to our own suffering, then it's too easy for that to reinforce self-involvement, self-preoccupation, selfishness of a certain kind.
And it's too easy then to not pay enough attention to the suffering of others to similarly cause harm.
Because we don't understand people, we don't know the impact we're having or what is supportive for people.
But to be able to do both is a phenomenal thing.
And one of the phenomenal aspects of keeping the Four Noble Truths at the center of Buddhist practice, it's a form of self-protection and protection for others.
Because we notice when we start becoming uncomfortable, tense, stressed, destressed, we stop and pay attention to that.
This is worth understanding, this is worth looking at.
And that's a very different approach than just barreling ahead with the suffering, kind of being preoccupied in a way that reinforces it.
But with this special awareness we're developing and mindfulness, the ability to kind of, in a metaphorical way, step back and know it.
Be conscious of it, where being knowing and conscious of it is in some ways more important than the content in what's happening.
Where the knowing of it is where some freedom is found.
And where the knowing of it gives us information about how maybe to correct, do a course correction.
If you notice the shoulders are tense, that's maybe simple to relax the shoulders.
If we notice we're attached to some outcome, maybe that's not so easy to let go of that.
Or we're holding on to some pain attached to suffering.
That's not so easy to let go of.
But slowly we begin to learn to have this different relationship to suffering.
Where it doesn't, it's not driving the show, it's not confusing us or preoccupying us in some deep way.
We're learning this ability to step back and be conscious so that in that consciousness there's some ease, some freedom.
And there's the information we need to maybe do course corrections.
So that's how it's protective.
So that works, for example, in meditation practice.
At some point we become aware that we're straining, maybe.
We're trying too hard.
Or we have an expectation that should be different.
We have this idea that I'm not doing it well.
Those kinds of thoughts and that kind of strain, probably you can feel some discomfort around having them.
Some dukkha, some strain or stress.
And if you notice it, then you're on the road to becoming free of it.
Especially if you've developed this capacity to be consciously aware.
In this very clear way that we're talking about today.
And then we can make a course correction.
We can maybe change what we're doing as well.
So we're not so much focused on the content of what we know.
And we're not necessarily focused on the process of what's happening.
But we're prioritizing being conscious of it.
Some people might feel that that's not enough, that that's dangerous,
or we're not going to take care of ourselves properly.
But what happens is, as we can be relaxed and open and conscious in this kind of effortless way,
that then we have access to deeper places of wisdom within.
Deeper knowing.
We have time for some deeper process to unfold.
And to reference what we say and what we do,
we can reference it against or with this freedom,
or this spaciousness, or this ease of this kind of knowing.
So to be, so the Four Noble Truths,
and instead of trying to understand what they mean,
which is appropriate, I hope you understood more this week what I mean,
but to also remember how important the word to understand, to know,
to know each one, and the knowing grows,
the capacity to know present moment awareness, present moment conscious awareness can grow.
So it becomes a place of abiding, of resting, a place of freedom,
where we discover that in a deep way,
what we're looking for in practice, in a deep way, the freedom, the peace,
what we're looking for, maybe is not found in what we're trying to understand,
but it's found in our capacity to understand.
It's not found in what we're trying to know,
but it's found in the knowing itself.
And that's a paradigm shift.
May you appreciate your knowing, your ability to be conscious,
to be attentive, to be aware.
May you, over this weekend, try to go through the day periodically,
tapping into or exploring what I talked about today,
about this value of understanding, knowing, and being conscious
in this kind of effortless way we're used to receive.
And see what you learn.
See what you learn, how difficult it is, when it's easy,
what benefits come from it,
even if you just have a little hints of it from here and there.
And then Monday we'll start the last week on these four foundations of mindfulness.
Now that we've gone through all the exercises,
there's a foundation for bringing it to a close.
So thank you very much and look forward to Monday.
