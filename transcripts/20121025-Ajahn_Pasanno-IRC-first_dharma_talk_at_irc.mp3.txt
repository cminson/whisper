Let's pay a short homage to the Buddha and the triple jamb, and then I'll begin speaking after. 
So, what do you say after Indian production like that? There's, of course, many things are popping up in my mind as appropriate to follow up on. 
There we go. 
Okay, there we go. 
Okay, that will keep people happy. 
So, there's several themes that popped up in my mind that I think would be worth exploring. 
And, of course, first of all, to express my appreciation to Gil for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to meet you all, see the place, and to be a part of this adventure of sort of IRC, Inside Retreat Center. 
And I particularly appreciate the fact that Gil is wanting to establish this place as a place that functions on Dana. 
And that, to me, is a very important example that is worthy of bringing into our culture the opportunity to give, to share, to be a part of a whole culture of generosity is something that is, you know, I think really essential as a maturing of Buddhism coming to America. 
On a certain level, the, say, the amount of centers there are, or the number of people, or the number of PhD graduates in Buddhist studies get pumped out of universities, doesn't necessarily, to me, indicate a real taking on of the principles of the Buddha. 
Whereas I think a commitment to generosity and sharing and a real fundamental kindness and virtue are, you know, that's when it's really seeping into the cells and the bones. 
And that, to me, is really important and to be able to have places that model that. 
And of course, a monastery's model that to a degree, and to a large degree, but to be able to have a, within the lay society, to be able to model that and to set those examples is, to me, extremely. 
Extremely important and wonderful to see. 
Of course, I was trained in Thailand, I lived there for 23 years, so that was what I grew up with. 
And that, I think one of the things that is important in the way we perceive our own practice is when we perceive that we're practicing, in order to give to the practice, rather than to get something from it. 
And that's a very different shift. 
And it's when we, I think that's when we really start growing, is when we recognize that I can be, and taking the different opportunities to give to the practice, give to situations that support practice, give to however the teachings are manifest. 
And so that having a retreat center like this, which is really going to be an opportunity for people to give, to share, to support, and be a part of. 
So that, because this is where, that's really where community is built. 
When we give and come from that heart of generosity, there's a connection that grows as just very natural as human beings. 
So that, and I'm sure there's going to be all sorts of challenges and glitches and various difficulties, because it is a new model. 
But I think that having a commitment to that, and having a, I mean, this, I assume is really a core group of family that has been a part of supporting this. 
And as a, having the opportunity to help each other bring this to the Santa Cruz Mountains, to come to the Peninsula area, to Bay Area, to America. 
I mean, these are things that you can all be sharing and giving. 
And recognizing that that one is giving to something that is, is actually, it's not personal. 
I think that's one of the things that is, is important that when we, when we can, you know, what comes to mind is the, there's a, after the, after the Buddha was enlightened, the Buddha was reflecting on his own kind of, on a certain level, a dilemma. 
Here he is, fully enlightened being, and he'd been looking for enlightened teachers, he'd been looking for enlightened friends, he'd been looking for other awakened beings, and he hadn't really found them. 
And then after his commitment to practice and training and, and his wisdom and effort came to fruition in his own awakening and liberation, he's thinking, you know, who do I, you know, it's natural for us as human beings to want to pay respects, to give respect to others. 
Now, who do I, who do I respect? And when I look around, I don't see anybody else who's, who's awakened. 
And then, and then it was, and then he continues his reflection and says, oh, you know, what is, is, is, is worthy of my, always worthy of my respect is, is the Dhamma. 
This, this, this truth, these teachings, this reality of, of existence. 
And so that, that was, and so that he always held Dhamma as the, as what was always foremost in his, in his mind. 
So what in accorded with truth, what accorded with reality, this is, this is what the Buddha always referred back to. 
And of course, that's a, a wonderful example for all of us. 
What is it that we're looking for? What is it that accords with, with, with Dhamma? What is it that accords with truth? And to, to be, be able to be, yeah, to be respectful, to be differential, to, to hold that dear. 
And to, and to look for the ways that we can accord with that, with that truth, so that we, we align with it. 
So our practice, our practice ends up being not just a meditation technique, meditation technique, or, or a retreat that we do from time to time. 
But it's all of our actions of body, speech, and mind that we bring into, into our, into our daily life. 
And of course, that's what comes into our practice. 
When we're able to really hold that clearly, when we come to sit and meditate, it's actually not that complicated. 
It was, I was, I was talking to the monks the other day and, and, and I was saying how frustrating it was sometimes being with Ajahn Chah and asking for meditation instruction. 
And, and Ajahn Chah sort of said, you know, because he would, when he would give meditation instruction, it would be, it would be sort of like, well, you know, you sit down, cross-legged, and then you, you keep, you know, keep your posture erect and alert. 
And then you pay attention to the in-breath and the out-breath, and then you do that again. 
And then, you know, and then your mind gets peaceful. 
You know, and like, you know, what's the big deal? But it's, so it's, because it's, I think, again, they sort of using the, because we tend to think, oh, what sort of, I'm not getting quite the right technique, or I haven't got quite got the right method. 
So I need another method to augment my, my, my spiritual practice so I can, I can get my mind peaceful. 
But if we come back a few steps and come, those foundations of, of, yeah, of respect, of reverence, of, of having that fundamental right view of what is it that's, that's, that's really true? What is it that's, that's worthy of, of our, of our attention? What is it that, that is actually truly beneficial and worthwhile? And that, that, that's a, so that when one sits meditation, yeah, that's not very complicated. 
You just keep, there's a lot of, of joy and light that comes from that. 
So that, that, that coming back to, to, to fundamental principles and particularly those, those themes of, of generosity and, and virtue, goodness. 
These are, these are fundamentals that really nurture the heart and, and being able to both, you know, it's a, it's a practice, it's training that we keep, keep plugging that in. 
But then it's also, it's as manifest here, learning how to, to take the opportunity to, to give so that it's a benefit of, to others. 
And that's a, a source of great, great, great clarity, really, because the mind becomes very, there's a joy that's there. 
And those are, are, I mean, there's a, there's a, a tendency for us. 
And, and it really is us of, of the, I think, just in the human condition and us as meditators of the, and certainly myself as beginning practice of really thinking, you know, when I get my meditation together, I'm going to be happy. 
And, and it's, and it's, you know, it's a, a, that's a valid pope. 
But the Buddha doesn't actually teach that way, because what he teaches is it, get your happiness together and your meditation sorted out. 
That's, and it's really, it's very interesting. 
It's stock phrases in the sutras that many, many discourses where he begins with, these are sort of the, again, setting out the different conditions, the condition nature of, of, of the mind. 
And he begins from different places, like the virtue or wise reflection or, or even sometimes from, from dukkha, from suffering. 
But it's through, through faith, confidence. 
But then it goes into different starting points, but then it goes into stock, these stock phrases that of, with these different conditions, there's the arising of well-being and pamoja. 
And, and with the arising of well-being and there's what, what comes to be is, is a quality of joy. 
Joy is a condition, there's the arising of, of tranquility. 
With tranquility is a condition, there's the arising of happiness. 
With happiness there's a condition, there's the arising of samadhi or of steady stability of mind, concentration, meditative stillness. 
And, and some, some of the discourses, the Buddha actually stops there and, and he actually explicitly says, the happy mind is easily concentrated. 
And, and it's, so that, that, that sense of, of attending to the things that, that, that nurture those qualities of well-being. 
And we're, we're thinking of the, the aspects of respect and reverence. 
The, the Buddha, there's a discourse where the Buddha points to five things which are, say, worthy of reverence. 
Of course, and one is, of course, one is the, say, the teacher, the Tathagata, the Buddha himself, and the Dhamma, the teachings. 
Sangha, the, the, the community that has held the teachings. 
And then the next one is the training. 
In the sense of one has that kind of respect and reverence to the, the recognition that what the Buddha has given us is, is a training. 
Because, you know, so many religions, philosophies, you know, have an intelligent people can really talk about high ideals and how the world should be and how you should be. 
And, and, but the Buddha doesn't really approach it from that way. 
He said, here's a training. 
This is, take this, take the human condition and work within it, train within it, develop the skills of being a, a wise human being. 
And, you know, there'll be fruits. 
So that, that's into that respect for, for training. 
And then the last thing that the Buddha says is worthy of, of respect and reverence is the qualities of hospitality is the, is maybe a way to translate it and sort of like looking after others. 
And so that, that, that, again, the sense of, this is a place that's being created that you can take those principles and, and bring that, that sense of, of implementing that respect. 
And then giving other people the opportunity to come into contact with, with something that, where there is this respect for, for the Buddha, for, let's say, an awakened, an example of an awakened being in, in the, in the world. 
The, the dhamma, the teachings, the, the sangha, the, the training itself and, and that, that, that sense of welcoming and, and being one who was, because that's where that generosity comes in. 
There's that sense of, of honoring and, and welcoming and creating spaces where people feel, feel welcomed and, and looked after. 
So that these, these aspects of, of our, of our, of our practice. 
These are, are things that, you know, again, it's, it's, it's helpful to keep things practical. 
We're down having tea with Gil before coming up here. 
And, and I said, Gil, what you really need is a maintenance manual. 
You need a database and a maintenance manual. 
These are, so that, you know, these are, I think the, the, the Buddha is, is, has a similar kind of approach where, yeah, there, there are these opportunities we have for peace and tranquility and, and meditation. 
But yeah, we'd also have to learn to look after things in a practical way. 
And, and particularly when it's a, it's like a meditation center. 
There's, there'll be many people that will, will, will be here and, and just everybody learning how to, to take it on or perceive it as our, our retreat center. 
It's not Gil's retreat center. 
Sort of like our retreat center. 
So that, that, that, that people are, are willing to, to help out and, and, and take responsibility. 
The, and that, and that just, I mean, I gave a reflection to the, to the monks this morning on, in the early morning, after our breakfast, I give a short reflection. 
Or, and one of the other senior monks, somebody will give a short reflection on how to take things into, into daily life and, and sort of how to apply the teachings in our ongoing practice of living together in the monastery. 
And I, I used it, used the theme of, of a cartoon that the assistant abbot, Geniatiko, just got from his mother. 
And cartoon is, is of a, it's, it's like in a Christian setting environment and there's a, looks like a senior monk in the front and then sort of a, kind of a row of, of other monks in, in, in front of him. 
And the, the caption is, most of you, some of you newcomers will, will know our, our philosophy here. 
Monkey see, monkey do. 
Which is, I thought was, they may not have, I mean, it was done as a play on words. 
They may not have actually seen the implications of it. 
But that sense of, oh yeah, you see something that needs to be done and you do it and you see something that, that should be rectified, should be fixed and you do it. 
And that's, that taking, taking responsibility and taking it on and, and, and everybody helping and sort of that, that sense of it. 
When we, when we all live in a place and it's, we perceive it as, as ours. 
And you know, that's what, that's what community is in Sangha, where we really take responsibility for, for each other and for, for the place. 
So that, that's important. 
And there's a phrase that Ajahn Amaro used to use from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
That was, when things were, something wasn't being done or something was being laughed or something was being assumed but being neglected. 
It's, it gathers an SEP field around it, which an SEP field is somebody else's problem. 
So that, yeah, in a place like this, in a retreat center and just keeping, and people keeping their eyes open and making sure that SEP fields aren't, aren't, aren't sort of coming into being in different places. 
So that, you know, these are, are, are ways of, of reflecting and, and perceiving the, the actual place that we practice and train in. 
And, and it's, and is a training. 
And when, when that's taken as a training, then you start seeing, oh, I, I, I give to the training. 
It isn't sort of, I get from, because you do get from the training, but you get in, in, in the same, you get back what you put into it. 
So that sense of really paying attention to how, how one is, is, is giving to it. 
Because in the end, it's, you know, it really is, is a lot of the, the, the practice, the tools that we, we rely on, tools of, of renunciation. 
The, the, I'm assuming that everybody here is here on the first retreat and, and you've all been practicing for a long time, got a lot of experience in, in practice. 
And, but it's, it's, it's really, I think, important to be, be recognizing the, that our practice has to be grounded in a certain ethos. 
And so that the, so both that ethos of giving, but then also giving up of renunciation and renunciation, if renunciation isn't palatable, that relinquishment, letting go. 
And these, these are, they're, they're, they have a, a similar, because sometimes we think the whole renunciation, I'm really losing something or giving up something. 
But it's actually, one is, what, what one relinquishes is the, you know, that releasing of that which is a burden anyway. 
So it's incredible relief when we recognize, well I was really able to put that down. 
And that, and the, the mind becomes even brighter. 
And Ajahn Chah used to say that there was, there's only, only two things you need to do in, in practice. 
Know and let go. 
Just those two things, that establishing of awareness, establishing of clarity and establishing of attention. 
So that there's a, a clear knowing and then a, a letting go or relinquishing a, a willingness not to, not to cling on to, whether it's externally in terms of the world or objects of our, of our senses or internally our own opinions, views, moods, feelings, projections, whatever. 
It's not that we don't have them or don't, that they're not there. 
But it's, they're held in a, in a place of knowing and letting go. 
So you don't have to actually push anything away. 
You don't need to, you don't need to, to try to get rid of anything. 
Because one, it isn't yours anyway. 
And, and it isn't, it isn't stable either. 
So that was like one, the first, very first time that Ajahn Chah went to, went to England. 
This was his first trip to the West and, and, and then a, there's actually at a, at a, at a Tibetan retreat center monastery as well. 
It was a monastic presence. 
And somebody came to, to ask a question about practice and, and, and they asked Ajahn Chah what, you know, you know, how do I just have such a problem with anger and ill will and how do I, how do I, how do I deal with it? How do I get rid of it? How do I let go of it? And, and Ajahn Chah, oh, that's easy. 
So just next time you get, get angry, just get an alarm clock and set it for two hours and see if you can hold that mood for two hours. 
See if you can do that. 
Which was sort of just the total opposite of what, what, of course, what the person was, you know, thinking or assumed Ajahn Chah would probably give some kind of, oh, you just need to develop in kindness or blah, blah, blah. 
And it's just, it's, it's just pointing really directly at the impermanent, unstable, uncertain nature of whatever we experience. 
And even the moods that we, that you think define yourself, they're not, they're not stable. 
I mean, there's, they're, they're there because we keep identifying with them. 
But that doesn't make them stable. 
It just means we identify with them. 
So it's seeing clearly, oh, wow, that's, that's its nature. 
And of course that's, you start seeing things in accordance with dharma. 
And, and that's, that's really the function of our, of our practice. 
So that as we, we continue to brand, how many days is this, this retreat for? Three nights. 
We've got this, these three nights and, and you know, to take the time to, to be, be practicing and, and, and cultivating. 
But pay, pay attention to the, the meditation, pay attention to the technique, pay attention to the, the kind of the effort and energy that you put into it. 
But pay attention to how you hold the, the, the, the, the practice itself. 
There's a, there's a very beautiful, very short discourse in, in the Sangyuta Nikaya, where, and it's the, at the beginning with the, the, there's a lot of poems and, and verses. 
And a lot of them are quite short. 
And this one is in the Davis Sangyuta. 
So it's sort of the discourse, sort of the discourses and conversations that the Buddha had with Davis. 
And anyway, there's many of them are poems that are, or verses that are presented to the Buddha as a expression of, of that being's understanding, or that person's understanding. 
And then the Buddha will either approve of it and, or he'll, or he'll kind of try to correct that so that it's, it's more beneficial. 
And, and then this, this one particular discourse is one where the, it's sort of as, as if smitten by a sword, as if one's head were on fire, one should, the monk should wander mindfully for the relinquishing of sensual desire. 
You just think, that's pretty good. 
That effort and that focus on, on, on sensual desire, which, which the Buddha points to as a basis of suffering. 
But the Buddha immediately takes it and, and basically repeats it, phrase, as if smitten by a sword, as if one's head were on fire. 
The monk should wander mindfully for the overcoming of identity view. 
So it's the, the, that identity is the desire. 
Yeah, I mean, it's there. 
But what feeds it is the identification. 
And the, what all the other manifestations of, of the, the kind of the stains of the mind are not so much the, their obviously have their painful result and complication and whatnot. 
But what really feeds it is that identification and identity. 
This is, this is, this is mine. 
This is who I am. 
This is myself. 
That's, that's that fundamental misapprehension of, of, of, of truth, of kind of the way things are. 
And we say, when we take Dhamma as refuge, then yeah, it's not just in abstract teachings. 
It's in the, it's in the kind of fundamental view of how, how, how the world works, how us as human beings work. 
And to be able to, to keep returning to that investigation of, of where is that, where are those seeds of, of identification. 
And of course, this is where the Buddha, I mean, there's many different ways that the Buddha points to one of the most frequent is, is the, say the five khandhas, five aggregates of being, form, feeling, perception. 
Mental formations, consciousness, and the, the different ways that, that, that we, we create that sense of identity. 
This is who I am. 
I'm my body or I have a, a painful feeling and it's just oppressed by, I'm oppressed by this painful feeling. 
Or I'm able to experience this happiness and well-being. 
And so this is who I really am. 
But it's that, that, that, that kind of slipping into the identification that is the problem. 
And because it sets oneself up for, for separation from the, from, from what one has perceived as reality. 
And then the, the bumping up to, to things not being the way one wants them to be. 
So that, that, that sense of, of, of investigation, of, of what we, what we identify with, how we do it. 
And there's a discourse where the Buddha points to a, there's a, there's a certain principle that the Buddha talks about in many places, which is in, in the scriptural language is that dhamma-nu-dhamma-patibhata, practicing dhamma in accordance with dhamma. 
So that, that in itself is a kind of a, a mouthful to, to reflect on. 
But it's, it's a, it's actually one of the, the conditions that the Buddha points to as a, as a condition for the arising of stream entry. 
So that, that there, actually the Buddha points to two, two external conditions, two internal conditions. 
And then there's a, a drawing close to, to association with, with, with good beings, with good spiritual beings. 
And then hearing, hearing, hearing the true dhamma, hearing good teachings. 
And then, so those are external conditions, internal conditions are wise reflection, skillful attention. 
And then the last one, practicing dhamma in accordance with dhamma. 
And because you reflect on it, there's, there's, there's so many ways that, you know, dhamma can be, you know, we can practice dhamma with confusion, we can practice dhamma with greed, we can practice dhamma out of compulsion, we can practice dhamma out of feeling of duty and, you know, all these different ways we can, we can do it. 
But that practicing dhamma in accordance with dhamma, and when the Buddha defines it, he said, it's just taking these, these five aggregates of being and, and reflecting, investigating, contemplating these, these, these five aggregates of being. 
And so that we're practicing dhamma in accordance with dhamma is, is manifested or implemented by this contemplation of form, the body, physical, physical form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness. 
And so when, when one contemplates those, those aggregates of being over and over, more and more clearly, one understands them. 
And one understands these five aggregates of being. 
And, and when one understands form, feeling, perception, mental formation, consciousness, one is released from them. 
So let's say this willingness to sort of be, and when one is released from them, one is released from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, all of the, the things where we really want, where we should be willing to be done with. 
So they sense, oh yeah, these are, these are fundamentals of, of, of the practice. 
So bringing it back to that, that, that, that fundamental, just knowing and letting go, knowing and letting go. 
And, and there's that knowing of these, these, it isn't sort of the, the, the kind of astute accumulation of, of more philosophical debate. 
But it's, it's coming back and investigating our own experience. 
And we've, so that we have all of the, the, the basis of, of our, of, say, successful and fruitful practice right here with this body, this mind. 
It's not, it's not far away. 
It's not, not, not, and it's not anywhere else. 
So we can be using these, these, these, these circumstances, both in terms of retreat, formal meditation, but that same contemplation, learning how to carry that into our, our, our interactions, our, our, our taking on of, of responsibility, of being, being a human being. 
One of the teachers in Thailand, Ajahn Buradasa, one of the ways that he would say that, say, from the scriptural language, the word that is used as a human being is, is someone with a kind of a developed heart. 
And that's a, you know, that's what is, what defines us as human beings. 
And one is the, that we are capable of developing our hearts and developing our, our, our wholesome qualities. 
And that we, we take that opportunity and, and, and use it. 
And so that as, as, you know, having, having taken human birth and had the opportunity to come into contact with the Buddhist teachings and come into contact with situations that are able to support us in our practice, then to put forth the, put forth the effort and then, and then also be able to share it with others. 
So I think I'll leave it there for today. 
Thank you very much. 
Yes. 
I mean, that's the thing is this is, we have no idea where this is going. 
And it's great. 
You know, these are such early days of, you think of, you know, the taking of, of Buddhism into China and took several hundred years to really, before it really kind of took hold and started to gain momentum. 
And actually even now, I wonder if things Reverend Heng Shui told me is that in China, Buddhism is still registered as a foreign religion. 
So it's, it's, and places like Tibet, Japan, I mean, it's, it's always, it's, you look at the history and it's always gone in waves and it takes what it takes, it takes time to, to, to, to really put down roots. 
And so like in, in Thailand, there's no real clear understanding of when Buddhism really came and how it was established. 
They don't, they don't have a sense of a historical sense. 
So that, you know, a lot of it goes sort of into mythology and it's only really clear around the 12th, 12th or 13th century that they're starting to be a real written, written chronicles. 
And here in, in America, it's still, still very early days. 
It might be useful for us to remember that we're kind of novices. 
We weren't not going to figure it out in our generation. 
Yeah. 
We're laying the groundwork. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
And that's why, why that, that, that my, you know, things that I was speaking about really trying to get people to reflect on what the foundations are and recognizing that the foundations that you lay for other people will, they can continue to build on that. 
And those, those principles when they're, they're laid down, they're not really, they don't get worn out. 
It's like Ajahn Chah used to say that one of the images that he used of, of, you know, practicing so that our, say, yeah, that our, our practice is grounded in Dhamma. 
He said it's, it's like, you know, you really want to be encouraging yourself to really ground it in, in, in true Dhamma, you know, practicing Dhamma in accordance with Dhamma. 
He said, because it's like, he said, it's like, if you've got, because we all exist on water, we need to have drinking water. 
And so that one of the things that, that is commonly used in, in Thailand for, for drinking water is to have these big earthen jars and collect rainwater, which you then use through the year, which is great rainwater is very pure. 
But if there's a long dry season, you run out or it gets, it gets broken somehow and you run out of water. 
He said it's, you need to be able to really put the effort in to dig a well where the water is right down into the water, where it's right down in the water table and that the water is always, always there for you. 
He said, that's what, when we practice Dhamma in accordance with Dhamma, it's like having a well that's always, the water is always there for you. 
It's right down to the roots. 
Do you want to open it up for questions or? Yeah, yeah, I'm happy to come all this way. 
I'm happy to answer questions. 
If anybody wants. 
Bante, would you give an example of practicing Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma sort of everyday example that we could know what you mean by that? Well, you know, a lot of things that I even said in terms of, yeah, not letting SEP fields gather around things. 
You know, say, yeah, well, somebody will do it. 
Whereas seeing something and saying, oh, that needs to be done. 
I'll do it. 
I mean, that sort of, it comes from, you know, there's a certain clarity, a willingness to sort of give up one's own kind of, because everybody, you know, everybody wants to be comfortable, not have to do much. 
So I mean, that in itself, you know, coming back into this is rooted in Dhamma or the choices that we make in terms of virtuous conduct and precepts. 
It isn't sort of a moral principle that I've got to hold, because, you know, there's some Buddha or Bodhisattva holding the club of the precepts over here. 
It's sort of like, oh, yeah, this is how to act with integrity. 
This is how to act with care for others. 
That's like one of the things that the ways that the Buddha talked about precepts as being the five great gifts. 
So that the gift of the five precepts being action is a giving of security, a giving of safety, a giving of trust. 
And that's in accordance with Dhamma. 
So rather than, you know, we're keeping precepts because we feel guilty if we don't, or fearful for some reason or other, or any number of reasons, but that it's rooted in recognizing that this is conduct that's in accordance with Dhamma and in accordance with truth. 
And then it becomes this wonderful gift, because the degree of trust and dynamics of human interactions change. 
There's a really great example of that with Master Xu Yun, who was a very revered Chinese monk from the last century into the middle. 
He lived to be 120, and many incredible stories about him. 
But one of the things that he did, he did a lot of pilgrimages, these three steps in one bow, across China. 
And then he did a lot of traveling sometimes to establish monasteries or teach meditation retreats. 
I mean, there's a transcript of a meditation retreat that he gave when he was 114 or 116 or something. 
But on one of these occasions when he was traveling, he was on a bus. 
And it was in the period of kind of the conflict between the nationalists and the communists and a lot of instability in the country. 
So a group of bandits stopped the bus and got on board. 
They had weapons and they were taking valuables from everybody. 
And then Master Xu Yun was sitting and they came up to him and they sort of saw he was a monk and an old monk. 
He said, reverend or venerable, we're sorry we don't want to kind of inconvenience you, but this is kind of, it's not great conduct, but that's what we're about these days. 
And we respect you and don't want to harm you, so we'll just leave you as you are. 
And Master Xu Yun just sort of looked at them very kind of kindly and said, if you really believed that, you would give all of that back to these people. 
And that was it. 
And then they would just totally confuse them and befuddled them. 
And then they just started giving it all back and then got off the bus. 
I'm sure they were saying, what the heck happened there? But it's sort of like that contact with somebody who really holds virtue. 
And it has a different feeling. 
So it's a gift, incredible gift. 
So part of what I hear you saying is that practicing Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma is in some deeply esoteric thing that will confuse us. 
Yeah, I hope not. 
Yeah, absolutely. 
Because I think there are certain equations that we follow. 
Sort of, yeah, no pain, no gain. 
I'll be happy when I get my meditation together. 
And the more complicated I can think about this, the more profound it must be. 
There are assumptions to be reflected on. 
Okay, there you go. 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
No, absolutely. 
I mean, that's the nature of the Buddha's path, that there are these loops going around. 
And that was actually Ajahn Chah's first trip to the West, went to England. 
And rather than stop lights, they go to these traffic circles. 
And he said, oh, this is just like Dhamma. 
It's just like the Eightfold Path. 
It's always these loops going around. 
And that really is, it's always feeding back. 
And if you think it's a point A to point B like this, that's when it gets a bit complicated. 
And when you realize, yeah, there's. 
. 
. 
So it's like learning how to plug into the things that keep those feedback loops going. 
Feeding, giving nutriment to. 
So it can be kind of hard to know where to begin in the dog. 
Well, the thing is, is you don't actually have to know, you know, in the sense of, you know, if you're looking for the absolute beginning and then really defining the end really clearly. 
I mean, the end has a certain feeling, but that sense of, you know, if you pick up the path at any point, it leads you in. 
And you just keep developing it. 
And it's just like, you know, picking up, there's a corner here. 
And it's just, I mean, it's only a little bit. 
But if I start pulling on it, the whole thing's going to go. 
So that's the same in our practice. 
Just starting in any place where it makes sense. 
Then you start to realize how it connects together. 
And because that's the conditioned nature of the teachings and the path, the conditioned nature of truth. 
There's interwoven, interlocking aspects of these conditions. 
So I'll take leave of you all and enjoy the rest of your retreat.
