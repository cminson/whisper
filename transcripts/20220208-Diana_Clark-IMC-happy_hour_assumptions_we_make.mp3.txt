The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So really warm welcome, warm welcome to everybody.
It's nice to see you all, nice to be here, practice together.
And today I'd like to share a little story that's out of Bante Gunnaraptana's book, Mindfulness in Plain English.
This might, this was one of the first Dharma books, maybe not the first one, but one of the first Dharma books that I read.
I think the other one is like eight mindful steps to happiness. And I appreciated this book very much, Mindfulness in Plain English, right?
It's just as the title suggests, it's really straightforward and was a very, for me, a very nice introduction to what this whole mindfulness business was about.
Not very in Dermatox, but, you know, Dermatox, one week to the next is just what inspires the Dharma teacher. They're not necessarily meant to be, you know, systematically laying things out.
So it was helpful to have a book.
I mean, I'll just say one tiny thing about Bante Gunnaraptana. So Bante, that's just a generic term that we use for monastics, for monks, for men.
Often, if you're ever practicing with somebody who's ordained and is wearing the orange robes, then that's how we would address them as Bante.
I don't know, maybe in English something would be something like brother, maybe something like that would be equivalent, I don't know.
And then Gunnaraptana, this is a Sri Lankan name, he's from Sri Lanka.
And he came to America in the 60s, and he started teaching meditation and mindfulness and the tradition that we practice and that I practice in.
And he was, I don't remember the story, I think maybe at one time I knew he was given some property in West Virginia.
So you can imagine that might have been in the 70s or the 80s, I'm not sure, but you can imagine somebody from Sri Lanka going from West Virginia, people in the West Virginia were like, what is going on here and he was moving from Metropolitan
Washington, D.C. when I what's going on here so wasn't always an easy place to be and I think I have heard, but I don't know if this is like within the last 10 years or 20 years or 30 years, that there still is kind of an uneasy
relationship between this property that they have in West Virginia and the neighbors, they're not necessarily so keen on this weird quote unquote Buddhist thing that's happening.
So, but I don't know if that's still true.
It's a bit of a little context of the story. So, he has a shaved head, wears orange robes, right, so I mean he definitely looks like he doesn't fit in. Let's just say that doesn't fit in if you just were to see him.
There was this monastery in this practice center in this rural West Virginia one of the first in America. And he would goes for a walk every day that's part of his practice, you know for exercise as well as part of his meditation practice.
And he said that there was this man who lived down the road was very unfriendly.
When he takes his walk whenever he would see this man he would wave, and the man would be like driving and would just frown and look the other way and just pass on by.
And so, Ponte describes his reaction as even so I was not fazed by his attitude. I never gave up on him. Whenever I saw him, I'd always wave and think kindly of him and sending him loving kindness.
So, this is Ponte's practice.
And then, after about a year of this happening, the man's behavior changed. He stopped frowning.
Ponte thought like, okay, some progress is happening.
Maybe just this unfriendly quote unquote person down the street is becoming a little bit more friendly.
After another year, something miraculous happened. This is kind of Ponte's language. Something miraculous after two years.
That man down the street lifted one finger off the steering wheel.
And Ponte thinks, this is wonderful. Okay, so all this loving kindness that I've been sending him and, you know, always thinking good thoughts and waving when I see him is having an effect.
Another year passes and Ponte still continues to wave and smile and now this guy raises two fingers off the steering wheel, right?
After all these years, right? Two fingers and you know how the story goes, right?
And then another year and he lifts four fingers off the steering wheel. This is a lot of time now that has passed.
And then he took his hand completely off the steering wheel and stuck it out the window and waved.
Like this is like a huge progress.
And then as Ponte is telling the story that he saw the man parked on the side of one of these, on one of these forced roads, he's parked on the side of the road sitting there in his truck smoking a cigarette.
So Ponte just went over to him and started talking. I don't know if they have ever had a conversation before.
But, and Ponte writes that the first they started talking about the weather and then little by little his story starts to unfold.
It turns out that several years ago before Ponte had started waving to him, he had been in this terrible accident. A tree had fallen on him.
And while he was in the truck, a truck and almost every bone in his body had been broken.
And he was in a coma for a really long time.
And then when Ponte had first started seeing him, he was just starting to recover.
He could drive, but he couldn't move his fingers.
So he was just holding on to the steering wheel because that was all he could do at the time.
So, just Ponte just, you know, had this realization like, oh, you know, these assumptions that he had been making all these years turned out to be inaccurate.
It doesn't mean that this guy was the friendliest person ever, but you know, something was happening in his life that Ponte didn't know.
But he still continued to wave and still continue to kind of send him loving kindness as was his practice as this person went by.
So what assumptions are we making about other people and their behavior?
And what would happen if we realized that we actually don't know what motivates other people?
And instead we assumed the best and gave them the benefit of the doubt.
Like, how would things unfold? How would it affect our lives?
If that our assumptions, we recognize them as assumptions and didn't hold on to them tightly thinking that, well, this person is just unfriendly and is never going to be friendly.
And there's a way in which doing some loving kindness is a way that can soften our hearts so that we don't always make the worst assumptions about people.
Soften our hearts so that we can give them the benefit of the doubt.
Soften our hearts so that we can continue to wave and say hello, even if they are not giving us a response that maybe is one that we're expecting or is one that suggests that they're so keen on our showing up where we are at that time or whatever it might be.
Something I appreciate so much about this story is that Vante, the way he tells the story, is he's meeting this person where this person is.
He's not going over there demanding that things be different. We have to talk about this. We're neighbors. And he's not, Vante is not going out of his way to make sure that he runs into this person.
When he encounters him, he has some warm heartedness. He waves and in his mind wishes him well.
Beautiful.
Because I don't want us to think that loving kindness practice means that we have to convert everybody over to being super kind all the time or we have to put on rose colored glasses and pretend that everybody's, you know, everything's perfect and we have to fake being nice all the time.
Right. That's not what this is about.
But we can start to notice what are our assumptions.
And can we just hold them lightly.
And can we, is there a way in which we can give people the benefit of the town.
And recognize that we don't actually know what motivates other people.
Okay, so with that as an introduction. Let's do some some practice.
Taking meditation posture.
Take a posture that feels steady and upright and yet has some ease with it.
And moving into the moment, bodily experience inhabiting the bodily experience.
What does it feel like right now to be in this body.
Is there a way that you know that you are in the posture you're in to sit and know you're sitting.
Turning into that.
The signals that indicate to us that we're sitting.
That the body be sense of the back being uplifted straight.
It's fine.
What is it that makes you know you're horizontal.
What is it that makes you shine on.
Moving into the rhythm of the breath.
Breathing the inhales and exhales.
Breathing the inhales and exhales.
It's easy to feel some warm heartedness, some goodwill benevolence care respect.
An uncomplicated way.
Perhaps visualizing this level of being.
It's an individual that you.
Have in your life for whether it's for a kitten's puppies babies.
And we smile when I say those words can't help it.
Maybe there's somebody who's had a big impact in your life with their writings or their teachings.
Moving into a level of being.
Breathing the inhales and exhales.
And then to support our cultivating loving kindness to support our intentions.
Can repeat these phrases.
May you be saved.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be saved.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
If we find the mind wandering, some kindness and some warmth, we just begin again with their phrases with connecting with the level of being.
Maybe connecting to a bodily sensation that's associated with warmth, spaciousness in the chest,
sense of ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Turning into that feeling of warmheartedness, this feeling of care.
If it's there, it might not be there.
That's perfectly fine. You don't have to manufacture, create any particular experience.
But if it is there, to inhabit that, to feel it, tune into it.
And if not, you can tune into the warmhearted wish to be warmhearted.
Thank you.
And then to expand our loving kindness to include ourselves.
It's not so much that we shine the beam of loving kindness a different direction.
It's more that we're just expanding that bigger so that it includes ourselves.
May I be safe.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
You don't have to be perfect.
Anything in particular.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be safe.
One day I was making assumptions about the neighbor.
It turned out to be inaccurate.
Chances are,
the assumptions we have about ourselves, the stories we have about ourselves,
are also inaccurate.
Sometimes our inner critic
is authoritative and believable.
It's not true.
It's not true.
We all have this beauty, this goodness inside of us.
It's outside of us too.
It's outside of us too.
It's outside of us too.
It's outside of us too.
And then to expand our loving kindness to neutral people, people we don't know.
Your neighbor.
Bringing them to mind.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
Recognizing that any assumptions we make about another person,
whether we know them or not, but especially if we don't know them,
is going to be inaccurate.
Of course it is.
What would it be like to give people the benefit of the doubt?
Assume the best.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The neutral person, may you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be happy.
Some equanimity practice can help us with not making assumptions or holding on to assumptions.
So for this practice, bring to mind somebody that's in your life that you care about,
that sometimes is a little bit troublesome, burdensome, irksome.
Bringing this person to mind.
Let me say this phrase, I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So this idea, of course we make assumptions, I mean that's how we navigate the world and it's helpful and it's wise to do that.
It's about what's skillful, what's wholesome, what will be supported, what will be helpful, what will not be.
The practice here is to not mistake assumptions for the truth.
Not think that our assumptions are actually the way things are.
Assumptions are helpful for us to make some decisions maybe, but we don't have to hold on to them and think that they're the absolute truth,
especially when it concerns the motivations of others, especially when it concerns the inner life of other people.
You can see the way that they act and you know, assume all kinds of things about them.
Maybe some are true, maybe some aren't, but imagine how your life would unfold differently if the assumptions you were making were about assuming the best.
Maybe this person's having a bad day.
Maybe this person got some terrible news, somebody from a family member and that's why they're cranky or maybe this person is troubling at work
because we remind them of some childhood character in their life that maybe was troublesome for them.
I don't know, right?
The point is that we don't really know and our life just would be a happier life in general if we just say, okay, this person's having difficulties,
but may you be happy, may you be healthy.
And that uplifts our heart so that we don't get stuck in the story making and the, you know, the incredible stories that our minds can make
and start thinking that they're true.
So it can be helpful to talk to others about this idea, but what are the kind of assumptions that we make for other people?
What would it be like to start making good assumptions, assuming the best, giving people the benefit of the doubt?
Like how might that affect our life?
How might our life unfold differently if we had that as a way that we showed up in the world?
So I'm going to put you into groups of three or four.
And an opportunity to just explore this idea.
And then this connection with loving kindness, of course, is that it makes it easier for us to assume the best if we ourselves have filled up with, we're feeling nourished with loving kindness.
And it's so much easier to give the benefit of the doubt to others, as well as with loving kindness practice, there's a way in which it just becomes easier and easier and maybe even more the default way,
not maybe, it does become more the default way in which we just approach others and approach the world.
So, and then I'll just give these instructions that I like to always give is no need to say every idea that you have on this topic, maybe just make one point, go to the next person, they make one point, go to the next person, make one point, and then have it come back around.
So in this way, everybody has the chance to learn something new, hear something new, and have some new ideas, as opposed to just informing others about what you know, instead to together create
a mandala, a mosaic of understanding of this idea of assumptions. And if it's helpful, you can go in the order of the last digit of your phone number.
Okay, here we go.
Welcome back. Welcome back.
Nobody have a comment or something they'd like to share.
So, in the group I was reminded of Donald Trump as a wonderful object to send loving kindness to rather than making assumptions and that was helpful because I haven't thought of Donald Trump in such a long time so that was helpful.
Thank you, Rebecca.
Yeah.
You know, these people right that we make assumptions about.
Yes, Greg.
I mean, where my assumptions have been kind of a fail and surely but slowly learned me not to trust them. So much behavior, both in people and animals that I have dealt with as a paradoxical in nature right where sometimes very aggressive behavior is driven by very
fearful types of motivations or coping mechanisms and so what seemed to me apparent as a way to interpret something was maybe not as thoughtful as it could have been if I think in terms of the Buddhist concept of dependent causation and
so that keeping that mind has been helpful to me if with more than just people. Nice. Nice. Thank you, Greg. Right.
That we ascribe meaning to behavior. Yeah. Thank you, Greg.
I was thinking about the assumptions that we made about ourselves in which way you can turn around so can you give me some hints on that same question to ourselves.
Yeah, so sometimes we might have this idea, especially when we're doing like metapractice and we find our mind wandering like this.
Maybe slight and in the back of mind, but this you can't meditate. Look, everybody else is meditating and they all have our filled with compassion and love but you can.
So I don't know what it is the exact words are but it's not uncommon for people to have this kind of inner critic that shows up and then we start to believe it.
It's like, oh, we can meditate or we're terrible meditators were losers. We shouldn't even come or, you know, I don't know what the story is. And so it's not true.
It's not true. It's just habits that we have that we fall into that about are the way that we are and it's natural to protest and say but I have lots of data to support this.
These assumptions that we're making but there's other ways in which we can interpret some of these things and one of them is on pointing to is the power of habit, the power of the way we've been socialized the power of
maybe there's some underlying fear or something that's wants to keep things a certain way and so there isn't a flexibility and seeing things differently.
So this them kind of stores oneself helps create the conditions in which when the inner critic arises that we see like, oh, okay, thank you for your opinion. But may I be happy. May I be healthy.
May I be.
May I live with these are you know, something like that was that is that helpful.
Thank you. Yeah, great.
Jamie.
This story about waving at the sour looking man who didn't wave back reminded me of Mr. Charles, the guy who lived in Berkeley, and for 30 years, every single morning he stood on the same corner on Ashby Avenue and wave that the cars driving by.
Wow.
And, and he took to wearing yellow gloves so that people could see his hands waving more easily. And he quit doing it in 1992.
And, and still on his birthday people put on yellow gloves and stand on the same corner and wave.
And he's still waving actually too because there's a big mural of him right on that corner.
That's nice. What a nice story. Thank you. Thank you for sharing.
Okay, so we're two minutes after the hour so I respect your time, but what a pleasure it is to practice together you know to share this practice.
If you like you can unmute and we'll say goodbye.
Thank you.
You and Jamie. Thank you, Terrence.
Thank you.
Thank you, Diana.
Hi, Trudy.
Hi, thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome.
