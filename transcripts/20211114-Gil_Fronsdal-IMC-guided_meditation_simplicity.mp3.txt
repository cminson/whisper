 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning everyone and welcome. Nice to have you all here in person. And nice to have everyone who's on YouTube present as well. I have the chat open. Thank you. So one of the hallmarks of this practice of ours is simplicity. And you might want to keep that word close by when you do this kind of practice. Simple. Keep it simple. Stay simple. If it's not simple, it's probably not mindfulness. And that's not meant to be a big, complicated engineering job of mindfulness. It's a complicated thing to figure out or to follow and make our way. Certainly we enter into complex worlds sometimes with mindfulness. Complex inner lives. And one way that I've made that simple is I use the label chaos. It's just chaos. I'm sitting in chaos. And that's like the big overview kind of label that I'm not lost in the details. I'm trying to figure it out. Another big wonderful label is confusion. Oh, that's all. That's all. It's simple. I'm confused. So, okay. And then you can hopefully, now that I know it's confusion, I'll just sit with confusion. Keep it simple. Maybe I don't have to be unconfused. Maybe it's okay to be confused. Just confusion. And as soon as I make those labels like that, chaos or confusion, I've kind of begun to make sense of it or I'm kind of beginning to kind of find my bearings or like a toehold or a landing place for it. And then it's not quite chaos or confusion anymore. Because now, like with confusion, I'm not confused by being confused. I know I'm confused. So it's like it's beginning to shift. And then what would be simple way of being with confusion or chaos? Let's be embodiedly present. So let's be present in the body with it. And then what is it like for the body, for this chaos, for this body to be confused? And so all this energy and agitation. And so it's getting narrower and kind of more defined where the tension goes. No, I'm not confused about this now. I'm not confused if my body's agitated. Is my little toe agitated? No. It's mostly in my torso. It's mostly in the front of my torso. So it's starting to get kind of more and more, you know, like sense or clarity of what's happening. But the principle for doing so is to be simple. Keep it simple. So ideally you would take a simple posture. And sitting upright, literally or metaphorically. And gently closing your eyes. And if it seems too complicated, take some deep breaths. And you don't have to. If you can take some deeper breath in a simple way, that's appropriate for you and your body, your lungs. Partly is a ritual of simplification. Just being here for this body, this place. Maybe a longer exhale can partly be the letting go of the complexity of there and then, past and future. Exhaling into now, here. Letting the breathing return to normal. There can be a continued simplification process that as you exhale to relax your body. Relaxing the body. Sometimes relax the mind. Relaxing the body. Sometimes relax the heart. Relax the muscles of the face. Softening in the belly. Softening the shoulders. And then the question for each of you is, what would it be like for you to be simply here? That kind of simplicity doesn't need anything to change. But you're simple with how things are for you. And maybe it's as a process of simplifying, maybe it's enough just to breathe with what's happening. Breathing in and breathing out. Having it be the question of the meditation session or the word simple. Simply being with what is. Simply breathing with what is. Simply breathing. Allowing yourself to be simple. Allowing yourself to, allowing things to simplify. Here and now. Allowing yourself to be simple. Allowing yourself to be simple. Allowing yourself to be simple. Allowing yourself to be simple.

Allowing yourself to be simple. Allowing yourself to be simple. Allowing yourself to be simple. Allowing yourself to remember the rest of your life today. People in your life, in your community, your neighbors, family, circles of connection that we have to people we know and don't know. And to imagine that the simplicity of your kindness, the simplicity of your care travels in unseen ways out into the world. And that it begins with looking upon others kindly. To see if you can look now onto your world kindly and wish that in the seen and unseen ways that your kindness can travel, that your well-wishing follows those channels, those currents. And wish well-being for this wider world that we live in. Wish it and also offer a little bit of yourself behind that wish that you yourself will offer some way to contribute to the welfare and happiness of others, even if it's as small as possible way. May all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be safe. May all beings everywhere be free.
