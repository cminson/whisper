The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So formal hello and welcome to all of you dear friends wherever in the world
you are, whatever the time zone might be. Happy to be with you, happy that the
Sangha is assembled and we get to practice together. How sweet, how special, how
special. So for the theme for today's practice, yeah, I wanted to invite us to
consider the juxtaposition of the times, which is what's happening with the
new variant, the Omicron variant and the world being on edge. And again, seems like
we're heading into another period of challenge in the world. So, and we are
already been in the midst of a challenging period and it's about to get
even more challenging. So not to turn away from that, not to turn away from
that. And also to acknowledge that meta, loving kindness, goodwill for ourselves
and others is a resource in tough times, is a resource, is a refuge, is a refuge
that soothes and calms the heart and mind for ourselves and for others so that
we can be more available for ourselves and for others. So it's a both and, it's
a both and. So that's the theme that the consideration I'd like to bring in for
for our practice this evening, not to turn away from the challenges in the
world. And yet, knowing that, trusting that our practice of meta, goodwill for
ourselves and for others is, is refreshing, is, is renewing, is a refuge.
Really, it's, it's, it's our heart's refuge. And we can offer that stability,
that care, that warmth, both to ourselves and to everyone else in the world.
Even if we may not, I mean, many people we might have contact with and speak
with and they might be all very upset and in challenging times, experiencing
challenges. And for us to just be stable with, with kindness, just a sense of
stability, openheartedness with kindness. So, so that's the setting, that's the
background. So let's, let's delve in, dear ones. Let's delve in together. So I
invite you to land, to arrive. The lie arrive more fully. Arrive in this moment
in this body. Taking refuge. The simplicity of this moment, letting go of
whatever has come, whatever might have come before this, whatever busyness,
whatever stress or worry, just for a moment, bowing to it, saying, thank you.
I'm going to take some minutes of refuge to refresh my heart, to refresh myself.
To connect more deeply with my humanity. To connect the capacity of this heart to
be tender. To be vulnerable if it needs to be, to be held with care and love and rest.
Landing, landing in the body.
Feeling our feet on the ground. Grounded while rooted.
As if our feet are kissing the earth.
As if our feet are kissing the earth.
I am here. This blessed earth, this, these blessed feet.
It's magic of this life. Here, here.
Feeling the sit bones embrace. Cushion the chair.
Letting go of the weight.
Ah, releasing, releasing. Releasing what you're holding.
You're holding onto in your thoughts. Ah, releasing, arriving more fully here. I'm here.
Giving, giving yourself fully to this moment of refuge.
This beautiful, amazing.
Nowness, right here.
Mystery.
Relaxing, releasing into.
This river, this river, it's always now. Time passes and yet it's always now.
As if you're releasing, relaxing, floating.
Being held by healing, nourishing waters.
Let the stream carry you lovingly. Nothing you need to do.
Or be with the soft animal of your body. Relax.
Relax. Let your heart relax.
Receiving the lullaby of the breath.
The lower abdomen.
Floating, floating.
If thoughts, judgments, whatever is not helpful right now arises.
Release it, release it into this healing river.
Opening your hand, don't need to hold onto any of them.
Ah, letting yourself be nourished and held.
Just this breath being received, soft, in this soft, relaxed body.
Healing waters, healing waters, healing waters of meta, nourishing, healing held.
The more you soak, the perfect temperature of the waters,
the more tightness, tension, challenging thoughts.
The more they wash away gently, gently, the more you soak.
There is a simile called simile of the cloth in the teachings of the Buddha.
Like a cloth. It's being soaked, it's staying slowly, slowly.
Feeling water seep in, sift, sift supporting, nourishing every cell, every cell of your body,
your heart, your mind. It's okay, it's okay. I am held.
It's okay. I am held, I am held that kindness and care and safety.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Realizing, knowing, this healing, soothing waters, the river flowing outside is also flowing inside.
Nature outside, nature inside, cite this body, heart, mind.
Nourished from the healing waters, there is a river that runs through you,
a river that runs through me, a nourishing, loving, caring river
that soothes, nourishes, cares for.
Here, here, now, now. It's okay, wherever, internally in the body, in the mind, in the heart.
Your challenges, maybe no challenges in this moment. The river flows.
Let it flow. Don't get in its way. Let it flow. You don't have to make it flow.
It does so on its own. Simply don't get in the way. Relax, release.
Let this body, this heart, this mind be held, externally, internally,
in goodwill, meta, care. If the phrases support, you're staying with the feeling of meta, please
bring them in. If you'd like to stay with the feeling alone, that's fine too.
I'll offer one round of the phrases.
May I, may this being, who is me, be safe, safe and protected from inner and outer harm.
Fool me while knowing that events, lives, so many of them are uncontrollable beyond my control,
ungovernable, and yet I wish myself with kindness the safety, without attaching to it, offering it
to myself as a gift. May I be safe. May I be happy and have joy in my heart.
May I be healthy and strong, as much as it may be available to me.
I'm offering this gift, this wish to myself, wishing myself well.
And may my life unfold with ease.
Feeling the river of care, nourishing, river of meta, flowing, flowing through your heart,
through your body, through your mind, nourishing, and livening, healing, soothing.
River inside, river outside.
Knowing, trusting that water has this cooling, if something is hot or burning, water cools.
If something is cold, shivering, water warms, brings comfort.
See what is needed. See what is needed.
See what is needed.
See what is needed.
Now if you wish, bringing to mind some beings in your life for whom it's easy for you to feel meta
and care.
So if you were sharing these healing waters from your heart,
that are both inside, outside, no difference between the meta that's inside and outside.
Maybe they too are joining you in this healing body of water.
Whatever works for you, whatever imagery, could be a river, could be a lake, could be a safe
healing ocean with undulating waves, warm, soothing, whatever, whatever might work for you.
Or maybe a warm bath.
Healing, soothing, the meta, the river running through you
is fed by this body of water and also it feeds, it feeds this body of water
that your loved ones are helping.
Don't try too hard, let it be whatever is easiest.
May you all, may all of us be safe.
From inner and outer harm.
May all of us, including yourself together with
people who are dear to you, may all of us be happy, may all of us be healthy.
May all of us have ease.
May all of us be happy.
May all of us be happy.
May all of us be happy.
May all of us be happy.
May all of us be happy.
For the last minute or two of this practice period,
when bodies of water rivers evaporate into the air, they become clouds, they become rain.
Continuing with the healing waters metaphor, imagining,
assuming, healing, meta filled rain, all over the earth, all beings everywhere,
this planet of ours, hurting so many beings, hurting the pandemic, climate change, etc, etc.
So many beings soothed, cared for, this meta rain,
yourself included.
May all beings everywhere, including ourselves,
appreciate the refuge of a loving, kind heart, a peaceful heart.
May all beings, including ourselves, be free.
Thanks everyone, thanks for your practice.
So we have some time for reflections, questions, comments, any reports from the field,
how the practice was for you, how you're doing, what worked, what didn't work,
it's all welcome. The invitation is for you to share your practice as a gift to others when
you share your insights or challenges, as you well know by now, it supports others.
Thank you. I thought it was so appropriate tonight with this meditation because
you see what's going on in the world and sometimes hearing people speak,
you know, I know I hurt for them and I felt reminded of Mehta being the antidote to suffering
and that's kind of what I was floating in, bathing in as an antidote to what we see going
on in the world right now. So I thought it was a very appropriate thing for tonight. Thank you.
Thank you, Mima. And with so much suffering, Mehta gets transformed into compassion,
compassion holds. Compassion can hold the suffering. It becomes,
it's as you're using the word antidote, it's the medicine, maybe that's what I would use,
it's the medicine. Yeah, the medicine. It doesn't negate it, but it's the medicine,
it's the self. Beautiful. Thank you, Mima. Yeah. I appreciate your reflections.
Luisa on YouTube appreciates the beautiful water meditation.
She went to a beautiful waterfall, she says, and was very synchronistic for her with gratitude,
feeling held in peace. Lovely. Thank you. Bill says, thank you for the peace of mind.
Delighted to hear there's a sense of peace. Yeah.
So, how about we turn, since I don't see any comments coming,
how about we turn to small groups, small sangha practice. And when we come back,
we'll have some more time for reflection. So you know by now how precious, how important it is to
have community, to have sangha. Even if it may be spending just a few minutes checking in with
fellow travelers, it is so important, it is so nourishing. It's to feed them with the river of
our Mehta and to be nourished by the river of Mehta. So take care of yourselves, take care of each
other, and I'll open the rooms in a moment. And if you can't stay, please do. And if you have to go,
not out of fear of talking with other folks, but if you have to go, it's okay to
take care of yourselves, take care of each other. So I'm opening the rooms now. Here we go.
Welcome back folks. So we have some more time for reflections, questions,
comments, what came up. Please. I'd love to hear.
Bill says, our group was too relaxed to talk. I love it. I love it.
You know, that's what happens when you soak in healing waters. You're like, you've been
soaking. It's like, wow, I've just been to the hot tub of Mehta. Oh my goodness. Christine says, ours too.
Oh, did I, did I just put you all into a, yeah, what, what should I call it, a meditative kind
of, oh, that is too cute. That is too sweet. Dave Parker says, Dave says, that's what I was saying.
Oh my God. He says we talked about cat videos. Oh my God, this is too funny, you guys. But anybody
like to, to, to share this, to put their voice, put their voice into, into the room or just be in
chat. Maybe you don't feel like talking. I don't blame you. I'm pretty chilled myself now.
You know, we might just end early tonight and go take a bath. Really, you know, a Mehta bath.
And continue to practice Mehta in, in the bath, being held in healing waters and
feeling your own healing and, and loving energy of Mehta. Any takers for any, any last minute
comments or reflections, besides that you're too chilled to talk? Jerry, please. Yeah, the comment
to building on what's been said, but the word that struck me was the lullaby of the breath,
that when you said that, combined with letting go of various, perhaps what ifs and buts clubs,
you might call it. It particularly struck me the lullaby of the breath, which I hadn't sort of
thought about. And that was just like, oh, it's like a chiropractic moment. It's just like, oh,
I can let go of the stuff. And so it speaks to what everyone else was. I thought, wow, this is a
powerful thought of lullaby of the breath. So that's what I have to say. Thank you, Jerry. Thanks
for reflecting that back and highlighting that lullaby of the breath. Yeah, you caught that.
Yes, and others too. It feels like that, right? It can feel when you tune into it. There's just
lullaby quality, the soothing, calming, just so nourishing. Yeah, it's all right here.
Yeah. What did you say? The but ifs? What was it? But ifs and something else club? Oh, you're
still on there. I heard the patient say to me that, what ifs and buts club? What ifs and buts
club? I like that. But what ifs and buts, you know, so I like that, that what ifs and buts club. So
I thought, let go of the what ifs and buts club, just pull under the lullaby of the breath. Wow,
I think that's a great quote. Let go of the what ifs and buts club and let that go into a release
into the lullaby of the breath. All right, I'm going to write that down. Love it. If we co-created
that, Jerry. Or fall into the lullaby of the breath. Like it's sort of like a hammock. You know,
I had a hammock. Okay, I want to go take a nap now. For those of you on the east coast,
this is perfect timing. It is, for sure. It's sweet. Thanks, Jerry. Thanks so much.
In the other last minute, reflections before we bring our session to a close, we've got a
compliment.
Thank you. Thank you for that message, Fred. So thank you all. Let's bring our
lovely session to a close. It's so nice to see you. It's so nice to be with you again. I've missed you.
It just gives me so much joy and delight to be back together practicing with a lovely community.
Yay. Every single one of you, every single one of us is important. Your presence makes this community.
So thank you. Deep, deep bows of appreciation. So may you all be well, safe, happy. May all
beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
