The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Continuing the topic of equanimity, it feels for me particularly interesting
and appropriate to talk about this this morning since the internet connection
dropped a couple times while while I was sitting. I think we got through the
guided meditation before it dropped. I don't know, there might have been, it
might have seemed like I stopped in the middle. I don't know, it's hard to say.
I'll have to listen to the recording later. It was interesting and I'll
describe a little bit about about what I noticed about equanimity and non-equanimity
in that in that experience. There's just a little bit of a recap to begin. So
we've been talking about equanimity in the context of the seven factors of
awakening and in the instructions of how to cultivate equanimity, how to
cultivate the seven factors of awakening, being mindful of them. So it's
the instructions in the Satipatanasuta, the Buddha's instructions on mindfulness
and the fourth foundation of mindfulness include instructions about being aware
of the seven factors of awakening. Mindfulness, the seven factors being
mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, tranquility, concentration, and
equanimity. So equanimity is the is the last one and it can be understood as
kind of the culmination of the others, that all of the others support the
development and cultivation of equanimity. That's one way of understanding the
seven factors of awakening. In the instructions in the Satipatanasuta on
being mindful of the seven factors of awakening, the key instruction which I've
repeated, I think most of the times we've been talking about the seven
factors, is to be aware of the presence or absence of the factor of awakening and
then to be curious about how it's cultivated and how it comes to
fulfillment, how it strengthens, how it develops, how it becomes an
awakening factor essentially. So the presence, knowing the presence of
equanimity, I think actually all of these are how equanimity is cultivated. Being
aware of the presence of equanimity, being aware of the presence of any of the
factors of awakening, with mindfulness, this is the experience of equanimity
that's happening in the present moment. This is non-reactivity happening in the
present moment. Being aware of the difference between equanimity and non-
equanimity is a way of cultivating equanimity. The factor of mindfulness,
the capacity of mindfulness to be aware of what's happening in the present
moment, it's a very powerful capacity when it is employed in this way to be
curious about what the present moment experience actually is. Not for any
particular purpose of what do I need to do about it or what does it do for me,
but what is the experience? So the experience as experience. So what is the
experience of equanimity? What is equanimity? Equanimity, some other words for
it, which we've explored in the past few weeks. Mental balance, non-reactivity,
acceptance of what's happening, ease with the present moment, ease with what is,
non-contentiousness, not fighting with what's here, impartiality, again that kind
of balance, standing in the middle of experience, not being pushed or pulled by
the experience. So in my experience when the computer closed the zoom window, I
just had a little circle on the screen sitting connecting, there was a surge of
energy and you know mostly in that time I just like tried to think okay what can
I do, I tried rebooting my computer, reconnecting, all of that stuff and
finally after I don't know probably three or four minutes I decided to try
connecting to a different server, a different internet connection. And then
as I rejoined the meeting and settled back into the meditation, there was about
10 minutes left in the meditation at that point, there was a lot of energy in
the system, it was very activated, there was a lot going on and my initial sense
was wow, I mean I didn't feel terribly, I mean it wasn't like my mind was really
flailing or anything, but it felt, there felt like there was some charge and so
I was like oh this is not equanimity, you know, so just noticing that, just kind of
the assumption or kind of looking at that, this is not equanimity, but as I kept
looking at it, what I noticed was that there was some energetic experience in
the body that seemed separate from reactivity, so it was like there was
this this surge of energy that had come from having to take action, from having
to do something and that's natural, you know, it's almost like there was a
little bit of adrenaline that was released that had a life and it was
still kind of going and I noticed what was interesting for me was noticing at
a certain point that the energy, that energy which I had assumed at first was
not equi- was the indication that there was not equanimity, that there was a
little bit of not equanimity there, but there when I noticed that that energy
itself was not a problem, that the energy itself was just kind of the after
effect of having had to do something, then the mind actually got very happy and
quite contented to just sit with that feeling of energy in the body and it
was clear that that energy was just kind of the after effect of having had to do
something and not that it was not equanimity, so there was some non-equanimity
there, but there was a confusion, there's a little bit of confusion about that
energetic experience, because when we are reactive it brings energy into the body,
it creates a kind of energetic experience, but there's also times energy comes into
the body simply when we have to do something, but what so what I was kind
of noticing was a subtler like teasing a part of what is the experience of that
energy and what is the experience of the non-equanimity part of that energy and
when I could notice that the like the initial assumption was that energy had
to completely calm down in order for the mind to be equanimous, and then there was
the recognition you know equanimity can be with activity and stillness,
equanimity and tranquility are different states of mind, and so it was an
interesting kind of demonstration or exploration around noticing or teasing
apart that some of the differences or some of the subtleties around what
equanimity is and what equanimity isn't in the mind, and so this was and as I
began to recognize as I began to touch into oh this some of this is just the
normal kind of energy in the system having had to do something and some of
it is reactivity, and as I began to notice that the reactivity faded pretty
quickly and then there was just the energy in the body and there was a
kind of delight like oh you know my system took care of things so so anyway
that was just a little kind of in-the-moment story or description of
noticing that that difference, noticing that curiosity around presence and
absence of equanimity. So the recognizing the presence of equanimity is a key way
to cultivate it. Recognizing the absence of equanimity also a key way to
cultivate it because we we talked about that a couple weeks ago noticing
reactivity as we notice when the mind is reactive we notice potentially we
notice that the kind of mindfulness that can recognize oh reactivity is
happening can step us back a little bit so that we become aware with a balance
of mind with a little bit of equanimity that the mind has some reactivity and so
we step into a bigger container some more spaciousness around both what's
happening and our reactivity to it and then sometimes in that container in that
bigger container sometimes the equanimity doesn't rearise but sometimes
it does sometimes we end up feeling that reactivity kind of fall away as I
noticed in that in my in my situation that when I actually notice the
difference between what was happening the energy in the system and the
reactivity as I noticed the part that was reactivity that part diminished and
then the mind was just at ease with knowing there was energy in the system.
So noticing the the presence of equanimity noticing the absence of
equanimity both are key ways to cultivate cultivate equanimity to
strengthen its capacity in our in our practice in our hearts and minds. Another
way that we talked about last time to cultivate equanimity is in reflecting or
reminding ourselves of wisdom. I talked we talked a little bit last week about
reflecting on the impermanent unreliable nature of experience the experience as
conditioned as ways that we can support being able to hold something that's
challenging and the purpose part of the purpose one thing that equanimity is
not I should have said this earlier equanimity having this balance of mind
having this space of non-reactivity equanimity is not about non-action and
so we can be equanimous and act and take action and so the the my way back to the
thread that took me there so I was talking about cultivating the
understanding of conditionality I think so understanding that what is happening
is conditioned can create some balance for us about what's happening but it
doesn't necessarily mean that we don't do something about what's happening that
we don't take action it's it's the equanimity creates a place a container
in which we can take action not out of reactivity but out of wisdom out of
compassion out of understanding rather than greed or aversion so the the wisdom
that supports equanimity is understanding that things are impermanent
understanding that they're unreliable and that they are conditioned another key
reflection which is related to the conditioned nature of experience another
key teaching that supports the cultivation of equanimity is the
understanding of karma I think we all kind of know the word karma it's in our
everyday language you know but it unfortunately isn't usually used quite
the way it's understood in Buddhism in our everyday language so I'd like to
describe a little bit about about what karma is in in terms of this reflection
and how this understanding is supportive for the cultivation of
equanimity first I'll say that this teaching connecting the reflection on
karma to equanimity is one of the key ways that the Brahma vahara of
equanimity is cultivated the Brahma vahara the Brahma vaharas are a list of
some wholesome qualities of mind that are cultivated as our heart begins to
let go of craving and clinging and in the teachings they're often taught as
cultivated in relationship to people in relationship to others and so the the
encouragement with metta for example with loving-kindness is to cultivate it
for ourselves and for others and for both for all beings essentially and we do
that by actively wishing may I be happy may other beings be happy may you be
happy may all beings be happy may beings be at ease may beings be healthy and
safe and so these these thoughts in the mind are kind of aiming the mind or
inclining the mind in the direction of that quality of loving-kindness so all
four Brahma vaharas loving-kindness compassion sympathetic joy and
equanimity have kind of a relational aspect to them kindness compassion and
sympathetic joy kind of the relational field of how we are with our with our
fellow human beings as we go through life seeing the ups and downs of life the
connectedness that we have the caring that we have related to just wishing well
for other beings that's the metta compassion being the the emotion that
arises when there are beings that are suffering and we have an open heart a
non-resistance to that suffering but the compassion then kind of comes with this
act action this wish to act to alleviate that suffering sympathetic joy arises
when somebody is experiencing
things to be appreciated things joyful joyful experiences so the sympathetic
joy is kind of the heart that's that resonates in empathy or in sympathy when
somebody else is happy so it's a happiness that is arising independence
unhappiness so again very relational the the relationship of equanimity is that
of understanding that we all get to make our own journeys we all get to choose
how we engage in the world and that those choices that we make how we choose to
navigate our lives is what creates or results in whether our whether we we
experience happiness or unhappiness whether we experience suffering or
ease and so this is this is the the relational field of equanimity that we
contemplate or recognize you know especially for people close to us in a
way you know I don't have children but I can only imagine you know the challenge
of understanding that your kids have to make their own choices I mean we need to
train and educate and give them all the skills that we can but ultimately you
know especially as they come into adulthood as they come into young
adulthood they have to make their own choices and they will live the
consequences of those choices and so this is essentially a reflection on
equanimity is understanding yes the happiness and unhappiness of those that
I love is dependent on how they choose to engage with their life I can't make
their choices for them they make their choices for them and so this this leads
to it's it's a hard it's a hard one it's hard for us to to land with that but it
does move us in the direction of having some balance of mind in that
relationship and it doesn't mean non-action right if your kid is doing
something making a choice you may want to step in and say that's not a skillful
choice here are the consequences of that choice you know so it again it's not
about non-action what we're talking about so the the the teaching on karma this
this understanding of beings have their choices to make and the choices that they
make is what leads to their happiness or unhappiness their suffering or ease so
it's a complex teaching the teaching on karma this is this is this is a this is
kind of a simple summary of it in a way this that the choices that we make are
directly responsible directly moving us towards more ease or more suffering so
just a little bit a little bit more about the teaching because it is there's
some nuance to it there's quite a bit of nuance to this teaching on karma so one
one teacher one Viku Bodhi gives a very succinct definition of karma that I'm
going to unpack a little bit so his definition of karma is the capacity of
our intentional actions so our choices and intention here well I'll unpack it
in a moment the capacity of our intentional actions to produce an
ethically appropriate result so the our actions will when we act out of greed
aversion delusion when we act out of anger hostility out of wanting to hold
on to things keep things to ourselves out of confusion out of disorientation
then that will have an effect on how our lives unfold and the understanding is
that the actions out of greed aversion delusion will tend to lead us in the
direction where there will be suffering in our lives now we know this at some
levels you know when we get angry you know the the consequences of that we
can actually feel that right directly in the present moment right immediately we
can feel it if we turn and actually explore that experience what is it
like to be angry in the present moment it's painful so right away we can
actually notice the consequences of a mind-state like anger now in my own
experience this was a revelation the first time I really noticed it the first
time I really brought the attention to anger and felt it it's like wow I thought
this was going to make the other person really unhappy but it's painful for this
being right now so you know my understanding of the consequences of
anger wasn't so direct initially and you know the idea there was some mistaken
idea somehow that making the other person angry was going to make me happy
you know that that was that was you know that was part of the the mistaken
belief around the anger but what happens when we make somebody else angry they
get angry at us and they want to get back at us and so there's this kind of
cycle a perpetuating cycle that results so this is this is some of the kind of
the consequences of these mind-states greed aversion delusion tend to lead us
in the direction of stress of suffering of more greed aversion delusion
essentially and greed aversion delusion when we experience them is
experienced or experienced in the moment as stressful as suffering and so the
the capacity of our intentional actions to produce an ethically appropriate
result greed aversion delusion lead us towards the more greed aversion delusion
essentially if we act out of non greed non aversion non delusion out of
generosity out of love out of wisdom out of compassion that tends to lead to more
generosity love wisdom and compassion and the understanding of this of this law
of karma that our intentional actions when we act out of greed aversion and
delusion it moves us to suffering we act out of non greed non aversion non delusion
it moves us in the direction more of happiness this is understood to be kind
of a natural law it's not something people made up it's like the law of
gravity in fact in one suit of the Buddha kind of points to this he kind of
makes an analogy of if you drop a big stone into the water you know what's
gonna happen to that big stone it's gonna sink because that's the nature of
something weighty dropped into water it goes to the bottom of the of the pond
and he said does any amount of wishing make that stone rise to the surface of
the pond he says no because it's not the nature of it to rise to the surface of
the pond and so the the law of karma this understanding of when we act out of
greed aversion and delusion it leads to stress it leads to suffering it leads to
painful result that is understood to be a natural law now the the couple pieces
here the intention that's talked about the when we act out of greed aversion
and delusion it doesn't have to be that we're consciously like in our mind
saying I'm going to act out of this anger you know we don't have to be mindful
we don't have to be aware that we're acting out of anger in order for acting
out of anger to produce this this result so sometimes our intentions our kind of
what we're acting out of is buried I think we know this too sometimes we we
we speak before we really think right and it's like wow if I even thought about
that for a second I would not have said that but the intention of whatever
motivated that was kind of in our subconscious mind just because it's not
consciously in our mind doesn't mean that we don't experience the effect of
of that kind of intention in our in our in our stream of experience so the
intention may be conscious or subconscious and it will be connected with
some kind of motivation and that's understood to be the karma the karma is
that kind of that impulse and the the the movement in that direction that our
action our actions so our intentional actions that's the karma then that they
produce a particular result that's the result of karma the poly comma is the
poly for karma comma and then comma vipaka is the result of karma and so
this is the the result of that intention so when we act out of unskillful
motivations it tends to move us towards suffering when we act out of
skillful motivations it tends to move us towards happiness but the results of
that karma it's it this is a this is an area of some of the subtlety there's a
couple of pieces to unpack here hopefully I can do this in it next ten
minutes or so and leave a little time for question the the results of that
action don't necessarily produce a result immediately so karma can be kind of
like a seed this is another analogy that is is used you know the seed a seed
contains a capacity for a certain result but it doesn't necessarily produce the
result until the conditions are right so the seed won't won't grow into its
appropriate plant until it's given soil until it's given nourishment until it's
given water and then it will sprout then it will grow and so sometimes that seed
might be planted in very fertile soil given a lot of nourishment and grow
very quickly at other times it might land at some place at a time when it's
very dry and take some time maybe it gets eaten by a bird you know then gets
landed out in its bird poo and a nice little package of nourishment and then
and then get some moisture and then sprouts so it it can take some time to
to get the conditions for that result to happen but the seed contains the
capacity so the understanding of the results we may not experience the
results of an unhelpful unskillful action immediately and and the you know
the it may happen it may happen immediately and if we are I think one
of the the ways mindfulness begins to work this is just something that a way
to frame this that just happened just occurred in my mind at this moment one of
the reasons mindfulness works is because it makes the the result of karma the
result of unwholesome mind states apparent much more quickly because we
feel directly in the moment the experience of greed the experience of
aversion the experience of delusion having a quality that feels like stress
and so the the the results of acts of acting out of greed aversion and
delusion are much more obvious much more quickly so there's faster learning
that happens we don't have to wait for years to learn oh yeah when I acted out
of that anger two months ago this is the result you know this person being
really mad at me and and doing something in return you know so that so the
results of karma are come more quickly and there's learning the learning
happens more quickly so that's one piece of karma that the results don't
necessarily happen immediately they can happen they can happen immediately they
might happen tomorrow they might happen next week next year and the teaching also
is that they could happen in future lives so the teaching of karma also speaks to
the possibility of where we land in in future lives so that's one piece of kind
of the teaching on karma it's not necessarily you know you turn on the
light and the light goes on you know it's not it's not necessarily immediate
consequence the second piece of of the kind of subtlety of the teaching of
karma is that the consequences of the results of our intentional actions they
produce an ethically congruent maybe that's a better word than appropriate
actually I think that feels more more resonant for me that the the results of
karma are congruent with the intention behind the action and so if we're acting
out of anger their results are congruent with that acting out of anger for
acting out of peace and kindness their results are congruent with acting out of
peace and kindness and again not necessarily immediately but the results
while being congruent are not what would be called deterministic so you know the
deterministic model at the time of the Buddha said something like you know if
you if you kill somebody then the consequences of that will be that you'll
go to hell in a future life and so you know that that's kind of the you know
that's a that's a kind of a deterministic model if you kill somebody
you will go to hell this is a very simplistic example but the Buddha when
asked that kind of question he said no you know that's not necessarily the case
that that the effect of karma the effect of our actions the result of our
actions is dependent on a lot of conditions it's dependent on the kind of
the field that the the karma lands in and it's dependent on how we are so it's
it's dependent on everything that we've done to this point that being the field
the karma lands in the conditions of our hearts and minds at the moment when we
do that action and then it also depends on the results also depend on how we are
when the results come to fruition what is the state of our mind when the results
come to come to fruition so the there's an analogy another analogy I love that
the Buddha gave so many analogies about karma because it's a complicated
complicated teaching and analogies kind of make things a little simpler or kind
of may resonate for us he gave an analogy of dropping a teaspoon of salt into a
glass of water and he said when you drop the teaspoon of salt into a glass of
water it becomes undrinkable you know it's it's way too salty you'll just
spit it out it's very unpleasant and so a small amount of water and a teaspoon of
salt big effect big effect of that salt in the water he said but if you take that
same teaspoon of salt and dump it into a very large pure pond of water and then
take a cup of water out of that pond you won't taste the salt it'll be a minimal
impact on that experience of drinking the water because there's it's diluted
it's got a much bigger field in which it's it's landing a much bigger like
that the purity of the water kind of absorbs the minimal impurity of the
salt so it doesn't affect the flavor when you take a glass of water out of the
pond this is this is also the understanding with karma of an action
the Buddha says that for some for some people a particular action may result in
a huge impact on their lives a huge effect a huge suffering and for others
it may barely be felt just the little list of ripples so this is what he means
what what is meant by karma not being deterministic the result is not lock
step the result may depend on the result depends on kind of how our minds are in
that moment and the the kind of the analogy of the water the kind of the
clarity that the purity of the water being an analogy for our minds if we
dump oh if we dump a teaspoon of water into a very polluted pond it's still
going to be not good to drink and so the the mind if we have cultivated a lot
of wholesome qualities in the mind then if we do something unskillful it has a
much smaller overall effect in the mind but if we do something unskillful and
we've been doing a lot of unskillful things in the past it's like it's like
an additive or a multiplicative effect that the experience becomes a lot more
amplified potentially so the the the Buddhist teaching on karma differed from
some of the teachings on causes and conditions at at his time in that both
the the kind of the the indeterministic time you know that it will that it may
take time for the karma to unfold and in this indeterministic kind of result and
yet the Buddha does say that there will be some ripples from that karma may be
barely perceptible but there will be an effect so you know doing something
unskillful will have an effect it just may be very mitigated by prior wholesome
actions and so we can we can kind of take delight in cultivating these wholesome
qualities of mind in that it creates the conditions for more and more wholesome
ness and when we do act unskillfully potentially to not have as much as much
of a ripple following that so the reflection on karma that cultivates
equanimity is to recollect that the language in the suttas is something
like I am the owner of my karma I'll say the whole phrase I'm the owner of my
karma I'm the heir to my karma
you to look at it I'm born of my karma I'm related to my karma I abide
supported by my karma whatever karma I shall do for good or for ill
skillful or unskillful whatever karma I shall do skillful or unskillful of that
I shall be the heir so this this reflection in terms of what's happening
right now I mean it both supports the I think the reflection on karma both
supports our movement towards wishing to engage in more wholesome actions but
also to understand that what's arising right now has had it has been shaped by
my past actions shaped by the past now the the point here isn't to beat
ourselves up for for our past actions but to understand that oh yes okay what's
happening now it's it's a lawful result of something that may have happened
before to me it sounds paradoxical in a way that this would lead to
equanimity but try it try it and see what happens as you reflect and and for
me the the reflection of right this is of course this is arising right now the
the experience of seeing you know self-hatred arising depression arising
when I use this kind of reflection of this is the consequence you know that
of course this is happening this is happening because I've practiced
depression for a lot of of my previous life of course this is arising and so
that that it sounds counterintuitive it sounds like we would just immediately
jump on ourselves and say well I shouldn't be have done that you know
but but when we are doing this with the kind of balance of mind to to
recognize oh this is arising right now it's arising independence on prior
conditions and when we can see that doing that with mindfulness creates the
conditions for some ease in the moment there is a balance of mind that that
comes with that it sounds paradoxical it sounds a little bit odd to reflect on
how this teaching of karma this teaching of how prior actions have led to what's
happening right now so I just got a chat somebody said we play the cards we are
dealt yes so that's a that's a kind of a way to to frame this we reap what we
sow another another kind of everyday aphorism that reflects this teaching
and we reap what we sow it's like we don't have to just like go in down in
the dumps about that it's like we can use what we what we sow and and have
some understanding about you know the past conditions and that cultivating
new conditions now leads to new results in the future so that that begins to
support the cultivation of equanimity internally for ourselves and and again I
think you know this the teaching on the reflection of karma very supportive very
helpful again with respect to our loved ones remembering the actions that people
what's happening for people the struggles whatever is happening that the
happiness or unhappiness of our loved ones is dependent on their actions not on
our wishes so that's that's that's a framing of the reflection on karma that's
often offered in the reflection on equanimity I wish you happiness but
your happiness depends upon your actions not upon my wishes for you so the that
again it sounds potentially counterintuitive that that would lead to
some balance of mind some some ability to hold the the struggles of others but
try it it's it's quite amazingly supportive and it surprisingly sometimes you
know surprisingly that oh yeah of course the the of course or that this is
nature this is nature kind of recollection this is nature
