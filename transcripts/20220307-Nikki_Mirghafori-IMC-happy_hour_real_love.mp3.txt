The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Recording is on. Great. So hello, hello. Nice to be with you. Come to practice
together. So, so like to, I like to share something from Take Not Han book
tonight. And he has so many wonderful, beautiful books. And one of my
favorite ones is Pieces Every Step and all these short vignettes. And I
randomly opened a book to a page and it opened to a passage that I love. And I
thought, Oh, okay, I'd like to share this tonight with the sangha. So, so here
we go. So from Take Not Han. This is this section is called Real Love. And for
those of you who may have the book and later want to look this up, it's on
page 80. So Take Not Han says about real love. Let it wash over. You can close
your eyes. I'll read it slowly. We really have to understand the person we
want to love. If our love is only a will to possess, it is not real love. If we
only think of ourselves, if we know only our own needs and ignore the needs of
the other person, we cannot love. We must look deeply in order to see and
understand the needs, aspirations, and suffering of the person we love. I love
that needs, aspirations, and suffering of the person we love. This is the ground
of real love. You cannot resist loving another person when you really understand
them. I'll read the other couple of paragraphs and please think about this
love that he talks about, not only as romantic love, of course not. It's love
of any kind, love of any kind. Even when we have friends, colleagues, a sense of
love and care only if we think of our own needs or people elsewhere. So think of
it as an expansive vision of love. So he continues. The next section is more about
people we know, but again, we can take this principle and make it general. So
next section. From time to time, sit close to the one you love. Hold their
hand and ask, darling, do I understand you enough? Or am I making you suffer? Please
tell me so that I can learn to love you properly. I don't want to make you suffer.
And if I do so because of my ignorance, please tell me so that I can love you
better so that you can be happy. If you say this in the voice that communicates
your real openness and understanding, the other person may cry. That is a good
sign because it means the door of understanding is opening and everything
will be possible. Maybe a father does not have time or is not brave enough to
ask his son such a question. Then the love between them will not be as full as
it could be. We need courage to ask these questions. But if we don't ask, the more
we love, the more we may destroy the people we are trying to love. This is so
profound. If we don't ask, the more we love, the more we may destroy the people
we are trying to love. True love needs understanding. With understanding, the
one we love will certainly flower. What a beautiful teaching. So both in terms of
close relationships, when there's someone near and dear to us, could be a friend,
in this case a child or relative, or even friends, colleagues. And the idea also I
want to bring in here is that we can love people without even liking them. It is
possible to not necessarily like someone but to love them and in this way to care
for or understand, appreciate, take the perspective of their needs, their
suffering, their aspirations, their wants. So as we've practiced together in this
happy hour in the past, with, say, with the neutral being, with the person we
don't know very well, and we bring this sense of common humanity, just like me,
taking their perspective, just like me, as a human being who wants to be happy. So
this idea of real love can be both in terms of people that are near and dear
to us, people we care about in our lives, friends. And if we try to possess, if we
try to just take their time, try to take their resources, that's not real love.
It's real love is not just about me, me, me, my needs, my needs. What can you give
me, dear friend, dear teacher, dear, I don't know, whatever, me, me, me, me, me.
It's just like, so, so a sense of, especially in close real or children, like,
oh, you need to satisfy my need to be loved. What is, what do they need? What,
what is their need? And as, as Thich Nhat Hanh puts, we must look deeply in
order to see and understand the needs, aspirations, and suffering the people we
love. This is the ground of real love.
One last thing to say, it is said that understanding, really understanding someone
else, clear understanding is equivalent to loving them. When we understand
someone, when we really understand them, the heart can open from this perspective
of self-centeredness, just being centered on our own needs, to having a wider
perspective, a bigger perspective. It's not just about me. Then service, actually
love can become an act of service. So I think I have said enough for setting the
frame for our reflection, for our meditation today. So I'd like to invite us all
to land, to arrive in your body, in your posture, if you need to move, to sit, to
your cushion, or lie down. This is the time. Entering a posture that's going to
be comfortable for the next 30 minutes or so, and landing, arriving in this body
here, here,
here. Connecting, understanding. Opening up to the sensations in this body, in
this moment. Not trying to control, but to open up to, to relax into. Can we have
real love for ourselves, for this body? Even if there are pain, there is pain,
there are challenges. Not trying to conquer, but to open up to things as
they are, this breath, this sensation, with open-heartedness.
As always, let us arrive, let us settle first with the breath. As it moves
through the body, the sensations, wherever they show up. Expanding, touching,
knowing, every cell of this body, as if greeting, breath greeting internally, gently
kissing each cell, inviting it to relax, to be just as it is.
Awareness, awareness, aware, awareness, knowing, the breath, the sensations, just this.
Releasing thoughts, plans, just being here, relishing this moment.
I'd like to invite you, maybe first turning, turning to ourselves, turning to
this being, it was me, as if it were a beloved other. As Thich Nhat Hanh recommends
in this passage, real love, asking ourselves these loving questions first,
asking ourselves sweetheart, sweetheart darling, am I making you suffer, am I
making you suffer? Please tell me so, please tell me so that I can learn to
love you properly. I don't want to make you suffer. And if I do so because of my
ignorance, please tell me so that I can love you better. Can we ask ourselves this
question, see what arises, don't think about it, drop it in, drop the question in.
Into your body, as if a pebble dropped into a pond, resonating, the water
resonating, reverberating. How can I love you better, sweetheart, darling?
Maybe the answer is wordless, maybe just asking this question is enough, or
something to be unleashed, opened up internally.
Like to experiment with putting a palm in your heart center, your chest connect
with yourself physically, more fully, your own heart, darling sweetheart, how can I
love you better, am I making you suffer? Help me see, help me know, how can I love
you better?
And this is not a chance to self-recommonate or self-judge, just meeting
yourself with love and understanding. In fact, it's a time not to do any self-judgment or
self-criticism. If any of that is coming up, let's drop it.
Not needed, release. Not a time for self-judgment or shame, just loving, caring, as best as
we're able to.
And now I'd like to invite you to bring to your mind's eye, if you wish. You want to
stay with yourself, if it's been a hard day and lovingly stay with yourself, that's fine.
If it feels appropriate to move on, that's okay also. See what your heart needs right
now. What is the ultimate expression of care? If you like, you can now bring to your mind,
your mind's eye, someone who's near and dear to you, someone you love, care for, their well-being,
now with whom you have an easy relationship, perhaps.
I'm wondering, in your heart, your mind, asking, how can I understand you better? Dear, my dear,
what are your needs? Your aspirations, your hopes, the ways you suffer, how can I understand
you? How can I understand you better? Not to possess, not to satisfy my own needs, but
to understand you, to step out of my limited perspective, what I, me, me, I want. To see
you from your complicated, complex, beautiful perspective of the uniqueness of you, as if
I were gazing through the world, through your eyes, as much as possible. How can I love
you better, through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping behind
their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like? What do you see? How can you
love them better? For their sake, not your sake, their needs and wants.
This way, love can be service, love as service, serving their growth, serving their goodness,
their beauty. How can I serve you better? How can I love you better?
How can I love you better, through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping
behind their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like? How can I love you better,
through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping behind their eyes,
looking at the world, what does it feel like? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping
behind their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like?
How can I love you better, through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping
behind their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like?
How can I love you better, through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping
behind their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like?
How can I love you better, through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping
behind their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like?
How can I love you better, through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping
behind their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like?
How can I love you better, through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping
behind their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like?
How can I love you better, through understanding you? See, for a moment, as if you were stepping
behind their eyes, looking at the world, what does it feel like?
And you can stay with yourself, if you like, as a beloved other, or a dear being, a dear
being in your life. If you want to try a bit of a stretch, maybe bringing someone to mind
that's different from you, many ways different, maybe you've had some minor challenge with,
please don't choose the hardest, most challenging person for you, just tread lightly, someone
maybe who's been complicated a little bit in the past. Just a tiny, tiny bit challenging,
just a touch challenge, where there isn't much energy, and if no one comes up, then
go back to your dear person, or yourself. And can you see this person, this being, from
their perspective, their hopes and dreams, their aspirations, the way they suffer, they
suffer. So if you're looking into the world through their eyes, and trying to understand
them, you could have been born as them, they could have been born as you, this is so random.
The bodies, the circumstances, the parents, were born into the family background upbringing.
What if you were them? Even if you, their areas, their personality you don't like, or
you disagree, can you love them? Meaning, can you understand them better? Just a little
better. Doesn't mean you have to agree with everything they do or say, just can you understand
them? Just a tiny bit more, through this perspective.
And can we offer our love to the world? Stepping outside of ourselves for a moment,
seeing ourselves as a beloved other too, with lives, dies, this short lifespan, being human,
with hopes, aspirations, intentions, needs, sorrows, sufferings, this dear being who's
there, can we love, can we offer our love to the world, as best as we're able to, or
care? Our warmth, our service, service is love, love is service, true love, true understanding,
may all beings everywhere, all beings everywhere, no real love, love themselves, appreciate their
own goodness, may they offer their love to others with generosity, may all beings everywhere,
be happy, may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you for your practice everyone.
Such a beautiful passage teaching by Thich Nhat Hanh, real love. So we have time for
reflections and I just got the note that my internet is a little unstable, I hope you
can hear me, I know probably my image is freezing, but you are welcome, hopefully you can still
hear me. So I see some reflections, thank you, that was wonderful, that was lovely, you
are so welcome, thank you for your practice. So I'd like to open up the space for reflections.
What did you discover, what came up, especially if you haven't spoken for a while, offering
your insights or your questions or your confusion as an offering to serve both yourself being
held and being witnessed then for the benefit of others, if there are aha moments, you can
type them in chat if you like, if you type them to the group, then I will read the reflections,
if you type them to me alone, it will be private, you can also raise your hand. And if you cannot
hear me, you can type it, but I think my image is frozen, but I think audio is still working,
so I hope it's still good. So any reflections, any thoughts you'd like to share from this
practice, questions, comments, deep gosho, thank you, you are welcome, thank you for your
practice. The private question coming, I have quit meditating for many months now, the reason
being every time I sit to meditate, my mind wanders and I become enraged with hatred for
people who have done wrong to me, although they are not in my life anymore. So instead,
I chose to concentrate on hobbies, hobbies that require concentration like learning to
play an instrument and learning a new language. How can I get engaged in regular meditation
again? Thank you. Thank you so much for that question. Yeah, beautiful question. And very
apt. The invitation, the recommendation I have for you is first and foremost, as you
engage with practice to practice self compassion, compassion and love and care for yourself,
because you are the one who is suffering, anger. When we're angry, we feel like, oh,
yeah, we're angry at others, but it's like picking up a hot coal that you're trying
to throw at someone, but who gets hurt when you pick up a hot coal? Well, you get hurt
first, of course. So feeling, holding yourself with compassion when the mind goes to they,
they just bring it back with sweetheart, sweetheart, they're gone off, they're living
their life. They don't even know I'm hurting right now. Just hurting yourself as if you're
holding a young child, a younger version of yourself, just holding this young child,
letting it have a tantrum, letting it cry, letting it be angry, just hold it sweetheart.
It's okay. You're safe. You're safe. You're safe. It's okay. Just holding the child as
long as it's needed for it to be angry with love, with love, not thinking about others,
others, but just yourself. So that's a way, that's a way to, to reengage. That's my invitation.
You're welcome. Please come back and send me a little report and tell me how it went. You
can also send me an email through my website, telling me how this practice I'm inviting,
but you really have to hang in there. You really have to let the whole the younger version,
angry version of yourself be in just with love, with love, with love, maternal love. Just stay,
stay. It's going to take a lot of courage, which is great because it both brings up your own
strength and courage to be with your own suffering with love. So it's a courageous practice. It's
really a, a, a loving warrior practice. It's a loving warrior brings up a sense of strength,
as well as love. So that's what I invite you. Cole, we see your hand is up, please. Yes. Well,
the only near and dear self that I have is myself. And it's been a difficult number of days. And so
it was a big question to ask myself, how can I better understand myself? Because I don't have to
look very far to find a very complicated person as myself. And I don't find it easy at all. I,
I, I can, I can accept myself, even when I'm full of resistance. But that's about all I can do is
just, is just accept, accept my resistance. And I don't know why I'm maybe feeling so much
resistance. Yeah, yeah. That's the best I can do is to accept that. And just figure that I may be
the best thing I can do is be patient. Yes, there is so much wisdom, Cole. And what you just shared,
I want to applaud your inner wisdom. That is beautiful. That is pure wisdom, acceptance. You
may not understand it. That's okay. But can you understand the resistance? Oh, dear sweetheart,
there's a resistance here. Okay, I can be with that. I don't understand it. And I don't need to
probe was it my childhood, my mother, does it's okay, I can just be patient and hold it with
kindness. There is so much wisdom in that to allow it to, to be and unwind and show you the
answers because when we let our confusion, our resistance, our anger, feel safe. When we offer
safety to these complicated emotions without needing to necessarily understand them. So yes,
let's back up from that word understanding. I appreciate that he's using it here. Let's back
up from that understanding about that word. And yeah, using this acceptance, allowing that,
that is deep wisdom. Thanks so much for bringing that in, Cole. Appreciate it. A couple of other
reflections here and before we go quickly into groups. Yeah, another reflection, wonderful
loving practice seek first understand before being understood, quote from Stephen Covey.
Another reflection. Thank you, Nikki, the invitation to ask myself what I need, how I can
love and support this being was timely and moving. Thank you. And Dave says compassion and
Nitta for the Russians were suffering as well. Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. Yes. So many beings,
we all suffer in so many different ways, especially people in time, areas of, of war right now in
this world. Love as service. Thank you for bringing them in. And the last week, I offered
every session compassion and meta, bringing in the people in Ukraine, especially and now
bringing in Russia. And tonight, staying a little more personal, but of course, it's
practicing love as service is not a selfish aspect serving all beings. So I like to invite
us now to turn to engaging in small groups together. And can we, can we hold patiently
each other and just listen or share as little or as much as you need to? Let's start with
maybe 10, 15 seconds of silent meta for one another, and then share as little as you like,
or maybe just hold witness for one another. Maybe that's the way of listening and holding
and understanding, or maybe sharing what you're feeling is about real love, this understanding
as love, love as service. So the rooms are created. I'm opening them up. Please take
care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Speak only from your own experience. Here we go.
Okay, welcome back everyone. And gosh, it is seven o'clock. So we have,
since we took more time, I think earlier with, with questions and reflection. So,
so why don't we dedicate the merit and close our practice together. Thank you all for
practicing and made them the goodness of our cultivation together may be a cause and condition
for goodness, for, for real love, for care in the world, may all beings be well, may all
beings be happy, including ourselves. Thank you so much. Be well.
