Good  morning  to those  of you in the morning ; good  
afternoon  to those  in the afternoon ; and good  evening  to  
those  in the evening.  I have  just a few words  I’d like to 
say this morning.  I think  you all know  that we either  
have  front row seats  for an historical  event  of great  
proportion , or we are on stage  in the middle  of this great  
event.  The coronavirus  is shaping  and changing  the 
world.   
 
Yesterday  I was given  something  from the Internet , 
which  seems  to be anonymous.  It touched  me, so I want  
to share  it with you:  
 
When  you go out and see the empty  streets,  the 
empty  stadiums,  the empty  train platforms,  don’t  say 
to yourself,  “It looks  like the end of the world.” What  
you’re  seeing  is love in action.  What  you’re  seeing  
in that negative  space  is how much  we do care for 
each  other,  for our grandparents,  for our 
immun ocompromised  brothers  and sisters,  for 
people  we will never  meet.    
  
People  will lose their jobs over this. Some  will lose 
their businesses.  And some  will lose their lives.  All 
the more  reason  to take a momen t, when  you’re  out 
on your walk, or on your way to the store , or just 
watching  the news,  to look into the emptiness  and 
marvel  at all that love.   
 
Let it fill you and sustain  you. It is not the end of the 
world.  It is the most  remarkable  act of global  
solidarity  we may ever witness.  
 
I would  like to live in a world  where  we care for each  
other  as neighbors,  friends,  family,  and community.  For 
those  of us who are able to shelter  ourselves,  that is an 
act of love.  It is a way of caring  for this world  and the 
people  around  us. For those  who have  essential  work  
that has to be done,  that also is an act of love.  They’re  
taking  care of all the rest of us. Before  this, we may not 
have  appreciated  how essential  and necessary  they are 
for us.  
 
I’m touched  by the people  who work  in stores.  They’re  
putting  themselves  in the middle  of this – in place s 
where  all kinds  of people  are coming , including  people  
who may not even  know  that they’re  contagious.  Those  
workers  are supporting  us, feeding  us, and making  sure 
that we continue.  I think  of this as an act of care and 
generosity.    
  
I think  of the doctors,  nurses,  and administrators  
working  in hospitals.  I think  of the people  who clean  and 
sterilize  the hospitals.  People  at all levels  are caring  for 
others . Right now, it’s a time for the whole  world  to care 
for each  other.   
 
With regard  to this quote , I’ve walked  through  empty  
streets  and seen all this emptiness  – the absence  of 
people  and of all the hustle  and bustle.  It is indeed  an 
expression  of people  caring.   
 
Rather  than this being  the end of the world,  maybe  we 
can see it as the beginning  of a new world , a fallow  
time.  It’s creating  space  and breathing  room  for 
something  new to be born.   
 
We can appreciate  that what  we’re  doing  is caring,  
loving  and supporting  each  other  – and being  
supported,  loved  and cared  for. If we go out there , and 
really  feel this potential  being  formed,  maybe  we will 
create  a new world  when  this is all over.   
 
So if you go out and about  and see empty  spaces,  think  
of all the care that represents.   
 
I hope  that you take good  care of yourself  and the world  
we share.  Thank  you.
