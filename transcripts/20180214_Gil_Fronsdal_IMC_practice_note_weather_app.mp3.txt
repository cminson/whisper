Practice Note : Weather

When I lived for a short while in Tennessee, I was told 
that there was a saying  there. That is , “If you don’t like 
the w eather , just wait five minutes ” – because 
apparently the weather there changes quite a bit.  
 
One of the ways that I have valued sitting with myself in 
meditation or in life is to view what’s happening within 
me as just weather. Sometimes I’m tired , and it’s tire d 
weather. Sometimes I’m tense , and it’s tense weather. 
Sometimes I’m happy or upset, and it’s happy or upset 
weather. There are all  these di fferent things coming 
through. S ometimes my mind is spinning , and it’s mind -
spinning weather. There  are different s trata in the 
atmosphere . And different strata have different kinds of 
weather.  
 
For me to  just experience these mind states  as weather 
lends itself to not identifying so strongly with them. N ot 
taking them  so seriously , or being so absolute  – as if it’s 
a problem , something to hold on to , or something t o 
build up a case against like , “Oh, t his means that. ” It’s 
just the weather.  
 Most of us don’t fight against the weather. We don’t try 
to fix the weather for ourselves. We might complain, but 
we put on our raincoat anyway. We just learn to work 
with it and live with it.  
 
The ability to just be present , and allow all of these 
different forces  – psychological states, emotions, 
thoughts  – to come through like the weather means that 
we don’t get e ntangled  with them . We don’t get 
involved,  or pick it up , and we  don’t actively reject it . But 
we just allow it to be there.  
 
There’s a certain kind of peace that can come from not 
identifying  it – not reacting or getting caught with it  – 
and just seei ng that, “Oh, it’s just the weather. Wait five 
minutes and it’ll change. ” It’s guaranteed  to change 
within five minutes. But , it’s not guaranteed that your 
mind will be sensitive enough to see the change. So , 
part of what we do in mindfulness practice is to s it 
quietly to increase the sensitivity. The higher the 
sensitivity is to what’s happening in the moment, the 
more we see that the w eather’s changing all the time.  
 
So enjoy the weather. Thank you.
