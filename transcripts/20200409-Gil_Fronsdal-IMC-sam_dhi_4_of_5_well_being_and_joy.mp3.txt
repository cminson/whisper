This is the fourth talk in the series on the faculty of 
concentration, samādhi. As I said the first day, samādhi 
has two very general meanings. As a faculty, our topic 
today , it’s a particular fun ctionality of the mind. The 
ancient Buddhists thought it was a particular place in the 
brain that is able to be settled, focused, gathered 
together.  
 
Maybe it’s not a particular place, but rather a combined 
functioning of different mental faculties , which  work in 
harmony to get us settled into the second meaning of 
samādhi, which is a generalized state of being – a state 
of mind.  
 
Samādhi is a state in which we are fully present, fully 
engaged in what’s happening. There’s a long tradition of calling that “being absorbed ,” but the idea of “being 
absorbed” can mean losing ourselves in the experience 
– an excessive merging in the experience where there 
isn’t clarity of attention or awareness of what’s 
happening.  
 
However, the way I understand it for myself, and from 
the ancient teachings of the Buddha, as concentration 
deepens in meditation, there is a greater and greater 
clarity of attention – the mindfulness becomes brighter. 
In fact, the deepest states of what is usually called 
‘absorption ,’ jhāna , include  a very clear form of 
awareness or mindfulness.  
 
The state of being fully and continually present – fully 
aware, with the mind not distracted, not fragmented – 
this undistracted presence has a lot to do with what 
samādhi  is. 
 
As we really get prese nt, organized , and unified for 
something, there are a number of things that are not 
happening , and a number of things that begin to happen. 
What’s not happening is that the busy, active, thinking 
mind is not perpetuating itself.  
 
The thinking mind is ofte n thought of as a self -
perpetuating machine – the faster we think, especially if 
we have negative thoughts – the more stressful it is for 
the mind. The mind is stressed both by the strength of the thinking and by what is being said . Our thoughts can 
be lik e little daggers we stick ourselves with. A leading 
source of all kinds of psychological problems is 
rumination – the regular, continuous things we’re saying 
to ourselves. That is a particular function of the mind – to 
think and have imagery a lot, to spin  stories and ideas – 
it keeps going and going.  
 
What begins  to happen in samādhi is that the mind gets 
settled , quiet , and unified. There is a quieting of the 
thinking mind. When we are spared from some of the 
stories, beliefs, criticisms, and undermining thoughts, 
there is more space in the mind for other things. Once 
the irritating or stressful kinds of thoughts are qui et – 
then, with th e feeling of being unified and present – 
grows a good feeling, to use a non -technical word.  
 
One of the things that falls away or quiets down are 
thoughts and feelings of discontent, irritation, or 
boredom . All these are activities of th e mind. Nothing is 
inherently boring except for the activities of the mind that 
evaluate it that way. Nothing is irritating except for the 
activities – thoughts and ideas of the mind – that 
interpret it that way.  
 
All these mental activities that make us feel dissatisf ied, 
uncomfortable, irritated, bored, wanting, greedy, wanting 
something else, expectations – all these activities have a 
stressful effect on our mind and body . But as we allow the mind to settle and get quieter, these things begin to 
quiet a s well.  
 
The more concentrated, fully engaged and settled we 
can become – allowing the particular experience we’re 
focusing on to fill awareness, to be the subject we are 
doing – then the mind gets quieter and clearer. All these 
afflictive thoughts and ideas fall a way. If there is no 
boredom, no irritation, no dissatisfaction, then we’re just 
here in a deeper, settled way. We can feel deeply 
contented, deeply satisfied, deeply at peace, deeply 
happy.  
 
It’s not because we are making ourselves happy or 
contented. It’s  just the goodness, the peace and relief of 
not having these afflictive thoughts and ideas. In his 
teachings the Buddha particularly singles out the Five 
Hindrances. When they quiet down, there’s a sense of 
goodness what he calls a gladness, or joy and 
happiness, that can be there, just because it’s so good 
to not to be afflicted anymore – a sense of relief in the 
fullness of it.  
 
I also believe that as this afflictive overlay finally gets 
quiet – not an easy thing to do  – as we get more 
concentrated, settled, and unified – there is a deeper 
sense of goodness and well -being that has a chance to 
bubble up. The image the Buddha uses for this deeper 
well-being is that of an underwater fountain in the bottom of the lake , which  flows up and spreads new, refreshing 
water out into the lake.  
 
The idea that deep inside us is a fountain, a spring of 
well-being that can well up and fill us – it’s not something 
we are doing, making, or forcing – but more like we’re 
getting out of the way. When the hindrances and these 
afflictive thoughts have finally quieted down, and we 
learn how to open, be fully present and make space for 
something to come in, make space to be influenced by 
the depths of what’s good inside of us – then we can 
someti mes feel this wellspring of joy or well -being or 
happiness. That is one way of experiencing it. Everyone 
has a slightly  different way.  
 
Part of samādhi practice is the practice of letting go . But 
I think that, more profoundly , it’s a practice of getting ou t 
of the way – allowing ourselves to trust something really 
deep inside , and get quiet enough that we begin allowing 
this to flow. Certainly , as we begin this movement of 
trusting something deep inside, some of what happens is 
the purification process.  
 
Some of what has been buried deep inside – grief, 
anger , and sorrow for example  – needs to come out and 
have its time in the sun of awareness in order to  empty 
out. We have to learn that process, be patient with it – 
hopefully know not to add afflictive th oughts on top of it – 
but just feel inspired that it’s so good to have this stuff finally come out , so that it can dissipate, resolve itself, 
heal itself.  
 
With this deeper movement of healing , at some point, 
the goodness wells up – the well -being, the gl adness 
wells up . It flows  and tingles . It feels  warm, soft, quiet, 
and connected . We feel like we’re home, cozy.  
 
There’s an image I love for getting really settled, feeling 
part of the joy that can happen in meditation. I spend a 
lot of time focusing on the breath, so the breath is like a 
rhythm . Sometimes I feel it’s like petting the cat. I don’t 
just tap the cat. I don’t take a fist and press down hard 
on it. I gently stroke the cat, and it starts purring. If I stop 
stroking the cat, it stops purring. I f I start stroking it 
again, the cat purrs. In the same way, we stay with the 
breath.  
 
Breathing is like stroking the cat . Or the awareness is 
like the stroking of the cat, just staying with the 
breathing. At some point – it’s not automatic and it’s not 
something you can force – as we get more and more 
settled, there can be a sense of the whole system of who 
we are . Everyone experiences it differently . The system 
– our body and mind – (in a non -technical idea) begins 
to purr . It begins to feel good, nice a nd light.  
 
This recognition of goodness, pleasure, what feels 
beautiful, or feels ‘purringful’ is part of what supports samādhi practice. Without expectation, without demand, 
without striving, but being open to start feeling the 
goodness, the well -being that comes when we settle, 
and allow that well -being to influence us, meaning get 
out of the way and let it move through us. The Buddha 
talked about letting it suffuse us, the whole body.  
 
This is part of samādhi, this sense of joy and happiness 
that can come from the practice. So thank you. I hope 
that you have a wonderful day, wonderful next twenty -
four hours. I hope that your inn er life provides you with 
nourishment and well -being.
