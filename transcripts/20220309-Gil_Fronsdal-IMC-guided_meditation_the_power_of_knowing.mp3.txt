 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, hello everyone. My warm greetings and my best wishes for all of you for your meditation. I hope that you find your meditation to be settling for you, beneficial for you, and that it's inspiring for you to be meditating in community, many other people meditating at the same time today. There are many ways to benefit from meditation, from mindfulness meditation. One of the ways does not require anything to be any different. It doesn't require us to somehow become more settled or calm. It doesn't require us to dispel certain states of mind or ways of being which are unpleasant to have, difficult to have. But one way is to begin appreciating the simple act of knowing. It can be so simple, innocent, and so such a common part of everyday life to know. There's a door when we see a door and a door handle and opening the door. We know all these things, myriad things all the time. But we seldom find the full fruition or full value of a clear moment of knowing. Where knowing something, anything at all, is a miracle. It's an amazing thing that the mind can do. That somehow out of the cosmic soup there evolved living beings that could have concepts, ideas, perceptions that can be had, moments of cognition, can be experienced where we know, oh, that is a door. That's an itch. That's an inhale. That's an exhale. And as I describe this, it might not still seem such a wonderful thing. But as knowing begins to become simplified or purified, and the knowing stands out by itself as its own clarity, where the knowing is independent of what is known. So if someone has something that I want and I'm caught up in wanting it, I know what the object is. Maybe they have ice cream or something and I want the ice cream. And so I've recognized this ice cream, but the wanting kind of is all over the place. My mind is swirling with thoughts about how I can manage to get it. But our knowing is often interspersed with or connected with our desires, our aversions, our confusions, all kinds of things, our commentary, our history, our memory. But when knowing becomes simple, really, really simple, has no baggage with it, it begins to feel special. There's a kind of peace in it. There's a kind of ease in it. There's a kind of freedom to be found in the knowing. And this is one of the kind of inner dimensions of this mindfulness practice that, once we can appreciate this, the practice opens up in a very different way. And so rather than needing to change anything, change ourselves, it's appreciating more and more knowing what's happening. And so the cliche or the little saying is that the insight practice is less about having new experiences as it is about seeing in a new way. So this knowing. So I'll do a little exercise about this kind of knowing, maybe help you kind of appreciate how simple and clear it can be. And then, of course, the meditation will apply that to the mind. So assuming a meditation posture, and gently closing the eyes, and taking a few moments to settle in quietly, whatever way you'd like, taking in some deep breaths, relaxing whatever way that you want to do it. So I'm going to do a little exercise on knowing. And then a little exercise in knowing. Find a sensation in your body that is pretty neutral. It could be sensations of your hand, if that's neutral, or maybe there's some contact of your foot to rinse against your mat, your floor. Something that's relatively, maybe the temperature of your body. Something that's not particularly pleasant, particularly unpleasant. Something where you can kind of not have too much of a reaction to. And then let yourself become aware of this sensation. Notice if there's any attitude of being either for or against it, or questioning and wondering what this exercise is about, resisting it, or a little bit irritated, as you do an exercise, or eager to explore it and figure out what's going on here. And see if you can let go of all that, maybe an exhale. Relax all the ideas and attitudes about. And instead, see if you can know the sensation, recognize it in the simplest, direct way. You don't have to know exactly what it is. Just approximate is fine. And let there be a clear, see if you can find a way to clearly recognize. It could be with verbal thoughts in your mind, it could be a brightening of the inner eye, a clear recognition of the sensation, where the recognition is its own event. The word door is not the door, it represents the door. So for your sensation that you're having, the recognition is not the sensation, but it's an amazing event in the mind that the mind would know, recognize. And see if you can recognize or see or understand that the act of recognition is distinct from the sensation. Of course they're related, but the sensation does not need to have the recognition to exist. So stay with the sensation, maybe breathe with it if it's there, or find another one, and see if the knowing, the seeing of it, can be very, very simple, and maybe a kind of brightness to it, clarity, this is what's happening, a clarity that doesn't have to have a before and after, ideas of what's going to happen or why it's happening, just the event itself in this moment. And now calmly, become aware of how your mind is, what your mind state, your mood in the mind, what your inner life like, what your mind state is, what your mind state is, what your inner life like. And in the radical simplicity, recognize in some way what's happening now for your mind, how it is. And recognize it with a kind of independence and clarity, which you did the sensation. Attempt to step back to be free enough that the knowing is not entangled with the mind state, it just knows. In a spectrum from contracted to expansive mind, how is your mind more contracted or more expansive or right in the middle, or not clear, none of the above? Recognizing how it is, maybe recognizing the miracle of knowing anything. And when you know your mind state this way, with this kind of clear knowing, relaxed and open, allowing, what happens to the mind state? Does anything shift? And if it does, then know the shift. And then we'll continue in silence. But as you would go along, maybe centering yourself on the breathing, from time to time, know the state of your mind. And see if you can know it with a simple, clear way of knowing, where the knowing itself is not for or against, not trying to do anything or understand anything complicated. The knowing is just a recognition, the miracle of recognition. Thank you................ You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You Knowing the mind as it is Taking refuge in the simplicity of knowing Knowing is a kind of protection When it protects us from fixing and predicting Wanting and not wanting You You You You You You You You You You And then as we come to the end of this sitting You You You You You You
