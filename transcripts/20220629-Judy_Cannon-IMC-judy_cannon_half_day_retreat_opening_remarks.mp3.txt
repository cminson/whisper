The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Good morning again. I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Judy Cannon. I live in
Burlingame. I'm a Catholic nun. I was sister of Mercy and I live in our
assisted living convent in Burlingame. I first started Buddhist practice around
2000. I read a book by Jack Cornfield and then I found out in conversation that
Tara Brock taught in Bethesda, Maryland and I lived near there. So I went to her
Wednesday evening sessions for two years with 200 other people. It was
wonderful introduction. Then I moved back here. This bay area is my home and I go
away and I come back and I came to IMC in about 2003 and appreciate what is
happening here at the Center all the time. My mentor in the Eightfold Path
Program and have her a few years. I served one term on the IMC board and I'm
very grateful for the support for practice. Lately I've been thinking about
motivation for practice and I looked for a couple of quotes I'd like to share
with you. Jack Cornfield said, we need a repeated discipline, a genuine training
in order to let go of our old habits of mind and to find and sustain a new way
of seeing. Discipline, training, a new way of seeing. Here's a quote from the
Dalai Lama. Awareness of impermanence is encouraged so that when it is coupled
with our appreciation of the enormous potential of our human existence, it will
give us a sense of urgency that I must use every precious moment.
Impermanence, potential, urgency. Another quote from Jack Cornfield. The trouble is
that you think you have time. And these words I think encourage us to use time
well for our spiritual practice and obviously when we come to Wednesday
half-day retreats we're using time very well and we're very fortunate we have
the opportunity and we express our commitment by accepting it and coming
and we support one another. Today as we sit and we walk mindfully we might open
our minds and our hearts to the experience of gratitude. We could begin
by appreciating our human birth. We have gratitude to our parents and their
parents and our ancestors. We have gratitude for the Buddha, for our hearing
about the Dharma, and for our putting into practice and learning more about the
Dharma. And we're grateful for our life circumstances that make it possible for
us to come here today. Earlier this month I was on a retreat at Mercy Center in
Burlingame. It was a Zen Sashin in the East-West meditation program and then
every night at about nine our practice together ended with a little ritual and
two people went out in the hallway they had drums and gongs and one read rather
dramatically. Let me respectfully remind you life and death are of extreme
importance. Time passes quickly and opportunity is lost. Each of you should
try to awaken. Do not squander our life. And I've read that these words are
engraved over one of the temples in Asia. So today next we'll continue our
meditation with walking. We'll walk until 11 either inside the building or
outside and we're asked not to walk in any of the parking lots of the dentist
or anyone else. If you'd like some instructions for walking meditation
please see Anne who's our manager for today. She'll be right outside the door
on the deck here and she can help. And at 10.55 a bell will ring and we'll
gather for sitting meditation from 11 to 11.45. Then I'll give a short talk and
at noon we'll do mindfulness and action by cleaning the temple for 15 minutes
and then we'll gather for our closing circle in the parking lot and people who
wish to stay will sit together for tea and chatting and have lunch if you
brought it. During the morning from 10.15 to 11.30 I will be available for
individual practice discussions for people who wish and there's a sign of
sheet on the counter just inside the front door. When we're outside we need
not wear face masks. And if you have any questions please ask Anne our manager
for today. So we begin our walking meditation.
