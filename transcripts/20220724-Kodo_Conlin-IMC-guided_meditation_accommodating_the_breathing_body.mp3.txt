 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, all. So we'll start with the sitting. Welcome ourselves to the seat. Beginning with reconnecting our bodies to the Earth. This companion of ours that's always with us. So first, inviting the attention to the point of contact with the Earth. Sitz bones, low body. Finding your stable base. And upon that stable base, little bit by little bit, allowing the spine to grow long and tall. All the way up through the crown, the back top of the head. As the spine grows long, you may find your body adjusting itself. You may want to roll your shoulders back and let go of any of the tensions in the upper body. And the invitation for this half hour is to let the upright, steady, alert yet relaxed body guide the attention. Bringing our attention to this breathing body. And as we settle into contact with this breathing body, you may notice tensions or contractions build up over a few minutes. And with an easy, deep breath, full inhale and exhale, just letting those go. And renewing the posture. Exhale. To accompany this breathing body with our simple, straightforward attention in its textures and temperatures. And when the inner worlds, the images, fantasies, have the attention, the moment of recognition, oh, fantasy. And then gently releasing the thought, the idea, like a helium balloon letting it float away into the sky. And then gently releasing the thought, the moment, the moment, the moment, the moment, the moment. And then gently releasing the thought, the moment, the moment, the moment, the moment, the moment. And then gently releasing the thought, the moment, the moment, the moment, the moment, the moment, the moment. to accompany this breathing body, releasing any of the tensions, the holdings or holdings that build up or accumulate, easing into a simple settled awareness here and now. And in our last minutes of this sitting, the invitation is to release, relax any effort in the meditation, relaxing the body, relaxing the mind to sense into in your experience now, if there's any, any hint of the wholesome qualities of settledness or ease or collectedness that ever risen. Just a minute to appreciate those. And if there's no hint of that in the experience, just continuing to accompany the breathing body. Yes? Thank you. We should continue. graduate Master Ching Hai Thank you!
