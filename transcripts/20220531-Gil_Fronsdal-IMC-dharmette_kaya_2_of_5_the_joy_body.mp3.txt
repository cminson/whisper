The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So continuing the theme of this week, the different ways we can experience our
body, and because it can be so dramatically different depending on
the circumstance, the state of the mind, we can almost refer to them as
different bodies. We refer to them as, so yesterday there's a karmic body and
that's where most people live most of the time if they're paying attention to
their bodies. They're experiencing the body that's very much under the
influence, under the impact of our thinking, our wanting, our not wanting, our
fear, all this kind of volitional force that that is operating and that if
used chronically or regularly builds up a very strong feelings of the body, sense
of what the body is about. Meditation begins to quiet down two things. It
quiets down the ongoing karmic formation, the ongoing karmic force that is shaping
our experience of our life, but especially experiencing of our body, and it
begins to recover from the legacy of that karmic shaping of what's
going on. Very simply, if you spend your days with your shoulders up to
your ears because you're tense or afraid, there's a continuous fear
that's the karmic force, and then as we stop the fear the shoulders can relax,
but they might be so chronic that it doesn't relax all the way, and so then
sitting and meditating slowly, slowly the shoulders might find a way to relax more
and more, and so the legacy of that karmic anxiety or fear begins to abate.
That gets replaced with time, that automatically, with a sense of pleasure
or well-being or ease or lightness, openness, softness in the very same
shoulders, and it's easier than to go on to the next concern and not linger and
pay attention to the shoulders, but it's possible also to feel how there's kind
of release of energy, there's a kind of a way in which the tightness and
definition of the shoulders softens, and the shoulders become kind of more
porous or softer or more kind of in flow with the rest of the body, there's a
release of energy, and it might not be noticed that release because you know
it's not maybe that much, but the opposite, this day chronically tense is
exhausting and can really create a lot of tiredness through the day
exhaustion and weariness, and without that tension our energy is more
available in a cleaner, easier way, doesn't get so tired. As we sit in
meditation and relaxing the body, relaxing the karmic body, that there
starts to be available to us not only a nicer flow or glow or vitality of energy,
but also as we start getting settled in more and more, there can be
pleasures that begin appearing, pleasant experiences that begin to show
themselves. They might be very subtle, but starting to pay attention to them and
notice them allows them to grow, allows them to have a different influence on us
than if we continually take in the karmic body, take in the karmic
pain and the karmic thoughts and all the ideas of what's all wrong about the
world or ourselves or our situation. These thoughts have a huge impact on us,
and if those negative thoughts are chronic, they can have the karmic
repercussions on ourselves are huge. It's not cost-free to spend a lot of time
with angry thoughts or depressing thoughts or undermining thoughts. And so
part of what meditation can begin doing is to quiet down those all those
thinking and thoughts. And then if we pay attention to the subtle pleasure, subtle
well-being, it begins showing us a different orientation. It shows us there's
more going on, there's more to the story of our life than our challenges. Part of
the story of our life is our capacity for well-being, for feeling of a healthy
body, a flow of a body. And even if there's illness, even if there's injury and
pain in the body, it's possible that the container, that the overall atmosphere of
the body that holds that pain is one that's soft and pleasant with pleasure
and joy. And this sense of pleasure and joy that can be there makes it much
more interesting for the mind to want to be present here and now. And it
supports the mind to want to be here in the present moment with the body, with
the breathing. And so there's it starts to be this unification process of
gathering together process and maybe around the breathing, around the mind
from this practice. The mind is less scattered, less interested in other
things. It's kind of our interest becomes more and more centered here. And there
starts to happen and it creates a kind of breathing room, creates space for
something to begin to emerge. The karmic mind is a reactive mind. And the karmic
mind, a reactive mind doesn't make room for the wellsprings within to flow
freely and emerge, the emergent quality of healthy emotions. And one of the
emergent qualities that begins to arise in meditation is a feeling of joy, a
feeling of delight, a feeling of kind of I liken it to that of a child letting
go, sliding down a slide. And it's squealing and so happy. Not that we're
squealing in meditation, but the letting go into our breathing, into our
experience here. At some point there does feel like there's a little bit of
momentum and joy and a kind of pleasure from that letting go. It's a little bit
like letting go into this sense of well-being that can be here. And there's
also some, there's also some way in which mysterious way, maybe not so mysterious
to people who know the neurochemistry of the brain, that as we begin to get
concentrated and settled and focused here, there starts to emerge as a
wellspring from within, more and more joy, more and more happiness. And over time,
and it might be years for us, some of us, this happiness and joy in meditation
begins to suffuse the body, begins to spread. And until at some point it
kind of dominates over, or my experience is that somehow it lifts me out of the
karmic body. And then when the concentration is no longer there, I come
back into the karmic body. And there's this, as it lifts out, there's this
pervasive feeling of well-being, a glow, a warmth, a joy, a lightness that can have
all kinds of different intensities from a mild, pleasant intensity to some
times quite strong. But the, but we start feeling a whole different feeling of
what the, what the body is. And this sometimes is called the joy body or the
bliss body. And it's the emergent experience of the body that is a
paradigm shift for the mind. It's kind of like, wow, is this possible? Is this my
body? It involves almost a shift of identity where the boundaries of the
body are not so strong, where there's a sense of safety and confidence, where
there is a sense of safety, openness, joy. And we start experiencing ourselves in a
very different way than the karmic body will ever let us know. And if we only
have the karmic body as a reference for how the body is to be experienced, we
think the karmic body is the real body. Remember, these are the bodies that we
experience. They're not the corporal body, the physical body, their body that's
being experienced. And all experience of the body is mediated through the
activities, states of the mind. And as those states of mind shift, the
experience of the body shift. And one of the ways it shifts is into the karmic
body. That's just one more way in which the mind manufactures or predisposes us
to experience the body. It's not any more real than the joy body, the bliss
body. And they both have their place, they both have their value. And so to
begin settling into and relaxing into the sense of pleasure, sense of joy, sense
of happiness, that maybe at first is only hints, only we have little traces of
these going on. But these are things to relax into, to open into, to allow
for, to have as a supports as a toe hold in the present moment. And so that
toll can grow and grow. Inevitably, people who experience this something like
this, this joy and delight, pleasure in the body, that inevitably people will
become attached to it, prioritize it, try to make it happen again and try too
hard. And of course, there's no crime in doing this. Maybe it's a developmental
stage to do this. And maybe most people have to go through this. And I went
through that. And until I realized I wasn't working. And so, and so we have
developmental stage to go through the attachment, the clinging, the wanting,
trying to make it happen with too much force, too much expectation and
attachment. And, and then we start seeing that, then we can begin working with
that and letting go of that. And because if we don't, if we stay with the
attachment and expectations and the demands that should be a certain way,
we're just contributing to more of the karmic stream and more of the karmic
body gets, gets reinforced. So, chances are if you start opening up and
experiencing in meditation this joy body, you will get attached. You've been
warned so that now you can be mindful of that and not be so caught in it and hold
it lightly and find your way through it. So, I certainly understand that this
teaching on the joy body might be very distant from some of you. It's, you know,
idea what I'm talking about and it feels maybe even a betrayal or as a, as a offense
to the challenge difficulties you have with your body. And, however, there might
be something here for you, even so. And maybe through the day today, give yourself
extra time, give yourself pauses through the day, maybe put your, your smartphone
on a timer or something and every 30 minutes, every hour or something, have a
real, you know, extended pause. The only purpose of which is to feel embodied,
physical, pleasure and joy. Go for a walk, sit and have some tea, look out the
window and relax and see if you can touch it. As a touch to have a joy or
delight or pleasure in your body, be a touchstone for a few moments and and see
what happens through the day. Touchstones check-ins to your body's
capacity for pleasure, joy and happiness. May you have greater well-being today
than you would have otherwise. Thank you.
