 It's recorded that Buddha's last words were last instructions with it, impermanent are all conditioned things, earnestly practice on, strive on earnestly. Impermanent are all conditioned things. It's a pretty significant statement. You think that the Buddha, after 40 years of teaching, would choose his words pretty carefully for his last instructions, his last teaching before he died. And what he chose to say was impermanent are all conditioned things. Carry on with your practice sincerely and intently. Another way that this could be said, in which the Buddha often talked, in a sense, was impermanent are all things that come into existence. Anything that arises in existence, anything that's born, is impermanent, is transient, and will pass away. And Buddhism can be seen as one great contemplation on impermanence. Impermanence is the subject of impermanence. The understanding, the perception, the realization of impermanence is very central to the whole Buddhist tradition and to the experience that Buddhism is, in a sense, seeking through practice. And of course you might say that impermanence, the perception of impermanence, is pretty universal in cultures and societies and human beings and religions. And here in the West we have the famous statement by Heraclitus that when something like, you can't step in the same river twice, implying that things are constantly changing, I suppose. Even though it's kind of a universal experience and universal understanding, Buddhism perhaps is distinguished by its thorough exploration of the subject, of the theme, and its recognition that impermanence, or transience, or change is one of the doors to liberation, one of the doors to awakening, to finding our ease in our life. In Buddhism there are three doors, they're formally called doors, to this world of ease or liberation or awakening. And these in Pali are Anicca, Anatta, Anduca, impermanence, no self, and suffering. And there's a kind of acute, I don't know who thought this up, there's kind of a acute paraphrasing of this. Basically these three doors or three characteristics can be translated into English as being, things change, it hurts, but don't take it personally. And that's the truth. And that things change doesn't necessarily mean that things have to hurt, but impermanence is not always a pretty sight, not always so pleasant in the usual relationships we have with the world. And for most people I think as we get older, impermanence becomes ever more obvious. Partly our families and friends begin to pass away, some family and friends get born during our lifetime and appear. But as we get older it seems like this circle of people who pass away becomes greater and greater. Certainly my life, but it's been very powerful for me to meet a few people on retreats. It has been mostly just gay men who have come in and told me that all their friends have died, and they're the last ones left. The only relief, the only happiness, the only relief about that is that there's no one left to mourn, no one left to really grieve. So they don't have to go through it one more time. And death perhaps is one of the primary places where impermanence teaches us, as a primary indicator that impermanence is outside of our control. We don't know when we're going to die. Impermanence plays a role in our life, which is quite uncertain. We're closely related to uncertainty. You can't control the flow of change. You can control it to some degree, but ultimately we have very little control over a lot of what goes on. And it's phenomenal to me how quickly things can change. One Vipassana student who lives in Berkeley went to Stinson Beach to spend a nice day in the beach, and she took her car and her car keys and her driver's license, but she was going to the beach, and so she didn't want to bring anything else in a towel. And she came back, and the Oakland Hills fire took away not only her house, but all her work. She had her office at home and everything. Everything disappeared for her, just in the matter of an afternoon, I guess. Things changed very quickly. And I've said, and other people have referred to this famous quote in the Mahabharata, where someone asks, or the Mahabharata states rhetorically, or someone asks, what is the most wondrous thing? And the answer is that people can see aging and death all around them and assume it's not going to happen to themselves. That's the most amazing thing. And if someone said that to me 20 years ago, I would have not understood. That's silly. Of course I know I'm going to die. But I would say that, as I sit in my life today, my relationship to death and my own death is quite different than it was 20 years ago. It seems closer. And it doesn't seem like something that's going to, perhaps, theoretically happen. So impermanence manifests itself in many ways in our lives. It manifests itself just in the aging process itself. Our bodies change. And I feel my body changing. And I don't want it to change the way it's changing. Stop! What good is it? Stop, stop! And we can do things, of course, and we have a culture that does a lot of things to control aging and tries to do things to slow it down. And to varying degrees of success. But it's kind of a lost battle. So impermanence can be a surprise with things that arise and pass. If impermanence was personified, if we can paint it as a person or something, how would you depict it? Those of you who are artists are thinking, what personality, what kind of being would impermanence look like if you were going to personify it? Water. Like a river. But as a being, if you're going to put into a person kind of like a being or an animal or an entity, what would it look like? What? A chameleon is pretty good. A chameleon. What kind of personality would it have? A politician. What? A trickster? A tester? A jester. A magician? A magician? Slithery. Slithery. What would an alamewy be, Zillow? Zillow. You change personality. All the time? Why allos? Allos took the Chinese herbs and the hinches of the hinches. Borderline? Borderline. Schizophrenic. And some of you might know the Buddhist depiction of the wheel of life. You can see it's picked up like a wheel. And then outside the wheel there's this monster. And it's not impermanence, but it's time. And it says huge jaws. And the jaws I think are holding the wheel. Because the time just eats everything up in its way. So impermanence. And impermanence involves three different things maybe. You can say one, it certainly involves loss. And that's often the painful part of impermanence. But also partly because of loss it involves new birth and new potential. And it allows for new potential. And without change there could be no new potential, no development. Nothing new would arrive. The third thing, which is perhaps most overlooked, at least from a Buddhist analysis of stuff, from what goes on in our life, is that impermanence is intimately connected to interrelationships. Relationality. Conditionality. All things are conditioned. All things are related. And if things were permanent, things wouldn't have this relationship of relationality, of being codependently arising, of being dependent on each other. Nothing exists, they say in Buddhism. It's my best guess also that nothing exists without having come or independence of something else that's created it. And so impermanence is what allows for this very intimate interrelational life that is the reality we live in. And to live in the world of impermanence is to live in the world of relationships. And to understand those relationships. And it's said that if you begin understanding a little bit about impermanence and a little bit about relationality, it's possible to find a lot more ease, a lot more freedom in living our life. So again, as I'm repeating myself, Buddhism stresses what should perhaps be most obvious, that almost everything, Buddhism does anything that is born, anything that comes into existence will pass away. And rather than the word impermanence for Anicca, sometimes I think that a nicer word maybe is transiency. Because transiency in my mind, when I hear the word, it implies something is in transit. Whereas in impermanent, mountains are impermanent, fine, but they're kind of there, and they're not going anywhere. But transiency implies more things are in transit, things are here as guests, things are here as visitors in a sense, or in process. It's passing through. In Buddhism, impermanence and reality itself, everything, our body, our reality, is neither positive nor negative. And I'm thinking, I'm partly saying this because the inquiring mind has asked to talk to me about the Buddhist, where the sacred fits into Buddhism. What's the Buddhist relationship to the sacred? And maybe that's not a category that's appropriate for Buddhists, because it's a particularly Western concept, the sacred, and usually it goes with a profane. And a lot of people will say, well, the world is sacred, my body is sacred, the body's not sacred, let's get rid of it and go up to some other place. It's profane. There's all these kinds of relationships. But in Buddhism, the world, reality, our body, our experience is neither sacred or profane. It's just what it is. And so impermanence, the world of impermanence is just simply what is. We're not trying to fight or resist or say anything, we're making conclusions about the world of change and impermanence. It's just what is. Which for some people is a relief, and for some people it's kind of frightening that there is such a kind of worldview. Because the world as it is, the world of impermanence, is a world of very profound suffering. It's painful to have things pass away. And so some people in defense, in a sense, of that kind of pain that the world has, want to kind of make it pretty. And they'll find a worldview, find a religious worldview, oh, it's okay. The suffering is redeeming. If you suffer and it has good purposes, and you'll get an afterlife or some future life or it builds character or something. And so you put a nice picture on it by how the benefits from it are denied. There is no suffering. It gets very complicated, theology, and worldviews about denial and projection and hope, projection of hope into the future as a compensation for the suffering now. In Buddhism, there's no real attempt to try to pretty the world up, make it look better than it is. But there's also no attempt to try to make it look worse than it is. To say this is terrible and an awful place to be and let's get out of here as quickly as we can. I would argue that Buddhism doesn't say that. Some people might disagree with me. Anyway, the world is what it is. And Buddhism, we're here just to see it for what it is. Without adding on top of it, good or bad, or as Hamlet said, apparently. What did he say? Things... He said, things are neither... Nothing is neither... That's it. Nothing is neither good or bad, but thinking makes it so. In four hours you said a lot. So, you're excusing me for not remembering at all? In Japanese Buddhism, they have a little bit different relationship to impermanence. There's a kind of melancholy feeling about the recognition of impermanence. There's this very acute sense of the impermanence of life. And the dew drop, the morning dew, is one of the symbolisms of how things are very impermanence. But there's also kind of... You feel sometimes in Japanese poetry and some art. I don't know if melancholy is the right word. They call it wabi and sabi. A kind of a melancholy, kind of a... I'm not sure quite... No one really knows how to translate it. The kind of emotional tone that goes with recognizing that things pass away. Bittersweet, maybe. I don't know. So, it's possible, of course, to fixate on the impermanence nature of life, the transiency. By some of the ways I've talked about, by denying it, by resisting it, by despairing about it. Protecting oneself from it, trying to get certainty, trying to get security. And it's a kind of... That's one way of fixating on it, trying to pull it at an arm's distance. And I think a lot of people try to do that. It's not fairly common. Another whole relationship to have towards impermanence is to see the possibility of freedom, of finding what ease in it, or surfing on a change. And, you know, I apologize if it's been said too many times on me and others, but this beautiful poster of Swami Satchitananda of... I never saw it, but it's been told so many times, I think I have. He's this wonderful Indian Swami with a long beard and long hair, and he's in a lion's cloth, and he's in the yogic tree pose. He's standing on one leg, and one leg's tucked up, and he's in his hands are like this. And he's posed on top of a surfboard that's riding a big wave. And underneath the picture it says, you can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf. Practice yoga with Swami Satchitananda. So learning to surf, learning to work with it rather than fixate on it. In Indian religions, and the little bit I've studied of it, have various relationships with the world of impermanence, and it can maybe distinguish... I can distinguish two different relationships that you find in some different Indian religious traditions. It seems like very central to the Indian religion traditions is the recognition of impermanence. Everywhere I've gone in Indian religions, it's really central, the understanding of impermanence, more it seemingly than any religions in the West. But one understanding is to equate the world of impermanence, which is everything, with suffering. And if you have a simple equation, impermanence equals suffering, and if you want to be free of suffering, then the only option you have is to get rid of impermanence. And the only way you get rid of impermanence is because you can't really exactly get rid of all this, but you can find or relate or leave and attain some kind of transcendental state. And so often they posit then a transcendental realm of existence. Transcendence becomes a very important goal because this impermanent world is not the place to be because it's suffering, it's painful. Buddhism has a little bit different take on this simplistic kind of way of seeing it, talking about it. Rather than saying impermanence equals suffering, Buddhism adds one more element to the equation, and Buddhism says impermanence plus clinging equals suffering. And now with the element of clinging attached to the equation, Buddhists then have the option not to get rid of the world of impermanence, but they have the option of getting rid of clinging. And if you get rid of clinging, then you get rid of suffering. And this is a very important distinction. So then for Buddhists then, rather than transcendence, the goal in a sense is liberation or freedom or awakening within this world, not rejecting this world entirely. So we have to understand clinging and we have to understand impermanence. And this is a very important point because to understand the role in which clinging has for suffering, if we don't understand that, then we tend to attack, we tend to blame the object of clinging for suffering, or things that are changing all the time, we blame that for our suffering. So that leads itself to kind of inappropriate renunciation, inappropriate letting go or holding away or rejection. That's quite common in Buddhism when things are misunderstood in other religious traditions. So for example, money is painful. How many of you don't have some suffering around money? So if money is a problem, let's get to let go of our money. Possessions are a problem because let's let renounce all our possessions. Sex is a problem. So let's get rid of sex. You name it, let's get rid of it so we can live peacefully. And that's, I would argue, and this is just my opinion, that doing that has its use, it has its pragmatic place. But when it's being done, from misunderstanding the roots of suffering, the causes of suffering, then it's a kind of maladaptive attempt to try to find our liberation, our freedom. Rather what Buddhism says is you don't necessarily have to get rid of things. You have to look at the clinging part of the equation and to work with that, to understand that really well. And so in a sense, what Buddhist practice is about is taking the mirror of awareness and partly turning it back on yourself to understand what is your relationship, what is our relationship to the experiences of the world, to the changing experiences of the world. Do we have a relationship of open-handedness, of ease, of generosity, of warmth, of love? Or do we have a relationship of clinging, of holding, of rejecting, or denying, trying to make things different? And we do all those things because things are impermanent. We don't like what comes our way. What comes our way we want to hold on to. We don't want to let it go away when it's time for it to go away. To have some sense of ease in life, we have to have some sense of ease with transiency, that things arise and they pass. The beautiful story of Ajahn Chah, having his favorite cup. And someone said, how could an enlightened person have a favorite cup? You're supposed to be beyond preferences. And he said basically something like, no, not necessarily. I have my favorite cup and I enjoy it. But when I use it, I already see it as being broken. So he kind of expects it to break. It's part of what it is. In nature, it eventually breaks. And so he's aware of that as part of his perception of that cup, is that part of its nature is to break. So when it breaks, he's not surprised. But if you're holding on to your fine china at home, expecting it to stay the same for 40 years, you're asking for trouble. But if you kind of expect it eventually to break, you try your best not to break it. And then it comes as no surprise and there can be some degree of ease or equanimity about it. And this is kind of me try it, simplistic examples, you know, your china or something. But for me, it's personally, the perception of impermanence and change and whatever arises, it's something that I'm aware of in all my relationships with people. All relationships that we have are going to pass away in a sense. Someone's going to die sooner than the other or someone's going to leave or move or relationships change. And so the people that I'm closest with, I don't know what, you know, I don't want them to pass away or die or leave. But it's part of my, little bit part of my awareness that that is certainly a possibility. And it makes somehow the relationship more precious. I honor it more, I enjoy it more. But also it makes it slightly a little bit bittersweet. And it also is slightly realistic, you know, so things do change. I kind of, I can imagine the world without that person because that person is going to at some point not going to be here. In the midpoint of longer Vipassana retreats, those of you who haven't been in a retreat, what we do in retreat is we progressively develop or expand the instructions as the days go along. So for example, the first day the instructions is kind of like follows the same sequence as the five week introductory course that we have. The first day we do mindfulness of breathing, the second day we include the body, the third day maybe emotions and the fourth day thoughts. It can go on like that, the development of instructions. Sometimes in longer retreats, somewhere near the middle of the retreat, there's instruction given to begin paying attention or noticing the arising and passing of phenomena. Basically begin actively paying attention to impermanence and how things change. It's a kind of a natural thing to do. As mindfulness gets stronger by itself, it's a natural point in a person's practice that mindfulness becomes extremely evident. So evident that sometimes it's even frightening. People are sitting there quite peacefully and beautiful people just be sitting around in nice environment and nice food and good weather and nowhere to go for two more weeks. You're sitting there on retreat and nothing to worry about. Suddenly you notice that things are changing really fast. Boy are things are impermanent. They're just like arising and passing and arising and passing. You never realize that things rose and passed so quickly. It gets really frightening because mostly where we get our security from is from being able to grasp onto something and expecting to stay for a while. But if nothing stays for any length of time, what are you going to hold onto? What are you going to use as your reference for your personality, for your sense of self, for your whatever? And to see the rising and passing of things very fast is somewhat disorienting. And one of the things we start learning after a while is how to be at ease in the world of change. Now seeing change at this very quick level on retreats especially is partly because we drop down below the conceptual level of thinking. A lot of our thinking is understood to imply permanence. Maybe not, if someone asked you, do you expect this cup to be here forever? You'd say no, of course not. But somehow in the kind of unconscious assumptions of our mind there's a sense that this is lasting, this is going to be for a while. And concepts themselves, we use nouns, we use kind of, we say this is a thing rather than say this is a process that's passing through. And we relate to things as if things, you know, I'm gill and so being gill I have to be a certain way. And I don't appreciate the fact that gillness is a constant process of change that's developing all the time. So if I have a certain idea of who I'm supposed to be and I don't stay that particular way all the time, it can be a little bit disorienting. So we drop down below the conceptual level. Concepts can have the implication of permanence. Direct experience doesn't. So at certain point in meditation practice it becomes deeper than conceptual, the experience. And we see very quickly the impermanent nature. But even so in our normal life, as we start noticing the rising and passing of phenomena, one of the things that's most obvious is we note the body changes. You can watch that in the course of a day. Your energy level goes up and down, your alertness goes up and down, the heaviness, the lightness of the body, the health of the body changes over the weeks and the years. It goes up and down and rises and passes different things. One of the little exercises or little curiosity things I did on retreats was I would see if I could notice the first hint of being tired or being sleepy of the day. So I wasn't paying attention to this all the time, but I see when during the day when I first hinted, oh, now the sleepy cycle is starting to set in. Eventually I'm going to go to sleep in the evening. And somewhere around three or four o'clock in the afternoon there will be a first little hint, oh, this is arising now. And it will arise and we get stronger and stronger and go to sleep and it will pass, arise and pass. But to notice these changes of the body, more interesting of course is to notice the changes of moods and mental states. How they change from day to day, from hour to hour, from minute to minute. One of the exercises that I've had a little bit of fun with is paying attention to my mental mood or my emotions when I'm on the freeway. And it's like a kaleidoscope. It's subtle. I can have a general mood that I have. But I would pay attention to the subtle emotions that happen in relationship to what's happening around me in the traffic on the freeway. And it's like, wow, it changes every few seconds. Anger and upset and joy and lust and you name it. Fear. And you're riding along. It's quite fun to watch. It's also enlightening to watch because if you can watch and notice the changes, then you're less likely to get fixated on one of them. One of them is going to come along and off you go on that train for a while, that train of thought for a while. Sylvia Borstein gives a little exercise. I think it's her. She says, she invites or suggests to people to think about the darkest, most miserable day they ever had in their life. You remember what it was like and how terrible it felt and how blue you were or whatever. And then she asks, where is it now? Because I think part of the reason for the exercise is in the middle of those dark, difficult experiences, there's a kind of sense, maybe not logical sense, but kind of this is really permanent. This is forever. How am I ever going to get out of this or see beyond it or do anything? But all things change. They arise and they pass away based on conditions. Except for change. But change is not a thing. All things change. And that changes in our concept of change, I think. That changes. Just wait until you get senile. One of the interesting things is we encourage, mindfulness practice is encouraging ourselves to be more in the present moment. Because we find out how little we are in the present moment or in the future, in the past or whatever. And then there's a phenomena that we can be in the present moment, but then we're kind of really tight and closed and preoccupied and judgmental about what's going on in the present moment. It isn't enough just to be in the present moment because you can have a lot of suffering in the present moment. You want to be present enough in the present moment to have enough spaciousness to begin appreciating that this is impermanent. This is arising and passing. If you don't, if you're kind of riding kind of really tight and close on top of the moment to moment, what's really going on in the present moment, it can be very miserable. There's this Sufi story of this guy who came to Sufi teacher, I guess, and asked him to engrave on his ring some piece of great deep spiritual advice they can kind of reflect on and look at whenever he needed it or whatever. And so the teacher wrote on his ring, this too will pass. This too will pass. How are we doing? Can I continue a little bit longer? Yeah. I'm kind of how it's working for you here today. I'm just kind of rambling. It feels like even though I have notes. Two more games to go. Two more games to go. Not tonight. So with meditation, whereas the mindfulness practice deepens, we start noticing the more subtle level of change which is going on all the time that kind of below the conceptual level. And this is a very interesting because meditation teachers that they're more interested that their students start noticing the rising and passing of phenomena. Whereas what students are interested in often is are they getting calmer, are they getting more joyful and more peaceful, more happy or people often have these criteria, which is a thing. And as long as you have a thing which is a criteria for success, guess what? All things rise and they pass. So there's a lot of meditators who suffer unnecessarily by expecting certain states of meditation or states of being to last. You know, it's wonderful, wonderful bliss and rapture that might arise. I got it now. Oops, there it went. But rather to begin appreciating the rising and passing is really much more to the heart of, you know, that's if you want to go for the meditation practice, that's much more of a central goal than any state that you can attain. And I find it a little bit interesting that the experience of impermanence is quite evident to many people when they start meditating in the form of the monkey mind. They can close their eyes, pay attention, and the mind is just, wow, is it wild? Jumping all over the place and not staying put for one minute. However, that kind of monkey mind and the world view, how we see the world and see ourselves through the monkey mind is a world we're just constantly trying to grasp onto things. And that's probably why the monkey is used as the analogy, constantly grabbing. And as we're constantly grabbing, we're grabbing because we think that things can last for a while to provide us some kind of lasting well-being or security or whatever. As the mind settles down, as the awareness can become more constant in the sense and see more clearly, then this deeper world of inconstancy, of impermanence becomes stronger and stronger. The mind that's scattered grasps at permanence. The mind that becomes calmer sees permanence most clearly and then realizes that there's nothing to stand on. There's nothing that grasping can stand on. And you try to grasp and there's really nothing really there to really try grasping onto. And you either, through grace or through being forced into it, you let go, you relax. And the less you see that you can actually grasp onto things, the less our tendency is to grasp so tightly or grasp at all, and the less we grasp, the more peaceful we'll become. And it's a kind of peace which doesn't require us to get rid of anything, in a sense. We don't have to get rid of our homes and our relationships and our money, not necessarily. But we can be with it without having to cling to it. This morning when I was sitting meditating, actually when I got up for my meditation, I turned to my wife and said, It's rather frightening to think what my mind would be like now if I hadn't spent all these years meditating. Because I can see as I meditated, I can see that I had these tendencies to grasp and to hold on. And I can see it sometimes, it's not so easy to know how to let go. It's really strong sometimes, the flow of grasping and holding. And as I sit and meditate and become calmer and more settled, and I start seeing more clearly what's going on moment by moment, then both through this clear seeing and through the calmness and the peace, there's a kind of letting go that happens. And so I have this, every day I sit and every day I let go, and so the kind of holdings and the fossilizations, the frozen parts of the mind, the preoccupations, the fixations, the preoccupations that I get stuck on, get loosened up, get lubricated. Now I can see this working just in the matter of one day, and the next day it comes along and I sit and it relaxes a little bit. If I had, you know, I think that having meditated now for 20 years, it's had a big impact on me. These movements of clinging and holding had continued for 20 years, uninterruptedly. I think I'd be a pretty rigid guy by now. So I'm very grateful for my sitting practice, because it really allows the flow of impermanence, the flow freely through me. And my suffering has to do with fixation, and fixation has to do with permanence, not allowing for impermanence, wanting things to be a certain way. So maybe that's enough for tonight. So this is one of the reasons why in mindfulness practice we emphasize paying attention to the quality of our relationship to our experience. Because it isn't the experience which is really so important for our suffering, it's the quality of how we relate to it. And as we relate to it more freely, then we learn to feel at ease. We can begin surfing in the world of change. Yes, Ali. Well then, there's, when I've done death and dying kind of retreats workshops, I do this exercise where people imagine what's, you know, if they have 12 hours to live, what they would do with those 12 hours. And then if you had four hours to live, if you have one hour to live, what would you do with that one hour? And it can be very interesting because people really, when you get that little time left, you really, your priorities get straightened up pretty quickly. But there was one woman who said, if I had 12 hours to live, I would run home and clean my apartment. And then she said, but there was only one hour left. She said, well then I realized there wasn't enough time to get home. And then I relaxed and it seemed really peaceful. The world seemed really peaceful. Anyway, cleaning house is a great lesson in permanence. Yes. I, three weeks ago, I found out very inadvertently and suddenly that a friend of mine had died quite a time before. And I had a really hard time with her. Nobody had informed me. It's not all the world in detail, but at first I couldn't even talk about it. And now I can accept it. She's a person that I had tried to be in touch with and I never got her. Of course she wasn't living any longer. Finally I got a real person on her phone and I asked for her. And she said, I don't know how to tell you this, but she died very suddenly five months ago. And I was just totally haunted by her for several days and gradually became just part of my being. And she was gone. And arising and passing away. It's quite sobering, the world of impermanence. It's quite sobering to live in this world of impermanence, to see it for what it is and to experience it and feel what it's like to live in a world of impermanence. To see things as they are. So it is painful. And it's painful. There's a different kind of pain that comes when we learn a long time afterwards. Thank you. I also need grandson. Bessia? I remember my question, teaching impermanence to children. I wonder what the impact is. I don't know if we have a lot of programs in our community. I think that children need a sense of permanence to develop a healthy way. But we want them to learn to accept reality. I'm no expert on children or grazing children, but I've been impressed by a few things. One is, I've heard of school teachers have taken kids out into the forest, into the woods, and asked them to bring back different things that have died. And in the forest you see lots of dead things. And they teach them the depressions of death. The dying and the composting allows for new life to come into being. So there's a kind of appreciation of change, of impermanence that goes on there. But the kind of permanence that's very important for children, I would think, is a permanence of certain kind of key relationships. And if you don't have that, it can be much more difficult. When I grew up, for example, I had fairly good relationships with my parents. And that was pretty constant throughout my life, growing up. But everything else was pretty impermanent about my life. I grew up, moved a lot, lived in different places, lived in Europe in many different places. And it was a very rich and wonderful life of impermanence for me. And I think it really helped me to be more flexible, to be more understanding of different cultures and everything, to see that things aren't the same, that things arise and they pass. So I was able to appreciate impermanence, perhaps, around me because of this primary relationship stayed constant. So that sense of pure ability to be able to adapt to all of this. So this is a very good... So one of the things I imagine is very important for all of us, not as children, is learning that we can adapt, learning we can work with, learning we can find our way to be at peace with impermanence and to give the tools. So I think part of what mindfulness practice is about is learning the tools of working with impermanence. And I think that can be taught to anyone. Yes? It seems to me that much, if not most of what we laugh at, has to do with impermanence and the folly of clinging. And some of the world's great wisdom traditions and great uses of music is made of humor, as in Sufism, Daoism, and Zen. And I'm wondering if Buddha ever said anything humorous. I don't know how to say that. But they ever used that as a tool. I believe he did. But it's a little bit hard to read, especially some of it is... You have to understand the environment he was teaching in. And some of it is kind of subtle. It wasn't uproarious humor. But you look at some of the things that he said, some of the stories he told. And I think they were probably humorous. They're kind of tongue-in-cheek sometimes, is my best guess. Yes? I grew up the way you did. And I think as long as there's consciousness, in other words, no matter where you are, you can see moon and sun and there's an ocean. I'm in my relationship with change and with impermanence. And I kept on kind of thinking about death and that type of change. And at some point I came to realize that it wasn't for change, there would be no healing. The impermanence of my holding, the permanence of the wounds that I carry about life. And so there's a very... Sometimes we judge change and impermanence as being something we have to accept that's not good, but it's beautiful. If it wasn't for impermanence, there would be no healing. So the Buddha said that a little bit differently. He said without impermanence there would be no spiritual path. No spiritual path. Last one. About impermanence and the relationship between people. What is it that allows you to... Or how is it you can enter into an ongoing loving relationship with someone knowing that it's impermanent, that there may be some that will come to an end? And with that they come sadness and there's pain and there may be suffering. So if there's an impermanence, then one would avoid that. But then what allows you to enter into it in a way that's loving and ongoing? Your honor. So I would think that... I would hope that the relationship is healthier. It's more healthy to enter into a committed relationship, a loving relationship if you realize that things are changing and impermanent. That the person you're involved in is changing as you talk with them, as you live with them. And they're going to pass away or you're going to pass away. That if you don't do that and live in the world of denial, I think that's going to lend itself to unrealistic relationship. So the question, how do you enter a relationship given impermanence? Well, we don't have any choice. But how to do it in a way that doesn't cause suffering? I think one way is denial and one way is to really see impermanence very clearly. And for myself, the relationships that are close to me, that's part of what goes on for me. I understand this is impermanent relationship. I don't know how quickly it'll pass, but it's part of it. And I know that built into this relationship is suffering, is some kind of pain. Because if someone dies, even a Buddha feels pain when someone dies, I believe. There might not be a lot of the complicated forms of grief, the things that complicate the grieving process, but kind of a feeling of loss is there. And that's inevitable. So either I'm going to die or my wife's going to die first, probably. So built into being married, there's pain there. And I feel if I don't take that into account, I don't think it's a really realistic relationship. I'm asking for trouble. I'm asking for the unexpected. I'm asking for surprises. But if I know things will change, if I know my wife, for example, not only will one of us will pass away first, but she's going to change as a person in the years that I know her. I'm going to change as a person. And I have to be willing to allow for change and to be ready for it and have the tools to work with the change and work on a relationship and things like that. So I don't have an easy answer, but we don't have any choice but to find a way to make it work. One of the options that some people take because of the suffering of relationships is that they don't enter relationships. But I believe that that's... Well, I don't want to completely avoid all human relationships or all close human relationships because it's painful to be in relationships, because there's pain built into it. I think it's a worse pain. It's a worse form of suffering. So I think we should stop. It's quite late. Is that okay? So thank you all. Maybe I'll see you next week.
