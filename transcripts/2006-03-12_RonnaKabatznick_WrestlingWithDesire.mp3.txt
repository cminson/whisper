 This morning I'd like to talk about one of my favorite topics, and the title, what I'd like to give the talk today, is called Wrestling with Desire. When the Buddha began teaching, his very first sermon in Sarnath was on the Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Truths are basically a prescription about life, about what the problem is, which is suffering, which is where we all suffer. That could be just the inevitable fact that we're all going to die and we're all going to lose the people we love. It could be just having an irritating hangnail. It could be just having something in the restaurant that you want to order that's not there. It could be a larger disappointment, an illness, a chronic illness. We're talking about the entire range of things in life, from the great tragedies to the minor irritations. He talked about what's the cause. He said that the cause is craving, you know, craving what we like and hating what we don't or trying to push it away. Really not seeing clearly that obtaining more pleasure and avoiding pain is really going to bring us happiness. He said that was really a delusion or a misconception of the truth. He said there was a way of letting go of craving and then ultimately a path, which is like the prescription. We have the statement of the problem, we have the cause, and we have what's going to cure it, and then the path, the prescription of the Eightfold Path. But where do we get stuck? Where do we get stuck in trying to create happiness? Basically, the Buddha said we get caught in the second noble truth. We all suffered. We all know that. So the diagnosis is pretty clear. We all have our secrets and sorrows. We've all lost people. We've all had great disappointments or grand ones. We've all experienced the illness either of ourselves or our loved ones. We've all experienced unexpected things. We wake up in the morning and think it's going to be a great day and bang, you get a phone call or something happens and your whole life gets turned upside down. So what is it that really causes us pain and sorrow, grief, lamentation, despair is what the Buddha talked about. He talked about our craving, wanting what we want and not wanting what we don't and not seeing that this is actually a delusion, as I said earlier. So what we engage in unconsciously or unconsciously is what I call this wrestle with desire. As much as we want to believe that pleasure is going to bring us happiness, we spend so much of our time trying to accumulate it. Just get the right position in our sitting, from scratching an itch, from getting a new house, a new relationship, blah blah blah, the endless variety of things. To a certain extent or to a large extent, pleasure is terrific, you get it, there's definitely that hit. There's a reason why we get caught in the illusion or the delusion that pleasure is going to bring us happiness because there is a moment when it does and how long it lasts, who knows. But there is that hit which basically the whole advertising industry bases itself on. And there is that relief when you scratch an itch or when you have hunger and you get it satisfied or when you get the job or the relationship or whatever, the cure from the illness. So we don't want to diminish that hit because that's the hook. Nor do we want to diminish that when we are rid of what we don't like, we're out of the relationship or we're out of the job that we hate or the town that we're living in or any number of things that we don't like. It's good, we feel better. But the Buddha asked us to consider how long do these pleasures of getting what we want or being relieved of what we don't, how long do they last. And the truth is, things are impermanent and they don't last so whatever pleasure we get is destined to evaporate. And so we spend our life in what I call a misguided wrestle, a misguided wrestle of trying to then replace what the other pleasure was that is now has evaporated or vanished with a new one. Or we replace trying, we've been irritated by something and that's over and so we find a new irritation and then we spend our time involved in another misguided wrestle of trying to release that and trying to gain more pleasure. And I'm not trying to be critical of us in this struggle, the Buddha said this is the struggle and it's partially our wrestle and struggle because as I said it does work to a certain extent. It does work to be relieved of anxiety or depression in the moment. There's definitely relief when you learn something new on the computer that's been frustrating you for a long time. You think, ah, this is it now my work life is going to, or my writing life, that's going to be it. And as soon as the ants get out of my house or my neighbor who's a pain in the neck, drums at three o'clock in the morning, moves, that's going to be great. And so we're, through our misguided means, we continue in this struggle. And we all have our personal histories and stories with it. And the Buddha wasn't trying to criticize us for this, he was just trying to awaken us to the fact that basically no matter what we do with our pleasure and craving system, you know, we are basically still going to experience suffering because of the truth of impermanence, is that it's whatever pleasures or just pleasures we feel are going to vanish. So being the great physician, the Buddha taught us what can we do to basically uproot this system of craving that we've gotten ourselves into? What can we do to end this grasping at what's pleasurable and kind of kicking away what's not? And he has a pretty straightforward prescription of what we need to do. And, you know, on the eightfold path he talks about Syla Samadhi Panya, Syla being virtue, Samadhi being meditation, and Panya being the wisdom factors. And I love talking about Syla Samadhi and Panya because he really sets the stage of how we win the wrestle of desire versus how we perpetuate the wrestle in our lives. And it's interesting, in America, in our form of Buddhism, we've kind of deemed mindfulness, you know, the ability, the natural ability to be with our experience as it is without judgment and without reactivity as kind of like the number one antidote to desire, craving, I should say. And to a large extent it is because when we're with our desires, when we're with that kind of ache in our chest, you know, for wanting something, you know, the new computer or the new program or the new piece of clothing or, you know, sex or whatever, you know, you can feel the constriction in your chest and then you can feel the release when you get it. And so being mindful of that, you know, is very helpful because it means you're not lost in the craving and there's no question. You know, the Buddha actually said, mindfulness is the medicine that cures the disease of desire. My training in Asia was, you know, was exactly that. But the other training that I really got was looking at the paramees, the factors, the systems of, you know, again, mental development, the great perfections, as they're called in Pali, of purifying our minds and our hearts and how you become a Buddha or how you become an artist. And I think the reason for that is because I think it's really important to know that, you know, you're a paramee, you know, somebody completely free from the defilements of great hatred and delusion is that you perfect these paramees and that once the cup is full or the oceans of these paramees are full, you become an enlightened being. And to the extent that there's an unlimited ability to perfect the paramees, you either become an arahant or a Buddha. And the first paramee, you know, before mindfulness, as I said, in America, mindfulness gets, you know, the front seat of everything, you know, and we think we think of Buddhism as synonymous with mindfulness. In Asia, the emphasis is slightly different, not that mindfulness is discredited or discriminated against, but the very, very basis of the path in the Four Noble Truth and with the great perfections is the practice of sila, which is the practice of virtue. And I, every day in the monastery, every single day, the lay people who come asked to take the precepts, they're not offered, they have to be asked. They have to be requested, I mean, and I love that, you know, it's not that the virtues of not killing, not stealing, not gossiping, lying, exaggerating, etc. Not, what am I blanking on? Taxications that cloud the mind and sexual misconduct. So these are, you know, the Buddhists said these are the basis. You can't, you know, it's hard to be mindful if your mind is cloudy with killing, stealing, gossiping, lying, exaggeration, intoxication, or, you know, messing around in relationships that, you know, basically, you know, don't have virtue in them. And for some reason, as I've talked to many Dharma teachers and professionals who teach mindfulness, there's a real reluctance to talk about virtue. It's like somehow it's going to be seen as moralizing. And that wasn't my training at all. It wasn't seen as moralizing. It was seen as this is going to bring the seeds of happiness when we plant the seeds of virtue. And when we plant the seeds of non-virtuous behavior, then this is going to bring the seeds of deep unhappiness and misery, not just to ourselves, but to our friends and family and community and the world. And you can see this, you know, when, you know, wars are justified, you know, through morality, you know, and killing is justified, you know, by good and evil, you know, they're the bad guys, we're the good. You know, this kind of delusional thinking brings a lot of misery, okay, and killing is justified, okay, and torture is justified. Hurting people is justified. Stealing, you know, taking what's not given is justified. And it can go on and on. And in the monastery, you know, the monks and nuns, you know, teaching lay people, you know, on the long-term basis I was there, you know, said you have to, you know, mindfulness is implicit in virtue. You have to bring mindfulness to ask, what am I doing now? You know, and even leering, you know, leering at somebody, you know, or coveting what they have in their bowl or in their kuti. You know, these are all forms of virtuous behavior that you have to be mindful of in order to wake up. And as I said, every day, the precepts are renewed in the monastery by some layperson requesting them and then the monks offering them. And I've heard many Dharma teachers say, you know, people are going to run out of the hall and you're moralizing. And what I say to everybody is, you know, I'm a teacher, not a preacher, and I'm just explaining what the Buddha taught. And you all know from your own experience, you know, when you lie or exaggerate or gossip or smack the ants or, you know, when you're coveting somebody else's husband or wife or whatever or getting drunk or even a glass of wine. Your mind gets cloudy and you suffer because if you lie, then you worry about being caught, right? You really, you know, that you're going to be caught in the lie if you, you know, if you, you engage intentionally in killing something, you know, usually there's some kind of remorse. You know, and it goes on and on. If you get, if you drink even, you know, one drink, you can say something that you didn't mean because your, your mind was clouded or you can get in an accident or, you know, a number of things. And, you know, the Buddha wasn't fooling around. I mean, obviously he was, he was the awakened mind. He talked, you know, from an enlightened point of view. And he set Sila, you know, as the basis of the path. And in Thailand, you're really not allowed to talk about people's outer beauty. You know, you don't say like a monk is good looking or a nun is pretty. You don't, you know, that's, that's considered very rude, you know, and just people don't do it. But they talk about their inner beauty, you know, and where does inner beauty come from? It really comes from having an established practice of Sila. You know, the restraint that comes from just not being, you know, lacking in mindfulness when you are engaging in any kind of behavior, you know, that's how restraint becomes beauty. And in the monastery, it's like the monks and nuns have these wings and these invisible wings because they, they feel, they begin to feel like, you know, the wings of Sila and Samadhi, you know, and their mindfulness, being able to kind of envelop the monastery because there's such a safety there, you know, knowing that you are protected. And the, the, in Thailand, the, the, the word for taking the precepts is raksa sin ha. Sin ha is the five precepts. And raksa is you're taking protection. Isn't that beautiful? So you're taking protection in the precepts because there's an expression that says those who protect the precepts protect them, protect themselves. So it's a, you know, if you protect the precepts, then you're going to be protected by the precepts. And in the monastery where everything is so impeccable, and you really, really feel it, and you really feel it if you don't protect them, you know, your eye, you're, you're kind of, you know, your skin gets all flush and you get really embarrassed and you're like running around to see who you can confess to because that's one of the, one of the things in the monastery. So, you know, as a psychologist, I work with so many people who are miserably unhappy, you know, just miserable from depression and anxiety and, you know, uncontrollable misery, really. And when I, when I encourage them to use the lens of mindfulness and really look at, you know, their, their behavior, it's not because I'm trying to be a goody two-shoes. It's just because I'm taking the Buddha's instructions on what's going to plant the seed of happiness versus the seed of misery. You know, I'm just, I'm being an arm of what the Buddha taught. It's not my idea, you know, but when I do, I know when I practice sela and I use it as my protection, I'm a lot happier. So when I work with people who are seriously miserable and have that disease of misery kind of, you know, pulsing in their bodies and their minds and their hearts, you know, that's my responsibility is to talk about that. And, you know, everybody has to have their own guide. But when we talk about wrestling with desire, you know, what's the antidote to the, to the unskillful wrestle of trying to always be grasping what we love and hating what we don't is if that's going to work and it doesn't. And we keep learning the hard way. The antidote to that wrestle was having the wrestle with becoming more beautiful in our virtue, you know. And, and I've seen, and, you know, why do, why do you trust teachers? You know, because you feel safe around them that they're not going to gossip about you. They're not going to do things that are going to hurt you. They're not going to come on to you. You know, and the tremendous misery in Buddhist communities by, you know, the sexual misconduct, you know, reverberates through generations. So, you know, the beauty of a teacher that you know is trustworthy. It's so, you know, the beauty that comes from that and most of our eyes, I would say without hearing from every one of you, is far more beautiful than someone's physical beauty. So the other foundation of the wrestle in the, in the parame system, in the, in the great perfection system before mindfulness is Dhanā, generosity. And the Buddha said, you know, generosity is a form of letting go. That's what you have to do. If you want to give my walk, give this water or give the clock or whatever, and it's mine, you have to let go of it. And the Buddha said that generosity and Dhanā, the whole center here is Rvanandana, no fees, no you've got to pay this, and here's your, you know, bill and your receipt. That giving things away, you know, physically, mentally, materially, you know, emotionally giving things away, you know, is a form of happiness. And it's an antidote, it's another form of wrestle, and it's not easy. You know, if you have something you really love, the Buddha didn't say you have to give it away, and you know, that's maybe unskillful if you think, oh, I love this new sweater and I've got to give it away. That's not the idea. But the idea is we all know people who are like emotionally cheap, you know, they're just, they're very constricted. They don't want to say anything that's kind of generous and good, you know, and we all have such heartaches our parents didn't mirror us, or you see, you know, in my practice, you know, with, especially with children and anxiety, you know, the, you know, I see that the parents, the kids get very anxious because the parents are busy, you know, being emotionally critical, but not emotionally generous in a lot of ways. And so the child becomes that way, and there's like an anxiety that builds. So what is it, you know, the question is, and I don't know the answers for each of you, what is it like to be emotionally generous? And what is it like to be physically generous, being there when someone's in grief for mourning or ill, or going out of your way to pick somebody up? And I know at the center, and I, you know, because Gil's my teacher as well, and has been for so long, you know, I'm so really so pleased that he's created this very intimate Sangha because, you know, there's, there's, there's, there's helpers in the center. If you need someone to take you to the doctor, if you need a meal when you're sick, you know, that the people volunteer their time to help other people. And this is a beautiful form of Donna. You know, it's not writing a check, which is also why we're here, many people wrote checks. But just being able to be there for people and how much it's hurt us, you know, when people haven't been there for us, you know, when we're lonely in our, our grief or depression or illness. And, you know, we wish somebody would just pick up the phone and call or come over with a bag or grocery, you know, that's a beautiful form of Donna. And so we have, you know, Donna and Cela. And, and, and in the third parame, the third perfection is patience. This is all before mindfulness. This is all before mindfulness. And again, you know, that's one of the shocking things when I came back. And I certainly was trained in this country for a long time. But the balance of training in Thailand was so different because, you know, mindful, mindful, mindful, mindful. And in Thailand, it was really, you know, Cela, Donna. And then the third really is patience, aton, kanti, those are the two words. And a lot of times it would be like a billion degrees, slightly exaggerating, a billion felt like it. Bugs, you know, boredom, hunger, whatever you're going through, you eat only one meal a day at 830 in the morning. For me, tremendous language stress. I had to learn Thai. There's a lot of my friends joke tonight, speak Thai with a New York Jewish accent. Thai has five tones. And you can know the vocabulary, which I do, I have an enormous vocabulary. But if you don't get the tone right, you know, people just stare at you. And it was just so frustrating because, you know, who knows what I was asking people or telling people. You know, being the first monastery, being the only woman, the second monastery, being the only, you know, westerner. Endless frustrations and difficulties and wishing it was cooler, wishing it was this, wishing I didn't have to give it three in the morning, wishing there was this, that. And my teachers would say to me, autton or kanti, patience, just patient endurance, you know, knowing it's going to change. And that was so helpful. I'd be, you know, I'd be like lugging myself around the monastery and I hear, you know, kun rana, kanti, kanti, you know, it's a reminder of just, you know, the wrestle of just kind of like saying, yeah, this is going to change at some time. And using that reminder of patience, it's going to change. And so are good things. You know, you're fine, you're eating a wonderful meal, you're fine, a westerner shows up and oh, you're so happy to have a conversation. It's going to end, you know. So, you know, patience with just wishing it wasn't going to end. You know, there's endless applications of patience. And that's something it's very hard to learn in our culture. It's very hard to learn because our training, you know, our conditioning is so impatient. You know, we want it, we want it now. I'm driving, I want to get here sooner, you know, it's like there's always this kind of leaning forward, you know, towards what we want and leaning backwards of what we don't want and the belief that we're going to get it right. And, you know, living in Asia, kind of like there is this understanding that we can't get it right. You know, we just, we can't get it right unless we're enlightened, then we get it right. You know, then it's, then we're not stuck in the delusion that getting it right is really, you know, anything special. Because the enlightened person, the difference between the enlightened person and his us is that they're, you know, they've wrestled their desires, their cravings, and they just live in the river of impermanence. And the Buddha said the highest form of happiness is peace of mind. It's not acquiring or it's not being in the constant state of bliss. It's really peace of mind. And so, you know, these are some of the ingredients of the skillful wrestle. It's not just being mindful because in mind, in mindfulness is what the, what the Buddha said, don't get me wrong, it's the medicine that cures the disease of desire, disease of craving. And so we have to be mindful in order to have patience, and we have to be mindful in order to have virtue, we have to be mindful in order to give freely, you know, give dhana. And in mindfulness itself, the exact experience of it is if you're mindful of craving, you're not craving, because you can't be craving and mindful of it at once. It's their mutually exclusive. And there's just a story I love because, you know, when we're craving our lens, our lens just, you know, it just squeezes, you know, all we want is what we want, you know, or not want. And it's kind of, you know, you realize how shameless the mind is. And it's so wonderful when we bring mindfulness to it because it opens that lens. But speaking of lenses, I don't have my glasses, which on the fact, I feel a thousand years old here, so. Let me see if I have a pair. I have this theory that the more glasses you have, the more you lose. So every time I go to Cresco, I buy, they come in packs of three, and I now have 12 pair, and I never seem to have them. Anyway, here's an example of somebody not wrestling with desire here, or wrestling in an unskillful way. Excuse me for not. I did thought I'd memorize this, but I'm... So Nazrudin is a legendary character in Turkish folklore. He is often used to illustrate the antics of the human mind because he can be clever, silly, and mystical all at once. Nazrudin and a friend once went to a restaurant and decided to share a plate of eggplant. They argued fiercely as to whether the eggplant should be stuffed or fried. Each was attached to his desire about the best way to prepare and enjoy the eggplant. Tired and hungry, Nazrudin yielded to his friend's wish to order it stuffed. His companion suddenly collapsed off his chair and onto the floor. Nazrudin jumped out of his seat. Are you going for a doctor as someone at the next table? No, you fool, shouted Nazrudin. I'm going to see whether it's too late to change the order. So there's somebody lost in an unskillful wrestle with desire because the lens is closed and squeezed to the extent that all he wants is to get it. And so I don't know what the skillful response for each of us would be to engage in what Ciela, Samadhi, Panya, whatever, or patients or Donna would be for each of us. But we know that the wrestle might be okay. That's the impulse to change the order. So the mindfulness comes there. That's the impulse of Nazrudin could be the skillful wrestle of even though I want to change the order. Mindfulness sees it, but what's the next skillful action? That's where Ciela comes in or graciousness and generosity comes in. Those are some of the skills that help the wrestle. Because it's not that you have to be excited about wrestling with desire and saying, but if you want to be happy, the Buddha said, or if you want to be beautiful of inner beauty, if you want to really uproot the cause of misery, if you really want to uproot it and completely abandon it, then this is the path we take. And it's not that some days you just don't want to engage in juicy gossip. It's not like you have a halo around your head. But you exercise restraint because this is an unbeautiful behavior. And the seed planted from unbeautiful behavior are unbeautiful outcomes. People don't trust you as much. And often times people ask me about having one drink. What's wrong with that? The Buddha didn't talk about just having one drink. He talked about the restraint from anything intoxicating that would cloud the mind. And this is not sexy in our American culture where we think, just having a drink, what's that? I'm not an alcoholic, I'm not a drunk. And I don't know the answer for each of you. I really don't. I just know for me, if I had a drink now, I would be completely out of it. I'd be so woozy because I don't drink. So I think if you drink and you have a drink, then you have the feeling that it's not affecting you. But if you don't drink at all. I once had somebody ordered me a, what's this done? A Pellegrino with bitters. I don't even know what bitters are. But I said, okay, bitters doesn't sound like whiskey, doesn't sound like wine. But it has like a tiny, tiny percent of alcohol in it and I drank it. I was like, whoa. I said, does this have alcohol? And the guy says, yeah, like zero, zero, zero, 0.1. And I said, you know, it really is amazing when you're meditating and you're not making your drink. Just even like, cough medicine could make you kind of woozy, which is why it's so popular in prison. And I'm not trying to say, aren't I great? I don't have a drink of wine. I'm just trying to help you reflect on, you know, what are the possible seeds of unbeautiful behavior and unskillful behavior and encourage you to wrestle with it. And as I said, I'm not a, I'm a teacher, not a preacher. I'm not saying that, you know, your one glass of wine is ruining your path of purification at all. I don't know. I'm not a Buddha, you know, I'm not an Arahant. I have no idea. But I'm just, all these things are always open for consideration and reflection. And I'm just a purveyor of what the Buddha said, having, you know, have my own set of defilements, have my own issues I'm wrestling with. And sometimes, you know, we need, you know, we don't just need wings to wrestle. We don't just need wings, but we really need muscle. You know, we really have to make a conscious effort, you know, to give or to avoid stealing, you know, and metaphorical stealing. Not that you're going to go to Walgreens and, you know, and nip a toothbrush or something. But in the sense of, you know, you know, envying somebody is a form of stealing, you know, wanting something, you know, from that person is a form of stealing. So you can, you know, think about your own metaphors to all these things. Sometimes you really have to work hard to apply the antidote, you know, to another kind of wrestle. And somehow, again, that's not very popular in our American system. It's supposed to be easy. And, you know, in my teachers, nobody said it was easy. Nobody, you know, that, you know, sitting at the feet of a great being, you know, it takes lifetimes to purify the mind and heart and to swim against the tide of defilements, you know. So we have to learn the antidote. You know, antidote wrestles. And some of it's gentle. Some of it's quite, you know, some of it really does require a muscle. We just don't want to do something. You know, we give in to the pleasure. And we give in to it many, many times. But hopefully with applied and reapplied mindfulness, you know, to eating, to depression, to sexuality, to whatever the, you know, the painful thing that's causing that compulsion that non-srudin, you know, really, you know, hits on the, you know, hits on the head. You know, get out of my way. I just want this. You know, those of us who've been in universities, you know, around people, you know, trying to get promoted. It's just, you know, the kind of shamelessness, not just, you know, wanting something, but, you know, what we'll do to get what we want. It's quite humbling. And we've all been there, you know. We've all been in those rudin's shoes. It's not like we're just talking about some ancient mystic. When that lens of craving narrows, and that's all we can see. And there's that famous expression, when a pickpocket sees a saint, all he sees is his pockets, the saint's pockets. So we've all been there. So I just want to say that, you know, there's unskillful wrestles, and there's skillful wrestles. And I just really want to encourage you to think about, in the Bharmi system, in the systems of great perfection, you're the first to seal it. The second to seal it, the third is patience, and the fourth is mindfulness. Okay, and it keeps going on up to great effort and concentration. I mean, there's others faith. There's others, but in talking about making the baby steps, you know, these aren't just words. They're, you know, they're the wisdom of the Buddha telling us what's going to unlock us from craving and really bring the highest form of happiness, which is peace of mind. So I leave you with these considerations. Thank you. Are there any questions? Yes, your name? My name is John. What is the difference between bliss and having peace of mind? That's a good question. Not having total peace of mind, I'll just take a stab at it. Peace of mind is the state of mind where no matter what's arising or passing away, you're content, that you're not in the position of moving forward or away. Okay, there's contentment with whatever the sea of experience as it goes by is just experienced as it is. With bliss, you can say it's a very high form of pleasure, where the tendency is to crave more and more of it, because it's so pleasant. And the undiluted person doesn't see pleasant as pleasant. They do see the unpleasantness that comes with bliss because it's going to end. So that's how the undiluted mind sees. There's going to be pleasure in pain because the pain is going to end because of impermanence. So that's the end of the delusion when you really, really know that bliss is going to turn into pain and pain is going to turn into bliss. So you're not moving forward or backwards from any of those states. You're content with whatever it is because there's no movement. It's the movement, the craving and the lack of seeing clearly that causes the suffering. I'm Frank. I have a question about the first precept in not killing. I think it's really hard. There's so many issues around it. Leather, clothes, being vegetarian or not, ants in the house, fleas, mosquitoes, that kind of thing. I just wondered how they practice it in Thailand and then how you bring that back here. What do you do about ants is a good question. When I was in Thailand every day I swept my kuti, my meditation hut, which was loaded with ants, out the door happily because there's certain actions that you take knowing that I wasn't going intentionally stomping them out. But in terms of the cleanliness routine in my kuti or the kitchen or the sidewalks, we're talking about the intention of deliberately smashing down ascension beings. It's very beautiful in Thailand. If you're in the meditation hall and there's an ant crawling, somebody might just put a piece of paper under it and walk it out of the hall. There's some very beautiful actions of being extremely exacting in the precept of not killing. I am a vegetarian. I do have kosher chicken every once in a while. These are all personal questions that I can't answer about leather and things like that. I will tell you this wonderful story. It's a famous story about Ajahn Chah, talking about skillful reflection because there's really no right answer. A monk cannot eat something that's been deliberately killed for him. But if the chicken's just been killed and somebody serves it, the monk can eat it. But if there's an intention to kill it for the monk, he can't eat it. So again, there's discriminating wisdom here. If rats or insects invest in your house, there's discriminating wisdom. Can you live without disease? Or if you're going to get disease, you've got to exterminate. I mean, these are all discriminating questions. But there's a wonderful story. I heard it from Ajahn Sumedho when I was interviewing him for the Inquiring Mind. He talked about Wat Nompapong, which is Ajahn Chah's first forest monastery in Thailand. That's the original. That's the home monastery. Now there's like 300 branches of Ajahn Chah's monastery, including a bayagiri in Northern California. At that time, there's only one, and that was Ajahn Chah's monastery. It was completely infected by these huge ants one rainy season. And I've spent a rainy season in Thailand, and there's tons and tons and tons and tons of bugs, which is why the Buddha said you have to stay put during the rainy season in one monastery, because you limit the amount of creatures that you kill. And they're just like multiplying before your eyes as a bit of a nightmare, unless you're used to it, which I never did get used to. Anyway, Ajahn Sumedho said that Wat Nompapong was just filled with these ants. They would fall off the ceiling when you were eating, and they'd get into your mats on the floor and all over the bathroom. He said it was just unbelievable. They were just floating practically in the air and going down your robe, and very difficult to live with. Ajahn Chah called in the Thai army to exterminate. And Ajahn Sumedho went up and said, wait a minute, Ajahn, Ajahn, respected teacher, or what about Pana, Thiba, Waya, Rakhman, Asi, Kapadam, Samadhi. I mean, I undertake the training precept, you know, not to take any life. And he said, okay, then the Thai army will skip your kuti. So he was very humbled, and of course the Thai army did get his kuti, and, you know, this was a skillful means. So in other words, none of these things are rock solid. They come from discriminating wisdom, and nobody could really tell you. That's why when you're with a really good Dharma master, you know, they try to give you the conditions of what's going to create happiness, but you're really not, you know, told, this is what's going to do it for your particular situation. Because, you know, how would the Dharma master know? You know, he or she may not know your entire situation. So, you know, these are the guidelines that we live by. But I love that story about Ajahn Chah, because he was probably the greatest meditation master in the 20th century, and he called in the Thai army to exterminate his wife. You know, so does that answer your question? I think the key is not to you, you know, to really be mindful of our justifications for what we do, you know, things like that. Yeah, I have a quick comment. I went talking to a Tibetan Lama, and I asked him a similar question. I said, you know, I worry about this first precept, but I want my cat to suffer from fleas, so I put this stuff on her and it kills the fleas, and I said, is there a karmic price to that? And he said yes, but it was mitigated by my motivation to protect my cat. It was a complexity to it. But I heard, yes, I mean, it's true, your intention was skillful, and that is the root of karma, is intention. So that's why mindfulness wakes us up, and it allows us to see if our intention is skillful or not, because unskillful intentions are going to plant the seed of unhappiness. But I urge us all not to get caught up in the minutia of the precepts, really to look at it in the larger scheme of lying and stealing and exaggerating and falsehoods, and really contemplate it on a larger scale. I mean, that's what the smaller scale isn't worthwhile, but don't get stuck in that. Any other questions? Yes. Hi, my name is Pat, and my question is, how do you rest peacefully with unhappiness? How do you rest skillfully with unhappiness, if peace of mind is being with both states? Right. To be aware of mindfulness, to be aware of unhappiness. Mindfulness is knowing that that's true right now, and asking yourself, you know, where is unhappiness in my body, or what thoughts in my mind, you know, are giving me this interpretation of unhappiness. And just the knowing completely eliminates the craving for it to go away. Just the knowing. The knowing is your life raft. When you're just sunk into the experience of unhappiness without being mindful of it, you know, you're enveloped by it. But when you're mindful of it, it gives you the healing power of that awareness, really takes you out of the hole of it, the darkness of it, and says, oh, that's unhappiness. And when you say that's unhappiness, that movement like this and like this, you know, wanting happiness and not wanting unhappiness, just knowing it helps you rest. Right here. And you have to do, you know, mindfulness isn't just a one-shot deal, but over and over and over when you see unhappiness arising, the wisdom also arises that it's not going to last. And that what we call, labeled, quote, unhappiness, are thoughts in our mind and feelings in our body. And when we connect with those experiences and see that they're made up of many impermanent phrases and feelings, then we're less connected to that experience. And when we're less connected, we allow it to rise and pass away. But craving kind of holds it. That's the unskillful wrestle. And we hate it. We're actually wrestling, you know, we have it in that kind of lock-jaw, you know, position where you're like, you know, you're kind of, you know, down there and you can't move it. When you're aware of it, it kind of loosens it up. So the awareness is, you don't pay attention to the specifics of what it is that you see as the unhappiness coming from. I mean, you don't pay attention to why you're unhappy, you just... Not at all. It's just the here and now. The story is endless. There's no beginning, no end to it. It's the nature of samsara. Stories endless. Any other questions? Yeah. But it seems to me that you could look at why you're unhappy from the viewpoint of dependent origination. And if you look at all this, perhaps, many minute causes that lead up to this feeling that's in your body, you start to see that, oh, this stuff isn't so important, but they're just making you feel this way. Yeah, that's a very good point. Thank you for making it. There are skillful reflections, you know, regarding, you know, Seela and Donna and things like that. There are skillful reflections of... And those whys are a lot more productive, you know, than the story of my particular personal unhappiness and where it came from. But it's more like... Because those are maybe out of your control. But when you're looking at skillful means in terms of redefining a story, you know, you look at things that you can practice and perfect in that sense. Those are more skillful than the why of the story, which is very seductive, you know, because we can all convince ourselves of why we're so, you know, ghastly or unhappy. But it's not going to get us anywhere in terms of really developing the heart of contentment. So skillful reflection is an excellent way of doing that, of what you just said, of if we really look back and we really make an effort to see, you know, was I really on the mark in terms of my applying... Not gossiping, not taking what was given. You know, that's a very helpful reason to understand why I'm so unhappy now. Any other questions? I don't have a question. I just wanted to thank you so much for your talk today and for your wisdom. It was very wonderful. Thank you. Okay. Rebecca, do you have a question? Well, I was just pondering what you said, Rana, about the understanding the why's and how we can get lost in our story. And I was thinking about how this applies to the sort of Western psychotherapy tradition, where understanding our background and conditions and conditioning is often seen as a path to awakening and increased awareness. So I was wondering how you negotiate that tradition with the Eastern. Understanding your story is not going to liberate you from happiness. You know, that's my definition. It may help you put the puzzle pieces together. But in terms of liberation from suffering, the complete eradication of the defilements of greed, hatred and delusion in the mind, the exact story line isn't going to get you there. It could get you to a lower level of understanding, but you can't get there without, you know, virtue. No matter how many times you tell the story and understand it, if you're still practicing unskillful behaviors, you know, you may be more understanding about your background, but still sowing the seeds of unhappiness. If you're still an emotional cheapskate or a financial cheapskate, great, you understand your story, but you're not going to be freed from greed, hatred and delusion. And if you're not mindful of what you're doing now, you're just sowing the seeds of suffering in the future. Hopefully, you know, the great insight is, you know, compassion. When you look back at your story, you realize, you know, there's really no villains and there's really no victims, you know, that, you know, kind of we're all in this mess together. And that's a very liberating insight, you know, after you go through your story for the 10 millionth time. But it doesn't stand alone as the path that the Buddha laid out does. Is that helpful? I know there's lots of disagreements. I'm just taking a very orthodox point of view. And I'm a psychologist, so obviously, you know, I spend a lot of time with other people's stories and my stories and they're not useless. You know, it's not useless. I'm just saying, you know, in terms of the greater path to liberation, you have to put the story in its place. And a lot of times the story, when you first start meditating, takes over and it's okay, you know, that's your story, that's the conditioning. And just to see it over and over and over again, you know, at some point, you know, after 30 years of looking at it, you know, it just loses its momentum. And that's a great experience, you know, it's just, you see the truth of impermanence. It doesn't have to live with you forever. And it kind of just like, it sheds away like a snakeskin. And there's room for compassion and loving kindness and all these other qualities. So it's a very difficult stage of meditation, actually, when your story is just, you know, it's just going on, on, on, on, on. And mindfulness is the only raft, really, at that point, just see, you know, just the, you know, how we've been poisoned by a story. It's just a story. You know, Joseph Golds See, it's a story, you know, or sometimes you hear someone's story, it's like, oh, can't say, you know, isn't that ridiculous? They're so wrapped up in that story, but it's not your story, it's their story. And the, and the hooks are in there. It's a story. And all of our stories are, you know, are very sad, you know, everybody's story is sad and there's secrets and there's sorrows, as I said earlier, and there's heartaches and, you know, every, the stories are sad. But you just fill in the blanks. And this is the human condition. Yes? You have been recommended reading regarding overcoming the untappiness of the book. I mean, that's about books, right? It's really, really, you know. Well, before reading, I would say, practicing is the book, you know, is, you could read till kingdom comes, you know, it's, and that's really not going to do it. You know, people say they have a bedside table, you know, that's like the Tower of Babel of Dharma books. So what, you know? What the Buddha taught is a book that I really like. And the experience of insight is another book I like. But no, no, this is not an intellectual path. It's really a path of the heart, you know, and how to liberate it. Any other questions? So we'll just end with a brief loving kindness meditation, please. Just taking a comfortable seat and turning your attention inwards to your personal secrets and sorrows and things that you're wrestling with and wish were different or wish you can have more of. You know, the things, you know, that constricts your heart wanting more of something. What is that thing? And wanting less or to get rid of something else. You know, what is that thing? And acknowledging that just bringing some mindfulness to it, just knowing that you're in the wrestle is very liberating. And in mindfulness is a real form of generosity of Dhanā. Because you're giving the moment it's full due to really just seeing what's going on. And in that sense, the wrestle stops for that moment. And it's also just being generous to the breath and to the body because your mindfulness is in the body. So just take a moment to appreciate that you are in the process of unwrapping that or releasing that grip. By just knowing what it is in your particular situation. And then just generously breathe into it. And really just saturate the moment with a fullness of breath and awareness. But this is it. This is all we have right now, the thoughts of the past or the past. You might have a thought of the past in the present or a thought of the future in the present, but this is it. So can we be generous to our secrets and sorrows? Just knowing them. And then in Thailand there's this word Adhitan, which is a spiritual determination that you make to yourselves. And I encourage you to make a spiritual determination or Adhitan to become more beautiful by really examining the role of virtue in your life. How you're really going to quote clean up your act. In terms of really examining sexuality in your life and intoxicating drinks and drugs, speech, exaggeration, gossip, lack of attribution. You know the forms of stealing or killing that we may engage in. And working with people who are over readers for example, that you often kill your emotions. It doesn't have to be killing ants or rats or whatever. You know, what's the rat that's your emotion that you're trying to kill? And really make an Adhitan to be aware. And moving away from so much the literal to a deeper understanding of virtue. Even intoxicating the mind, how we get intoxicated by a new pair of boots or intoxicated by the thought of a summer vacation. Or intoxicated by the eggplant, like in Nazrudin's story. We don't have to be simplistic in our virtue. Actually virtue is very sophisticated. So make an Adhitan to widen your lens in your life. To affirm the life of your emotions and to really see in terms of not stealing. The way you really work with that is seeing the greedy mind. Not stealing someone's car, not that you're going to take a key and unlock it and drive it off. But wishing it was yours instead of somebody else's. And on and on. You know you can contemplate this yourself. And just continuing to breathe into the body, into these determinations, to acknowledge secrets and sorrows. And spread that degree of contentment that you have to everybody in this room. While making that similar effort. To friends and family, near and far away. To the young and old, rich and poor. The Buddha said, everybody's blood is red, everybody's tears are salty. To all beings everywhere. Everybody's blood is red, everybody's tears are salty. To bring the heart of generosity to that truth. So may all beings be liberated from suffering. May all beings be liberated from the wrestle of desire and craving. Thank you.
