 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So, Wisdom. The Buddha says, just as the lion is the ruler of the jungle, wisdom rules over mindfulness, concentration, faith, energy. The last of the five faculties. So, wisdom, philosophy, that word breaks down as love of wisdom. And I'll say more about the Buddhist definition of it, but in one scientific team, they characterized it in this way as having six components, nothing sacred about six, five or seven, but they picked six, and six facets. So, wisdom as pro-social attitudes and behaviors, emotional homeostasis, self-understanding, value tolerance, dealing effectively with ambiguity, uncertainty, and social decision making. So, I offer that just as a kind of way, another lens from which to understand, okay, what is wisdom? Often, practitioners ask Dharma teachers questions, yeah, and often boils down to something like, how do I be wise? And that's a question that can't really be answered by another person. Wisdom is, it can't be mimicked, and it's improvisational, and it emerges out of our own intuitive connection with ourself, and our ability to make good predictions about happiness. Wisdom is about making good predictions about suffering and happiness for ourself and for others. Given, given everything I know about me and you and everyone we know, how should we live? Given, dukka, anicha, anatta, how should we live? Given the vulnerability of our species to greed, to hatred, to delusion, to violence, given the vulnerability of our species to violence, how should we live? Philosophers sometimes distinguish knowledge that from knowledge how. So, knowledge that the universe, 14 billion years old, versus knowledge how, how to ride a bike. And Dharma insight wisdom is mostly about knowledge how, knowledge how to do what? Knowledge how not to suffer. I heard a story of this beloved old monk in Thailand who apparently saw a satellite in the sky and asked his younger, younger monastic to explain like what is that, what is going on there. And the younger, younger monk had to explain the earth's rotation, the earth is round, the, you know, all these things. And that was all news to this old monk. News about the shape of the earth and its movement. He didn't know any of that. He knew how not to suffer, how not to cause suffering. So the journey of wisdom from a kind of latent potential, the dots inside us that haven't been connected, latent potential to insight to embodiment and generalization, generalization meaning wisdom that's operative in all spheres of our life. It's a tall order, wisdom operative in all spheres of our life. The right we all know there's zones, contacts, relationships, moments, particular currents of feeling, of thinking where we lose, we become alienated from our wisdom. And we want to keep a kind of relationship with the failures of generalization. The way is our wisdom doesn't generalize to all contexts. And I was talking with a friend just a couple of days ago, another long time Dharma practitioner, and just having a very, very frank conversation for the, about the ways that our wisdom has been actualized and generalized and the ways it's not. And it's inspiring to see the ways in which we have not generalized the wisdom to all corners of our life, actually motivating. So the process we start by thawing out the top layers of delusion. And that just takes time. It takes time. We just, I think naturally are kind of confused about the nature of happiness, confused about what we actually want, confused about what a good life would be. And maybe we find ourselves getting what we want, but then it's not what we thought it was. And this kind of recognition, the cycle that getting is always different from wanting. So wrong view, wrong view, feels almost visceral. It feels almost visceral. I guess in our tissues or something. And we have to thaw out. And that process of thawing out, which might be months or years, there's a lot of kicking and screaming that happens. A lot of kicking and screaming as we're thawing out, as we're starting to replace the kind of boards on the, or boat or raft or whatever. We find we can't just replace all the boards of the boat that we carry on at once. It's a gradual path. And we can't even really pick up new ideas initially. We have to almost like make our body, mind more porous so that new information can flow in. This is some of why we emphasize not knowing, emphasize surrender, emphasize putting down all the familiar reference points of liking and disliking good, evil, us, them. We make the mind more porous, malleable, stable. We get settled, get happy, happy enough. And usually we think we have to get wisdom so that we can be happy, and that's fair enough. But happiness often actually precedes insight. Happiness precedes insight. When we're suffering, we're just looking so desperately for ways out. It's hard to learn. It's hard to learn. We can do it. We can do it, but it's harder to learn. Happiness, a kind of positive mood, actually modulates our attention, our cognition, and broadens the view. And so whereas suffering pools the attention, narrows the view, makes resolution feel kind of urgent, happiness, sense of well-being broadens the view, we become receptive to new information, and wisdom often feels like it arises out of, almost like out of our peripheral vision, not out of our intent gaze. Ram Dassa is the quieter you get, the more you can hear. And the function of samadhi, quieter you get, the more you hear. And so the wisdom, wisdom actually creates the sense that the, oh, okay, the dharma, the dharma is real. It's real. It's been realized. It becomes real. And our insight feels, insight feels freeing, feels, it feels like it resolves, it's like something consistent in our being all the way down, from conscious thought to subconscious competition. Something feels like, hmm, something comes into true. And sometimes we think that's the end of the story, but most insight needs reinforcement, the light from the stars dims, and we need to consolidate and to re-practice, to re-discover. We need to be reminded of our wisdom. This is why we have Kali Anamitta spiritual friends. We're way more suggestible than we think. And it's really important to have this kind of steady inflow of goodness into our heart. We keep practicing to nurture, protect our wisdom. Joseph Goldstein just summed it up simply, when we practice, wisdom grows, when we don't. Wisdom waves. We have to keep suffering. We do keep suffering. And we keep a conscious relationship to our dukkha. This is what inspires us to grow and deepen. And we, we try acting from our wisdom. Even sometimes when we don't feel it, what would a person be like? Yeah, okay, I knew that insight around self-kindness. What? I don't feel so kind right now at all. But what, what would that person do now, if they were living from, if I were living from this insight, from this wisdom, from this self-kindness, how would I behave now? Let me do that. Let me try that on. So we prepare the ground, till the soil, barred delusions, inhabit wise view. We get still, get quiet, stay open to the peripheral vision. We consolidate and grow our insight. Wisdom, wisdom. So for this for your consideration. Yeah, it's sweet to be with you. Think about you wherever you are. Yeah, okay. Well, I wish you, wish you all well. And I'll be back in a few weeks here. So this was annoying. Don't, don't, don't come, I guess, would be my wisdom, you know. Anyway, I'm not sure Gil's schedule. I think he's back. I hope he's back, but it's possible. I'm confused. Anyway, it's always lovely to, to step in for him and feel connected to you all. So it doesn't feel like, doesn't feel like a weird, awkward substitute teaching kind of gig. It's like, oh, yeah, we're friends. So I love that. Okay, people, I wish you, wish you all well. Yeah.
