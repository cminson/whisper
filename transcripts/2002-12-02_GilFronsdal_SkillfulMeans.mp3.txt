 There's a story that Gary Snyder tells of going to Japan to study, he studied very strict Rinzai tradition in Daitokuji and Kyoto. And there was one very old venerable Rinzai Zen master who was renowned for giving great Dharma talks. The thing was that no one ever could hear him because he spoke so faintly. And then Gary Snyder goes on to say, it didn't matter. So which brings me to a little bit around to the topic of tonight. And that is I'm going to talk again on the topic I talked on yesterday, which is skillfulness and skillful means, partly because it's a very important topic in Buddhism and partly because after I left yesterday, I didn't think I did a very skillful job with the talk. And I can't get away with just my charisma. And sometimes when I feel that way on giving a talk, I think, oh, well, then I feel inspired sometimes. I'd like to do it again and do a better job. You know, sometimes I feel once I've given a talk, only then am I really capable of giving a talk, but I've already done it. So and so this is my chance to redeem myself. And there's a certain skills involved being a teacher, right? So it seems appropriate to give a talk on skillfulness. And but also remember, there's a skills in being a student. So some of you might need to redeem yourself in that department so we can all get to try again. So skillfulness is a very important concept in Buddhism. And probably it's not emphasized enough. And in fact, for many years in my own practice, I had no sense of really its importance, even though unknowingly, in a sense, I was developing all kinds of skills in my early years of practice. But it wasn't explicitly told, expressed that that's what I was doing or that was the point of the practice. Since it's not emphasized, many people don't recognize its importance. So tonight's talk has probably two major aims. One is to talk, one is to encourage you to look at Buddhist practice as a development of certain skills, including the discernment to distinguish what helps and hinders the spiritual growth. So to feel encouraged and inspired by the idea that what you're doing here is developing a skill set and skills. The second aim is to suggest that in developing skillfulness and being skillful, you're doing something that you already, you'll be doing something, you engage in a practice of something you already do, that being skillful and developing skills is something inherent to being a human being. And that when you're asked to become more skillful through Buddhist practice, you're not being asked to do something anything different than something that you've been doing probably since the time you were born, cultivating and developing skills and adapting yourself better to this human condition. So I like to think of, often like to think of Buddhist practice as building upon what you already do, as opposed to introducing something foreign into your life. And maybe this talk can kind of hopefully point to that, that you already are adept at all kinds of skills that maybe you don't even give yourself credit for having mastered. In the Buddhist teaching, the idea of skillfulness, developing skills, is emphasized explicitly in two different places that I could think of easily. One is in a somewhat famous, at least in Asia, famous quote from the Dhammapada and elsewhere, it's called the Ovada Patimok. And it's considered kind of like one of the simple, one of the simplest, shortest descriptions of what the Buddha's teachings are. And it goes like this. Do no evil, engage in what is skillful, purify the mind. This is the teaching of the Buddhas, not just simply our Buddha. All Buddhas teach this thing. Avoid evil, do no evil. And sometimes this is translated as do no evil, do good and purify the mind. But that misses the important emphasis here. Buddha didn't say do good, he said do what's skillful. And there's a big distinction between that. And then purify the mind. As a little footnote to this, in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition, they took this famous poem and they changed one line. And the line verse goes like this. Avoid evil, don't do evil. Teach in what is skillful. Save all beings. This is the teachings of the Buddha. So you might, I think you need to look at these three admonitions together. Because it isn't that all skillful action is good, beneficial for the Buddha's path. Being a skillful robber is not considered to be a good thing, a skillful liar. The three go together. First you have to avoid evil. So you can't be a robber then. Or you can't skillfully lie, supposedly. And so that kind of puts one limit on what is skillful, the definition of what's spiritually skillful. And then the third admonition is purify the mind. Is do that which is skillful for purifying the mind, for liberating the mind, for cultivating the mind's capacity for love, compassion, openness, to live in accord with the truth. So that's the first place I can think of where this is explicit, the importance of doing what's skillful. The second place is in a very frequent references to distinguishing ethically between those behaviors, activities we do, words we say, even movements of the mind. Distinguish between those which are skillful and unskillful. The Pali word is kusala and akusala. And sometimes this is translated as wholesome and unwholesome. Which is a good translation I think, except it misses the fact that the word literally means skill. Like a craftsperson develops a skill. So that which is skillful in a particular situation. So when a person is engaged in the path of liberation, the ethical considerations are not what is good and bad, what is right and wrong, but rather what is skillful and what is unskillful. And it kind of loosens up a little bit the heavy moralistic tendency that people might have, but oh this is right and wrong, good or bad. That's not the point. The point is what is helpful and what is unhelpful. So those are the two areas I can think of. The first quote, the poem, is not so well known in the West. And Buddhist ethics is not so popular in the West. So unless you tune into these things you wouldn't pick up that the skillfulness is there. However, everywhere else in the Buddha's teaching, the idea of skillfulness is implicit in the teachings. In the Four Noble Truth, the idea of developing skills, becoming skillful in relationship with Four Noble Truths is implicit. The Eightfold Path, the three trainings, which is an overview of the Buddhist system of training. They all have to do with developing skills. In the sense, the idea of being skillful, developing skills, is the warp upon which the rest of the practice and teaching is the weft that goes across, is woven across. And sometimes we don't see the warp, I suppose. We see kind of what covers it or what leaves in and out of it. The idea that human activity, your human action is efficacious, can cause a change, a beneficial change is implicit at the foundation of the Buddha's teaching. The choices you make, the activities you do, can make a difference. If you couldn't, then why bother with any practice at all? That's what the Buddha basically said. So it's assumed that skills can be developed and that our choices and our actions can make a difference. One of the reasons to develop skills, a skilled mind, a skilled character, is so that the monkey mind, the mind of desire, doesn't have the upper hand in our actions in the world. An untamed, undisciplined mind is a very dangerous thing. And probably all of you can recognize in your own life someplace where you've saved yourself tremendous amount of suffering by being a little bit disciplined. Or maybe the opposite. You could remember some time where a little bit of discipline would have done you a lot of good. And just a disciplined mind, some mind where you develop the skills, the self-knowledge, the self-awareness, the self-discipline, in order to not be a slave to the movements of the mind is a very important part of developing a mature life. Certainly a spiritual life. So the question is, what is it to be skillful, to be skilled? And probably many of you can come up with a definition. One is, it's an ability to do some task, some activity, with proficiency, with fluency, mastery, expertness, efficiency, elegance. And we often go to watch athletes or dancers or craftspeople or various people who have mastered a skill. And it's just wonderful. It's one of the great delights to watch sometimes people that really mastered something, sometimes spend years and years, sometimes from childhood, in order to master to a degree that almost seems magical to watch what people can do with their bodies or with their minds. And it's just a beautiful, beautiful thing to see what can be done. I was really inspired by watching my son's preschool teacher at work. And after 20 years of being a preschool teacher, he had the ability to stay calm, not only to stay calm in the midst of chaos, but also to work very skillfully with all the children in the classroom. So he had the practical skills of working with the kids. And they had the inner skills of being able to turn in towards himself and be attentive and mindful of what was going on inside of him so he could stay calm. He developed those skills. And I don't think they came easy, but 20 years. And he was mentored closely by his preschool teacher-teacher, the person who taught him to be a teacher. And I thought he was a little master to watch him. So I'm talking about skillfulness, the person who just walked in. And the reason I mention it is because I know she was trying to get her son into the same preschool. And I was talking so nicely about the preschool teacher there. A skill is something we develop and cultivate, we train for. Even people who have natural abilities would usually need to kind of train and cultivate, repeat that ability until they master it and become real experts at it. So the idea of developing a skill in Buddhist practice implies that Buddhism means you have to apply yourself, you have to have something you do, you engage yourself. It's in the repetitive action of doing the same thing over and over again that you learn to master something, a skill. So you have to kind of do that. You have to put yourself in situations where you're going to repeat the same thing over and over again. Even something as simple as watching your breath has the virtue of repetition, where a lot of development can come. And when we see a skilled person, sometimes it's not often obvious to us the amount of training that's gone into that ability. I remember I was so inspired when I saw my university mentor when I was in graduate school. I had a mentor, my professor, wrote brilliant papers. She read, they were really wonderful to read. They were so smooth and so well argued. And I was in awe of her articles that she wrote. And I would sit there, labor away, and just like pulling teeth to write these articles and then draft 32 and draft 55. And then one day she showed me an early draft of one of her papers. And it was crossed out and there were things in the margin and there was all these corrections and changes. And I was amazed to see that her too. I always assumed she sat down the typewriter and you're like, you know. But actually this very skilled papers that she was able to produce came through a lot of effort, repetition going over and over and over again. Same thing with concentration. I've known people who have been praised for their ability to get concentrated in meditation. And some people think, oh that person is so easy for that person. That person can get concentrated. And I know that person has spent sometimes years plugging away, working at developing the concentration and really making an effort at it. And sometimes with great, certainly sincerity, but great exploration and playfulness and great trial and error and testing and really making it a central part of their life. Remember one person who developed tremendous concentration, it seemed like for him it was like the thing that his life was going to be about for about four or five years, I believe. And he worked at all kinds of other things, went on retreats. But the thing that he was most interested in doing was developing his concentration. And it wasn't that he had maybe some natural ability to get concentrated. Even though later it looked that way, he just put in the time like a great athlete would. And he made it important enough for himself. I feel I'm that way a little bit. I don't feel like I have a natural ability to get concentrated. But I've put in the time and the effort. I've noticed that at some point I noticed that I would go on long retreats. And it's a little bit dangerous to talk this way, but I would notice that the progress on retreat, the degree to which I got concentrated, my mind got still, what happens faster and the retreats would take five months on one retreat to get to point X. The next retreat would take two months. And the next retreat would take a month. The next retreat would take two weeks. It would be faster each time. And what I attributed that to was developing skills. Not only skills in the techniques that I could use or how to use my mind, but also I became fluent in the tricks of my mind, how my mind operates and what the map is and how to use it and how to work with the mind and all these things. And so part of the fluency of developing a skill was also being able to read myself very carefully and to know myself, be familiar enough with myself so that I could be much more efficient in applying myself as I went along. I remember some people have been really inspired by how some venerable old Zen priests bow and just totally inspired by their bows. And some of these Zen priests have been bowing for 50 years, every day, dozens of times, up and down, up and down. And they've mastered the skill. Somehow there's the efficiency, the elegance, the complete involvement, comes from this lifetime of putting themselves into this one activity. So I find it interesting that the word skill, if you look up in the dictionary, comes from the Indo-European root that means to separate, to separate the ability to separate things, the ability to separate. And from that in Middle English it meant to make distinctions and to discern, discernment, to distinguish and discern. And I think a lot about developing skills is developing our capacity to be discerning and to make distinctions. I read recently an account of someone who had learned to master the art of swimming. And he'd swum for many, many years. And then, but he kept working on his skill with repetitive motions over and over again. And he felt he could have started making a quantum jump forward in his skill in swimming when he was able to make finer and finer distinctions in the movements in each stroke. So stroke wasn't just one big movement, but it was made up of dozens of different little sub-movements of muscles working. And because he was doing it for so long, repetition, he could see the subtle, subtlety going on and make those subtle distinctions and then adapt himself accordingly. Same thing happens in meditation. As we get more still and more familiar with ourselves, more concentrated and more present, part of the value of that is to be able to make finer and finer distinctions, discern finer and finer differences of what's actually happening in our experience. It can be as simple as discerning the finer and finer difference between what's really going on in physical pain. I sat here with back pain when I was sitting here with you today. And I did it then. I kind of zeroed in on the back pain. And it wasn't just a solid mass of pain. It actually was kind of moving around. I could discern differences within it. And I could certainly discern what my mind did about having pain and not believe it, or not get caught by it. At least, my mind was made to spin out stories about what it means for a Dharma teacher to sit in front of everyone with back pain. Oh, 30 years of meditation and I'm a failure. I shouldn't have back pain. Or whatever, right? Another aspect of being skillful is knowing what is an appropriate response in any given situation. So a skillful response is an appropriate response. And so I think part of developing a spiritual life or a wise life is learning how to be adaptable in a wide range of circumstances, ideally in all circumstances. So I have that flexibility to know the appropriate response. And I think there's a Zen Koan. So you remember? It goes, what's the teachings of a life? What's a teachings from a, someone's asked, what's a teachings from a lifetime of practice? Is that how it goes? Remember this Koan? So yeah. No, the Zen students here. Yeah. What's, you know, what's the teachings of a lifetime of Zen practice? And the Zen master says, an appropriate response. So knowing what's an appropriate response, seeing what an appropriate response is, is the result of, you know, not some particular state or experience, but knowing how to respond. So that's very much true in doing a spiritual practice, Buddhist practice. Knowing to be discerning enough, make distinctions enough, to read yourself carefully enough, to know what's the appropriate attitude or response to yourself in any given situation. So there might be times when you're filled with anger and you sit down to meditate. It might not be appropriate sometimes to bring mindfulness to that anger. Maybe what's needed is to bring loving kindness. Or the opposite is true. It might be inappropriate to bring loving kindness to it. And what's appropriate is to bring mindfulness to the anger. And, you know, anger in both situations, but different appropriate responses. And a certain skill set gets developed where we know, we can discern or we can find our way to what is the appropriate way of responding to our anger or to anything that's coming up. So you sit down to, you see, you go out to do your meditation practice and you find yourself tired. And what is a skillful response to tiredness? Using low energy. There's many possibilities. One might be, is that that's not the day to do sitting meditation. Rather that day you spend your meditative time doing walking meditation. As valid as doing sitting meditation, but the walking meditation brings more energy and keeps you more alert. So one of the interesting things about emphasizing skills and developing skills as part of practice is that we can distinguish that from the emphasis on developing, having experiences, cultivating certain experiences or certain states. It's very common for meditators, especially here in the West, to fixate on experiences and states of mind as being the point to the practice. I'm trying to reach that state, you know, that person has a great state. I'm going to have that state too. Or, you know, if there's a right state to have, then I really know I'm on the right spiritual track or the right sense of being in contact with a sacred or something, some great feeling we have. That's the point. And I don't want to belittle those things, experiences and states and feelings, that have their importance. But sometimes I think they're over emphasized their importance. What's more important in Buddhist practice, I would argue, is cultivation of skills, skillfulness, understanding of an ability. And part of the advantages of this is that spiritual experiences, spiritual feelings, spiritual states are not enduring. And so they're not so reliable. But if you cultivate an ability, abilities are much more enduring. You can bring them into many different situations. So I think that you find yourself much more supported by the skills you develop than by the experiences that you have or don't have. Does that make sense? That was an important point. Oh, good. The other thing is, if you develop a skill set, certain skills, you can use them in time for great difficulty. So you find yourself in crisis. And you might find that your ability to get calm, your ability to be discerning, your ability to not get caught by your thoughts is really, really important in that period of crisis. But if you hadn't developed that ability to do those things, then you're trying to hold on to your peace or your calm, you probably get yourself more and more fragile, more and more rigid. But if you have the skills you developed, then you can call on those and try to use them in a particular situation. Or I find it very encouraging when I find myself in challenging situations to kind of think, oh, great. I get to try to cultivate my skills here, too. Hone my skills, develop my skills here. And the example I gave yesterday was Saturday morning, I had this very feeling. I was inspired by this challenge. It was time to make breakfast, usually not a very challenging time. But my wife was sleeping in because she was tired, nursing in the middle of the night. And I was carrying the baby with my left arm, who was nuts. You had to kind of sometimes take some doing to keep them happy. Whatever. You know, with one hand. And while we have this four-year-old at home who's also awake and wants to play with me, wants to be engaged and do something, he's kind of round, you know, doing his dance. And you know, the four-year-old has to eat really soon. Because if you don't eat soon enough, then it gets out of hand. Because you know what happens when he kind of revs up, when he's hungry or tired. So it was really important to get breakfast done. So with one hand. So that was a challenging situation for me. But in that particular challenge, I felt kind of inspired. Okay, what are the skills here? I'm not getting caught, I'm being present, paying attention to the whole situation, being focused on task at hand, you know, the skills of communication with a four-year-old, you know, just all these things had to be developed. So playing that and working with it made it much more interesting and probably prevented me from going off the deep end. So the impulse to develop a skill can give a person a sense of purpose, even in situations that might otherwise seem hopeless. And I've known people in our situations that can seem hopeless, or hopeless that you can do anything to help yourself in that situation. I'm thinking now of going into infra-surgery. Many people report they're laying there on the bed and they're waiting for everything to happen. There's major things going to happen in their life. They don't know whether they're going to wake up ever again, you know, or they're taking off the wrong leg, or who knows what they're kind of worried about what's going to happen. You know, you can't do anything, seemingly. And it's one of the things that makes surgery, I think, difficult for people. And people report when they feel that they can do something, they feel so much better about the whole surgery, and maybe you feel they recover better also. And so even in that moment when you feel like you normally can't do anything, having a practice that you can cultivate and develop can be very helpful. A very common one that people use before surgery is loving kindness meditation, to just do loving kindness, and to feel, oh, great, I had something to do, something to kind of hold on to, or some purpose here in the situation that otherwise I couldn't do anything. Remember when I was first learning Vipassana meditation in Thailand? I had done maybe about eight, nine weeks of Vipassana practice by this time. So a lot of retreat time. And for some reason, my meditation teacher, the abbot there, took me along to a funeral in Bangkok of a probably very wealthy Thai general. And it was an incredibly gaudy funeral, glitzy, and like the Roman Catholic Church or something, just full of regalia. And there was this long funeral ceremony, which was all in Thai or Pali, and no language that I could understand. And I thought of myself very bored. And I was stuck in this place. I couldn't go anywhere. The teacher wanted me to be there, and I was bored, and I couldn't understand anything. Why was I there? And after being bored for a while, miserable for a while, then I remembered, oh, actually I'm still kind of on retreat. That's what I'm supposed to be doing. And this thing of mindfulness, paying attention. Maybe I can do that here too. And so I started paying attention and being mindful of what was going on. The boredom vanished, and I felt quite happy about being there. I had a sense of purpose that was different than just kind of waiting for something more important to happen. That's part of the beauty of having spiritual practice. It can give you a sense of purpose in every situation you find yourself in. Isn't that nice? The idea, oh, sometimes a bad meditation, so-called, is better than a good meditation. So again, we emphasize so much. People emphasize experience, having a good meditation experience, whatever. And now I have a bad meditation experience. But actually, a good meditation experience can be better than a bad one. I mean, a bad one can be better than a good one. In that, the bad one, so-called, might give you a lot more self-knowledge, self-understanding. There's a lot more patience might develop, a lot more self-compassion might arise. So all these good qualities can come from a really bad meditation. There's a good meditation, maybe all you get is pride. Great, I did it. And that's not a skill you want to develop. And in fact, habits are kind of like skills, right? Anything gets developed by repetition. So you want to be very careful what you repeat. And if what you're repeating is egotism over and over and over again, being self-centered, might get stronger and stronger. The idea that spiritual practice entails skillfulness, developing skills, can be daunting to some people. And the very idea of hearing about it can seem exhausting. Some of you feel exhausted already hearing this. It can be exhausting. And I think it's partly because many of us, our minds are exhausted from doing so much. Doing, doing, doing, doing. And then they have some kind of implication that spiritual practice also involves doing. Give me a break. What I want is a vacation for my mind. And so there are spiritual practices that emphasize not doing. And they're very profound in their own way. But we might not understand the profundity of them, but what we understand is this is the antidote, maybe very wise antidote, for the exhausted mind. So what is the appropriate response? If your mind is exhausted from doing, maybe the appropriate skillful response is doing a practice of not doing for a while so the mind can rest and relax. We don't want to make a religion out of the practice of not doing. This is the only true way. But rather, oh, given these sets of conditions, this is a useful practice to do. Those conditions change. You have to then be adaptable then to change your practice accordingly. It might be after a while your mind is cooled out and relaxed at ease. And that not doing doesn't help you anymore. Doesn't kind of continue to develop your practice. And then you need to switch to something more active at that point, cultivating and developing. Now, so again, I think I'm also afraid that some of you listening to this might want to be ready to dismiss that you're becoming more skillful or developing skills because of all the doing involved, seeming doing involved. But remember that being skillful also means having the ability to discern what is the appropriate thing to do, what's the appropriate response. That's skillful right there. And if what you need to do is to rest and not do, you have to be skillful enough to see that. We're skillful enough to see when that's not appropriate. So part of what it means to develop skills being skillful or inherent in being skillful is the ability to read a situation accurately. A skillful kayaker reads the currents, the waves, the position of the boat, her own abilities at a particular moment in time, her own balance in the boat, in the kayak. All those things, a lot of different things are taken into account. And because of the training, endless training, endless repetition, all those discernments happen almost effortlessly. The tremendous amount of information is taken in when a person kayaks, when a person rides a bicycle, when a person develops skills that have become for some people second nature. And also part of the joy of it is you're so absorbed in the present moment that everything else is forgotten, but the present moment is where you live. And in that present moment, the mind is so attuned and sensitive to all the information coming in that you can make very fine adjustments, very fine distinctions to know how to proceed. The same thing happens in meditation. At a point when the concentration gets really strong, sometimes I felt like it's like surfing, you caught the wave, you're kind of on the concentration, the concentration is hooked you or you're hooked into the concentration. And it's kind of like you're on the wave and it's really exciting sometimes to meditate. It feels exhilarating sometimes to be there on the wave and kind of fully present and then all your senses kind of get tuned in or attuned to what's happening in the present moment and kind of riding that wave and staying on it and not letting the thoughts carry you away or not get caught by them or whatever. So a skillful meditator needs to be discerning about their energy level, concentration levels, emotional state, the thoughts, the concerns of the mind. There's a lot to track in order to really master the art of meditation, to be adaptable and to know how to respond to different situations. It's a slow process to learn that mastery. And one of the first skills that a lot of meditators need to learn, though sometimes they're slow in learning it, is patience. It takes a lot of patience to become a meditator. And sometimes it's a lesson that's hard learned, is that the word? We learn it through the fire of not having it. How are we doing? Can I continue a little bit longer? Is this interesting enough? Yeah? I'm a little bit of an acousinist and I say no. Somebody finally says no, that I know I've succeeded in being a good teacher. But anyway. In the Bhagavad Gita, which is a Hindu text, there's a line that says, yoga is skillful action. Yoga is skillful action. The reason I mention this now is that here we find outside the Buddhist tradition, another Indian spiritual tradition which emphasizes the importance of being skillful. But in Bhagavad Gita I think it's synonymous with spiritual practice, not like hatha yoga specifically, but spiritual practice in general. And skill is something that's universal. Developing skill is universal in our human condition. I see it in my new baby, who's now five weeks old, that he's been very busy in the minutes that he's awake during the day developing skills. The most rudimentary basic skill that I never thought about, what a big deal, how difficult it is to learn. You guys probably haven't never thought about it because you've learned that skill before you had thoughts. So you probably don't even remember. Is holding your neck up, holding your head up. You know, in the first few weeks we had to kind of hold his neck up, he couldn't do it himself and he's constantly trying now. He tries again, you know. And it's a skill he's developing. And, you know, it takes a lot of coordination and attention and all this. And he also seems to be learning the skills of how to use his eyes and how to focus. Very actively involved in developing these skills. And it's so inherent, it seems like there's a drive in the human psyche, in the human being system, to develop skills, to explore. And a lot of growing up is this drive to develop these skills with the master, all kinds of different things. By the time you get to be a teenager you're trying to master things your parents don't want you to master. But maybe that's part of the system, how it works. And my sense is that if a person is relaxed enough or not stressed too much, sensitive to their own inner life in a deep way, that that impulse to developing oneself, to developing skills, to cultivating, to mastering certain things is still inherently there. And it's not something that's foreign to us, but it's already here, we're already doing it as we keep growing older. We're developing skills and how to be old, which is a good thing to learn if you're going to be old. So developing skills is a common human endeavor. And as we get into adulthood, spiritual practice is an impulse to develop to a higher level of maturity. I think of spiritual development as being a maturation process, as opposed to something which is adding something to your life, which is just continuing that process of maturation development, something more mysterious than that. It's not some great esoteric thing. Now one of the things that happens as we mature though and become adults is there's a kind of a second level learning, and that is we learn how to learn. We develop the skills of how to develop skills. I saw my son's school today and they had a pamphlet called Learning How to Learn. It made me so happy, especially since I was going to give this talk today. So learning how to learn, learning how to develop skills. What are the qualities that we need to have within us to develop skills? Do we bring to a situation? One of the foremost is patience. The second is persistence, repetition over and over and over again. You underestimate the tremendous value of repeating your attention on a breath, one breath after the other. Self monitoring, having the right attitude, humility in developing a skill, willingness to learn, willingness to learn from others, self knowledge, interest, willingness to fail, and to learn from how one fails. Suspending preconceived limiting ideas. So you find some Buddhists emphasizing a lot the not knowing mind, practice not knowing. If you do it well and you're supposed to imitate Korean teacher Sung-Sae-Nyem who popularizes in America and he would say something like, I can't even do it. I embarrass myself and my profession. I just forget it. I'm sorry. I don't know. Knowing having skills not to let self limiting ideas get the upper hand. When I was writing my dissertation, I had a ton of thoughts about how I couldn't do this. This was impossible. I can go through a list of it. I can't do it. It can't be done. All these thoughts. But for my years of meditation, for my familiarity with my mind, there were little pesky flies in the background. They were there. I didn't let them bother me. I didn't let them get in the way. I just took the next footnote. You could write the next footnote to do the next sentence. It kept plugging away and plugging away and plugging away. It just kind of ignored. It didn't get caught by those thoughts. It might be that as we grow up, that it's the skills and learning how to develop skills which is most useful because it's most applicable everywhere. Along this line, the last thing I'll say, I apologize if we're going over, is even choosing one thing to master, like in terms of meditation practice, trying to cultivate concentration in the breath, their mindfulness in the breath, choosing one simple thing. There are so many different skills, so many different aspects of our psyche that has to come into play to make that happen. In simply doing that day after day, month after month, year after year, you'll learn to refine so much of your character, so much of who you are, through that very simplicity of that one thing. You'll develop things like patience and self-awareness and concentration and a whole slew of things. You keep trying to develop mindfulness in the breath in all the different circumstances of your life. You see yourself in so many different circumstances by having this one reference point, the breath, the same activity you can repeat day after day, day after day. It's like a vantage point from which you can see everything else much more clearly. To develop a great skill on one thing can often then translate into the self-knowledge, this kind of self-refinement that can help us in how we engage in life outside of that particular skill. So I would encourage all of you to think of developing a skill. It doesn't have to be a meditation, but certainly this is a meditation group. It's a great place, so I'd encourage it there. Develop skills. Don't be discouraged by failure, even years of failure. It might actually be more useful sometimes if you're learning about yourself in that process. But it could be other things to develop skill in. When I was at San Francisco Zen Center, there was a lot of emphasis on this idea of developing skills. They didn't use that kind of word. And so they would have, sometimes as Zen students, were sent to study Japanese tea ceremony. And tea ceremony is a skill that you develop. It's a very refined way of behavior and action. And they're really encouraging people to develop themselves by developing this particular skill. So developing skillfulness. And in thinking about the pedagogy of this talk and trying to redeem myself from yesterday, I had said, it's really important not to talk for too long. You want to give a short talk and then have questions. I'm still trying to learn how to do this. So thank you very much for your patience and listening. Have fun.
