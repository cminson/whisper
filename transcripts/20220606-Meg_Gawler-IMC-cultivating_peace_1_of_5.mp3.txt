The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Greetings everyone. My name is Meg Caller and I'll just give you a brief
introduction. I've been blessed with many beautiful teachers in my life, starting
in my childhood with my substitute mother, who was of
American Indian and Black
ancestry. And she was an amazingly wise woman with a heart as big as this guy.
Her name was Hermione. And it's thanks to her that I had an example of what it
might mean to incarnate, hopefully someday,
that kind of beautiful wisdom, kindness, strength, and above all kindness.
And then at the age of
21, in 1968, I became a disciple of Shinryu Suzuki Roshi.
And in 1971, I received lay ordination from him and his gift
has been immense. And I see him every day.
And then about 15 years ago, I took a turn towards the Charavada tradition
and have trained with Gil Fronstal, Jack Cornfield,
Venerable Analyo, and Aya Anandavodi among others. So the theme for this week
will be cultivating peace.
And I'd like to explore with you five of the 12 steps taught by the Buddha,
which are the conditions for allowing one to step off the karmic path and onto
the dharmic path, which leads to freedom. And this is from the Upanishad Sutta.
It's Samyutanikaya 1223, which Bhikkhu Bodhi translates as the
Proximate Cause Sutta. So you may be familiar with dependent
origination or dependent arising, which begins with ignorance and
leads all the way to suffering, pain, lamentation, and despair.
And this other path of conditioned arising
is called the liberative or transcendent dependent arising.
And this one actually begins with Dukha, where we left off from the karmic path.
And the Buddhist teachings put in place a series of 12 conditions
that create the ground for awakening to arise.
So in all of the Buddhist teachings there's a
wide spectrum of experiences, which they may start from very small
beginnings, and then they progressively deepen and
become more intense and profound.
The Buddha had many similes for Nibbana awakening, full liberation.
The supreme happiness, the supreme safety,
the supreme peace, and among others. And so one of these will
resonate more or less with each of us.
And in the meditation just now, we explored how when the mind becomes
settled, we could notice and take in the subtle
flavor of joy and well-being that can accompany the simplicity of being
fully present. And this is true in everyday life as
well. I'm sure you've had the experience of
maybe seeing dew drops in the morning shining in a
beautiful spider web. And if the mind is quiet enough and
present enough, wow, there is a feeling of joy
in just being there for that. And so the experience of joy
is perhaps the pivotal condition in this
liberative dependent arising. And there again with joy there is an
incredibly wide spectrum of really subtle joy
all the way to intense bliss. And they're all good
and they're all worth appreciating and cultivating.
So it's kind of amazing that just with the simplicity of
awareness, really being there for our experience,
subtle experiences of joy and well-being
arise quite naturally.
In these states of mind that give rise to the conditions
necessary for awakening in the scheme from dukkha
unsatisfactoriness being the first one, it's also the first noble truth
clearly seeing and appreciating the truth of dukkha
of unsatisfactoriness in this karmic samsaric world.
And the dharmic response to that is quite different from the karmic
response. And if we choose the dharmic response, it tends to be one of
confidence or faith that the path taught by the Buddha
is a good path to be on.
And when we have that confidence in the Eightfold Path,
it can easily give rise naturally to gladness.
We're glad to be on a path and we don't know how far we'll advance
but we do know that little by little
our dukkha diminishes.
So from gladness that's the condition that gives rise
to joy in this scheme of liberative dependent arising.
Concentration can also give rise to joy. Tranquility can give rise to joy.
And
what I'd like to suggest today is that when you have an experience of dharmic
joy, to really stop for it and notice it,
take it in. And just doing this will help you to
appreciate and cultivate the value of the state of mind,
which is joy. And it's valuable, as I said, whether it's
very subtle or whether it's very strong.
And then joy in turn leads us to tranquility and the condition of being
able to have a tranquil body and a tranquil mind
provides the fertile ground for contentment to arise. This is dukkha,
which is the opposite of dukkha, sometimes translated also as happiness.
But it's a much quieter happiness than the joy was. The joy is more
uplifting and happiness is more transversal.
And from this quiet contentment, that is the condition
that gives rise to samadhi. So all of these conditions up until
contentment can be cultivated. But from that point on,
we have to get out of the way. We have to become less of a doer and more
of just allowing samadhi to arise. So we invite
samadhi concentration or unification.
But we can't try to make it happen. If we do, it will certainly fail.
But if we do put in place these conditions of joy and tranquility and
contentment, then that implies that the mind
is already quite settled and samadhi then can
come to us and it comes as a gift.
We don't orchestrate it. You receive it.
And we could also say that samadhi is pivotal as well
in the sense that this condition of unification
is what gives rise to insight. This is where the mind is
together enough to really see through
the truth of dukkha. We really see it. We really know
we know it for ourselves. And we also know for ourselves
the truth of anicha, of impermanence, or as Gil says,
inconstancy. We see it as clear as day.
And we see as clear as day the truth of not self,
that anything that is conditioned is by definition
unsatisfactory in the sense that it's going to disappear.
And we can't rely upon it. And with these insights, that's what
sits in motion, the natural unfolding of awakening.
And the Buddha described it as water slowing downhill,
first in little rivulets and then tiny streams and bigger streams and
small rivers and then big rivers, and finally all the way to the
past ocean of nibbana.
And these steps, we don't cultivate either. They will
they will come with the benefit of insight,
just like the water rolling down the hill.
And these last steps are disenchantment, where we see through the fiction
that conditioned things can bring us happiness,
and dispassion, where we lose interest in pursuing the karmic stream,
and then cessation, and nibbana, and then the knowledge of nibbana.
So I'd like to just read you a poem from the Dhammapada
that kind of illustrates this dharmic joy.
Tasting the flavor of solitude and peace, one becomes free of distress and evil,
drinking in the flavor of dharma joy.
And then another one from the Dhammapada, one tense,
for a practitioner with a peaceful mind who enters an empty dwelling
and clearly sees the true dharma, there is superhuman joy.
So as you go through your day-to-day, if you like, you might try putting on a
bumper sticker, I stop for joy.
And see if you can experience it in different qualities from
subtle to perhaps more intense.
And then when you feel it, if you like on the inhale, try
radiating out this joy to all of the beings, human and other,
that you may come into contact with today.
Breathing in receptive awareness, breathing out,
radiating, peaceful joy.
