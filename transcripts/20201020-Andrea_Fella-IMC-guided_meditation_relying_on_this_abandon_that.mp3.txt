Allow yourself to arrive in your body. 
Allow all of our tendency towards mental activity that takes us into past and future. 
That can be released and planned just right here and right now in the body. 
In a gentle, simple way to connect sitting and knowing that you're sitting. 
Some of the Buddhist instructions are so simple. 
It is what is challenging is to continue to have a continuity of awareness. 
Just in this moment, sit and know that you're sitting. 
Breathe and know that you're breathing. 
Remembering to how relaxation supports this possibility of arriving. 
Relaxation supports the possibility of letting go of thoughts of past and future. 
Relaxation can bring a quiet and simple pleasantness into experience as the tension releases. 
That simple pleasantness can be something that allows us to let go of habitual holding to thoughts and views and worries and concerns. 
So exploring relaxation, letting the body relax as much as possible. 
And as this relaxation may happen as tension can release, you may notice some pleasantness there. 
It's okay to notice that pleasantness. 
Okay, to appreciate that pleasantness. 
There's a phrase in one of the Buddha's teachings, by relying on this abandonment. 
By relying on pleasure associated with wholesome intention. 
We can abandon habits of mind associated with unwholesome intention. 
Yet this relying on is not meant to be a clinging to, even though it sometimes can head in that direction. 
Let the Buddha keeps pointing to a more refined or subtle state that could be relied on to abandon. 
To abandon even the pleasantness of relaxation, for instance. 
We can rely perhaps on equanimity, balance of mind. 
And so, remembering the support of relaxation to arrive here in the present moment and receive experience. 
And as the body and mind do relax, perhaps some measure of relaxation, we can let go of that orientation and just explore being with whatever is arising. 
Allowing. 
And for you, for some, rather than having that allowing and receiving the broadly open, more of the open, choiceless awareness possibility. 
It can be useful for some to attune to a particular area of experience, which is the breath or just body, for instance. 
And allow receiving that area of experience. 
Not trying to look for what's there, but just what's naturally easily available in this body, but with this breath. 
Thank you.
