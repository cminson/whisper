 How does the path move from our protected exploration to from now until you die? That's one question. And I wonder if there's a hint of an answer in how you have engaged and how you have felt for the last six hours. What was it like? How is the not just remembering to, let's say, be mindful, but specifically where the mindfulness is of the path? Much wider than just, let's say, being mindful of, well, something I like to do is whenever I'm reaching for something, I like to have that be a moment of sati. It's helpful for me. But the path is a lot bigger than that. And did you notice anything supporting you in the last six hours? So I think I'll just start with that question, and the field is open for us to talk about it for a moment. You'd like to raise your hand and we can do it that way. How has the path been the last six hours? I want to thank you because I noticed I was in nature and nature asked nothing of me. We were together. And I was with two friends and I remembered that it wasn't important if they weren't on the same path I'm on. I guess it's a way to put it and had a delightful conversation. And I just might add that I think my primary purpose in my practice and how I'm living and purging possessions is to have a peaceful death. So you mentioned the path from here till death. It's kind of my purpose at this point in my life. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a classic function of a spiritual path, a religious path to prepare one for death. I don't know if any of you have seen the video of my speaking about my experience of nearly dying from renal failure after receiving a chemotherapy drug that I was allergic to. But it turns out I mean a very obscure modern research level drug that my body just had a very bad response to. And it didn't answer all my questions, but I certainly found that awareness went all the way down through minimal function. I won't comment on how far that was, how close that was to death, but it was certainly in that direction. And it was very encouraging, very encouraging. And it wasn't because I'm some kind of special heavy duty meditator. It was just observing the processes of body-mind. There was really no suffering. Of course, there was a lot of discomfort and pain and so on, but there was no suffering. So the news is from the frontiers that I've visited is very good. So in this last six hours, just doing whatever you had to do, taking walks or doing your shopping or taking care of your baby or whatever it was, what was the sense of path? Did you feel like you were, for example, in the middle of a, I guess we'll call this thing a retreat? Did you feel like something was going on that was just not your normal weekend or what? Nancy. Yes, thank you. I deeply appreciate being part of the texts that you were sending out. I have my best friend is stage four cancer and was admitted to the hospital with sepsis yesterday. And so I've been talking to her daughter and her husband and mostly listening and offering to do what I can to support them. But largely have felt like there's nothing for me to do. And so I did some normal weekend chores, but kept my friend in my heart and my thoughts. And the text message as I was getting more very helpful to me to keep me focused today. So I really appreciate that. Yeah, thank you. Judith. I'm trusting emergence because I don't know what I'm going to say. And I don't have anything profound to say. That's the best. I went also to the woods out for an hour back for an hour and something shifted coming back. Going out there was a pool, a still little pool and I thought, oh, there's a breeding ground for mosquitoes. And on the way back, I thought, oh, it's a still forest pool, which was, I think, one of our John Chas teachings. And I guess something slowed down on the way back because there were lots of little bridges over streams. And so there was like metaphoric things happening with the bridges and the path. And I started doing walking meditation when I came to a bridge. And there was something about the pace that allowed a fuller experience of the pause and relaxation and attunement. Yeah. It was always as though I came into my body more fully. So thank you for all the guidance. Colleen. For me is something that, Greg, you defined as Vibhara and not wanting to be part of somebody. It's part of my personality to avoid people. And so and my normal day to day does not have very many people. So there wasn't a way to come to practice. So I went in an errand and I thought myself a very smoothie on purpose. So I had to try to interact with some people. And I went in and ordered it and then sat outside and I had enough time where I can really sit. I mean, really come back into my body. And then I called my name to come back in pick up this movie and I did. I'm watching the theater in my brain. I thought, shit, I'm going. I don't have a defense. I don't what have a defense. And so I walked in and a young man who made my smoothie handed it to me and I purposely dropped my defense and looked at him and said, thank you. And he looked at me with his defenses down and we had a moment. We had a moment and I just breathe out and walked out. But for me, that's really different. I mean, that was really different. I hear you. I hear you. Thank you. And Sandra. Hi. I'm the main thing that has occurred for me is for the past 12 weeks, I've been in a caretaking situation first with being in hospice with my mother for two weeks and now caretaking my older sister and what I really became aware of is just the amount of tension in my body, the amount of tension, the little aches, the little pains. And I'm a person who doesn't live with any aches and pains normally. And so to have been these 12 weeks so shut off from all of that has been remarkable. Yesterday in the afternoon meditation, I became aware of just how, you know, scanning around. Wow, there's this and that and this and that. And I was like, wow. Anyway, so that's the main thing that I've gotten is the awareness, the body awareness. And I was cut off in traffic probably shortly after we finished the morning session session. I was trapped between a curb and this car that was moving into my life. And I was really nowhere to go. And I just was completely present. I just laid on the horn, maneuvered my car and nothing happened. Right. And when it was all over, I think I swore once but it was kind of like half hearted, you know, like I wasn't even that serious about it. And I didn't want to blame the person because she was moving into my lane. And then I thought, well, maybe I did a little bit of a hot dog move behind her and she couldn't see me, you know. And anyway, in other words, I allowed for other things to have possibly occurred instead of her just cutting me off. And my natural response would have been to, you know, attack. None of which happened. I just, I was like one of those animals, you know, like in the trauma, you know, an animal will just shake it off and then they're in the next moment. It was just like that. There was just nothing lingering. Great. And then I was walking right before we started. I had gone for a walk in the woods and it was raining. So I was walking with my umbrella. And I was thinking about what you said earlier about the inner and the outer. Is it, is it inner or is it outer or is it both? And I was listening specifically to raindrops hitting my umbrella. And I thought, okay, now is that inner is that outer because if I were deaf, I wouldn't hear that. So it's got to be a circuit of inner and outer. It's not just I'm not hearing that just because I have the ability to hear. And now and I don't even know if I mean, that was my interpretation in that moment and that awareness. But it seems like every time I come to one of these retreats, I realize just how shut down I've been, you know, and then I just immediately snap out of it. And then I feel how I like to feel. But there's some disconnect there that I just keep going off the deep end and then I have to come to, you know, a meeting or a retreat. And then I just snap back out of it. So that was a big awareness for me that, you know, my practices, like I don't have any practices, you know. Except, you know, eating a lot of sugar nowadays and swearing. Yeah, I appreciate the honesty, Sandra. Thank you. Thank you. You speak for part of all of us, I think. Yeah. Like to give us some time to reflect on where the path is going now. And I'll spend a little time before speaking about the aspect of insight dialogue where we directly address speaking and listening in meditation. Because it opens up a mode of practice where we are continually releasing or stepping out of habitual speech, which means the habitually instant virtually instantaneous connection between what we think and what we say. And in listening, the habitual move of thinking ahead of what the person's saying, as well as thinking somewhere else entirely, as we've talked about once before. And so where listen deeply and speak the truth come together is potentially when meditation ripens. It's at the very boundaries of language. Because how do we speak? What is it to speak? What is speech? What are words? So we take this for granted right now I'm speaking words and I'm a native English speaker. Perhaps you are native English speakers or you're at least your English is good enough to fluidly understand what I'm saying. And it just, wow, all this stuff goes by so quickly. But in meditation, perhaps you've experienced when mindfulness and enough samadhi develops, you can actually see more deeply into present moment experience. You see more refined features of the mind, of the body, of processes of change. Similarly, as the mind becomes more refined in insight dialogue meditation and we develop the capacity to bring speech into these more subtle observations, it involves a tuning internally, a listening internally to what might be said. To what's true is kind of the language of speak the truth. What are we going to say? And if it's the truth of experience in meditation, that's what is meant by truth. Because in meditation, it's about experience. It's not about worldly facts or something like that. So we pause, the contemplation comes to mind, which will be a contemplation about your very path. But we're talking about the meditation part of it right now. You pause, you bring the contemplation to the mind and that internal listening to say what's true, what do I speak, what do I let go? And the attuning to where's the truth in my thoughts, in the words going on in my mind like this, this, this, this. What's the truth as I sense it in the heart or in the belly? What's the truth that's, you might say, outside of or behind all of this kerfuffle that I'm making with the body mind? And can I sense into a kind of intuitive experience of what is ready to emerge? So we're in that attune to emergence aspect for the whole of our experience, like listening to what would come up here. And lots can come up. We can ask a question about the nature of our path right now. And lots of thoughts can come up, even lots of feelings without specific language on top of them, but lots of feelings. Lots of stuff can come up. That's there, but it doesn't have that truth power to be spoken. It's just sort of generated stuff that for whatever reason just isn't ripe. Or maybe it's something that feels like poignant, but you don't want to say it. Like you don't feel safe saying it or something like that. That's also not the truth then. Like speak the truth doesn't mean spill your guts. So if you don't want to say something, you just don't say it. You discern. That's the discernment aspect of speak the truth. Do I let this go or do I speak it? And sometimes you just remain in the silence waiting for something true to emerge. And in the best tradition of continuing to interrupt our habits of speech, even as we're speaking, pause again. Is this still true? So normally, we've talked about this once before, you start speaking and you kind of launch that thought and then you're kind of hanging on to the tail end of a rocket. That's just your thoughts and ideas. And you're just kind of, because we're so good with language, we can kind of keep producing verbiage. But we've lost the connection with what we're calling truth, meditative truth, truth of experience. And in the same way, I'm going to speak about listen deeply, which is a separate guideline, but obviously we're going to pair them here. Listening deeply, the quality of listening rises to the subtlety of speaking the truth. So this receptivity, the kind of emptiness, the attunement of listen deeply is just like speaking the truth. You're breaking the habits. Normally, we can receive those words so quickly, know what they mean. But now when we pause back into that emergence, back into listening deeply and receiving, there's a kind of like listening behind the sound. It's like listening to, let's say, have you ever been in nature and wanted to listen to the forest or just listen to the sea and you kind of go wide and you just get receptive and you just drop it and you just like, here's the sound coming in. It's like that. And as practice gets more subtle, the listening even becomes, you might say, energetic or the equivalent in the speaking, it's that intuitive aspect. You're listening with your intuition. And all of this is relational practice, right? So it's listen deeply and speak the truth, are meeting each other. So I'm going to offer some, like just before we drop into practice, I'll offer some instruction on speaking the truth and listening deeply. But right now, I'll speak about the contemplation, what we're going to talk about. Perhaps you've heard the, you know, the witticism, but it happens to be true, you know, when a system is not functioning well, whether it's a machine or a social group or a culture or something, it's like, well, we've created exactly the conditions necessary for that to come up. It's like if you wanted to recreate that, bring in all these conditions and it will create, it will look like this. So that's how our path is. The way we each experience our lives right now is the result of the conditions in our lives. It's just kind of obvious, but significant because what it implies or what it really demands of us is that we recognize that if there's an aspiration, if there's a sense of possibility of the peace or the joy or the profound goodness of a whole life path, conditions need to change. Something's got to change, you know what I'm saying? And what is that? What is that for you? Do you have a sense of possibility? A sense of perhaps being, if nothing else, intrigued or maybe even inspired to your capacity for a life that's imbued with that kind of that sweetness of the Dhamma. It's a sweetness of freedom, a sweetness of a life lived so with much richer in care and authenticity. I mean, life is still life. You're still going to have a body and it's still going to decay. Your interpersonal relationships will still be complex and some of them will be really difficult because that's how it works. But there's a movement of understanding the nature of suffering, its causes, and a sensing into the cooling of the frantic and intoxicated system. But what's going to change? So is there an inspiration, for example, to investigate path factors and play with them, do something with them, the way most of you have already, with mindfulness and probably with some samadhi? And I have no doubt that many of you have been giving thought to right speech and so on, you know, at different points in your Buddhist development. So what's the what's what's calls you on the path and do you feel, you know, what would it what will it be for you to meet it? So as you contemplate that, what in my life, what is the path inspiration and what might actually shift or change as I listen to that call, as I act on that call. As you contemplate this rather than just sit there and kind of have normal thought processes, work with this guideline quite intentionally, even offering yourself the language internally, speak the truth. So feel that sense of pause, the sati that comes up when you pause. Just relax, receive, allow, be in the, you know, notice the mindfulness internally and externally, the sense of open, attuning to emergence, not just with your partner and you know between you, but attune to the emergence of what your response is like the meditative detail of what might be known now. You can take time, you see, that's the beauty of this practice. You don't have to say a lot because a few words spoken as truth far more powerful than many words that are spoken from habit. So that's the place of discovery for us now, the place of possibility. And as your partner speaks, listening deeply now, you're receiving this Dhamma gift. You're receiving a kind of a message from the Dhamma space of your spiritual friends. Wow, what a privilege, right? How often does that happen? And what might you learn of like the nature of the path, the possibilities that you don't see that they do? And listening deeply into that receptive place where the words touch and meanings spring forth and the sense of what's being said touches your mind to mind, just like we are talking right now. So listen deeply, speak the truth. Gene, did you set up twos or threes? Twos, very good. And so you'll each have five minutes for the first speaker, five minutes for the second speaker, and ten minutes between you. That should be quite spacious. And the reason I'm naming that, specifically saying that, is because sometimes with speak the truth, the truth is silence, you know? Just take your time. You don't have to rush. Let your meditation practice move right through the listening and the speaking. And then when you're in the, you know, when you've released the form of taking turns and you're in, listen deeply, speak the truth together, that kind of vibrating, attuning to the emergence of who knows what is next. See what might be discovered about the nature of the path for you. So listening deeply, speak the truth. A frank acknowledgement of how life is so demanding and complex. How do we live a whole life path in this actual life? So I invite you to reflect with me on the six tenets that I've drawn from my experience of living this very question. And see how they feel to you. We'll touch each one of them briefly and sort of try to internalize it and see how it fits within this, your actual body, mind right now, you know? And the first is very simple and as you could imagine foundational, which is to ground in the Dhamma. Now, indirectly, I spoke about this earlier, perhaps you'll remember when I was saying, you know, we have all these ways of coping with life and that the Dhamma as a wisdom system stands outside the strategies that we've constructed to get by in life. So when we talk about grounding in the Dhamma, we're orienting ourselves by way of, well, it's a wisdom system that of course has been tested for 2500 years. And it's been applied to quite some depth by a lot of people, monastic and lay. And it has as its reference points, a very subtle, but not hidden understanding of the nature of the human dilemma, as we've spoken about, and the possibility of freedom. So ground in the Dhamma, do you have any sense of that? I mean, you've come to this particular talk, perhaps you participate in IMC and the community here that is hosting this. Perhaps you can sense into whatever's inspired you in the Dhamma in the past. But does it also give you this rootedness in a sense of possibility and path? Let's reflect on that for a moment. Does it call you? Does it inspire you? Do you trust that body of teachings such that you could say, yeah, I'll ground in the Dhamma. I, yeah, ground in the Dhamma. So the next tenet rests on that and says something very important about the nature of those teachings. And the tenet is engage all teachings as practices. So when we ground in the Dhamma, we're not just, let's say, listening to Dhamma talks or reading discourses and thinking, this is telling me something about the nature of life that's kind of good to know. What we're doing is we're taking all of those teachings, even those that would at first glance seem to be almost philosophical and we're taking them as practices. I'll give you some examples so you can ponder this for a moment. So we talked earlier about Anicca and Dukkha and Anatta, you know, about impermanence. Now, is the Buddha simply saying things are impermanent, you should know that. Or is the guidance, things are impermanent, stop and see for yourself. In other words, meditate, reflect on impermanence, observe it in your life. See what I'm saying? That's an example of a teaching being a practice, not just some sort of statement about things. The Four Noble Truths, these are practices. To practice with Dukkha is to observe experience through that lens and see what you see in actuality. Not take an abstract teaching, right? Observe your relationships, observe your mind. And the Second Noble Truth, Tannha, while it's kind of interesting that life is driven and pushed and hurt by hunger, by craving. But to really observe with that lens, to reflect, to watch your mind, to watch your life, to see where the hungers emerge in your relationships. And in your social engagement. So, Tannha, as a practice, and you already see a pattern here, that contemplation, reflection, meditation, you know, sincere conversation, these are converting teachings into practices. So we know how to do that. We know how to bring the teachings to life. So the whole life tenet, engage all the teachings as practices, dependent origination, the aggregates, the sense bases, all of it. So, sense into that. Does that feel true? Do you feel called to do so? Engage all the teachings as practices. And the next tenet, exclude no moment, no experience, no teaching. Everything is included. Exclude no moment, experience, or teaching. So sense into that for your life. You might ask yourself, what am I leaving out? Am I leaving out, let's say, my marriage, or am I leaving out my job? Am I leaving out money? Am I leaving out play or art? Am I leaving out the parts of my mind that I'm embarrassed about or that scare me? Am I leaving out some of my friendships, like they're not Buddhist, so when I'm with them, there's no path? You know, something like that. Is anything left out? Any moment? Is any experience left out? Is any teaching left out? If Buddhism is seen as just mindfulness, then you're leaving out a lot of teachings. You know, if the path is seen as, you know, this whole life thing, and these teachings, you come across something and it challenges you. You don't like it. What do you do? Toss it out? Do I have to honor truthful speech that much? I feel really challenged by, let's say, the Buddhist teaching on sense pleasures, and speaking of a certain austerity that comes from a time that was in itself entirely more austere than my privileged North American lifestyle. How do I feel about that? Well, no, I'll just skip that part. Or do I let it challenge me? I don't have to go ahead and sleep on a wooden pillow, but I have to realize that I sleep on a soft pillow and it's like, okay, that's part of my path. How is it part of my path? Or here's another one for you. Rebirth. Ooh, very controversial, very intimidating for a lot of people. Hmm. I think I'll leave it out. Or I can't say I believe it, but I'm not going to reject it. I'm going to let it sit here in my throat and challenge me. So no teachings left out. No moment, no circumstance. This left out. Nothing's excluded. Let's sit with that for a moment. Let your mind range across your life. And the fourth tenet. Find each teaching in the here and now. So not only is it not putting off our access to direct experience, but it's looking at the teachings, whatever they may be, and saying, of this teaching, where do I find it alive? This moment. You understand that even if you come upon something like, let's say, some really subtle teaching on Samadhi, that you don't say, oh, I don't get it. No, the effort, the attitude of the whole life path is to find what you can of that teaching alive now. Maybe it's just a fragrance in the wind. Maybe you have not embodied some degree of a very subtle teaching. Or maybe it's something, let's say, on the nature of the aggregates or paticasamapada, dependent origination, where it's like consciousness rising and vanishing every moment. Nice idea. But I don't get it. Or what can I get of it? And you sort of allow yourself to come close, come near, sense into rising and vanishing of consciousness in each moment. How do I sense that? What can I sense of that? That's the attitude of with every teaching you encounter. Nothing is entirely beyond your direct human experience. Some things are very subtle. So we just listen for them, find what truth we can. So I'll repeat this now again and give you a moment to sense into it. Find each teaching in the here and now. Find the living truth of it. And the fifth tenet of the whole life path, let all the teachings in fully. Another way of saying this is like no arm's length Buddhism. Just let it all into the body, let it all into the heart, even if it's challenging, even if it's difficult. Even if compassion for all beings is like, wow, that's a lot, that's a big ask. Or the power of giving. I don't want to let that one in because that means I might have to give more. I don't really want to let it in, let it do its work. Or even something like impermanence. Wow, do I have to let that in all the way? Or whatever it may be. The nature of conceit, the Buddhist teachings on conceit. Or on being easily, being easily receiving criticism well, letting it in all the way. All of these teachings, just letting them in all the way. And it might be something as simple as the nature of meditation, you know. And there's a teaching, let's say, on internal, external, in both, or rising and vanishing for mindfulness. Or it could be something, a teaching on a practice of samadhi. And can I really absorb and let it touch me? Or something like, you see where the Buddha's example of caring for a monk with dysentery. Do I have to let that in all the way? Does that mean that I might be called to that level of care and compassion and touching filthy things, smelling bad smells. Because I'm acting out of compassion, am I going to let that in all the way? And here's the biggest one. The third noble truth. Is it really possible? This awakening. Can I let it in all the way? So the tenet, I'll let be silent now for a moment. Let all the teachings in fully. And finally, the sixth tenet, the whole life path. Engage the teachings individually. In relationship and socially. So talk about nothing being left out. This means your brother and your sister. It means if your mom and dad are alive or you have children. It means your work relationships. Your relationships within a Dhamma community certainly. The person at the store. The person on the road who pushes your car up against a curb. But socially as well. Leaving nothing out of not only the field of compassion, but to really know the Buddha's teachings for example on Kama, cause and effect. And to sense that part of this vibrating web of cause and effect that expands out through our relationships to the whole of humankind. That's quite a path. Sensing the individual nature of the body mind, the island universe as Aldous Huxley called it. The unknowable inner world that you have that I will never know, no one will ever know and that everything about the living experience is also relationally conditioned and unfolding in relationship. In the web of society. The path is all of it. To sit with that now engage the teachings individually in relationship and socially. So I'd like to invite you into back into insight dialogue to explore these. Six tenants. And what I'd like to suggest is that we if it's okay gene form groups of four. You have time for that. Okay. There might be some groups of three. But you know what, it doesn't matter. We're not going to take turns now. This is just the actual let your practice support you with the four of you or sometimes the three of you together. Speak the truth should leave lots of space. Listen deeply. And now you're going to be hearing from three Buddha friends, you know, three wise speakers three, three people who are letting these teachings touch them and are sharing what's emergent. What a gift. What a beautiful gift. And what I'll do is I'll read these six tenets again then they'll go out in the broadcast. So if you want to see them. And the reflection is how do you feel called what's of these tenets what's inspiring you what it touches you. It's okay to name also what might seem intimidating or something. But really since you know, these are not demands these are sort of attitudes. There's no demand that you do these things. They're more like, you know, to inspire a sense of how the path can be alive all the time. And how do you respond to that? How does that feel possible? Does it feel enticing? Does it, you know, there's any particular tenant or any two of them really call to you. Just like any path factor. Does it call to you. Having your practice support you listening deeply, speaking the truth and now all all state the six tenets, and then we'll go into our breakouts ground in the Dharma. Engage all the teachings as practices. Exclude no moment experience or teaching. Find each teaching in the here and now. Let all the teachings in fully. Engage the teachings individually in relationship and socially. Listening deeply, speaking the truth with your spiritual friends. I didn't say anything about duration, did I? Yeah, that's what I was going to say. So I'll just tell you. Yeah, 15 minutes. Okay, Chris, there's a room with three if you if you would like to go here, there's a room of rage. Room number five. You said it was open dialogue entirely. You're muted. Sorry. Maybe we could talk a little bit about next steps. And one of the things that I'd like to emphasize as a might you might say a closing thought is the Buddha's clear, I would say, insistence, his statement that spiritual friendship is the whole of the holy life. That's not part of the holy life. It's the whole of the holy life. And from a specific, you know, what we can take out of that is one who has good friends can be expected to fulfill the noble Eightfold Path. Quite specific. And, you know, if you imagine being alone in this, the first thing you'd have to imagine is that you don't even know there's this path is possible. The nature of meditation, the nature of freedom, the nature of suffering, the nature of the mind, the nature of the human dilemma, and all the specific path factors, and all that stuff. You know it because of spiritual friendships. Right. Friendships with teachers, the movement of the voice of another through the printed discourses, and your wise attention to those, and podcasts, and so on and so forth. Those are all relationships. But that's not all. If you could imagine not having anyone to talk to about it, not having anyone reflect back to you, or encourage you, not having the opportunity to help others to be reminded of your dark spots. It's not pleasant sometimes. Have no one to whom you could practice giving. Wow. It'd be pretty hard to cultivate that open-handedness, that self-effacement of giving if you had no one to give to. And if you want to be more specific, no one to go on retreats with, not just the teachers, no other, no one to sit with or do walking meditation with. It's a bleak image. I don't want to actually go any further with it. It's so bleak. But that's not how it is. We have resources. And the nature of our friendships just has an enormous influence on our path of awakening, our path of compassion, our path of freedom. So what does that mean to you specifically? How are you going to engage whatever has touched you here with the support of others? Or do you just want to kind of go home and just be with some notes or the book or listening to the talks again or something like that, and just try and do it all by yourself? That sounds like so much work to me. Sounds a little bit almost alienating to me also, I'll have to admit. But that's maybe just me. But then I look at the discourses and I see that throughout the discourse is what you're seeing is the Buddha teaching in a relational way. You see the friendship among his disciples, if you want to call them that. You see the building up, the development of a Sangha. Why? Why did the Buddha want the headache of a Sangha? And there's plenty of stories of the headache of the Sangha too. Because it's essential. What has carried the teachings for the last 2,500 years, the Sangha, of course. So there's a real difference, you know, if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. It's like that. You want to go far, go together. So what does that mean to you? To any of us when we contemplate our next steps on the whole life path? The nature of our friendships. If we're hanging out with people who are, let's say, doing a lot of drinking or drugs, people who are completely obsessed with media absorption, it's going to influence us. If we're with people who are rough or who lie a lot or who are, let's say, biased racially or have gender biases or are insensitive to their economic privilege, that's going to affect us. So how do we, you know, have the courage to, say, make the changes in that department? That's a rough one sometimes, but it's also incredibly inspiring. Because the other side of that is that good friendships just make the path like so much more, so much more ease and so much more joy. It becomes really workable. So with that in mind, I'll mention a few resources and you can see what inspires you and maybe I think I'll just begin with since this retreat is offered in the context and by the hosting of the Insight Meditation Center and the whole community of IMC. There's a long-standing history of offering not only Dhamma teachings generally and meditation teachings like up at the retreat center, but also specifically Eightfold Path teachings. And Chris, who's been with us and hosting us today, is a excellent resource for that. So you have it locally, which is fantastic. The insight dialogue community, if you wish to further your development of insight dialogue practice, filling in that place where all of the path is engaged relationally as well as socially and individually, but for Sati and Samadhi, mindfulness and Samadhi, practicing relationally, insight dialogue is one of your few options actually. It's a well-developed practice that's been, you know, it's not 2000 years old, but it's been tested. And you can see in the discourses plenty of dialogues that look like that very much so. They're just name not named that way and they don't have guidelines. But there's something very ancient about settling together into silence and speaking in such a way that the silence isn't broken. And as it says, the Dhamma, the Dhamma talk just flows on, cycles on. So if you go to insight dialogue dot org, there's plenty of stuff there. And there are whole life teachings there. And I'm very happy to let you know that the whole life path workbook, which contains a lot of material that I couldn't fit into the whole life path book, mostly practices. You know, literally the book was twice the size. So that all came out and has been reformed and added to and crafted beautifully by a team of intelligent, committed, sensitive people. And that should be out available hopefully in the fall. And it's all freely offered. Just, you know, go to insight dialogue dot org. And, you know, it'll be announced to that mailing list and so on. But if specifically regarding insight dialogue, if that's touched you, there are insight dialogue groups offered out of insight dialogue community IDC. And there's introductions to insight dialogue that, you know, walk you through the guidelines quite skillfully. And then there's some occasional insight dialogue retreats online. And when life gets back to normal, there will be more insight dialogue in person retreats, which I can recommend with the whole of my heart. These are potentially very transformative, inspiring experiences of meditation with others. Quite profound. And yeah, you know, we're really near the end of our time here. And I'm wondering, Jean, is there anything that you think I should mention? Not that I can think of. We will be sending Chris will be sending a follow up email at the end. Okay, great. Thanks, Jean. And I would like to thank you, Chris, for all your support. You've been a really wonderful host, really skillful. Thanks to you, of course, Jean. And thanks to IMC, to the whole community. It's my sincere hope that there's something, something that's been offered here. That's useful that follows on. Yeah, my class. All right. And so I'll pause. Is there anything before I close with loving kindness sharing merit? Is there anything else, Chris, that is needed from the organization? I don't think so. We'll just collect all the information that we've wanted to share with you and send it out in the final email, including the links for Donna, a link for follow up questions and so forth. And a lot of you have asked for some time to connect with each other. So I'm willing to hang out for a little while and open up chat when we're finished here and we can chat to each other if you want to do that. That's great. And you anticipated my parting words, Chris, which is if you can leave this circumstance we have here with even one person to practice with, a practice partner, then it will really help keep the path alive. Do anything you can to connive, cajole, whatever is necessary to, you know. And of course you may have a practice partner elsewhere that you can share this stuff with and just do it that way. But here you've had people who have had some of this particular experience, which might be helpful. So I'm glad you'll facilitate that, Chris. Thanks. So in closing, again to remember the, you know, there's a gift of the Dhamma and there's a great fortune, great good fortune that we have access to it. And a great good fortune that we have worldly conditions that support us to reflect, that support us to spend time in meditation, that give us opportunities to meet spiritual friends and receive teachings that give us the safety, the food that we need, the clothing, the shelter. Tremendous, I mean, as was said by Deepa Ma, we are knee deep in grace. The great good fortune that we often don't even see. And to reflect on that both with joy and compassion for those beings who don't have the safety or the food, who don't have the shelter, the clothing, the time, the health, and beings who don't have access to the teachings. They can have plenty of privilege and not necessarily understand the nature of suffering or the possibility of the cessation. Wow. So may they be also free. May all beings without exception, every type of consciousness throughout the universe above and below, left and right, forward and back without exception. May all beings be free from suffering. May all beings share in the merits of our practice. May it flow through us and outward unbounded. May all beings be free. May there be peace. May there be peace. May there be peace. Thank you, friends. You may feel free to unmute and say your goodbyes and Chris said she'll stay for a while and help whatever happened happen. So thanks a lot. Thank you. Thank you for the teaching.
