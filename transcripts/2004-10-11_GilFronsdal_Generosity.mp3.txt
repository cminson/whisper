 Last week, last Monday, I talked about the paramees, the perfections, and introduced the idea. And then this, last Friday we had the first, the Dharma practice days on the paramees and we explored the paramee, the perfection of generosity a little bit. And I'd like to parallel, complement all these today by talking about, giving a talk about the paramee of generosity, of DhanƒÅ. And then as we go through the year of the paramees and these Dharma practice days on Fridays, then maybe the Monday after or some Monday near that Friday, I'll give a talk on that particular perfection, that particular virtue that's very important in Buddhism. So today it's the virtue of generosity. And generosity is quite a beautiful virtue and practice. Generosity. Generosity, it can be seen as the first Buddhist virtue that is often said that the Buddhist path traditionally begins with generosity. If you follow the instructions that the Buddha gave for how to develop the path of practice, a path of liberation, a person would start with generosity. In offering, suggesting that generosity is an important Buddhist virtue, I think it's important to remember that probably most spiritual traditions place generosity as a very important virtue, a very important practice. And I think you probably find great sermons or great teachings in all the different religions about the value, the beauty, about giving, having a generous heart. And I'm quite impressed by that current of American culture that puts a lot of emphasis on generosity, on generosity of supporting nonprofits and all kinds of things. And there's a very strong spirit of volunteerism in America that I think in certain currents of American culture, it's quite beautiful. And so it's kind of embedded, I think, in kind of the, I don't know what to say, in the American cultural idealism, the ideal of American culture, that the importance of generosity being a service, contributing to society, being part of one's neighborhood and community. So Buddhism, you know, emphasizes this as much as anybody else. What makes the teaching of generosity look perhaps a little different in Buddhism is that Buddhism also understands that generosity can be a support, a foundation, an aid for the spiritual path itself, leading to, leading to liberation. And so the paramese, the perfections, is talking about generosity from the point of view at how it serves liberation, how it serves liberation and compassion and action in the world. The Buddhist virtue of generosity, generosity is often called dana or chaga, poly words. And when it's taught often in Thailand and Burma, places like that, it's taught a lot over and over and over again. And it's kind of the first virtue that Thai Burmese children are taught as they're growing up. Very common things, monks come walking in the streets and you make offerings to them. You go to the temple and make offerings. The importance of being generous if people come to your house. But often when it's taught, it's not taught in its connection to liberation. It's taught because it's a basic important human value and that it promotes social harmony, social connections, promotes friendship, it says in the classic text, and it promotes a good heart and it creates lots of good merit. Or to say it in ways maybe a little bit more understandable, it creates good karma for a person. And getting good karma was understood to be very important for a lot of lay people, for everybody, for lay people and monastics. But classically in the old days, there was a division in Buddhism between the Buddhism of lay people and the Buddhism of the monastics. And it wasn't a hard and fast division between the two, but there was kind of a division and that division still continues to some degree in Southeast Asia. There's a kind of Buddhism for monastics and a Buddhism for lay people. And the Buddhism for lay people is primarily a Buddhism of karma, of trying to take care of one's karma, improve one's karma, create good karma conditions for this lifetime and for future lifetimes. And if it's not for yourself, then it's for your parents often. And so it's not uncommon for Thai, especially men, to go spend a period of time as a monk or a nun for women when they're young. It's kind of like in some countries, they have obligatory military service. In Thailand, they don't have obligatory monastic service, but it's really common and kind of expected among some Thai culture for young men when they're about between 18 and 20 or so to go spend three months in a monastery as a monk. And women do it also. And sometimes I know I was told, I asked some women why you're here and they said, oh, the reason we come to the monastery is that if a man has gotten trained as a monk for three months, they make really good husbands. So they're there to kind of meet their partner. But if you ask other people, some of these men that I didn't ask everybody, but the men I asked, why were you studying? Why were you doing these three months as a monk? They said, oh, to create good karma for my parents, to help them out. I feel a lot of gratitude to them. They raised me, they brought me into this world. And I want to ensure their happiness in this lifetime and in future lifetimes, because classically, Buddhists believe in many rebirths. And a layperson is going to continue being reborn time and again for a long time. They're not thinking about ending rebirth. They're just thinking about how to improve their rebirth so it gets better and better. So the Buddhism of lay people tends to be very karmically focused. They're trying to create good karma. And generosity is one of the really good ways, or the primary ways in which they do that. Generosity and ethics, trying to live ethically. And so you find in Thailand, people make a lot of donations to places where they're karmically beneficial to make donations. Often that's to the monasteries, to monks, to all kinds of situations. Sometimes it seems like it just gets out of hand because the monks have some, occasionally in Thailand you find this huge, gaudy temples. They have gold and marble and all, out in the street there's poverty. And then people come with their donations and make donations to the temple. And the temple builds even more gold, marble, rooms or whatever. And it just seems kind of absurd to keep giving money to monastics institution that way. But it's understood in this karmic Sahaja Buddhism that you want to give to that place where it's most karmically beneficial to give. So sometimes again it lends itself this absurdity of offering donations to people who don't need it. When I was in Thailand, my first time I was in a very poor temple and I was just practicing. It was really great to be the recipient of the generosity of Thai people and Thai culture and Thai temples and just go there and just practice. I first retreat was 10 weeks long and I wasn't asked for a penny. There was even any hint or expectation that I was expected to pay anything from my time there. And I was given a little cut, a little kutti to live in and I was given food. But the food I was given was the monks would go out for alms every morning. They'd go walking in the streets and they'd come back with all this food they'd been given. They'd deliver that food to the kitchen and the kitchen would distribute it at lunchtime. So we would all kind of eat lunch kind of together. And sometimes when I was sitting there meditating in my little hut early in the morning someone would come over and bring me some breakfast. So sometimes I had breakfast early in the morning. And once I got this can of tuna, you know, some monk or someone came along they got in it probably in their morning alms rounds and they wanted to support me, encouraged me in my practice. So they came and brought me some American tuna made in the USA it said. And then it said in big letters for international aid only. And I was getting it. And it seemed a little bit odd. I mean you could kind of, you know, I don't know how it ended up there but what I could imagine is some person, probably some poor person was given it. And out of their generosity and spirit of wanting to give and support the monastics had given this to a monk. It was probably quite beautiful. And the monk had needed the monk had passed it on to me. So that was how it got to me. And it's quite inspiring to be in countries like Thailand and Burma where the spirit of generosity is so strong. I was blown away over and over again. And the sense of gratitude that I had from the generosity fueled my practice really encouraged me. You know, it got to a point where I felt like I had to really do well in my meditation practice. I had to really apply myself well, engage well, not be lazy and you know, really apply myself well. Because I was so grateful for what these people had done to support me to be there. And I really wanted to kind of live up to their confidence in me, their support in me and their donations to me. And it was beautiful to feel that inspiration, that fuel from that gratitude. When I was in Burma, there's a Burmese story, I don't know if it's true, about an Englishman, I think maybe a hundred years ago or something, a long time ago, who went, he didn't know, he thought he was eating at a restaurant until he asked for the bill. And then he found out he was at someone's home. He just walked in, he walked in and he walked in and sure, what would you like? And it's a story makes sense in the way that there's such an outpouring of generosity in Burma people. They're just so happy to, you know, what I saw there, to give and support people. And so when I was in Burma, you know, I felt like I was the guest of the state, the guest of the country. It's a very poor country. And again, you know, coming from this affluent country here, and nothing was asked of me financially at all. I lived there for eight months and I think I maybe spent $20 the whole time, eight months I was there. You know, mostly I spent a little bit of money the first day I got there and a little bit of money the last three days I was there. But in between I spent no money at all. And everything I needed, I really needed was supplied for me by the monastery and the people who wanted to support me in practice. And the best doctors, some of the best doctors in Burma would come and visit us in the monastery from medical, from medical schools and things. If we had medical needs, I was sitting meditating one day, minding my own business as you do a meditation, right? And sitting clearly still, and then suddenly a cavity just dropped in my mouth. It was a very strange feeling. And so I went to my teacher and said this cavity fell out and he said, oh, okay. And the next day there was a dentist. He looked at me and said, oh, it's fine. Just, you know, you don't have to do anything because it's just only part of the cavity, the corner of the cavity, the filling fell out. The cabin fell out, the filling fell out, right? And the filling fell out. So you see a tremendous spirit of generosity. People are trained and taught in Buddhist Asia to have this spirit of generosity in everything they do. But the, but the, kind of the, the philosophical background for that kind of generosity among lay people, if you kind of push them a little bit, you know, why it has a lot to do with karma, creating good karma. The monastic side of Buddhist religion in Asia is focusing much more on liberation. And classically in the old days, it wasn't, people didn't feel that lay people could pursue liberation. That was something that was not possible. It was too difficult and it was reserved for monastics. And monastics are the ones who would meditate a lot. Monastics are the ones who would do the kind of practices that are conducive to taste liberation. And what's happened in Asia is in the last 60, 70 years, in the last 100 years, is that the, the divide between lay Buddhism and monastic Buddhism has begun to dissolve. And now there's a lot of lay people that have begun meditating in countries like Burma and Thailand. And in Thailand, in Burma, they have hundreds and hundreds of lay meditation centers and people will go now to lay people will go to meditation centers on their holidays. You know, they have two week holiday, they go meditate in the monastery. I remember there was an Easter, Easter time Easter, but spring break when I was, I was this very big monastery in outside of Rangoon. And mostly I was left alone in a little corner of the monastery, I practiced by myself, but I'd have to come out of my little corner to have my meal once a day or to go to the teacher's little house for the talks we got. And during a spring break, there was like 5000 people meditating in this monastery. Isn't that something? You know, it's kind of a powerhouse. There was this, there was this, there was there was this women's meditation hall that I got that I witnessed. There were 500 women meditating in this one hall all at once at the same time. It was one of the great sites of my life. You know, that was a real powerhouse boy, so much dignity. And so now, now the divide is kind of, you know, beginning to dissolve. And you find a lot of people pursuing the path of liberation. The teachings on generosity, having to do liber with liberation are a little different than the teaching generosity having to do with karma. And with with teaching on karma, the focus is what creates the best karma, the most karma. The teaching on liberation is what is it that's most conducive for liberation, for freedom. And so that's the interesting question then is how is it that the practice of generosity supports us in developing a spiritual life that is about liberation, with developing compassion? What does generosity have to do with liberation? What is generosity have to do with compassion, cultivating and learning and developing it? Shouldn't generosity be altruistic with no concern for oneself? Just give, give, give without any thought about oneself. The Buddha in his teaching, illuminated different reasons why people might want to be generous. And the highest reason he gave was a little odd expression. He called it, to, he said it's to adorn the mind. And adorning the mind by the tradition is understood to create those beautiful qualities of the mind that support meditation practice. So to help, to help get the mind calm, rested in a cell, resting on itself, concentrated, stable, mindful, insightful, create these qualities of mind that allow the mind to penetrate into that, into that realm of liberation or freedom. If the mind is really agitated for word all the time, we're thinking about the future a lot, thinking about the past a lot. If we're consumed with greed, if we're consumed with hate or fear, the mind is going to be clouded in such a way that it can't see through to that realm, that reality of liberation or freedom. And part of the function of generosity is to begin clarifying the mind and the heart. So those clouds begin falling away. And you can see it very directly in that in order to be able, in order to give generously, in order to be generous in a way that's spiritually healthy, there has to be a letting go, a relinquishment. If you're still holding on, then it's not very helpful, the giving. But giving involves kind of letting something go. And letting go is a beautiful quality of the mind. A mind that begins letting go is a mind that begins becoming clear and light, expansive, spacious, open. A mind which doesn't want to let go, which is holding on, sticking, fixated, is a mind which is tight, claustrophobic, constricted, painful. So the movement of generosity is one that is beginning to massage how we hold on, how we cling, so that we begin letting go and train ourselves to let go in the mind, in the heart. So some people love to practice generosity because of that quality of, you know, it kind of helps with letting go, letting go, letting go, letting go. That opening of the mind, the clarity of the mind. It's one of the most beautiful qualities of the mind, is a mind which has no clinging. It's very hard sometimes to appreciate because most people want something in their life. They want, you know, there's always things we want. We want a relationship, we want money, we want a house, we want a better work schedule, we want a better this, we want to, you know, we want things. But non-clinging is not a thing. And so sometimes the beauty of non-clinging is lost to a mind which is always interested in out there in things. Give me more things, where are the things? But to turn the attention around, all the way around into the mind, into that place that's kind of non-thing centered, that part of the mind which has a capacity of not being fixated, not being focused on something, opens the mind up to a place of tremendous spaciousness, tremendous ease, tremendous peace. The mind which is fixated on things will find no peace. But the mind which can turn, the awareness can turn around in a sense and find that place of non-clinging will find infinite peace. So generosity is the beginning of this training of letting go. The Buddha said that, he taught letting go, I don't know if the Buddha said this, but it's said in the tradition that generosity is taught as the first practice for Buddhists because it's the easiest to do. Is that true? I don't know if it's easiest for most people, but I think the idea about it being easiest is that it's an activity which is relatively coarse. You know, you can kind of do it with your body. It's kind of like you kind of do something. You can offer your time and help someone. You can offer your skills and help someone. You can go shopping for a neighbor. You can offer some money to a homeless. You can make a donation to a good cause. You can do something and that's a lot easier to do something physical like that in a sense than it is to watch the subtleties of the mind or to cultivate forgiveness or to cultivate compassion. Those are much harder to cultivate these inner qualities, but to do something physical is something we can do. And so it's said to be the easiest place to start. As we start with something that's supposed to be easy, something gross, kind of physical in the world, it's the first area of developing mindfulness. In order to cultivate generosity in the world, we have to be somewhat mindful. We have to cultivate. If we want our generosity to help us on the path to liberation, we have to pay attention while we're generous. Who's this person I'm giving to? Who's this person I'm helping out? What happens to me when I try to offer myself, offer some part of me in this act of generosity? Do I feel afraid? Oh, I can't do that. You know, it'd be nice to offer something to that person, but maybe the person is going to ask something more of me and I can't get to open that door. The person keep asking for more. Or maybe the person think I'm, you know, trying to get something. And so the people are going to misunderstand why I want to give. Or maybe I just love my security. I feel insecure if I give. There's all these attitudes that come into play when we're up against the edge of wanting to give, give generously. It's interesting that it's usually understood that the word generous, giving generously implies giving beyond what's expected. If you're giving what's expected, I don't know if it's generous, but generosity involves one person is distinguished. Generosity is when we give part of ourselves. If you don't give part of yourselves, then the recipient might feel resentful or feel like there's pity or kind of one-upmanship going on. But if we offer some of ourself in the giving, which means we have to extend ourselves or stretch ourselves a little bit, then, you know, it's, you know, we're not someone holding ourselves separate from that person. There's a caring there, there's a connection there that goes on. So mindfulness is one of the easiest places. I mean, generosity is meant to be one of the first places to cultivate mindfulness, to develop the mindfulness practice. And some of you have probably tried to be mindful on the cushion. And you probably are successful for two or three breaths. And then it takes a while to come back, some of you, if you're new, especially. It's kind of hard to develop the mindfulness on the cushion. It's said to be a lot easier to do with these gross activity of how we are in the world of other people. So generosity is one of the first areas. The second area then is our ethical behavior with other people, how we talk to people, how we steal, you know, how we kill, you know, how we do these things. So you start taking care of our ethics. That's supposed to be a lot easier also than sitting and trying to quiet oneself in meditation. As a person cultivates generosity, the Buddhist ideal is that the generosity is supposed to bring joy. It's said that there should be joy before one gives, while one gives, and after one gives. If there's no joy in the giving, then don't give. So there's no moral imperative that thou shalt give, you know, it's your duty to give, obligation to give. But if you see the value of giving, of being generous, of having generous heart for yourself, and the joy that it produces, then it becomes more and more natural to give. And I was really surprised when I was in Asia that the tremendous joy in which people were generous to me, or generous to the people around them. They were smiling and laughing, they just couldn't, they were kind of sometimes they were kind of like almost kind of joyfully kind of competing exactly who can give the most, but who can get there first, you know, let me do it, I'd like to do it. So joy, and joy is one of those inner qualities that supports the path to liberation. In the Buddhist understanding of the path, there is no, unless there's happiness and joy, there's no way of succeeding in the path to liberation. And so the Buddha offered then generosity as a so called easy practice to cultivate, to do, because that's a place then to generate joy. And what that means is a person has to take the time to appreciate what they've done. This is great. Wow. I did this great thing. I should be really happy. I have my sons really into Legos these days, big time Lego fan. And I see him how he provided me his but he's a little Lego piece and he puts them all day long puts them in, you know, and I feel this joy and wanted to go out and buy him another little Lego piece, the whole thing, you know, I can feel joy, the light, I feel delighted by the very idea of coming home and giving him this little piece of leather. I haven't done it yet. But, but I just, but you know, I just this idea of it, you know, delighted. Now, I know sometimes that I know my parents bought big gifts that I really wanted as a kid. And they might my after a day, they were long forgotten. So I don't know if their joy lasted very much longer than they realized that I lost interest very quickly. But, but to have joy in the act of giving, and if there's no joy, then the mindfulness practice is to look why what's going on there? Perhaps there's good reason not to not to feel joy in a particular act of giving, maybe it's the wrong person to give to the wrong time, wrong kind of way of giving. Or maybe there's something really interesting about your psyche to learn. Maybe you feel oh, there's a tremendous amount of fear connected to giving, or embarrassment, or all kinds of things, what's going on there? So generosity as part of the path of practice is used to cultivate these qualities that are needed for liberation. Mindfulness, joy. A third thing is cultivating healthy relationships to people around you. The path to liberation is best done if our relationships are caring and healthy in the world around us. And generosity is something we usually do towards others. You can be generous to yourself, but mostly I think we think of it as something we do towards others. And if we try to develop joy in those relationships, and mindfulness in that activity, then a certain sensitivity to our connectedness to others gets cultivating and developed in that act of generosity. It's interesting that the Buddha advised that people when they make acts of generosity, of giving, that they do it with their own hands. That they can give people directly. And here in this modern world, we can't always do that because we often want to give to organizations which are far away and we send in a letter or something. But the city of giving personally, yesterday I was told by someone that she's fallen on love, maybe it's too strong a word. She really now is really hot on a website called FreeCycle. You heard about FreeCycle? I never heard of it until yesterday. They have one in Palo Alto, various places. And FreeCycle is a website. If you have something you want to give away, you put it there on the website and someone wants that, they call you up and they come and get it. And she said that it's really great because then the people come to her house or wherever to pick it up and there's this personal connection to someone. And the person is grateful. You know the person really wants it and the person is grateful for it and they thank you and she feels all this joy for having been part of this kind of exchange. If she take the same thing and send it to the good will, there wouldn't be that personal connection. That sense of joy wouldn't be there. The gratitude and the feeling someone's gratitude and the whole exchange, that connection to human being is missing if you kind of just put it in the goodwill box and off it goes. And she said yesterday, she said, oh and often when people send things to goodwill, what they're really after is a tax deduction. You know it's not really about you know generosity sometimes or the empty their closet, you know some convenient way of getting rid of things that they don't want anymore. You know it's not necessarily completely the spirit of generosity to just you know a convenient way of emptying your closet. But when someone actually comes and meets someone in person and you hand something to them, then there's this joy that's this relationship of joy, this cultivation of joy. It's probably too ambitious of a statement or too idealistic or naive. But to point out that we have a now epidemic of depressed people. That's not naive. But I wonder if at least some of the of this depression people are feeling might be helped a little bit if people cultivate and adopted a practice of generosity and did it in a way that brought joy. Maybe by doing things directly, going helping someone directly and feeling their gratitude and their appreciation of what you've done. I know that there was a woman who came back from, there's a woman I knew who had developed a lot of very serious psychological problems. She'd been a long time Buddhist practitioner and she developed these psychological difficulties and she couldn't meditate anymore. She went to her Buddhist teacher and she told him, you know, what can I do now? I can't really meditate. And the teacher said, oh, you should be practicing generosity. So she started practicing generosity every chance she could. And in that practice of generosity, she started feeling better and better. I mean, she didn't get cured. She had to do many years of psychotherapy to get helped, but it really made a difference for her. Something she could do, something that brought happiness, it lightened her up a little bit. It helped her out. One of the odd things about the Buddhist teachings on generosity, odd for me or odd for Westerners, I think, is that the benefits of giving relate to the person that you give to or the cause that you give to, or you have to call it if you do service for help out or something. So say you have a dollar and you give it to someone who goes out and buys alcohol. One more time they drink or buy cigarettes. Well, it may be nice, you know, person feels connected to someone and is supported and it's nice the person was lonely and they feel someone cares for them. Maybe it's been that maybe it has some benefit. You take a same dollar and someone is going to take that and they're going to, you know, they're going to, you know, say they went out and bought a pad of paper that they needed. Because they had a pad of paper, they were able to write the draft for their entrance essay for college and they got accepted. And they came back to you, you know, some months later and said, you know, that dollar you gave me, I bought this paper, that paper I was able to write this essay. And, you know, some guy comes back to you two months later and says, you know, what I did with that dollar was I bought some alcohol. I drank it that day. You know, it was okay, you know, but some guy comes up, some person comes back, you know, two months later and says, you know, I wrote this essay on that piece of paper, you know, and it was so grateful because I didn't have paper. You came exactly the right time. Then you'd have those joy. They would come later. Joy would come, it might come over and over again. I have things I've done for people that were very small, but were very significant for them. And I still feel happy when I think about it 15, 20 years later. Wow, that was really nice. So this, the Buddha has encouraged us to have some discernment about where the generosity goes. If what we want to do is to maximize the adornment of the mind. So to give where we have confidence, he said, and to give in such a way that it brings joy, the biggest joy. The difficulty with his teaching is that sometimes then people ignore the people who need it the most because, and you know, I think, oh, it brings me a lot of joy to go support, like in Thailand, to support the monks, but the monks don't need anything anymore. Some of them. And right outside the monastery, there's beggars who are starving or people are starving. And so it seems a little odd then that kind of, that kind of way it's understood. But, but I think it's well worth kind of considering this Buddhist teaching that look for the joy, cultivate the joy. And if there are people who really need it, maybe it has to do not so much about avoiding them for someone else, but learning how to give, you'd be generous so that we find the joy in that activity. Where's the joy? The theory in Buddhism is that generosity helps calm the mind, helps make the mind soft, open, not sticky, not contracted, not constricted, kind of expansive. And that expansive, open, relaxed, soft mind is a mind that will go into meditation a lot easier. A mind, a heart that's practiced generosity and really feels connected to the people that we're supporting is probably also a mind or heart that's beginning to feel it, feel empathy or compassion towards those people. And compassion is one of the very important motivators for following the path of liberation all the way. It's very hard for people to have the enough motivation to really follow it, what the Buddha was talking about, all the way to the end. Some people can do it without too much compassion, but it's really hard to follow it all the way. Sooner or later, if we don't understand that we're practicing for the sake of others also, then it's impossible to keep practicing. So the idea that the practice we do is a generous act also. That we're not only cultivating our inner well-being for ourselves, but we're doing it because it makes a difference to the people we encounter. It helps them, it supports them. I learned this very clearly in my very beginning years of practice when I practiced in a, I was living in Davis, and there was a small little sitting group that met twice a week, I think Monday and Thursday evenings. And there were three, four, five of us would show up for this little sitting group. And it made a real difference if someone didn't show up. If we all showed up, then it was a quorum, enough people. You could feel that there was a spirit then of concentration, of support and stillness that was there by the group practicing together. And so I often felt, I wanted to go not just for my own sake, but it was an act of supporting other people in their practice. It wasn't just about me. So generosity, I think, is kind of a giving of oneself. It's a kind of a self-sacrifice of sorts. And so ensures that practice is not selfish. But the odd thing about generosity is that self-giving, giving of ourselves, giving up ourselves in a sense to give, is a form of self-development. Isn't that a great paradox? You can develop yourself spiritually by giving away, giving up yourself. Surrendering yourself in healthy ways serves you. It helps liberate ourselves. Giving up selfishness, being selfless more, is a way of finding the self. This is a wonderful paradox in practice, or seeming paradox, that is kind of counterintuitive. We think that by giving up self-concern, a certain kind of self-concern, it gives us back some of the most precious things a human being can have. So when the Buddha talked about adorning the mind as the highest purpose for generosity, I think he was playing this paradox also. That if you really give yourself over, you get in return so much. And that, I think, is very common teaching in a lot of religions that I've encountered where they talk about generosity. They talk about this wonderful circle, by giving we receive. And perhaps, as is often said in many places, that the giver often receives more than the receiver. And the more thoroughly we give, perhaps the more we get. It requires mindfulness. It requires care and attention that is joyful. And it requires wisdom, to know that it's wise, the kind of giving. You don't want to just give blindly and naively. And those qualities, mindfulness, joy, wisdom, are all factors that help a person on the path to liberation. So anyway, I hope that was okay. I hope I wasn't preaching too much. If I was, I apologize. And I love it. Generosity is just so great. So generosity as a perfection, as a paramee, is that form of generosity that moves us on the path to liberation. May all of you move along that path. Thank you.
