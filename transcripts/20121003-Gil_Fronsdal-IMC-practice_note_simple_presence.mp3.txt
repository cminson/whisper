The w ords about practice that might be useful for you 
today are , “” It’s always a good idea to keep in mind that 
mindfulness practice is supposed to be simple. It’s 
meant to be simple presence, simple attention to what’s 
going on.  
 
Keep that in mind with whatever you are doing: s itting 
here and being with your breath , or doing walking 
meditation and paying attention to your feet as you walk  
back and forth .  
 
Whatever you are doing , you might ask , “Is what I’m are 
doing simple? Is it possible to simplify what I do, so that 
there’s a simpler presence in the present moment? ”  
 
I like to think of simple as  being an open -handed , open -
minded, open -hearted  way to know what’s happening.  
Maybe that’s enough . See  what it’s like to just be sim ple 
with what is , as it is.  
 
I hope you enjoy your morning.
