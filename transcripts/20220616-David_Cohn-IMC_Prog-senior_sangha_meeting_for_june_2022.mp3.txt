So welcome our our good friends. It's so nice to see all of you. See back, see you
back here again. Familiar faces. So today I thought we would work with self-compassion
and not in a way to fabricate self-compassion, to create self-compassion,
but more to recognize that we already are self-compassionate. We already are
compassionate. We already have this quality. It's part of who we are. It's
continuing this exploration of our own natural inner goodness. I find it so kind
of comforting and reassuring that I don't have to really do anything other
than just be myself, but get in touch with my deeper self. And it's all good.
It's all more than good. Essentially, you're Buddha. Essentially, you are awake 24-7.
The light is on. Your light is on. You don't have to light it. You don't have to
keep flipping the switch. And we have this intrinsic quality that we want to
be happy. We want to be content. We want to be peaceful. That's why we're here
today, looking for this, being this, relaxing in this. That's why we meditate.
We want to feel ease and peace and well-being within ourselves. It's just a
very natural quality that's always with us. And the reverse side of this desire
has kind of a bad connotation in Buddhism, but this is very healthy,
wholesome desire to want to be happy. And the reverse side of it is, it's like two
sides of the same coin, is we just naturally respond to suffering with
compassion. We don't want to suffer. We surround suffering that we experience
with a heart full of compassion. I was walking down the street with with
Robert about a week ago and there were some dogs on the street and they were
engaging with each other. It looked like they were playing. But then all of a
sudden this dog started screaming, yelping, and he wouldn't stop. He was
injured in that fight and he was lying down and his masters were hovering over
him and trying to comfort him. And I think everyone, I'll just say that everyone
in that street that heard that, their hearts were responding with compassion.
So when we suffer, sufferings from the past that we've been immersed in,
vivid memories of some of those sufferings,
we get very entangled with the event of the past and the faces and the
circumstances and the problem. And how could I have fixed this problem and how,
you know, trying to work it out, work it out, work it out, bring preoccupied with
the problem and being preoccupied with the pain and how can I get out of this
problem or pain? Or the same thing for the future. You might have some anxiety
over something that's going to be happening in the future or dread.
What can I do to fix this? Some people are upset about what the stock market is
doing these days and really concerned about their future safety. So if we go
underneath that, the pain, underneath, first of all, the cognitive that wanting
to fix, wanting to work it out and then go and experience, like we experienced
the pain of that dog experience, the pain of our own suffering, and then go
underneath that and experience the shift to compassion. Just the natural shift if
we allow ourselves to experience the pain and allow ourselves to experience
that shift in perspective. That we don't want to suffer. We don't want this pain.
We don't want this stress. We want to be free from it. It's who we are. It's just
natural. So the important thing here, we can use the phrase. It's very helpful to
use the phrase sometimes. May I be free from this suffering? May I be liberated
from this suffering and from the causes of this suffering? It can be useful not
to create compassion but to recognize it, to key us in to what's already here,
what's already in you. So let's try this out in meditation.
And just to begin with, just relax and come home.
Come home to your body. Maybe take a couple of deep breaths, if you like.
And relax the shoulders. Sometimes it's helpful to calm the mind by putting your
attention below the navel or the base of your spine to bring the thinking mind
down. And sometimes it's helpful at the end of the exhale, the release of the
exhale. To not take the inhale right away, just let it rest there for a little
bit, not an uncomfortably long time, but at the end of the exhale, there's often a
quiet, open space.
And maybe letting your attention move further down into your legs.
In your feet.
And if your mind goes off into some thoughts that's perfectly natural,
Be gentle with yourself and just allow it to come back.
You're already back.
Now, if you could check in how we're feeling right now.
Is there some tension or some stress in your body or some problem that's kind of looming
in your life?
Just finding some, sorry, some problem, some expectation of the future or some problem from
the past, some unresolved problem from the past.
Take out one.
Rather than mentally stewing over it, allow yourself to feel.
Feel the strain.
Whatever you're feeling it in your body, pressure, the heat, it may simply be that you're irritated
because your mind's going off, it could be some problem of low self-esteem, doubt, self-doubt,
anger, shame, guilt.
Rather than figuring out who's right and who's wrong or what you should have done or what
you're going to do, just feel it.
Feel the pain or the stress or the discomfort in any way for this experience.
And then let's go even deeper and shifting the perspective to compassion.
You don't want to feel this way, you don't want to have problems like this or have these
negative feelings, you want to be free from them.
You want this for yourself.
Let your heart's natural response to your own suffering be this compassion.
relax into this natural love and compassion that you have.
It doesn't have to be a particular feeling, just an intention, a motivation, it could
be a feeling, it may help to key into the phrase, may I be free from this suffering
and the causes of this suffering to help you recognize this powerful, wonderful quality
that you have, that we all have.
This quality gives us confidence, it allows us to connect with others.
Just that we can be ourselves and that we can extend this wish to others when we feel
it, when we recognize it in ourselves.
We naturally want that dog to be free from suffering.
Our partners, our friends, grandchildren, children, everybody suffers, it's the first
noble truth in Sanskrit, it's called dukkha.
Everybody has this edgy dissatisfaction.
Not enough, I'm not enough, or you're not enough.
Everyone transcends all of that.
May we all abide in compassion.
Maybe think about what you're going to be doing today, and your small group will be
coming up next.
And when you leave this group and go about your business, go about your day, you can
spend your day in freedom going underneath the everyday dukkha, which is inevitably going
to take place, going underneath it, into something that's more true to who you are.
This compassion, this compassion, this loving kindness has no limitations, it's boundless,
it's infinite, it radiates in all the ten directions.
May our experience of compassion now radiate in the ten directions and help all beings
proliferate out and help not only myself but help my loved ones and my friends and people
who appear in my life today and all the suffering beings throughout the world, so many suffering
beings, may they feel the benefit of my compassion, and may they know their own compassion, their
own goodness, their own freedom, okay, thank you.
So all we can look at each other in all these warm hearts, nice to see these warm hearts.
So I had some suggestions, one suggestion that you could talk about in your small group
was how was this for you, do you recognize this in yourself, how was your experience,
do you recognize this quality beneath the strain, beneath the suffering, you might think,
whoa, I don't see that, I always see this anger, and then maybe talk about with each
other how do you practice with your suffering, maybe this is a new practice for you, or maybe
you've been practicing compassion for many years, share with each other about that, how
do you find ease and peace and well-being when you're in difficult situations, challenging
situations, problems, and how is this different from self-pity, how is compassion different?
So let's go into small groups now, if that's okay, Joe, are you ready, let's go 20 minutes
and groups of I think four to five would be nice, okay, I'm ready, okay, we'll enjoy
your discussion, hi there, so how was your discussion, beautiful, went by quickly, yeah,
that's when you're having fun, well tell us some things that you talked about it, share
I'll jump in because our group was so rich and we talked about anybody want to volunteer
to summarize and nobody does, but I will always have an opportunity to talk, I'll take it,
and just know that I cannot possibly, as you know, you guys know, your groups are just
so full of wisdom and shared ponderings, so we had gosh, so many different views as we
circled the questions and one person came up with meta being such a powerful tool for
self-judgment for negativity in general, just simple, easy phrases, repetition, so powerful.
Another person shared some books, especially Kristen Neff's Fierce Compassion being very
valuable as an exploration of this topic, how to water that garden of compassion, another
person shared about a strong emotion coming up and staying with it, staying open, not
turning away, and another teacher talks about compassion actually being a verb and there
was a couple, there was an image about compassion being kind of an upward spiral and self pity
sort of being a downward spiral. Anyway, I'll leave it at that wonderful group.
Thank you, Jeannie. Go ahead. As usual, oops. Okay. Well, maybe you go ahead and then Jeannie,
you can come next. Frida, go ahead. Okay. In my group, as usual, we all felt very similar
ways and each of us had a different way of being, bringing more compassion to ourselves
and that was the big talk that we could offer compassion to others, but turning it around
and showing compassion to ourselves was a little bit harder and so we all agreed about
that and then we felt very happy that we knew we weren't alone.
So you have something to work on. Good. Okay, Jeannie.
Well, we had a couple of people in our group who were really suffering and so we did talk
about self compassion as being kind of harder to maybe get a sense of then, you know, compassion
in general to others and the idea of the difference between compassion and pity and pity being
putting some, the other person down, lowering them and another idea was seeing that the
other person when they're suffering, they had, have confidence in them that they, they'll
come out the way that it's supposed to be for them. Maybe I'm not saying it very well,
but, you know, to see them as, instead of like, if you feel too much sorrow or something
when someone else is hurting, that it impairs you as a compassion being.
Yeah. It's very helpful to see their Buddha too. They, they have, they have their own
compassion to see the compassion in them and they'll find their way through their own inner
goodness. They have, just like you, they have their own inner goodness so we can have faith
in them. Yeah. Just yeah. Thank you. Not to see their problems, but to see their compassion.
Yeah, please. I, I can't see your name. You had your hand waving. I'd like to.
Catherine. Catherine. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I think in my group, we connected on many different levels
and two of the things that come to mind are the importance of doing this practice
and self-compassion and how that has really helped, helped us. And another one was cat
and how wonderful it's been to have a cat. Somehow they're compassionate.
Yeah. That's all I wanted to say. Thank you. Good. Thank you.
This is great to hear these.
Please go ahead. We had a very, we had also a very rich discussion. It's just such a pleasure
to talk to people and on this, this kind of a level. I think we all agreed to that.
And we discussed the different ways that we can be compassionate to ourselves.
First of all, it would be noticing that we're off or that we're hurting.
And then, and then sometimes this could be meditating, stopping, saying,
message to yourself. We also looked at other ways of going for a walk on the ocean or just walking
and seeing people or making a phone call to somebody that you would enjoy talking to,
that there are a multitude of ways that we can be compassionate towards ourselves.
Great. And every time that you're compassionate, recognize it. Recognize that in yourself.
And by recognizing it, you're automatically cultivating it.
And the phrases help, too. May I be free from suffering?
Yeah. Areza?
Areza, did you want to say something? Oh, I thought you raised your hand.
Yeah, please, Susan.
I'm sorry, I think I got your name wrong. That's okay. Catherine, again.
Catherine, okay. I just wanted to say that it really does work that when you're suffering,
you really look at it in a different way. And to really feel compassionate and feel love for
yourself really does help. It really does put the suffering at bay. The suffering goes away.
It gets much, much less. It goes into the background. And it's really a way of practicing self-love,
I think. Great. Yeah, it's shifting to a whole different perspective.
It's like instead of really hurting yourself, because we're hurting ourselves with our
jealousy, with our pride, with our competitiveness, with our comparisons, with our self-esteem issues,
with our putting ourselves, we're hurting ourselves. And it's just a completely different
perspective to actually hug ourselves, to hold ourselves, and abide in that
hug. Hugs feel good, and we don't have to stop hugging.
And the problems, the negativity will
say, well, they'll vanish. They'll, like, you know, waves that rise, these big waves that rise,
and these waves are kind of beneficial in a way. I mean, the waves are ocean, they're water,
but the waves can point out who we are when we respond to the wave of the anger of fear,
this big wave that comes up when we can respond to it from the ocean.
Our awareness of our compassion, our awareness of our awareness of our love becomes stronger and
stronger. So we can actually use negative states. This is kind of a revolutionary idea
for me. We can use negative states, the strength, the strength of emotions,
to keep us in to our goodness, to the power and beauty of our own goodness.
Well, thank you all so much for these wonderful shares, for all your wisdom,
all your kindness and goodness. So let's take a 10-minute break, and
if you can try to come back promptly, because Robert has some words of wisdom waiting for you,
and I can't see the time. Joe, do you have the time exactly?
It's 12 o'clock right now, David.
Okay, so yeah, so if you could please come back at 12.10, and Robert has some
wonderful treats ready for you.
If you're going to come back, then please don't leave the meeting.
That way you'll stay in the same breakout room.
So please show yourself. Yeah, if you've come back so we know that you're here.
Good. So as I begin here, I just want to beg your forgiveness,
because I've been plagued with a cough that's not because I'm sick, it's just chronic,
and it flares up, and it's been giving me hell the last few days. So I hope this doesn't
end up with me coughing my brains out here. So welcome back, and
it's a delight as always to be here with you, and I'm seeing some of you looking very serious,
and some of you looking less serious, so it's nice. Life is good, I guess.
So I miss the benefit of listening to what David was offering you, but he filled me in a little bit,
and so I want to, first of all, to thank you, David, and thank you for having me come
to these sessions to do them with you. So I want to begin this portion of our time together with
a poem. I think I've read this poem in this group before, but it's a beautiful poem, and
if you didn't hear it, you'll be hearing it for the first time, but it's a poem about finding an
anchor within ourselves that we can sort of go to for refuge, and it goes like this. It's
titled For Old Age, and it's by the famous Irish poet who's no longer with us, John O'Donoghue.
It says, May the light of your soul mind you. May all of your worries and anxiousness about your age
be transfigured. May you be given wisdom for the eyes of your soul to see this as a time
of gracious harvesting. May you have the passion to heal what has hurt you and allow it to come
closer and become one with you. May you have great dignity and sense how free you are. And above all,
may you be given the wonderful gift of meeting the eternal light that is within you. May you be
blessed, and may you find a wonderful love for yourself. May you be blessed, and may you find
a wonderful love for yourself. So I love that poem, and it has a lot to do with not only finding
an anchor within ourselves, but finding a place where we can meet ourselves with
conscious intention of kindness. So I was listening to some of the responses in the group sharing when
I came in to the session a little bit later, and I see that there's so much wisdom in this group,
and people were talking a little bit about the challenge of being self-compassionate,
the loveliness of it and the wonder of it, but also the challenge of it. So
one of the ways that I think about it, and maybe some of you have
think about this as well, is that compassion comes as a movement of the heart, a movement of love
in response to difficulties or moments of stress or suffering within ourselves or within other
people. So a simple way to think about suffering is any moment when we're in contention in any way
at all, in any degree at all, with the way things are for us in that moment, when we want things to
be other than the way we're actually experiencing them. Now, I would be dishonest if I said I
didn't encounter many moments like that throughout my day, where I wish the things were different
in the way that they really were unfolding, and I might not even know that that's what's happening.
It might be just an experience, but when you stop and think about it, whenever we're pushing or
resisting what's happening, when we want it to be different than it actually is, and when we're
and when we're judging it in a way that it lands like this is like a real moment of resistance,
we are suffering. And this is true for everyone, just as it's true for us.
So this business about self-compassion being difficult, being more difficult than offering
compassion to other people, this is actually true. Studies have actually shown that this is true for
most people. But the form of compassion that is the most difficult, ironically, is to receive
compassion from other people. When we're suffering and people are trying to be kind or generous or
offer us kindness, many times we say, oh, don't, it's nothing, I'll take care of it or whatever.
And so what we do is we sort of diminish our own suffering. And there could be many reasons
that we do that. It could be culture. We learn that we're supposed to think of other people
before we think of ourselves or if we're wanting kindness for ourselves, we're somehow being selfish
or something like that. So there's many, many reasons why we feel this way. But what's actually
happening is that we're blocking the quality of receptivity within ourselves. We're shutting
ourselves off to this kindness as though we somehow don't deserve it. In a way, we're
abandoning ourselves at the very moment when we need kindness to touch us, to sue this in some way.
So this quality of receptivity, I want to point this out because it's this quality of receptivity
that comes into play when we're trying to consciously offer self-compassion to ourselves.
So I've defined suffering as a moment in time when things are other than the way we wish they
were or we would prefer them to be. And in that moment, that would be a moment for self-compassion
to arise. However, for a lot of people, myself included, in moments like that, I might be
triggered or I might be flooded. I might be feeling overwhelmed or hopeless or angry or
upset. I might be disconnected from my ability to actually recognize I'm suffering. In other
words, I might be reacting to whatever is going on. And in that moment, I'm not actually able to
address my own suffering effectively. So I might try all of these different wonderful
ways to be kind to myself. I might say, okay, I need a cup of tea or I need to go sit in the
garden or I need to go throw up. I'm too old to be throwing basketballs, but to be doing
shooting hoops, I might need to do something kind for myself. But all of those things
might not work in that moment. In other moments, they might work perfectly. But in this moment
where I'm triggered, they might not work at all. Or I might try to do a compassion meditation for
myself. You see, may I be free from this suffering, may this etc. etc. And they're just words that
I'm saying to myself because I'm actually caught. I'm caught by my reactivity. I'm caught by not
not seeing clearly. And and and through that clarity being able to find the kind of anchor or
refuge where I can feel safe for a moment. So this quality of receptivity is one of my theories
on the way on the reason why self compassion feels so difficult for most people, for many people.
And that is that when we try to offer ourselves kindness, may I be free from suffering?
May I enjoy this cup of tea or this hot bath or shower? You see, we we've cultivated a habit of
not being receptive to that when other people are offering it to us.
And therefore we don't know what it feels like when we offer it to ourselves.
You see, when we're offering real kindness to ourselves, or when we need to offer real kindness
to ourselves, we don't know how to receive the kindness. We block the kindness off. So this
thing is getting in the way of us actually being able, this habit is getting in the way of us
actually being able to connect with this quality, this natural quality of compassion,
which is an expression of love. Now, you know, it's not like we can't promote compassion,
but we can't make ourselves be compassionate. We can create the conditions in which compassion
can arise because it's there naturally. But we can't create it on demand, especially when we're
upset. And when we're upset is when we need it the most, you see. And so this is a dilemma that
we all face as human beings. So having said that, I want to just, I want to go through a real quick
little visualization with you. And then maybe we can talk about it.
I'm looking at my clock and I'm saying, oh my goodness, I'm going on like I have an hour
to talk here and I don't. So, but what I'd like you to do is I'd just like you to
close your eyes for a moment and let me walk you through something or guide you through something
that really takes more time. But I hope that you can sort of get into the feeling of this. So
in this moment, I invite you to settle down into this guided reflection and allow whatever is
being known in your own direct experience, just allow it to be there. It doesn't have to be any
certain way. And take a nice deep breath in through your nostrils and when you're ready, exhale it
through your mouth and just savor the awareness of letting go of relaxing, of releasing,
of a moment of not needing to do anything or hold on to anything, you can just relax
into your own direct experience. And you can notice that you might
be experiencing a flow of thinking, a flow of thoughts or emotions. All of this is completely
normal. You're hearing sounds, feelings, sensations.
You might even be aware of attitudes and states of mind.
So I'm going to invite you in this flow to notice obvious contact points, the chair that you're sitting
on, the quality of being supported by that chair of feeling safe, not even questioning it.
This is a quality of support. We can be receptive to the awareness of support in the sense of safety
that that brings. So just connect with the embodied experience and the direct knowing
of support or of being grounded and stable and safe.
This receptivity of support or this quality of support is a direct, it's a preverbal way of
knowing. This is the awareness of what it's like to feel anchored and safe. An anchor is a place
or an object that you can return to at any time to connect or reconnect to the awareness of warmth
or of stability or of safety. It's there all the time, just like compassion is there all the time.
In one way of connecting to this place is to find an anchor for yourself. It could be your breath,
it could be the mental image of a place in nature, an experience. So sense into how it feels
when you identify with an anchor or when you find an anchor.
And when you do, I invite you to call up from memory or imagine a situation or a time
when you are going through a rough patch or were caught up in the throes of some kind of personal
loss. It could be the losses associated with age, aging, or it could be some event that has happened.
And sense into how that feels and how much you truly want to be free from the suffering
that you yourself are going through. The contention that you're feeling, how you want to be free of
that feeling. You have the psychological tools and emotional intelligence to imagine the possibility
of finding a way out of that suffering, your own suffering in this very moment. You have a practice,
you have a religious or a spiritual tradition that you can call on for support. You do have the
tools and the emotional intelligence to claim your agency. And as you think about this,
feel into the wholesomeness of your own desire, your own deep wish to be free from suffering
and to relieve your own suffering. Allow yourself to sense into and rest in that felt experience
of your wish. Wisdom lies in observing your own state of mind.
Wisdom lies in knowing that you have the capacity and the ability to be with yourself
in these kinds of moments where you need yourself most.
So allow yourself to simply feel into this deep wish that you and I and everyone in the world
shares to be free from suffering, to be happy, to find an anchor where we can feel warmth and
stability and safety and deal with whatever challenges come our way.
We all forget this when we get flooded or triggered or reactive.
So I'm going to end this little exercise
repeating that wisdom lies in observing the activity of our own minds
and trusting in our own capacity and agency to be with ourselves in those moments.
So take another nice deep breath in and exhale through your mouth and whenever you're ready you
can open your eyes and rejoin this circle of friends and this lovely sangha that we've created here.
So I'm just going to ask a question. I don't have time to put you into a breakout room
but I'm just going to ask a question and see if we can get a response or two.
But how did you find your anchor and did you find an anchor and did it help you reconnect
with that sense of safety that I was referring to?
So that's one question and the other question would be
what was it like to be with and clearly see that experience of reactivity or that moment
when we're flooded or triggered without pushing it away or rejecting its reality?
So those are two questions that I am offering to you that I would have offered in a breakout room
and I've already given you some idea of what happens for me so I would be curious and delighted
to hear what you might have to say for yourself what your experience might have been or might be.
Or anything about what I said in the lead up to the actual exercise?
I really appreciated the guided meditations for deep boughs and for me the anchor is
body-based like feet and earth or sit bones in the chair and sometimes I was pondering that
when I don't have that awareness I can reorient to something in nature
or something with more space like bird sounds or shape and form and color of a flower.
Yeah and when there's deep duke gardening with awareness or surfing is pretty rich so deep
boughs thank you. Thank you Michael. And when you are able to do that or when any of us are able
to do that ponder whether you can get in touch with this feeling this quality of receptivity that
I was talking about because it's when we are not overwhelmed by whatever is triggering us or
the deep duke or the minor duke when we're not overwhelmed by that at that moment we
have created the conditions in which we can be receptive to this quality of warmth and stability
and anchoring once again. So time for one more before I turn it over if someone
I'm trying to look around the screen if anyone wants to say anything.
Janet was raising her hand. Who is I'm sorry. Janet I saw Janet raise her hand.
Okay Janet and I saw Trish raise her hand too I think. Trisha yeah Janet go ahead.
I just I really liked what you were talking about about it's very hard to take in that
compliment or if someone is giving me compassion or that's when I when you mentioned it and I
thought about the times when there has been you know people are trying to help me it's
very hard for me to let that in and you saying it's just a habit that just kind of clicked
with me because it's a it's a habit of behavior it's just a habit of behavior and if you can
if you can just take it in in the moment instead of just letting it be a habit and an automatic
like I change the subject Robert if someone starts doing that to me I'll change the subject
yeah and I just I just realized that that's a habit and it has no basis in reality at all it's
just it's like brushing my teeth in the morning or something so that's that's amazing so thank
you I really appreciate that you're welcome and it's a completely your response is completely
normal we we do this all the time we just do this all the time you see people are trying to be kind
and generous and we say no no no it's all right it's like we diminish ourselves in some way we
block and and we block off their generosity we're not only doing it to ourselves we're
teaching one another how to do that hi Trisha you have the last word okay I just I just wanted to
say that the your definition of suffering seeing it as any moment when we're in contention with
the way things are I think that is really helpful in the first step I could see for me in stepping
out of the reactivity stepping out of the you know overwhelm of and the flooding seeing it as that
sounds really useful and helpful so thank you yes you're welcome I I spent some time in a
monastery and one of the teachers used to say no preferences no problems
no preferences no problems I thought that was a brilliant teaching so thank you all for
for your sharing your comments for receiving me so generously and I'm going to turn it back to
David now so and I'm going to turn it over to Bernadette Bernadette is a longtime practitioner
and Fiona is visiting her her son and daughter and grandchildren in Los Angeles so Bernadette's
stepping in for her today so welcome Bernadette thank you so much thank you very much
for the opportunity to put my voice into the fabric of the song and I'd like to share with you
I want to work with my time like right Robert did here what self-compassion feels and looks
like to me as I'm continued to journey through the gateway of grief and maybe something can
add on today to what's already been said so my life changed entirely six months ago when my husband
died suddenly and he had been chronically ill for a long time and we lived with that
chronicity didn't know how or when he knew his death was on the near horizon and but we just
didn't know when it would come and gratefully he died in his own bed no COVID or ICU I was grateful
for that he didn't want that he died just before winter solstice and the onset of the coldest
December on record up here I live up near the Canadian border he wouldn't have wanted to live
through that either so he died just as Putin attacked Ukraine and as a Vietnam vet with
severe PTSD I'm grateful he missed that invasion he was tired of war in his body and he was tired
of war in the world so a little of what I'd like to share is my perspective on our discussion today
about self-compassion I have been rereading the book by Stephen Levine who was a well-known
hospice teacher worked with Kubler Ross in the 80s and one of the last books that he wrote was a
book entitled unten unattended sorrow and he described very much what I felt what my experience
was he said in the acute grief and the sorrow of loss the inconceivable tragedy of this moment of
death it feels like a stabbing sensation in the body in the mind it slams shut the heart
and leaves exposed only raw emotions it leaves very little space for anything but the sorrow
the anger the fear and the doubt that go along with it well given our 46 years together and
how we were one another's primary reference point in our daily lives of our partnership I felt pretty
paralyzed and those words stabbed in the heart pretty much say at all so the 24 seven light of
my own goodness seemed to go out it was like a total eclipse of the sun and this tightening
inside my body and my being became a new edge of my practice another teacher told me one time when
I was going through a really tight place in my life he told me to just sit down when the storm
came so I've been a practitioner for many years but being in this downpour of this monsoon felt
beyond my capacity to endure I could not find my breath you know Robert was talking about
anchor breath has always been my anchor I couldn't find my breath it's as though it was stuck somewhere
in my body frozen I cried I cried through most of my meditating time and I still do so I just
continue to sit with Kleenex and I carry Kleenex on every pocket and the rains continue to come
um I have known the role of caregiver and caretaker of other people most of my very privileged life
and as a partner to a person with extensive medical issues for many decades um as a mother
of three children and as someone who worked a lot of my professional life in the hospice field
I knew caregiving of others I knew that playbook backward and forward I knew what to do the morning
my husband died I knew the 9-11 drill and I knew what would follow I knew that drill really well
but that edge that I encountered of overwhelm uh brought me to a new question that's what
what do I need right now and what does self-care and self-compassion look for look like for me
right now and I brailed my way into this question it felt like an impossible question
each moment of each day felt like one big contraction and I wondered at times if that
question was self-pity disguised as self-compassion I was very bewildered with that but self-pity is
easy and it's automatic and self-compassion is very challenging in these dark moments
Stephen Levine in this book unattended sorrow talks about um he talks about how we construct
in these moments a labyrinth defense and a moat around our heart to allow some semblance of safety
for our grieving and Robert talked about safety safety totally eluded me I didn't know how to get
out of my own labyrinth that I had built I didn't know what safety was so I needed a map to get
from my living room to the kitchen that's how bewildered I was so one morning I took out an
eight by eleven blank piece of paper and I wrote the question at the top what do I need and in
the days and the weeks that followed I filled things out on the list on that paper some of them
I'll read pause slow down let the tears come when they come get off trains to nowhere trust where I
am right now keep things simple don't pick up anything heavy feel my feet on the floor lay
down on the floor and stretch go outside look at the sky listen to music stare out the window
just stare out the window do what needs to be done in small doses sing chant walk read
stroke the dog's fur let her take care of you let others take care of you cook and eat nourishing
food listen to the Dharma take a nap call someone I trust sit try to find your breath be still
so when I look at this list now and I just passed the six months part six month passage of
my husband's death his name was Terry he's not a his I look at this list and I think wow
this is a list for any day of my life this is a list I can come back to again and again
because it's a list of self-compassion so to breathe fully in and out and be connected
with breath as my anchor feels remarkably miraculous right now breath is my teacher
without it I'm lost in that labyrinth I'm off riding trains to nowhere so in the shock of
the days and the weeks and the months after Terry's death and my breath felt so stuck up in my chest
well it's moving again there's more space and there's more ease with breath I imagine people
I can't imagine people in all places and all times everywhere in the world who live every day
all day long with their breath stuck high in their chest their bodies tense their hearts broken
some days are really difficult and I know it's likely to be that way for a while
the waves of expansion and contraction come and they go I don't know when the contractions come
but they come and some days it's all I can do to put one foot in front of the other blow my nose
I do think often of the Ukrainian people and families of gun violence victims
all my fellow human beings everywhere in deep sorrow and I in deep sorrow trying to hold it
all my own suffering the world's suffering and I remember it's the practice and the more I work
with it the more my heart is able to hold it so asking what I can do to care for myself in the
middle of my own suffering became my co-on my puzzle I kept returning to the question
how can I care for myself how can I tend my own heart and my own suffering
and so my response to this question of what I need how can I be kind is my way of living the
Buddha way following the path as best I can right now I vow again and again to take refuge in Buddha
Dharma and Sangha even when I feel clueless what that means in the moment I do it again and again
I chant the vows and I take step after step when I go for a walk in the woods where I live
I recite my Zen vows to do no harm to do good to practice with all beings I vow to make space for
pain and grief I vow not to sink into despair or be consumed by sorrow I vow to turn toward it again
and again right now grief is my call to keep practicing and it begins with self-compassion
this I see my pain the pain our pain is valid grief is valid our culture drowns in unmet pain
we are taught to turn away and distrust ourselves it's a scary thing to a lot of people in this
culture and in other cultures we as a culture are so far removed and so ignorant of our own
collective grief and oh my gosh there is no sugar coating the end of life I knew for 46 years
with a man I loved that's a truth and I'm facing it my heart has been broken again and again
and my heart stretches in ways I did not know possible 30 years ago when I set out on the path
so today I do my best right here right now one breath and one step at a time
so this is the practice of self-compassion for me today it's my life and I bow to each of you
and I thank you kindly for listening thank you Bernadette your words are deeply touching and
please feel my own and I think I can speak for the sangha our condolences for your
for your loss and your words are powerful powerful these are the words of compassion for sure
so my friends I think David I think that we have lost David I got a text that his
internet went up David are you on or not I guess we did I guess we lost him
see no no I am here oh good there you are yeah yeah it magically came back on okay good so
so I'm sort of at a loss of words after Bernadette's presentation of profound self-compassion
so maybe just a moment of silence would be would be nice right now
so
and this being a compassion practice compassion
and along with awareness and wisdom and love
it is what allows us to live this life in some some freedom
so um whatever merit has been created here today and I think much merit has been created
here today much merit in the recognition of compassion in the rate in the recognition of
wisdom and love and awareness in ourselves and in others so may we may we share this with all beings
share our compassion with all beings all beings everywhere
may all beings
know happiness is their nature and the causes of happiness
may all beings know compassion as their nature and the causes of happiness
may all beings know joy as our nature and the causes of joy
and may all beings know equanimity as our nature and the causes of equanimity
so thank you all for coming there's a beautiful meeting today
much love and compassion and good wishes
come off mute and say goodbye to everyone yeah thank you for this
