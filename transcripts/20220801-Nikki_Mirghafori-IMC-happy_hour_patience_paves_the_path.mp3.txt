 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay. Okay. Well, hello and welcome. Welcome to happy hour, everyone. It's lovely to see you. It's lovely to be with you. Ah. So, so for today, this fresh new day, whatever day it is, whatever time zone for today, the topic I'd like to invite us to engage with is patience for ourselves, patience for ourselves and patience for others. Patience. Such a beautiful quality of the heart and mind. Ah, so patience. In praise of patience, praise of patience. Such a useful paramee. Paramee is the name of what's called 10 perfections in Buddhism. They're 10 beautiful qualities of the heart and patience. Kanti is one of them. Patience. So patience as an expression of metta, as an expression of kindness for ourselves. Let's consider, you know, this mind, this body. We take it to be ours. We take it to be. We take it so personally, especially when, when maybe it doesn't feel well or it's sluggish or it forgets something or, or it, it gets agitated or it gets upset, angry, this heart, this mind, this body. What if we treated this being as, as we would treat a, an elderly beloved parent? Just, it's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. It's all right. I'll have patience with you. I'll have patience with you instead of being short tempered with ourselves. Like, oh, you forgot this again or, oh gosh, you, you lost it or whatever it might be. Whatever it might be. Or you're sleeping again. Oh my goodness. You're distracted again. Fill your favorite habitual pattern in there. The one that you, you lose your patience with. What if, what if we had patience? So, so you might want to, oh, wait a minute. If I have too much patience with myself, then I'll never improve. I'll always be distracted and sleepy and forgetful and angry. Not exactly. So not exactly. The idea of patience is not acquiescence. It's not to accept and, and, and resign ourselves. That's not the idea here. It's actually, it's like a very wise. A. Aikido move and the Aikido move Aikido for those who may not be familiar with this, this. Martial arts. The idea is you use the energy of the opponent. You use the energy and you redirect it in a very skillful way. You don't oppose it. You redirect it. You redirect the energy. So the idea of the redirection here is say with the pattern that is troublesome or for one thing, it may not even be our fault anyway. If it's with the body or the mind or we're not feeling well and we feel betrayed by the body. And then with the other patterns with, with the anger and loss of temper, et cetera. Having patience with ourselves, actually that, that moment of acceptance is like, it's like shifting the energy. Like, okay, you're here. I see that you're here. I accept that you're here. Ah, instead of fighting you now, how now that you're here. Now that you're here. How can I work with you? That is in that moment, wisdom can come in. How can I work with you? And again, I've named a range of different patterns. The mind and then the body and some of them might be realized the body's just tired or sleepy or anger or having a hard time. Like, okay, rest, patience, patience, patience. And then with some of the patterns, maybe another skillful means is helpful, but patience, patience, taking our time, taking our time with heartfulness. All right. There's more I can say, but I think that's enough. Let's just practice together and see what arises in our reflections, in our hearts, in our minds, in our bodies, in the areas that we can have just a little more patience for ourselves. And of course, patience for others. So, all right, let's, let's practice. Let's land in our seats to arrive. Calling for the power of patience in this moment. Can we have patience as this body settles, relaxes? Let's go, or maybe it doesn't let go just yet. Maybe it's too agitated to let go right now. Can we be patient with that? With whatever the conditions are. Whatever is arising in this moment, in this body, in this mind, the space of the emotions, can we have patience with it? As we gently invite the body to settle, it's just an invitation. It's not meant to be forceful. Like a hammer, it's just an invitation. And can equality of patience inhabit the body, especially the lower part of the body, sense of stability, groundedness, receiving the breath. Can patience be intertwined with awareness right now? To receive the breath all the time in the world, for it shows this breath as if this in breath is the most important, awaited breath in the world, to take its time. Not waiting for the next in breath, just this one. Just this out breath. Deliciously enjoying with patience. It's arising in this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Receiving, receiving just this breath. Just the sensation of the breath in the body. Not going off to the past or into the future. Resting, resting. Moment of refuge. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Spending another few minutes just settling with the breath. With patience. And if there is lack of patience right now, with anything, sense of irritability, lack of patience, can you be patient with that? Can you be patient? Can you be patient with lack of patience? Or with the judgmental mind or whatever is coming up, it's something challenging. To be patient with lack of patience. See how that might feel like an Aikido move, to be patient with lack of patience. Is your heart relaxed a little bit more? Is there more ease? And I feel like I'd like to invite you to a little experiment, staying grounded with the body, feeling the breath. Bring to your heart, bring to your body memory. Not to get too heady, but bring the memory into your body, to the felt sense of your body. The memory of maybe today or yesterday. Maybe an occasion where something happened. Some mishap. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were impatient. Maybe judgmental mind arose. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe you were a little less patient than normal with yourself. Maybe there was some feeling this memory comes up. Maybe there was the Aikido movement of patience with yourself, an extra dose of patience. Maybe you joked with yourself, oh sweetheart. It's okay. You're getting a hang of this being a human thing. It's okay. Given all the causes and conditions, this is the best outcome for this moment, for your body, for your heart, for your mind. It's okay. It's all right. Whatever the situation was, the sense of, could have, should have, would have, could have, would have, feel the tightness and then see what arises, this feeling, this aikido move redirecting the energy of patience. It's okay. This sense of this body that's doing the best it can, this mind that is doing the best it can. And see what might arise in your heart, in your body. Notice. Is there more settling, more peace, more ease, more energy available, more kindness available, more peace? Ahaha. And is there more uprightness, more aspiration available? Yes, sweetheart. It's okay. Patience, patience. More energy for a different outcome next time. More kind, more wise, more wholesome outcome next time. Okay. No matter if you wish, you can stay with this feeling, more spaciousness, or you can stay with this feeling, more spaciousness, or as you like. Again, feeling your body on the cushion or the chair, your breath feeling embodied. And opening up the heart, the body again, maybe this time, inviting the memory of a time. Sometimes you were a little bit impatient, not as patient as you would have wished with someone else. Maybe it wasn't even so overt, maybe you didn't even lose your temper, but in your own mind, you knew that you were a little impatient, like, okay, wanting them to see the point or get it or do something or not do something. Now, aware of this internal impatience and feel a little bit if it's okay, if it's not overwhelming, let yourself feel that contraction a bit in the body, this contraction of impatience. Lack of patience doesn't feel so good, does it? It seems like it sucks the air out of the room, sucks the air out of your lungs. Now relax and let's do a redo in our minds, in our hearts, in our memory. This thing is happening in our memory. Ah, we're being patient, fully patient, they're doing the best they can, this being, with the causes and conditions of the background, their upbringing, their experience, their own, who they are, they're getting a hang of this being human thing, just like I am. I can give them space to figure it out in their own time and give them the gift of patience, give myself the gift of patience. See how your heart might feel, does the contraction loosen, melt, is there more ease? Being yourself and this other being, the gift of patience. And if there's impatience present, like it's not working, can you be patient with the lack of patience? It's okay. I'm getting the hang of this human being human thing too. Or offering them patience, maybe yourself too. See how soothing, calming, healing the self can feel. And notice how with more patience towards others, it can be more supportive, more wise in our actions towards them, more kind. It frees up energy for wisdom. It frees up energy for kindness and wisdom. Can there be patience with whatever is arising in this moment? Goredom, agitation, distraction? Not acquiescence, but patience, patience has an uprightness to it. The morality of equiescence doesn't see for yourself. Can we bring this practice period to an end together? Can we offer patience to our hearts? In our aspirations to awaken, to be wiser and kinder, patience paves the path. Offering ourselves patience as a gift of kindness to enable wisdom. And patience may our cultivation or goodness be a cause and condition for kindness, awakening, goodness all around the world, all beings everywhere. May they be patient with themselves, patient with others, all around for those who are like them, for those who are different. Patience, patience, patience, may all beings everywhere be free, including ourselves. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. And praise of patience. So, time for reflections, what might have come up for you, if you would like to share for the benefit of others, your aha moments, your questions, your challenges, we offer these as gifts to others. So any reflections, any questions, comments, in praise of patience, or maybe more specific, and oh, you can always type in chat if you type to me privately, I will read your reflection, not your name, so it will be private. You type to everyone, it will be both, I'll read your name and your reflection, you can also raise your zoom hand. And Richard. Hi, I wonder if patience extends to like giving yourself. Time enough to do some, let's say practice, you know that you want to sit for 45 minutes instead of five minutes, rather than get antsy and kind of short. Yeah, exactly. Yes, tell me more. Yes, and I'm curious what's coming. No, no, because it's sort of easy to say, oh, I know I'm progressing slowly. But you know, I'm easily distracted, not in the sense of thinking of something, but wanting to do something else. And I need to do one thing for long enough before I drop it and do something else. Well said, that's exactly right. It's given that you have the aspiration, just as you said, to awaken, to wake up, and you sit and after five minutes, it's like, okay, I've got to do this other thing, like, oh, yeah, that's more important. Wait a minute, dear, what's your highest aspiration? What's really important to you? So could be, can you, and bringing patience there, this is a beautiful way, this beautiful quality of can I be patient with this agitation? Because maybe what's really underneath, wanting to get up and do something else is a sense of agitation. Can I be patient with myself? Or maybe there's different framing, as you were saying, like a sense of patience. I'm just going to be patient with me walking this path. I'm going to be patient and actually give it time, not just give it five minutes. So there's so many different things. But it's also fully engaged with whatever that thing is. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, patience is fully engaged. Yeah. Yeah, patience is fully engaged. Resignation is not engaged. And that's another thing to explore. Patience is fully engaged. Yeah. Thank you, Richard. You are the reflections here. Bill says, it seems to me that patience and love are closely related. Yes, indeed. Exactly. Thank you for that. You says thank you, Nikki. You're welcome. You Mary says, I love the reminder. Patience paves the path. Yes, you're welcome. Yes, patience paves the path. It is engaged. It is engaged. It's an active engagement with ourselves, with others. Yeah. Patience paves the path. Yeah. Any other reflections before we share patience? Deborah says patience and acceptance are also related. Yes. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. They're both related and a little different, the same way that patience and love are related. And I think of these as Venn diagrams, right? You're familiar with Venn diagrams, these circles. You have these circles that define a particular entity. So patience and acceptance have areas that are in common. But of course, there are other aspects to them. And so in many ways, patience needs acceptance. Patience requires a level of acceptance that, yes, this is how things are right now. This is how things are right now. And how can I hold it? How can I hold this with both uprightness, with spaciousness, with goodwill, and with steadiness? There's a steadiness also in patience. That's part of it. It's really fun to explore these qualities in the body, in the mind. Like, oh, yeah. And I'm still loving how all of you have been, how the comments are coming in, like, oh, yeah, these are related. Oh, those are related. You're kind of feeling them in your body and mind. Yeah. So there are no other further reflections. Maybe I'll pause for one more moment. So OK. So I'll invite you now to small rooms. So the invitation for the practice together is, first of all, showing up with patience, showing up with the quality of patience for yourselves, the quality of patience for others, which again, has both love and acceptance in it, as observed. And each person will say one nugget, just one thing could be about this practice today, or it could be about your relationship with patience, relationship with your patience in general. Does it come easily? Does it seem like a challenge? Or what nuance you've explored, you observed today as you were playing around with it? And so each person, one person will say one nugget and then the other person will say another nugget. And then the next person will say one more nugget and it will come back to you. So you'll go around a few times. And let's go in alphabetical order according to the first name. And what else? Yeah, so each person just sharing from your own experience, if you wish, you can also offer silence and say pass and just hold presence, patience, compassionate presence. That's perfectly okay. It's fine. So yeah, I think that's all. So I'm going to open the rooms now and take care of yourselves, take care of each other, be kind. Here we go. And we have a couple minutes if any reflections came up from your conversations in the rooms together. You are welcome to raise your hand if you would or type in chat. Questions, reflections. How is it to be in room and discuss patience with one another? Why did you discover such a juicy topic? I see some smiles. I'll be patient with you. I am patient. Take your time. Fred, please. Well, we discussed among other things, being on the phone to AT&T. And I thought that was just to me, that was just the perfect obstacle, the perfect task, perfect learning situation, how to hang in there and maybe get what you want, but not make it worse. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly right. Yeah. Thank you, Fred. That's a great example. Yeah. And we all go through examples like that. Yeah. Appreciate that. Barbara, please. Oops, please. You're still muted. There. I have a similar example. I live on an island that has a drawbridge. And for the first time in the year and a half, I've lived on the island. I went to leave and there was no, the traffic wasn't moving. We're backed up for blocks this way and that way. And you could see people that were unaware of it were getting really worked up. And those that know that the drawbridge is up, we're just sort of jelaxing. And none of us were going to get across the bridge any faster for getting all worked up. That's exactly right. Opportunity for patients. Yeah. For exercising, practicing. Thank you. Thank you for that. And there's one reflection privately, but it's hard when someone takes up the whole time. Seems to be happening a lot lately. So I appreciate that maybe in the groups also, even though with the invitation that each person will just say a nugget and then the next person will say nugget and the next person will come back to you. It may not always happen that way. Even there's always the invitation to be mindful. And yeah, especially with the topic tonight, I think that is the perfect. If that happened in your group, it's okay. It's a perfect opportunity to be patient with one another. It's like, it's okay if I don't say something tonight, I can exercise patients. That was the invitation anyway. Can you show up with patience for each other and yourself? So if you did that, yeah, you succeeded even if you didn't get a word in edgewise. Yay. Then you practiced perfectly with with the MECTA and patients. So anyway, so thank you all. It's lovely to practice with you and whatever we do, as long as we bring kindness to it, it's part of this practice. It's part of this practice. I appreciate you showing up, you cultivating your heart for the purpose of serving yourself and all beings everywhere. May all beings be safe. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Great. Thank you all. Thank you. And I will be traveling this next week so you'll have some wonderful other supportive teachers who will be supporting the sangha in the coming days. So all right, I'm going to stop the recording.
