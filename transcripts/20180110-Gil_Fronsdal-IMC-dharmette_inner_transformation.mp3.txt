Dharmette : Inner Transformation  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

As many of you know, mindfulness practice has entered 
into our culture in a big way . There’re  many people who 
teach mindfulness in settings where it’s called “secular 
mindfulness ” – without the Buddhism part. This is a 
wonderful thing. I think that one of the wonderful 
teachings in this secular mindfulness world , which is  
also taught in Buddhism , is learning how to be present 
for the experience that we have in the moment, just to 
be present for here and now. Whatever circumstances  
we’re in , we try to bring mindfulness  and presence to it. 
Hopefully that  mindfulness and presence has a quality 
of non -reactivity , where we don’t bring a lot of reactive 
emotions  – being for or against  something, or angry , 
blaming , holding on, clinging , or preferring. We don’t 
bring a l ot of associations, beliefs , and ideas from the 
past with us  – like a tidal wave bringing whatever is 
happening on top of us , and get  into complicated 
relationships with it. But just, “Oh, this  is what’s 
happening now. ” Often our lives  become a lot simpler. 
One of the hallmarks of mindfulness is the emphasis on 
being in the presen t moment , and  how to bring that into 
our lives.  
 However,  Buddhist practice includes much more than 
mindfulness. There’re  many things that Buddhism 
brings along besides this present moment awareness. 
But what I’d like to emphasize today is that Buddhism 
also emphasizes transformation in our psyche. The 
heart or mind can somehow be transformed , so that it’s 
not just a matter of bringing mindfulness to situations . 
It’s also about changing ourselves into a different kind of 
person. We become different people  in the different 
situations we find ourselves in.  
 
A poignant example of this sometimes occurs towards 
the end of life . A Buddhist teacher , who’s a friend of 
mine , was friend s with the president of the American 
Psychological Association or the American 
Psychotherapy Association. I don’t know exactly what 
it’s called . It’s a big , important organization , and her 
good friend  had been  the president. He was retired and 
getting elderl y. My friend and her husband were invited 
over to have dinner with this man whom  they had known 
for many years. They knocked on his door . He opened 
the door  – swung  it wide open  – and said to them, “I 
don’t have a clue who you are, but you’re very welcome 
in my house. Please come in.” He was getting 
Alzheimer’s or dementia. They had known each other 
for years and years , but he didn’t remember them . 
Nevertheless , his disposition was  one of friendliness, 
openness , and acceptance . And he said , “Come in to my 
house. ” So, they did , and they all had dinner.   
I don’t want to imply  that this is always the case, b ut the 
impression I’ve gotten from talking with different people 
is that when people start having something lik e 
dementia or Alzheimer’s, sometimes  the surface 
functioning or coping mechanisms of the mind begin to 
fall away . And t hey no longer have the energy for their 
usual coping mechanisms . And s ome of the person’s 
deeper dispositions begin  to stand out more clearly. 
Some people ha ve a wonderful compensatory surface 
mind , where  they keep  a lot of their deep inner angers, 
sorrows , or issues at bay . This is their way of  coping 
with and  under standing how to be in the world. When 
that coping mechanism falls away , then they are left  
with t heir deep issues in some way. And often  they don’t 
have the wherewithal to practice with their issues  or 
work through them . When the mind is declining, they’re 
just left with their deeper disposition.  
 
For people who have work ed through some of their 
deeper issues , and have settled, healed , or become  
free of them,  then when their mind declines , they’re not 
left with the se difficulty issues like  grief or anger. The se 
people a re left with something deeper that’s more  like, 
“Welcome  into my house. I don’t know who you are , but 
it’s so nice to see you.” Th is is a very different 
disposition of how to be.  
 I don’t want to generalize too much from this . But I’m 
trying to use this idea to make the point that Buddhism 
focuses on inner  transformation. On the one hand, part  
of that inner transformation is in fact let ting go of, or 
bring ing to an end to certain dispositions that are not so 
healthy. One of the key  disposition s that Buddhism 
focuses on  ending  is hostility. Another deep disposition 
that Buddhism talks about uprooting is all the variations 
of greed or lust . The third disposition that Buddhism 
emphasizes bringing an end to is delusion . When those  
can somehow come to an end , there is a n inner  shift in 
practice.  
 
So, it’s  not just a matter of knowing how to bring 
stronger and stronger mindfulness to our situation . 
There’s also an inner shift  that’s required. On the one 
hand, I said that with that  inner shift , some  things come 
to an end. O n the other hand , certain things then have a 
chance to shine. When  there’s a lot of greed , lust, hate, 
or hostility, there’s very little room for generosity. 
There’s very little room for love. When there’s a lot of 
delusion , there is not a lot of room for wisdom.  
 
For many people, a s these unhealthy dispositions  begin 
to fall away, then their  positive virtues, attributes , and 
dispositions have a chance to grow and develop. These 
positive qualities arise not only  because there’s spa ce 
for them, but also when we emphasize and encourage  
them in practice. Then  they can become not just qualities that we do . Sometimes  doing is not very deep. 
Instead , we becom e these dispositions in a  deeper  way. 
We strengthen these  dispositions in how we are . We 
becom e not someone who does generosity , but 
someon e who is a generous person . Not someone who 
does kindness , but someone who has become a kind 
person.  
 
What  we’re looking for in Buddhism is not just non-
reactive mindfulness  in the moment , but rather  what it 
would take to have some deep inner shift  – so that we 
can enter the world from a different disposition , which is 
more enduring, valu able,  and important. Who knows 
when our mindfulness is not going to be strong enough 
to handle a situation we’re  in?  
 
I’ve known people who have gone into situations where 
their mindfulness wasn’t available to them. They had 
practiced for years and years , and somehow the ir 
situation was too difficult. They had an illness for 
example , or were facing surgery , or mental decline. 
Their practice was not available in the usual ways. They  
became  distressed because their practice was what had 
kept them safe, kept them going , or som ehow kept 
things at bay. Suddenly they were left without the 
strength of their practice , but they hadn’t really changed 
deeply inside.  
 Both mindfulness and transformation  are important 
aspects  of Buddhism . First is  the tremendous 
importance of nonreactive mindfulness. And the  practice  
of mindfulness itself is not independent of the 
transformation. It’s actually one of the important ways 
that allow s that transformation to happen. But Buddhism 
also emphasizes a lot of other things . It’s not just 
waiting for the accident of personal transformation. It’s 
not wishful thinking  – that if I just do this mindfulness 
long enough , then something will happen. Rather , it’s 
also being interested in this whole area of our in ner life 
and inner dispositions  – of how we are . We consider 
what are the healthy, appropriate ways of supporting 
this transformation from unwholesome to wholesome 
dispositions. Classically , in Buddhism , there is a whole 
combination of different practic es represented by the 
Eightfold Path, which address es all of who we are, and 
is not limited to  just the part that has to do with 
mindfulness.  
 
It’s important to orient yourself  towards using 
mindfulness  – not just to be present in life moment by 
moment , like when you see a sunset. “How nice it is to 
be fully present for the sunset. Isn’t this great and 
wonderful. I can be here now. And then go home and 
eat my lunch. Oh , be mindf ul of my lunch. It’s so good , 
and I can taste these flavors of food. The food is so 
good ! This mindfulness is fantastic. I just love it because the flavors explode in my mouth. Now I know what 
Buddha must have meant by the power of mindfulness. ”  
 
The poin t is not just to have greater flavors as we eat . 
Some people are oriented towards mindfulness in order 
to have that  kind of pleasure in life . But in this practice, 
there is a preference for an orientation  to be come  more 
sensitive  – to use mindfulness to support  the quality of 
our inner life.  
• What are our dispositions?  
• What are our mental  or emotional tendencies?  
• What is this emotional life?  
• What are the motivations that drive us ? 
• How to become more aware and mindful  of them , 
and th en to be the caretakers of that?   
• How t o be the gardeners in the garden of our heart  
– and then to start working on it  – figuring  out 
healthy , appropriate ways to shift how we are in this 
deeper way.  
 
Classically in Buddhism  practice,  one of the central 
points is not to have an experience of enlightenment , 
but rather to be a person who is transformed in such a 
way that they’re seen as being enlightened. It’s the 
personal transformation that’s important , not the so-
called “Now  I’ve attained the highest thing , and I can 
check that off on my resume. ” But, rather your resume 
can say, “I was that way , and now I’m this kind of 
person.”   
Your inner life and disposition are something to be 
deeply cared  for, connected to , and value d. I beli eve 
that everyone’s inner life , or heart  if we may call it that, 
is precious, valuable, well worth caring for, and paying 
attention to. It’s a treasure that you have in there . No 
one else can be the gardener of your heart for you. May 
the weeds turn into … I’m tryin g to avoid saying flowers. 
It seems a little too sentimental. But, may the weeds 
turn into non -weeds.
