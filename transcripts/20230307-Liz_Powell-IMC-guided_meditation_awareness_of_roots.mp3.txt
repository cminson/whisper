 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Settling into the meditation, allowing yourself time to notice how things are with you right now. Receiving whatever is prominent in awareness. Allowing time for anything that's coming up to be known and recognizing what's coming up. Now, relaxing around it or softening. if there's any tightness or tension, resistance, and allowing things to be just as they are if the invitation to relax or soften is not what's called for right now. There are no right or wrong experiences here, simply letting everything be received in awareness. This is useful to notice what's unpleasant as what's pleasant and as what's neither. Noticing any attitude or relationship you have with whatever is appearing in awareness. Opening the heart-mind to whatever the attitude is. Letting awareness show you when you're wanting more of something that has arisen. Or you're simply receiving it, allowing it to pass through. Letting awareness show you when you're wanting to push an experience away, wanting it to pass through quickly. And being aware of any uncertainty, confusion, lack of clarity. Not going out and looking for these things, just allowing them to be received if they're present. Whatever attitude or relationship with what is being received is most obvious, allowing it to be here, to be recognized. No need to judge it. No need to judge it. With gentle curiosity, allowing yourself to know when there's a wholesome state of mind that's here now. That could be a helpful or skillful attitude towards what is in awareness. What's being noticed could be unpleasant and the wholesome attitude could be gentle curiosity or simply allowing that it's here right now. Whatever arises, allow it, soak it in, noticing how it's known or experienced. And perhaps appreciating whether it has a wholesome effect on you or an unwholesome effect, just knowing what it is and what it does in the moment. Thank you. And as we continue in silence, no need to judge or worry if the mind drifts off for a while, simply recognizing when awareness returns. And what is present? What is the relationship with returning to awareness? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
