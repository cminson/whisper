Practice Note : Mindfulness and 
Awareness

Mindfulness is different from awareness, although 
teachers like myself will sometim es use the words  as 
synonyms . Awareness  is being conscious or openly 
aware. Mindfulness is more of a practice of clearly 
acknowledging what is happening in the present 
moment. It’s not just a simple awa reness of what is 
happening, but rather a clear recognition of what it is 
that’s happening. If your mind wanders off, you can be 
aware of that, and then just realize that you have to 
come back to your breath. Or there can be a clear 
acknowledgment – a clea r recognition: “My mind is 
thinking.”  
 
There can be a sound , and you can be aware on the 
periphery of your perception that a sound has happened 
around you. You can give it no heed and just stay with 
your breath. Or it might grab you for a few moments, 
and then you come back to your breathing. So that’s in 
the field of awareness. Mindfulness is more a simple, 
relaxed, peaceful, non -judgmental recognition of what it 
is that awareness has taken in. You don’t have to be doing that acknowledgment of everything that’s 
happening in the field of awareness, but there are 
certain things that  are useful to acknowledge or 
recognize with a little more precision or sharpness.  
 
So if you choose to be with the breath, it isn’t to be 
generally aware of the breath when we do mindfulness, 
but to have a relaxed, open recognition, “Oh, I'm 
breathing in , breathing out ,” and of the different 
sensations of the breath coming in and out . We’re 
present enough that we register clearly that this is what 
it is. 
 
You can be generally aware and afterwards you might 
have to stretch your mind to think , “I think ther e was a 
sound. What was that? ” Whereas if you’re mindful , you 
would clearly acknowledge the sound, “Oh, that was a 
sound,”  and then you would know what it is. It’s a clear 
registering. The trick is to do it in a way that is not 
analytical or involves a lot  of thought, but in a way 
where there is crispness and clarity . This is particularly 
useful with the distracted  thoughts that pull us  away.  If 
we just casually let go of them and come back to the 
breath without clearly acknowledging  them, then 
sometimes they have an easy tendency to creep back 
in. But  if you clearly acknowledge them, then  sometimes 
it is easier to put them to rest. I liken that clear 
acknowledgement of mindfulness to what it’s like if 
you’re talking with a friend  about some chal lenge in your life, and you feel lik e your friend is really present, 
listening  and there for you , as opposed to someone  who 
is impati ent and multi -tasking on their p hone while you 
know they are only kind of listening to you. So it’s the 
same thing when we offer that real  “there -ness ” to what 
we bring mindfulness to, to freedom  
what we  receive mindfully in our aware ness.  
 
Mindfulness  is a sub-aspect of awareness that involves 
a clear recognition and  acknowledgement that this is 
what’s happening.  So you can try that and see if your 
acknowledgements can be a bit clearer  today. See  if 
that helps you feel freer in the midst of what’s 
happening.
