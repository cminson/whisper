Know

To be  aware of awareness, to be  awar e of yourself 
being mindful, to be  aware of yourself being present for 
something is part of this path of practice . A certain self -
reflec tiveness or self -awareness is part of this .  
 
If you’re only foc used on the external world  – for 
example, on your concerns for other people , or things , 
or activities  – it’s very easy to be so concerned , that you 
don’t notice how  you are in being  concern ed. You might 
be str essed out , worried, and tense. I t’s possible to 
spend a whole day tense , and so focused on what 
you’re tense about that you don’t know you are tense ! 
Part of the self -reflective, se lf-aware aspect of 
mindfulness is that you don’t focus only on your 
concerns . You also have self -awareness, self -
understanding : “Oh, I’m tense .”  
 
That’s one step. T hen you can take a step further . You 
know you’re tense , but you also know that you know  
you’re tense . This might seem abstract , but stay with 
me. It’s one thing to know you’re tense;  it’s another thing to know that you’re present, to know that you 
know. It’s one thing to be present; it’s another to know 
that y ou’re present. If you know you’re present , then you 
know som e of the qualities of presence. You know what 
it feels like , and you know how present you are.  
 
It’s possible to know that you’re paying attention . For 
example, you’re tense and you’re paying atte ntion to the  
tension . It’s also possible to know that you’re  just paying 
attention halfheartedly . “I’m not really pay ing attention. 
I’m a dutiful Buddhist practitioner, and I’ve been told to 
be mindful . Okay, I’ll do it. I don’t know why I’m doing it , 
but I’ve been told to pay attention to my pain. I don’t 
know if I believe in this , but I might as well give it a try.” 
You can be aware if it’s halfhearted . Or you can be 
awar e of your pain or tension , and you know  it. You’re 
going to bazooka it! Y ou’re g oing to zero in like a laser . 
You can be aware of the quality of the awareness and 
the attention you bring. I t’s one thing to know something 
like tension ; it’s another  to know how you know  it, to 
know  that you know  it. When mindfulness, attention , 
and consciousness are  really strong , there i s a beautiful 
quality  – a beautiful feeling of knowing that you know.  
 
Here’s a n unfortunate example  – hopefully it won’t 
traumatize some of you. Maybe this has happened to 
you. You’ve been on the freeway or driving some place , 
and you had a really dangerous , near miss accident . 
You were just driving along , minding your own business, thinking whatever you were thi nking  – random thoughts, 
nothing about driving . Then out of the blue , a car does  a 
crazy thing and you ’re a hair away from being creamed, 
flattened . But, nothing happen s to you. For a moment 
the brakes screech and  all kinds of stuff h appen s, but 
you came out of that n ear miss. Chances are you 
wouldn’t immediately just pick up those random 
thoughts again , like what you’re having for dinner . 
Suddenly you feel alive. Maybe the adrenaline is 
running. Y ou feel really present in a way you weren’t 
before : “Wow ! I’m alive and present. ” Things are clear 
and crisp . There’s  an energy , alertness , or cla rity that 
wasn’t present  before . In that clarity, that alertness , that 
sense of presence brought on by the near accident, you 
can palpab ly feel that you know you know. Y ou know  
you’re present. T here’s a whole new enti ty here : 
presence, alertness, clarity.  
 
Maybe a  better example would be  waking u p from sleep 
or a nap  so refreshed  that you feel the refreshment, and 
you know you’re refreshed . But the refreshment is not 
separate from the awareness that is refreshed , and  the 
clarity of awareness that comes . So there’s a self -
reflective aspect of knowing that you know , and it’s 
beautiful . “Wow ! This is really something. This i s 
powerful.”    
 
Sometimes in medi tation , you come to a point when  the 
mind gets more and more settled ; and at that  point , the awareness flowers and becomes strong. I t almost 
becomes its  own entity . In ord inary life, however, 
awareness is not its  own entity . In ordinary life , 
awareness is this poor thing that’s co -dependent on 
everything else, lost with ever ything else, pulled around, 
hijacked, held hosta ge by whatever concerns you , so 
that you hardly even know you’re aware, let alone know  
that you have awareness , because you’re so involved  
and caught in what you’re doing.   
 
As mindfulness and meditation get stronger, then slowly 
the sense of bein g aware  becomes stronger and stands 
out in highlight . One way it stands out is that you can 
feel th e quality  of the attention you have . And you can 
feel how you can use attention , rather t han attent ion 
being hijacked by everything. Y ou can start using your 
attention . For example , “Oh, right now I’m tense. I thi nk I 
can use my attention. I will take my awareness and 
place it i n my shoulders where I’m tense.” Y ou place it 
there in a careful way , as opp osed to continuing to think  
about the important upcoming meeting  you’re tense 
about . Instead, “ I think what’s useful would be to use  
awareness  to pay attention  to my feelings,  to the anxiety 
I have .” Rather than being highjacked, a ttention 
becomes something you start u sing. I t’s anot her way 
into feeling awareness  and presence  until awareness 
becomes its own thing , kind of like an entity .  
 
With time, awareness, presence, mindfulnes s, attention  become  conscious , and can lead to a stronger sense of 
presence, and become something very valuable and 
meaningful . Awareness  can become the most importa nt 
and valuable thing you have, even more valuable than 
your valuables. At some point you’d be willing to give up 
your bank account , rather than giv e up awarene ss – this 
pristine, open awareness . This clear s ense of presence 
is so valuable because that’s where freedom is . It’s 
where compassion and love are. When we have that, 
it’s where s o many of the best qualities reside . 
 
To know that you know , and, as you know that you 
know, to know the qu ality of the knowing is what the 
earlier talk was about . Is the way that you know 
entangled with attitudes and moods and anxieties and 
fears and desires and sense of self? Of course it will be . 
Part of the idea of  knowing that you know is to keep 
stepping back. How far do you have to step back so you 
can just know what’s there with equanimity? Kno w 
what’s there without judgment?  Know what’s there with 
some kind of allowance ? “This is how it is now. ” When 
you come to that place where you just know with some 
allowance, ac ceptance, and openness , “This is how it is. 
Right now I’m tense. Right now I’m upset .” When  you 
can hold it with some allowance , then you  begin to  
appreciate how precious , valuable , or even sacred it is 
to reside in that place where you know that you know.  
 
When t he sense of presence is so strong  that you could say, “ I know that I know ; I know that I’m present” – that’s 
a great place to begin letting go of the ‘you’ that knows. 
There  can be knowing that you know without it being 
you who knows you know . The ‘you’ is just extra; ‘you’ is 
more of this entanglement  – the sense of ‘I .’ At some 
point , when the knowing that you know is strong, then 
there’s relaxing into it, letting go into it, but there’s no 
‘you’ left in it . There’s just knowing , and that knowing  
stands out in highlight as its own entity – its own power, 
its own clarity, its  own freedom.  
 
I hope that made some sense to you. If not, just leave it 
here.
