 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. We'll be getting with finding a posture that feels both relaxed and comfortable, and also alert and awake. If there are any areas of tension or holding or little micro adjustments that might help you, the sense of relaxation, the sense of settling, the sense of receiving and being awake to this present moment experience, it can be helpful to intentionally relax the body. You may find that this naturally supports a relaxing and settling of the mind. Relaxing the space of the head and face, relaxing the space around the eyes, the jaw and mouth, the neck and shoulders, inviting a deeper breath to open and soften the chest and upper back, the diaphragm, belly and lower back, feeling the arms and hands, inviting, softening, settling, down into the pelvic area and buttocks, softening the area of the groin, the thighs, the upper legs, down into the knees, lower legs and feet. We invite a settling and relaxation and then just receive and just be with whatever is actually happening in a non-demanding way, in a non-contentious way, not trying to change or create or control, but rather meeting and receiving just this experience right here, whatever is already happening. Whatever is naturally arising at any of the six sense spaces, whether the physical sense spaces of body sensations, sounds, sights, tastes and smells, or experiences at the mind base, all kinds of thoughts and images, ideas about the past, ideas about the future, thoughts and ideas about what's happening right now. Just inviting a receiving of this whole unfolding natural process of body and mind, remembering that our experience is just nature. What's arising right now is based in past causes and conditions, based in the habit patterns that have been laid down and conditioned into the mind over many years. Just getting close to this experience, just seeing how it actually is in a natural and light way. Whatever is obvious right now, not looking or digging for anything in particular, just this, just the simplicity of this moment's experience. We can observe the natural process of our own experience as a naturalist might observe nature, not interfering, not controlling, not judging as good or bad or right or wrong. Just curious to see what's actually happening, curious about the workings of nature, the workings of this body and mind. Just simply recognizing the present moment experience. Thank you. Receiving the flow of ever-changing arising and passing experiences. No need to try to know all of them or label all of them. Just receiving this stream of passing experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is there awareness of this present moment experience? Just check to see whether awareness is present, emphasizing, relaxing, over-focusing. You might play with just remembering the present moment rather than trying to be aware. You may find that if you keep the present moment in mind, awareness will naturally do its job. If you can even remember to check if awareness is present, awareness is already present. Thank you. But if you do inevitably wander off into thought and lose track of present moment experience. And as soon as there's a recognition that you've been lost in thought, you're already back. There's already awareness. There's nothing to go back to. This experience is already being known. You are simple. You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
