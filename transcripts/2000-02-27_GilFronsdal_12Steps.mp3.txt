 Today's topic is happiness because that's the next stage of one of the descriptions of the path that the Buddha laid out. And since the beginning of the year, I've been slowly going over the 12 stages of particular description that the Buddha gave of the conditions that build on each other in order for a person to become awakened or liberated. And right in the middle of that list of 12, number 6, is happiness. And happiness is a very important element of Buddhist practice. And you're expected to some degree to become happier as you do practice. The experience of awakening or nirvana is sometimes described as the great happiness. The Buddha said somewhere that nirvana is the ultimate happiness. But short of the ultimate happiness of nirvana, there's happiness as part of the stage, part of the process of getting there. And so these 12 stages or 12 steps are kind of building on each other. One is the condition for the arising of the next. So I started off some weeks ago talking about the first step being that of suffering. That's the condition, the foundation of suffering, good, proper suffering, in order to be interested in the spiritual path. So you have to do that well. And now that's not a problem, of course, because none of us have to kind of work at it. But what we do have to work at is acknowledging it and seeing if they honestly that we do suffer when we suffer. We don't want to look for suffering. And so some people only hear that message of Buddhism. You're supposed to kind of pay attention to your suffering and then think, oh, what a downer of a religion. There must be better religions than this one. But it's kind of like a doctor. You don't want to go to a doctor and say you're sick and the doctor doesn't want to hear about your symptoms. I have some good medicine for you here. I gave this to the last patient. It was really helpful with that patient. I don't care what your symptoms are. Take it. So the first thing to do is be very serious about acknowledging our suffering. And the next stage is then out of that acknowledgement and honesty about our suffering is to have some inspiration, to have some conviction, to have some faith that it's possible to engage oneself in a path to become free of that suffering, to become happy. So really to be honest about our suffering is the precondition that allows us then to develop faith. Some kind of faith is a necessary part of any spiritual practice. And I know some people are a little bit hesitant with the word faith, but maybe the word conviction or confidence is a better one. Some confidence, oh, this is worthwhile doing or at least trying out. Having confidence is the precondition for the arising of some kind of delight. And delight is an important part of practice also. And this is in particular with the Buddhist thought book is that delight that arises out of engaging oneself energetically, fully, in spiritual life, in trying to resolve our suffering and laying the other conditions for a spiritual path of living an ethical life. So the delight that comes from our good ethics and being virtuous and knowing that our intentions are wholesome and good. And that is a precondition for being able to begin settling on ourselves with our concentration, with our mindfulness, which brings on joy. Joy is the precondition for tranquility, for calmness. And unless you have some delight and joy in your life, some appreciation and inspiration about your life and what you're doing, it's very hard to feel some genuine level of calm or tranquility. You can have a conditional calm and tranquility that's a result of relief or a result of kind of the opposite of your normal state of agitation. But to feel the deeper possibility of tranquility and calm, it's not a reaction to something, but it actually arises out of the path itself. Now, some degree of tranquility and calm then is the condition, lays the foundation for the possibility for happiness, which is the next stage or level of whatever you want to call it, the next link in the chain. And the word is sukkah. Now, it's interesting that Buddhism puts a lot of emphasis on the possibility of happiness and as part of the path. There's a story of a king talking with the Buddha, and the king had it all. He had all the stock options he could have wanted. So he had a pretty good life. And so he said to the Buddha, which one of us is happiest? And the Buddha said, well, if you set still, basically you set still and set quietly for a while, for an hour, would you remain happy for that hour? And the king said, oh yeah, no problem. I have all these great stock options. And so the Buddha said, well, if you set still and just kind of sat there without needing to do anything at all or get any kind of stimulus from outside or any kind of support from outside or any kind of benefits from the world around you, just just sat there with yourself contently. Could you be happy for six hours? And the king said, no, I couldn't do it for that long. And what about for 24 hours? The king said, no, I couldn't do that. And he said, well, I'm able to do that. I'm able to sit for six hours or 24 hours for a week at a time and not have any kind of stimulus from outside, any kind of propping up with activity. And my happiness is not dependent on anything around me. I can sit happily and contently for up to seven days at a time. And the king said, thank you. I think that you have discovered the greater happiness, the greater ability to be happy. So the ability to discover happiness which is not dependent on the world around us, on our relationships, on our work, on all the different things that we often think we require a need for our happiness is part of the path of practice. I would discover happiness which is not dependent on anything outside of ourselves, in a sense inside of ourselves too, perhaps. I was quite surprised when I started doing intensive practice by the amount of joy and happiness that arose as part of the meditative path. I kind of hadn't thought about it or hadn't realized it was part of it. And there were times when I just had to sit down, especially on retreat, and just take a few deep breaths and I would just be suffused and suffused with a great feeling of happiness and love and joy. It just seemed to kind of radiate. I had this little mantra that I told myself, one long retreat. And I have to do this song from the 60s. I was a little embarrassed to say this, but I've said it before so. It's in the public eye already. I would sit down and I would take a deep breath and I would say to myself, kind of under my breath, got a whole lot of love. And then I would just be really quiet and just sit there with all this love and happiness that just seemed to be there. And I would just take a little retreat. All my sitting was in my bed. I had a little room, this little monk cell that I sat in and I sat in the bed. And there was an American there who was quite unhappy. He even did no longer than I had. He was plugging me right into his practice. He was very diligent, very uptight. My first day or two that I was there, I was new. Monster, I didn't know where anything was or anything. I went up to him and very quietly said, you know, where are the bathrooms or something? I don't know what I said. He's not really supposed to talk to people on retreat, but this was Burma, you know, and there were only three other Westerners there. I thought it was a pretty mild thing to ask, you know, where's the bathroom? And he got all tight. You know, you're disturbing my meditation. You can't do this. He's breaking the rules. Anyway, he suffered a lot in the retreat. He was on. And at some point I really wanted him to come and sit in my bed in the place where I was sitting. I had this idea. I sat there for so many months with so much happiness and joy. I just kind of was true enough. But I just felt that it had to still go over into the bed, into the room, you know. It had to be somewhere, you know. So I just didn't think he could sit in that spot. He would share it. What's really fun about the kind of joys and happiness that arises in meditation is to be able to start distinguishing between joy and happiness. The joy, it's said that joy always contains happiness. But happiness doesn't contain joy because happiness is more sublime or more subtle, more refined than joy. Joy tends to be much more energetic. It's an energetic state. Someone who's really familiar with the great states of joy in meditation will find that actually after a while it feels kind of agitating because there's so much energy there. And though once you kind of let go of the agitation, once you kind of confuse it with some level of calm and tranquility, then what's left is happiness. And the happiness is kind of akin to kind of a sense of contentment or ease. It's kind of a sustained sense of happiness or well-being. It doesn't arise and pass depending on conditions and what happens to the world around us. It's kind of a sustained feeling and it's kind of a whole body kind of sense. But in a sense maybe happiness is a little bit more of a mental happiness than joy is, which is really pervasively physical. It's also interesting that in Buddha psychology they list many different states of consciousness. And there's a different list, so there's not much. There's different ways of dividing a consciousness or seeing consciousness. But there's one division where the Buddha or Buddhism describes 120 some states of consciousness that the human being can have. And what's interesting about this list is that it's something like, I don't remember exactly the numbers, you have to apologize, but it's something like 56 states of those states of consciousness are beautiful states of consciousness that come with joy. 66 of them, give or think, a couple I don't know, are neutral. They don't have any joy or suffering as part of it. And three, this I remember very well, and three of those states of consciousness, 126 states of consciousness, have suffering as part of them. Now that's an amazing proportion, because where do you live most of your life? So you know, there's something like 117 states of consciousness which don't involve suffering, that's part of human potential. And most people tend to live in those three small ones. So I'm talking about using a small capacity of who we are. So the possibility of joy and happiness is really great. And the question is, how do we become happy? How do we develop our happiness? It's like many, many people that I don't know how accurate it is, but the happiness is really the ultimate goal of human life. Most people, what they really want is some form of happiness. And what happens is people pursue happiness often in unuseful, unhealthy ways. And often in our pursuit of happiness, for our happiness and happiness of those around us, we often get sidetracked and we'll go down completely different tracks because we're confused, or we get confused in our values and what our necessities are. But the pursuit of happiness is considered to be one of the goals and one of the purposes of Buddhist practice. Understanding that ultimate happiness comes from release, comes from full awakening. Freedom from all that binds us and keeps us bound. So what are some of the many other ways in which we may be in an unuseful way to pursue our happiness? One way is that we pursue happiness as an antidote. We think that happiness is the relief from what a compensatory state for some unpleasant and uncomfortable states that we're in. And there is a kind of happiness that comes from compensation or comes from relief. If you feel very stressed for a while, then you can get certain kind of happiness from getting a nice massage. But it's a kind of broader that happiness can come as a result of the relief that's been received. And the happiness that Buddhism is looking for is not the happiness, it's simply the happiness of relief. And then he can confuse relief for ultimate happiness, so relief is very temporary. So they're constantly looking for more relief. They have some relief temporarily and they get stressed again, they look for more relief. We have some values and ideas for what will make us happy. And wonderful things can happen to us. And we confuse this temporary happiness that can arise out of our values and ideals when they're fulfilled for a kind of more pervasive ultimate happiness. Fulfilled happiness is also considered in Buddhism to be somewhat shallow and superficial. Not to knock it, not to deny it when it arises. But fulfilled happiness is what I understand is when we have some ideal or some wish which gets fulfilled. So for example, if one of one is a promotion at work, I think that finally I get the promotion, I can feel really happy because my wish has been fulfilled. Until I find out that my coworker got two promotions above me, who reached the equal, and oh my God, then suddenly that happiness is lost. So the idea of happiness that comes from relief, the idea of happiness that comes from fulfilling certain values or certain desires, which can sometimes be quite unhealthy. Some people can feel happy in other people's unhappiness. If we get, you know, it really cuts someone down really well, some people will feel happiness and delight from that because, for all kinds of reasons, maybe because there's a sense of, well, if I cut that person down, if I judge that person, then I'm protecting myself and I'm safer than I'm free of being judged. If I'm going to be wrong with that person, then in some subtle way it kind of justifies who I am. So the pursuit of happiness is often occurs in unuseful ways. And I think it's useful to understand what we understand, to look at how we pursue happiness. Is it a value that we have and what do we think are the requirements we have for becoming happy? And looking very honestly at what we think we require for happiness, how reliable is that requirement? How ultimate is it? Is it happiness that can result only temporarily when it's fulfilled? You know, I really, really want that car. And then I have that car and then I'm happy for how long? And then happiness fades after you have the car full of love. And then I really, really want that house. You get that house and you're happy for a while and then that fades. Because this kind of happiness, it really wants something, we're kind of pursuing our desires. And we think that happiness is going to result from getting it and we get it perhaps if we're lucky. But then it already lasts so long. Can we find a kind of happiness that's not dependent on the fulfilling conditions, the fulfillment of desires, or only getting relief from our distress? One of the requirements for doing this, to developing a more realistic happiness, is, for some people it's not dependent on the fulfilling conditions, the fulfillment of desires, or only getting relief from our distress. And so the way that we can do this is to be honest about our happiness. Part of the unhealthy pursuit of happiness is avoiding a very honest assessment of how we are unhappy. And that if we could be avoiding unhappiness, denying it, numbing to it, then we'll start acting out, often, unconsciously and subconsciously, in unhealthy ways to find happiness or find relief or find what we want. So that's why the beginning of these 12 stages that we're talking about here begins with a very serious assessment of our suffering, appreciation of it in a sense. So the happiness that arises arises in the context of having been very honest about actually what's going on with us. There's not a happiness that we produce as a substitute for being honest about who we are, but arises out of that. One of the great happinesses that I feel, that I felt, maybe it's a little bit conditioned, but I get a lot of joy and happiness and inspiration by knowing that I have a spiritual path that I can follow, that I do follow that I'm engaged in. And so there are times when I suffer, and when I suffer I'm honest about it, but I feel kind of delight. Oh yeah, I know what to do with that. I know how to bring my mindfulness to it, I know how to explore it, I know how to bring a kind of non-reactive presence to it. I know how to bring myself, a spiritual practice to bear on it, so I don't feel like I'm stuck in it or lost in it or this is all there is. I feel so amazingly grateful for having discovered the Buddhist practice and path, because when things get really difficult for me, I don't feel lost in it. I feel like I have my bearings in it, I feel like there's something I can do and someplace I can go and develop practice. So the happiness of this path that we're talking about today arises out of, or the condition for it is a certain level of calm or tranquility. And how I understand this is that one of the ways that we keep ourselves from being happy is by being fragmented in our psyche, in our mind. We're pursuing many different pursuits and many different concerns and many different defenses and many different preoccupations. We get lost in our desires, in preoccupied, we get consumed with our aversion, we get filled with restlessness and anxiety, we get doubt, it becomes a basic quality of our mind sometimes. And when those things are operating, whether it's subtle or gross, aversion and desire and doubt and restlessness, it keeps the mind fragmented, it keeps the mind away from itself, because we're looking outwards towards objects, towards concerns. So something was going to fix us, something that's an object of desire which is going to do it for us, some object of aversion that's going to keep a day. And when the mind is looking outside of itself, it can't really settle very deeply on itself. So as we become more tranquil and more calm with ourselves, what happens is our energies stop flowing into neurotic desires and healthy flows of desires or aversions. It stops flowing into anxiety and restlessness, it stops flowing into doubt. And that energy that is available to flow into our practice itself, flow into a sense of being unified in our whole being, a unified sense of being, which is one of the important qualities that needs to arise, it does arise, as a person settles deeply into the meditative practice. This is a very important part of the conflict of meditation, is that we stop scattering our energies in all kinds of different directions, but all our energies are available to be unified. And the great joys and happiness that arise in our practice come when there's a unified feeling, when all our being, our body, our awareness and our mind, our intention, are all unified to the same purpose. And this is fairly unusual for people to have. Often our body and our minds and our intentions are in cross purposes. All of you probably experienced it to some small degree, maybe accidentally here today sitting. You sat here, you're going to sit here in this body, in this place, and as you were sitting here, you were thinking about something else. Your mind was elsewhere. It wasn't together in the same place as your body. You sit here and you sit down to meditate and say, well really what I'm going to do is sit here and be with my breathing. And you find yourself concerned with intentions or thoughts about other intentions you have in your life. How am I going to plan my life for the next week? So we have other intentions where the mind goes down, other things we want to accomplish or pursue. But when our intentions, our body and our mind are all united in the same place, that's when the deepest, the most fullest pervasive forms of joy, happiness have a chance to arise. So happiness then is a part of the path. Any time we discuss a path of practice, this sequential, there's a danger that people suffer because of it. They measure themselves where they're at. They have the danger of anticipation, anticipate where they're going to be, rather than really allowing themselves to settle deeply into practice, to anticipate where they're going and so on this out. Or they measure themselves negatively and not there yet. One way to take this description of the path, in a way that's going to be helpful, is as a suggestion of ways to look more carefully at your life. If happiness is not part of your spiritual practice at all, then you need to look at your spiritual life much more carefully. Maybe together with a teacher and talk to what's going on. Or maybe just simply knowing that delight and joy and happiness, to some degree, needs to be there, as it needs to be developed. We're helping you become more honest about its absence and what is there because of its absence. Why aren't you happy? In a meditation practice, for example, why aren't you happy? Are you striving too much? Are you being too demanding? Are you being filled with too much doubt about your capacity to do the meditation practice? What is it that gets in the way of feeling settled and happy on yourself as your practice? So these qualities like happiness and joy, tranquility, become a mirror not to measure ourselves by and criticize ourselves, but to help us understand ourselves honestly, to assess ourselves in an honest way. It's just one of the really amazing things to me, that you can sit down, close your eyes or not, or go for a walk or whatever, and happiness can arise for no good reason at all. That to me is really amazing, that you don't have to have a reason to be happy to be happy. Isn't that amazing? It blows me away. I found myself so happy, and why am I happy? I don't know why I'm happy. The conditions are there to arise out of who I am. And to have the experience of that kind of happiness gives us a very different perspective on all the pursuits of happiness that come in pursuing things which are going to make us happy. Not that those things are wrong, in which you stop doing them, but we put them in a better perspective when we realize that they're not so ultimate. We realize there's a possibility of happiness that just arises out of our being, and we give ourselves half a chance. Sometimes I like to look and just sit and look out a window. Do you ever do that? Just sit and look out a window, not do anything, and then I get happy. It takes a little while sometimes because my mind has all this momentum of things I'm supposed to be doing, planning, and whatever. And then I remind myself, I don't have to do any of that. And eventually I just sit and look out the window, and I feel happy. It's far from easy to become happy. And I mean, talking about this way today, maybe I'm making too much of your life of it. It's not so easy. Some people are phenomenally challenged to engage, to buy their unhappiness by the difficulties of their life and their mind. But it's by being very honest about that, and engaging in the honest practice of mindfulness that I think everyone will eventually find their capacity to be happy. Perhaps one of the great mottos, the great sayings, great bumper stickers of Buddhism, kind of encapsulating one little phrase, is the phrase, Sade Sata Sukihontu, may all beings be happy. That's the wish of Buddhists. May all beings be happy. May all beings everywhere be filled with happiness. So thank you for listening to Happiness Talk. Do you have any comments or questions? Yes? What are the three suffering things? They're the ones that are changed by greed, hate, and delusion. Yes? Does happiness have an opposite? I'll have to scan my mind to see if Buddhism comes up with an obvious opposite, but do you have an idea for an opposite? No. No? I mean, you know, if you look at some of the opposite, you see the opposite. And so often, there are also those who are doing that. But it's very much a good idea to have an opposite. Well, I think they're obvious opposite, and the Buddhist context would be suffering. And that is obvious because the words are very closely related. The word for suffering is dukkha, do is bad, and ka is, some people say, kind of like a wheel out of kilter, a wheel which is not true, so it's kind of... So when you're a little bit all censored, then you're suffering. And dukkha, Su means good. It's the same ka. So a good wheel and a bad wheel. So suffering is the opposite of happiness. But suffering, you know, includes so much. I'd like to explore a little bit of the idea of condition and the right condition for happiness. If you talk about happiness, it comes from the strike, you get something, and she's got this condition. What about the happiness, it sort of appears because something happens. For me, it often comes with the sunlight hits something. Right. Something like that. So this is a good question. Well, this is a good question. And you pointed to something, you pointed to some part of my, in my mind, was giving this talk that I felt a little bit careful about how to address. The... Until we have the experience of awakening, all our happinesses are conditioned. But there's different kinds of conditioning. So when our happiness is conditioned upon getting a raise or getting, you know, all kinds of things in the world, or when our happiness is conditioned upon some kind of some idea that props it up, then it's certainly conditioned. But that's different than the kind of happiness that arises when we're not looking outside for something that's going to do it for us, but it seems to arise much more out of our being itself. But when it arises out of our being itself, short of full awakening, it's also conditioned. But it's kind of different, qualitatively different kind of conditioning. So, you know, so the condition for the happiness we're talking about today is tranquility. We both have some sense of calm or tranquility or ease for that kind of happiness to kind of show itself. But it has its feelings, the happiness that arises at a very deep meditation, for example, has a feeling it doesn't need anything, it's just arising out of our being. But it's conditioned by our ability to be mindful, our ability to be concentrated in all these things. So, that making some sense? Does that answer your question? Yes. Does the unconditioned avoid a very special case? Does that involve a very degree of conditioning? Yes. There's no relationship between happiness and beauty, or the perception of beauty. There's a connection between pleasure and beauty. And there's a connection between pleasure and happiness for a lot of people. There's a necessary connection. But for a lot of people, happiness can arise out of experience of pleasure. And pleasure can arise out of beauty. That's my understanding. But someone else might have something different to say. Can you speak more about this? I do. I would also say that that helps a lot of happiness from just being able to be accepting of something that's very important. Very nice. You hear that? Andrea says she can discover how to be happy, very happy, from being very accepting of something which is unpleasant. Sometimes I try to find what the words are, but try to experience happiness, to find happiness. The preceding beauty is something which is intrinsically beautiful to myself. That's what I'm asking. I don't know if recognizing the beauty in something that is not intrinsically beautiful by some measure is a step towards happiness, or if that's a condition of happiness. I shouldn't worry about the beauty aspect. I don't know if that makes sense. Do you follow that? I think it sounds like a worthwhile thing to do. As long as you're not putting all your happiness eggs in that basket, you realize that it's a kind of conditioned happiness that arises out of wanting things to be a certain way in the world. It sounds a good thing to do, to look for the beauty. You see people who maybe initially you don't think are very pleasant person, but you look at a spark on their eyes or look behind their face or something. You see some beauty there. You see some delight. You see some wonderful humanity there. It brings pleasure and happiness and depth of connectedness, which brings a kind of happiness also. I think it's a worthwhile thing to do with what you just described. Even though it's external. Even though it's external, you have to realize that that's what it is. You realize that there are other forms of happiness. What some people do is they only think the externals are going to make them happy. That's all they ever pursue. That's going to cause suffering. Yes? In looking at the relationship with beauty or pleasure and happiness, it seems like any of the spiritual qualities could bring the fish to happiness. So compassion, gratitude, any of those could be what your friend has brought. Right. I think so. I completely agree with you. What's interesting though is that there's... This is what's being pointed to here in the Buddhist Path, is there are different kinds of happiness or degrees of happiness. All happiness is basically appreciated, unless they're based on wholesome kind of association. But as a sixth level, sixth stage in this path that's being described, it's not just simply the happiness that comes out of gratitude, the happiness that comes out of some spiritual quality like compassion perhaps, but it's a happiness that comes very clearly out of the contentment and tranquility where all our forces of our life are unified. So we're not working in any kind of way across purposes with us ourselves. So it's possible, for example, to feel grateful and feel the happiness out of that. But there's just a little kind of voice inside of us that says, well, am I obligated now to return the kindness? So we're kind of split a little bit, mostly feeling happiness, but there's a little bit of protectiveness and concern. The happiness that arises at the sixth stage here is a happiness for a whole being suffused and together and united on this kind of happiness. It's all pervasive and also effusing. So there's different kinds of happiness in this. Makes sense? Oh, this is an important point, is that many people will confuse great pervasive experiences of joy and happiness for enlightenment. And some people have argued, all right, this is it. So you need to have, if that's the case, you need a good teacher to kind of... Get off that one, please. You don't want to be stuck in happiness and joy, please. After you've gone through it for a while, you've got enough of this. There's better things than happiness and joy. This is really fun. So I tell this story a lot, but I apologize for repeating it. I've heard it enough times. On one retreat, having great experiences of joy and rapture just kind of just ripple through our body. And it's building into it for a while until I went to some deeper states. And then, oh, there's deeper states. So I was doing my walking meditation one day and the same level of rapture was beginning to surface. I knew there were deeper states. I said, oh, I'm not going to deal with this superficial joy, you know. And so I held it at day. I'm not going to deal with joy, you know. I held it at day. And until finally I started getting a headache and realized, this is ridiculous. So I kind of let go of my resistance to the joy. And then I just walked through very quickly and passed and then I dropped into the deeper states. And what I didn't know at the time was that some of these states, some of these are progressive states that kind of fall. We often have to go through these states in order to go to deep. It's like, you can't just go from one to four. You have to go one, two, three, four usually for many people. So I had to go through one, two, to get to four. But I didn't know that so I was trying to avoid two. Yes? I was thinking about what you said about fully awakening and happiness and experience, especially happiness. You remember something about the ability of the awakening one to be pleasant and unpleasant simultaneously. And if that ability would somehow cloud the perception of happiness or not. I mean, it's happiness I know of a different nature. It's not happiness, it's happiness. And inside. And I guess maybe in my own mind I think of awakening being very equinamidous with the world. And finding the source maybe of happiness inside. Not inside even, it's just, I don't know how to say this, but the quality of happiness maybe is what she was trying to say. Or conditioned or unconditioned. Very different. Yes? I'm not sure how to respond to you, but in the Buddha said that nirvana is the highest happiness. It's very important not to make any of the normal associations we have of what happiness is with that particular kind of happiness. Because it might feel and sense and look very different than the normal kind of happiness. So for example, some people, I think it's in somewhere that peace is the highest happiness. So you might not think of peace as being kind of happiness, but the Buddha is always a peace. And it's a kind of wonderful happiness, but it doesn't have the energetic excitement, for example, of joy. And happiness, so equanimity, for example, is a lot more pleasant. There's a much more pleasure in equanimity than there is in happiness. So some people would say that equanimity is greater happiness than happiness because it's so much more wonderful and sublime. So what exactly is being defined as happiness? Greater happiness is equanimity. Peace. Maria? Maria? I would say this way, that happiness is a much more common enjoy as happiness is. But, first of all, happiness is very very common, very common enjoy. I would say it this way, that happiness is a much more common in joy, much more common states than people realize. And if we weren't so preoccupied, we would notice them more often. The opportunity to feel some joy and happiness are the potential possibilities there much more often than if we're not preoccupied. So if we somehow drop a preoccupation, just notice what's going on more. I think we tend to be happier. I think as we go around and around and around. It's more like a system. I don't think the idea of a linear path that we just follow, you can get better and better and better is how it works. It's kind of spiral and we get kind of mixed up. Sometimes we jump around a little bit. I don't think it's too linear here. We look over our lifetime. It's not so linear. Sometimes in meditation it can feel quite linear as the concentration develops. But in a wider spiritual life, I think it's best not to be looking for some absolutely linear path. I remember talking very much about that poem, Every Day is a New Day. And it's like I know. And it's like you're going to talk to something else. If you lost your own child, it's doing you a good thing. You know, it's a question of truth. It's amazing. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. It's a question of how you feel. If you lost your own child, would that be a good day? You know, I don't think human life is meant to kind of always be happy. We were supposed to respond to the conditions around us and someone else was suffering. We were supposed to feel empathy and empathy feels uncomfortable. But it's possible. There's a kind of sense of rightness or happiness or joy or ease or I don't know what the right word would might be that comes from our non-resistance to the way things are. So if something horrible happens to us, something difficult happens to us, we might really feel distressed by it in a sense. But there's a non-resistance to the kind of an acceptance of that. We're not resisting it. They're not struggling against the inevitable, which can have a quality of, maybe some people say kind of happiness that we carry with us even into the unhappy states. I think the danger I think in a kind of talk like today is to set the expectation you're always supposed to be a certain way. If you're spiritually developed in a certain way, you're supposed to always be happy. I don't think that's the case at all. I think when we increase the opportunities for us to be happy, they can more likely. But we also make it more likely that we feel life more fully and feel the difficulty and the suffering of life much more fully than we do otherwise. And if you place yourself in the middle of some great worldly distress, I don't know if it's appropriate to go around this one. There's a different kind of happiness. Maybe where the person feels, maybe you bring a certain kind of peace to the situation. That peace is kind of the happiness, but if you lose your only child, I think that would be a distressing state to be in. And that there's no resistance to it. It's really inevitable. Maybe that's also a kind of definition that every day is a good day. Every day is what it is. Yes? As you increase, you're more able to be hopeful. As you resist it, that causes you to persist. That's well said. As a teacher, one of the things I'm looking for when I talk to students is not any particular state that they've attained, but their flexibility to move between states. Even if so-called ultimate states of realization, I'm not so much interested in that as I am. Are they flexible to move in and out of it? I'm thinking about my role in finding my happiness. After experiencing great loss, my experience was that the grief came from the cells of my body that was uncontrollable, like being buried in a flood or something like that. And I'm wondering what the flip side of that is. Is happiness just come from the cells of my body? I don't know. What are you talking about? And where I'm coming from is this uncontrollable part, this feeling of just being buried in what the opposite of that is. Well, you know, I don't know so much about this area, but my understanding so far, my limited understanding is that there is a, what we must call a natural sense of pain of loss that anyone will feel when it's something we feel very dear and very close to us is lost. And practice is not supposed to take that away from us. There are indications in the Buddhist sutras that the Buddha felt very acutely the loss of his mother. He died when he was seven years old, and that was a loss that kind of stayed with him until he was through his adulthood. After he was a Buddha, he was still concerned about that relationship and went out of his way to somehow deal with it. The intensity of our sense of loss, our grief, is often complicated by a whole slew of possible attachments that we have. And so if we just say kind of carte blanche, you know, your grief is just cellular, just the nature of reality, just to have that intense grief, it might be overlooking the fact that there might be an element of it being somewhat natural, but that for most of us, it's often intertwined, entangled with all kinds of fears and desires and securities and attachments that make up who we are. And to give and to claim that even though it feels cellular, say, well, just cellular, it's in my cells, and then kind of have a blind eye to how it's being fueled by our so-called attachments, isn't the right thing either to say. I was very moved by a story that a woman told me who came on retreat, and had much more experience with grief than I had, I had had so far. And she, in the course of one year, lost her father, her brother, her best friend, and someone else. And so she was grieving a lot. And she came on retreat. And she said that the difference between grieving at home and grieving at home on retreat is in both situations, grief came like a wave, powerful waves. But at home, the waves would last for a long time, like for a few hours at a time. But on retreat, they were much more intense, the waves, but they only lasted for minutes. And her understanding of it was that at home, even though she kind of gave herself a chance to feel the grief, there were so many distractions at home, so many things to kind of keep her occupied and concerned about and worry about and whatever that, that it somehow erupted the clean floor of the grief through here. But on the retreat, it was completely unbrocked and undistracted and undiluted. And so the grief would pass through much more intensely, but then it would pass, and then she had periods of great peace for a while until the next wave would come through. I don't know if I'm responding to you, if you've got that. I have a comment about in living a harsh fraction of your life, and there's three states of controversy, that it's hard to recognize, we sort of need a happiness 101 course, it's hard to recognize happiness like Helen was saying about the way the sun shines or the way the sun shines on your face. I can remember doing that when I was a very young child, and it was like a state that was in, but it's like the duration of time in this other narrow state neutral or something. It's very, very hard to even recognize that that's happiness. You see so much TV behind it. Yeah, beautiful. Well said. I think there's many kinds of happinesses, and we can become much more experts at what makes us happy. And that kind of narrow, somewhat narrow approach to happiness that comes through the meditative life is only a part of becoming much more of an expert of happiness. One of the things that I've learned that makes me happier is to understand my belief systems and how I get unhappy based on my belief. And it's possible sometimes to reframe the situation. So actually, I don't see it in an unhappy way. And I see it, you know, it's a glass half full or half empty. You know, sometimes you switch in the way you look at things sometimes, reframe it. So rather than thinking, oh, you know, how does this terrible thing happen to me? It's like, oh, oh, this is an opportunity for me to learn about how to respond to a difficult situation. And maybe in the future, when I meet someone else who has had the same difficulty, I can talk to them out of experience. A lot of people have told me that they've gone through tremendous suffering in their life, real difficulty, are very unhappy about it, didn't see any benefit to it. But then later in their life, they were so grateful to have gone through it because then they were able to help some friend or they were going through the same thing. It wouldn't have been nice if you had reframed it earlier. You know, this is probably going to help my friends later. So there's a lot of power to reframing because we often frame things, and we often see that how we frame things is optional. So they're kind of cognitive, you know, work sometimes helpful. That's one way. Yeah. There's a book out called How We Choose to Be Happy. Actually, James Perez was with his group having everybody read it. And actually, the people who wrote it, as we put on that spend-it-on spirit document, they interviewed hundreds of people who were happy, and they came down to like 12 things at the old having time. It didn't matter if economics or anything. Reframing was absolutely one of them, that you reframe your situation. But I really encourage everybody to read it. It's really, really good book. Yeah. So there's lots we can do to become more experts on happiness. And a book is one way. There's all kinds of different ways of reconsidering. So, you know, we don't learn enough about how to be happy, I think, in our culture. We don't have happiness 101. Buddhism is kind of like happiness 202. So, you know, sometimes if you spend the whole time studying 202, you don't learn 101. And you come to Buddhism, and Buddhism doesn't teach you 101, it teaches you 202. So that's a shortcoming of Buddhism. You're expected to do 101. So read the book. Yeah. In Bhutan, which is a Buddhist country, they don't have a gross national product. This is really true. They have a gross national happiness. And we're always looking to complete the gross national happiness of the family. So may all of us be happy and divided. And if we're not happy, let us at least maybe feel some confidence that there's a practice and a path you can follow. So thank you for listening. And I think it was a little bit clumsy for me today to talk about happiness. It's a difficult topic to talk about. I apologize for that. And now please happily enjoy your potluck. Thank you.
