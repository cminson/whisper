Dharmette: The Value of Nothing   
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on May 23 , 2012  
 
 
An interesting issue about t hese short talks I give 
occurs when I find my self with nothing to talk about. 
Then I do a little reflection. I consider that maybe it’s 
meaningful for some of you to come here and listen to 
the Dharma. Since I want to respect you and your 
interest, I should try to think of something profound to 
say. After all of these years as a dharma teacher, 
certai nly I should have something profound and 
meaningful to say. But then I look , and nothing  is there. 
Then, I think, “But that’s profound. That’s really good. 
That’s what I’ll talk about today: the value of nothing. ” 
 
Sometimes when we pay attention to ourselves, we 
realize what we are up to. For example, we might 
realize that we’re afraid, so we spend a lot of time 
planning  – believing it’s important to plan and organize 
for the world to be a safe place. Then, at some point, we 
realize we don’t have to do all of this planning to be 
safe; so there is a letting go of planning.  
 
Or maybe there are a lot of desires  – wanting things to 
be a certain way, having certain acquisitions or 
experiences. At some point , we realize that in having all of these desires , we aren’t really here  – not really living. 
And, then, sometimes desire can be let go of.   
 
Some  people live with issues of identity  – wanting to be 
someone in the eyes of others , or in their own eyes, o r 
wanting to attain a certain status or recognition. 
Hopefully, at some point, by paying attention, they 
realize that this is suffering ; so there is a letting go of 
striving to be someone, or proving  or defending  oneself, 
or get ting a promotion in order to be seen better in 
people’s eyes . 
 
Sometimes people carry resentment or anger that 
simmer and lead to scheming , planning , or being self -
critical. How could I be this way? But in paying close 
attention, they notice the cost of all of these things , and 
realiz e how much of what hurts can be let go of. One of 
the remarkable things is to appreciate how much you 
can let go of. How much you can stop doing. That’s for 
your betterment. Having these things interferes with 
your life, and diminishes your life. 
 
Perhaps,  not having the fear, the anger, the desire, the 
issues of identity, enhances you. You’re more open, 
freer, more at ease, more relaxed. After a while , you 
see that having less means having more in the spiritual 
life or the practice life.  
 
Then some people think, “Oh, this is great. Now I’m going to do a spiritual practice. Now I’m going to have to 
do it well. I was going in the wrong direction before, and 
now I’ve found the true path. I have to learn all about it. 
Let’s get all the books ou t.” You don’t have to learn 
about it. You can let go.  
 
Or some people  with identity issues  think that to be a 
good Buddhist involves looking around the room to see 
what all the Buddhists are wearing . I better go out and 
get a new wardrobe, the Buddhist costume , so I can be  
a good Buddhist.  
 
Or maybe it’s always having a lot of loving kindness  – 
showing up in only a loving way . Heaven forbid that I 
come to IMC grumpy!  
 
Sometimes when people come to Buddhism, they pick 
up the very thing they’re trying to fr ee themselves from 
– 
desires, identity issues, aversions. Then at some point , 
if they’re lucky, they realize, “I don’t need to do this. I 
can let go of being a good Buddhist. I don’t have to be a 
good Buddhist.” You’re not going to be free if you try too 
hard at that. So there’s a letting go of that.  
 
With a ll these things you want to do and attain, at some 
point, you come to realize that you can do less. Maybe 
you don’t have to do anything. Maybe there are times 
when it’s ok just to be. Be present in a sim ple way.  Maybe always wanting something interferes with what’s 
best in us. One possibility in meditation is to learn how 
to put down all the desires, the fears, the doings , and 
realize the wonderfulness of having nothing.   
 
Someone who is fu lly mature in the Theravadin track is 
referred to as akiñcana: ‘a’ means ‘nothing ’ or ‘not;’ 
‘kiñcana’ means ‘something. ’ So, “not something. ” In the 
monastic tradition , it partly refers to someone who 
doesn ’t have a lot of  acquisitions. But from a spiritual 
point of view , it means someone who no longer has the 
desire for acquisitions, and no longer has th e 
tendencies toward greed , anger,  and aversion. They 
have nothing , and feel comfortable with having nothing.  
 
Just show up and be . No need to have to give a good 
talk. No need to have anything to talk about . No need to 
have anything happen , except to show up and be here. 
That’s how it is for me today. I had nothing to say , and I 
felt fine about it , and now I try to sha re being fine about 
it with you, so I had something to say.  
 
We have a couple of minutes. Do you have any 
comments or questions about this? Maybe you have 
some really good rebuttals or protests  – like, “That was 
fine, but there are things that I really hav e to do. It’s 
never good enough to do nothing, to have nothing. ” 
 
Audience member 1:  I was reading through a book of Zen aphorisms once and came across the story of one 
the very early Zen teachers in San Francisco. He had 
some kind of menial job , but whene ver he saved 
enough money, he’d rent a hall in the city and put up 
signs announcing an upcoming meditation. Once on a 
sign he said, “There will be absolutely nothing of any 
importance said tonight.” Then he couldn’t understand 
why no one showed up. This is n’t really a comment on 
your talk, but this story came to mind.  
 
GF: Our sign outside could say , “The Insight Nothing 
Center, ” “Nothing Meditati on Center. ” That person was 
Nyogen Sen zaki. He came around  1905 . He had been a 
teacher in Japan but was told not to teach when he first 
came here, so he spent twenty years just working in 
laundromats and elsewhere. At some point he began 
teaching.  
 
Audience member 2: I’m really happy tha t you had 
nothing to say , and that  you said you had nothing to 
say. For many years , I’ve thought  that I always have to 
have something interesting to say. It’s like a 
performance of life or something. Many times I’ve said 
to friends, “If I don’t have anything interesting to say, do 
you still want to visit with me? I might be boring for you.” 
Sometimes people would come over , and we would just 
sit and do nothi ng. I don’t know if that was a good thing 
or not . It just gives me a lot of peace to know that I don’t 
have to always be coming up with ideas. That’s where my stress comes from, having to be on all the time, 
having this constant flow. So I really appreciat e you r 
doing that.  
 
GF: Beautiful. I hope that you will develop more 
confidence that you don’t have to show up and do 
anything. What can happen? Two things. One is that 
there is no requirement to do anything, and sometimes 
that can actually create a very g ood connection with 
another person, doing nothing with someone. I have told 
the story of when we were considering buying this 
building. The ministers who owned it were Christian 
mystics. They sat in silence. They wanted us to have 
the building because we s at in silence , and w e would 
continue the silent practice. It took a long time before 
they showed us the building. Finally they were going to 
show it. I came first and met the two ministers, the 
couple. They gave us a tour of the building. It’s a small 
building, so it didn’t take long. We were talking, but as 
the conversatio n proceeded, there were gaps in silence. 
The gaps grew longer and longer. We finally came into 
this room – the main sanctuary room – and sat down on 
the pews that used to be here. One of those gaps of 
silence happened , and it continued for ten minutes. It 
was a very beautiful, meaningful time. Then some of our 
other people came to see the building as well. When 
they came in, we got up and greeted them. When I had 
the chance, I went over to  one of the ministers and said, 
“Someday we’ll have to continue where we left off.” So something can happen when nothing’s happening, 
something deeper sometimes. Sometimes all the doings 
interfere with the deeper, heartfelt , human connection 
that can occur . That’s one thing.  
 
The other thing that can happen sometimes when you 
do nothing , and you’re relaxed and comfortable with 
doing nothing is that it allows for some deeper 
emerging, some deeper intuition to bubble up. It might 
be very different from what i s conventionall y expected 
for you to say or do. W hat comes o ut of you might be 
much wiser i f you relax, don’t think , but give yourself 
lots of space and time to see what wants to emerge. 
There is an expression: “Trust the emergence. ” If you’re 
not comforta ble with nothing, it’s hard to trust the 
emergence.  
 
This was meaningful for me : how me aningful this was 
for you.
