 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. I want to say a few more words about samadhi and samadhi as a continuity of a mindfulness practice. I was struck by this line from my last retreat that the teacher said that this is how we practice samadhi. So we're learning to recognize that samadhi naturally arises as the felt sense. I was very relieved when I heard this. So I want to unpack this one-liner a little bit by pointing out a few key words here. The first one is felt sense. In our mindfulness practice, sometimes we can be practicing awareness from our head. There's a kind of head-heavy way of practicing mindfulness. We're mindful of the breath. Somehow our mind hovers over on the breath. And there's this term, a felt sense, invites us in a different orientation. It's actually as if the feeling and sensing comes within our bodies, within the human system. It's not me directing it in some way. But this feeling and sensing kind of drops underneath of our conceptual ideas, our conceptual mind. And so often when we have to use the word to describe what's felt, what's sensed, we have to use the word to kind of describe the sensations with it. Finding our own direct experience, I could just drop into the body and feel and sense it as they are. Sometimes the words come, sometimes they don't. Sometimes images come, and sometimes they don't. We don't need them for the felt sense to be there on its own. And so this form of practicing is getting to really know our experience from the rawness and elemental levels of our experience, rather than boxing it up based on our ideas. As I remember for a long time, how I practiced mindfulness of breath is based on my idea of what the breath is supposed to be like. And so I spent a lot of time trying to shuffle and maneuver my breath into how my mind thinks that it's supposed to move this way and that way. I got a lot of headache and I didn't realize that was happening because I just thought I was trying very hard and I was kind of directing it and controlling it. Not until one day I literally feel like I was suffocating myself. I thought the breath was supposed to happen in a certain way. My mind was really gripping it and trying to shuffle it and at the corner of my awareness, all of a sudden noticing that there is a form of movement in my body that was happening. And if I kind of just allow that movement to kind of move its own way, all of a sudden I could breathe. And that was a kind of turning moment of realizing, oh my goodness, all this time I was really breathing from my head and trying to direct it and control it by letting go of that boxed idea and just kind of dropping into the felt sense all of a sudden. The knowing of the breath happened naturally. That didn't need a kind of a big time doing on it. So this first phrase, felt sense, is very important in our practice and learning to drop into the felt sense and letting it guide the way. And so when we talk about mindful awareness and to know our experience, the knowing happens in our system. It's not us in the head knowing it, the knowing happens naturally. And so the second phrase is that samadhi naturally arises as the felt sense. This is a really good news because so many of us, you know, trying to get concentrated and trying to get settled. But this one says it's naturally happening if we just drop into the felt sense. Because when we're staying with the felt sense of our experience, we are very present. We're right there. And often what distracts us, like our planning minds or thinking minds and judging minds and storytelling minds, are not there. They're kind of settled, settled in the background or taking a temporary break. And so we get to really just stay with what's present and dropping into the very raw felt sense. And this way our mind naturally connects with our experience, no matter what experience it is. It doesn't have to be one object. Doesn't have to be one breath or body sensations. It can be all kinds of things happening in our lived experience, and yet we're collected. We're right there. We're with them. And so that's a sense of gatheredness, not necessarily gathering onto one object, but gathered by no longer becoming fragmented through our mind's thinking, mind's storytelling. And I love that in the commentaries, there was kind of like 27 phrases that define Samadhi. And this list ended with a set of words that I just love. And so it says, Samadhi as harmony, welfare and happiness. It didn't say Samadhi with a breath. It was just, you know, you're happy and harmonious. And welfare has a sense of a wellbeing there. I didn't necessarily need an object. And so this is a natural occurrence when we are connected with the felt sense. And the last word I'll highlight is we're learning to recognize, recognition. We're learning to recognize that the Samadhi naturally arises as a felt sense. So there is a way when we're connected with our felt sense, as is, as it unfolds, that we begin to recognize some of the dimensions of Samadhi in our experience. That is maybe we are settled, we're collected. Maybe all those thoughts that tends to take away are not there. May have a sense of wellbeing, maybe a kind of happiness that's bubbling up here. Maybe you feel very pleasant, pleasant in the body, pleasant in the mind. So we begin to recognize, oh, oh, you know, I haven't really kind of intended to do this, but it's here. It's just here. And so learn to recognize it has an effect on us. When we begin to recognize that this here, it can also uplift our heart and mind, our being, and kind of offer a sense of confidence and trust. Oh, this is good. You know, I'll keep going. And so that recognition has an effect on us. And so in this way, Samadhi can be cultivated through kind of continuity of mindfulness, always mindfulness one moment at a time, noticing what is happening and knowing it through the felt sense. And at the same time, we're also cultivating Samadhi. And so may we all continue practicing in this way that supports our wellbeing. Thank you. Those are the words I have. Thank you for practicing together and our managers.
