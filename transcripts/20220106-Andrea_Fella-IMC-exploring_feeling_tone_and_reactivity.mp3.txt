The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So today I thought to respond to a question or maybe two of ones that had
been submitted over the last few weeks. The first question is a question about
working with Vedana or feeling tone. The Buddha talked about feeling tone,
whether experience is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, as being a really
important area to attend to because it is from feeling tone when something's
pleasant. We tend to not like it, not want it, want it to go away. We tend to
not necessarily notice the feeling tone and we're already reacting to it.
We're already wanting to push it away if it's unpleasant. If it's pleasant, we
tend to want to lean in towards it, have more of it, hold on to it, keep it, and if
it's neutral or neither pleasant nor unpleasant, then often where it's kind
of spacing out around it or not really noticing it or maybe we're bored when
there's neutral feeling tone. So the question is, I've been playing with
Vedana during meditation and in daily life. I often find that I identify
phenomena as pleasant or unpleasant only after I've already moved towards or
away from it. Almost as if in retrograde fashion, I experience craving and
attachment before the feeling tone, before Vedana. What are some strategies
for me to experience Vedana before craving and attachment? Now this is a
question, I think, that it's an interesting question and one that I
think there's a lot of different angles to, so I'll probably talk about it for a
little while here, but first I want to just just mention or say that this is
this experience that you're describing of noticing the reactivity before
noticing the feeling tone, that's kind of how our minds work with feeling tone.
Feeling tone is a kind of subtle experience and so often, very often we
are already reacting and we don't even know what we are reacting to. You know,
we're already frustrated or angry or confused or wanting to hold on to
something or, you know, feeling good about things and we don't really know
why. You know, we're just kind of responding to that very basic
level of feeling tone without really knowing the feeling tone. So this
description is kind of how we are before we come to meet the teachings of the
Buddha in some way. It's much much more rare for us to actually recognize, oh
there was this unpleasant sensation, this unpleasant experience, and that's why
I'm having all of this reactivity. And so the that experience of noticing the
reactivity first, that's pretty common. Even after we even after we
start learning about mindfulness and learning about being attentive to
experience, the reactivity, the craving, the attachment, the aversion are all way
more obvious than feeling tone. So we're likely going to experience the or
notice the craving, the attachment, the aversion before we notice the feeling
tone because the feeling tone is so subtle. So I just want to kind of
normalize that. It's not at all unusual and in fact it's often the way the
practice moves, the direction the practice moves in as we start to
understand the reactivity and we understand how much, how painful it is.
It's like that that becomes almost like a wake-up bell for us when we have a kind
of suffering or a kind of reaction or craving, a tension, a contraction in the
body wanting to hold on to something or an aversion. That's a it's a more
obvious experience and so we notice it pretty quickly. So mindfulness kind of
gets attuned to that experience and it wakes up with that experience of
reactivity. It's less attuned to the experience of the feeling tone of the
more subtle, pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feeling and so it's not, it's
often at least early on in our practice for sure and even way in there. I mean I
still have this happen all the time, this kind of noticing, oh I'm reacting, you
know, okay, you know, well what is it that I'm reacting to? What is the pleasant
or unpleasant experience in the field? So this kind of seeing that there is a
reactivity is an understanding that there is some feeling tone that is a
pleasant or unpleasant feeling tone that's kind of maybe the springboard we
could say off of which that reactivity is coming. That's an understanding that
comes to us as we practice, as we learn about the teachings of the Buddha, as we
even begin to see how, oh yeah, I am reacting and it is that feeling, you
know, that's what I'm reacting to. So we begin to understand that connection. We
understand the connection between the feeling tone and the reactivity. So this
is all really useful to understand that. In terms of seeing the feeling tone
before the craving and attachment, what I would say is the first place to begin is
exactly where you are which is seeing that there's a reactivity and realizing
oh there is some kind of feeling tone that's connected to that reactivity. Now
that isn't always obvious, you know, what the feeling tone is, you know. It's
really helpful when you notice there's reactivity. The first piece maybe
before like trying to see the feeling tone first is to recognize okay well
there's this unpleasant reaction that I'm having. There's this reactivity in the
mind. So then kind of maybe do a little bit of exploration. What is that
reactivity connected with? It can sometimes surprise us, you know, that we
find ourselves in a state of confusion or fear or aversion and, you know, and we
may not, we think, we might think we know what we're reacting to, but if we
start when we start to be curious it's like well what is actually going on
here? And so sometimes a little investigation, a kind of a checking
around in the environment of the body, of the experience. First check in in the
body. Is there something physical in the body? Some touch, some physical
sensation that's unpleasant and does that physical sensation feel connected to
the reactivity? Sometimes we might find something, something really kind of
clear and obvious. Oh that's what it is. I'm really hungry. That's what's going on.
Or, you know, maybe there's a pain in the body that we hadn't quite noticed. At
other times it might kind of be well there's kind of this little unpleasant
stuff, but it feels like this reactivity is connected to something else. You
know, it doesn't really feel like it doesn't have the intuitive click that
it's connected to that physical unpleasant or physical pleasant
sensation. And so then you might check in well what about is there anything that
I'm seeing or is there anything I'm hearing? So, you know, kind of go through
the senses. Check through all the senses and see is there some pleasant or
unpleasant experience connected with any of the physical senses starting with
that because the physical senses are more obvious. So is it something I'm
seeing? Is it something I'm hearing? Something I'm smelling? Tasting? Touch
senses probably the main one. Touch and hearing are two big ones. Seeing another.
But so checking into that is it some actual physical sensation in our
physical sense space is where the unpleasantness is. And again, it might
or might there might or not not be some click that's like oh that's what's
happening. You know, I'm seeing that thing or hearing that thing. Maybe there's
been this background noise of a leaf blower going that's that I hadn't
really noticed that's just got me on edge. You know, something like that could
be oh that's what's going on. That's the unpleasant experience that this whole
thing is connected to. And if it's not in the physical realm then if there's a
little more subtle kind of question or checking in well what? What's going on in
the mind? You know, is there some kind of idea, belief, or is there some emotion or
mood that's kind of in the background that I hadn't really noticed or felt? So
kind of broadening the attention. It's like well what else is going on and and
see if there might be something pleasant or unpleasant or you know
potentially even neutral going on that that reactivity is connected with. So
that's that's the first step partly like in terms of beginning to connect or
understand how the reactivity is springing out of a response to or is a
response to some kind of feeling tone. That understanding that connection,
understanding or kind of making that connection through exploring well here's
the feeling this reactivity. I don't like something. I'm really frustrated. Okay
well what's going on? Is there something that I feel like I'm not something
pleasant that I'm not able to get or something unpleasant that I feel like
I'm not able to get rid of? What is going on? And so that maybe begin to let
you get a sense of what the pleasant or unpleasant thing is that this
reactivity is connected to. Once there's that sense of here's an unpleasant
experience and here's a reaction or here's a pleasant experience and here's a
craving here's an attachment then the next step would be to just hold both to
kind of understand or recognize yeah that's happening that unpleasant feeling
and I don't like it. That's what's going on right now. With that kind of practice
holding or recognizing or understanding okay there's this unpleasant thing and
there's this reaction to it. When we hold both at the same time and understand
that there's a kind of connection between them sometimes what will happen is
the reaction will fade. It will just be like oh of course you know there's that
you know that sound of the leaf blower going that's what this kind of agitation
is about and when we kind of connect or notice the sound of the leaf blower we
can just know well there's the leaf blower you know maybe maybe the
reactivity goes away and we're just with that sound of the leaf blower and
maybe we can notice well that's unpleasant or maybe it even stops
becoming unpleasant because it's the it was the resistance to potentially
something like the resistance to the leaf blower that turned it into an
unpleasant phenomena and so seeing that you know seeing potentially seeing the
reactivity die or diminish you might learn something about the connection
between the feeling tone and the reactivity and how the reactivity can
then alter the feeling tone. So there's a lot to learn through this kind of
exploration around holding or being with both the feeling tone and the
reactivity. Now the the other piece about the so at that moment at that moment
if you have at that moment touched into or see oh here's a feeling tone and the
reactivity has fallen away and the question it didn't say that that had
happened but if this happens if you see in a moment that there's a feeling tone
and the reactivity falls away in that moment you are aware of the feeling tone
without reactivity arising. So that's that's kind of it kind of is going it's
going you haven't seen the feeling tone before any reactivity arose but you are
now in a place of seeing the feeling tone and there isn't reactivity
arising. So that begins to give you the sense or the flavor or the taste of what
it's like to experience the feeling tone before craving or attachment or a
version arises because in that moment I mean going forward you know going
forward you're you are experiencing feeling tone before craving because
craving is not arising in this moment. It might it might be it might be
interesting to kind of hang out with that feeling tone for a little while the
leaf blower for instance let's use that keep using that you know it's like the
leaf blower it's like oh it's just the leaf blower okay well let's just hang
out with the leaf blower for a little while and then you might notice oh
there's the leaf blower and oh it's kind of sort of unpleasant but not really oh
it's kind of neutral and then you might notice that it turns unpleasant again
and then you might notice that the reactivity arises. So you know if you
if you hang out with a feeling tone that has habitually in the past created or
sprung into a reactivity if you can kind of see a reactivity come and go then you
can learn something about what's going on in that in that place where the
reactivity springs out of the feeling tone. This is a really useful exploration
because in the teachings of the Buddha the the the teaching around how craving
arises craving arises independence on feeling tone and so learning something
about that connection learning something about the feeling tone and what it is
about the feeling tone and it's not just the feeling tone there's something kind
of in the field with feeling tone that creates the springing into into craving
into reactivity. It's usually some kind of a view some kind of an idea that it
that the that the the feeling tone becomes a problem to be solved or to be
gotten rid of or to hold on to. So you know that that that exploration around
well there's feeling tone and what is it that in that place where you you know
there tends to be reactivity maybe seen the reactivity fall away possible that
seeing the the feeling tone and then maybe feel seeing the reactivity come
and go you'll learn something about that climate of ideas perhaps of views of
something else going on that may be contributing to the movement from the
feeling tone to the reactivity. So this whole exploration around feeling tone
and reactivity is useful whether or not you're seeing the feeling tone before
reactivity or not that whole that whole of the whole exploration is useful. We
don't have to one of the one of the maybe potentially misunderstandings around the
teaching about craving feeling tone leads to craving is that in order to have
freedom we might think well I have to experience the feeling tone without the
reactivity in order for freedom to happen but that would have to be the
mind state that would have to be where the the mind is to see that have that
kind of freedom but the the teachings indicate that at any point of whatever is
arising if it's craving that's arising we can see that craving and understand
something about how it comes to be understand something about how it falls
apart and freedom can happen right in the midst of that of seeing and
understanding craving freedom can happen right in the midst of seeing and
understanding the identification of self-hatred so it's not that we have to
somehow get back to what was it that led to what was the unpleasant experience or
memory or thought or belief that led to the self-hatred we don't necessarily
have to see that sometimes we can just see through the construction of self
hatred or the construction of the aversion in the moment and have the
experience of the vanishing of that and feel the freedom of that so so we don't
have to get back to the place where we somehow see feeling tone before craving
or before reactivity however it is possible it's possible to see that so I
would say the first piece so what I've described so far talked about so far you
know just the exploration around why you have reactivity that's where you start
so be curious about what kind of feeling tones might be connected to that you
know what what what is kind of the springboard for that particular what's
the springboard for that particular reactivity and be curious about that
connection between that feeling and that reactivity there's also potentially
some exploration or other kinds of practices that might be useful in terms
of familiarizing yourself with feeling tone before reactivity just like at a
time when you're feeling pretty good or just kind of calm or relaxed just kind
of check in well what not just what's the most obvious experience but you know
kind of look at what's most obvious in your experience and then check in what's
the feeling tone to that experience this was kind of eye-opening for me when I
first started exploring this you know just like I was sitting is like things
are fine and what what happens I start okay well what's the most obvious thing
oh that unpleasant experience that's the most obvious thing I wasn't particularly
reacting to it but but I found through this kind of exploration that my mind
tended to gravitate towards the unpleasant when all when all else was equal
it's like that was my habit of mind it was kind of amazing to see that and and
and I began to understand well okay no wonder my mind is so kind of a
versus if that's its habit to gravitate towards the unpleasant you know it's
kind of like of course there's a lot of a version there but that was just a kind
of an exploration of getting familiar with the various flavors of feeling tone
the pleasant the unpleasant the neutral in the various fields of experience so
exploring in the body exploring in hearing just kind of be curious take
some time to get familiar with feeling tone in sight in sound what is it that
we find pleasant unpleasant neither pleasant nor unpleasant in body
sensation in sight in sound and then also in the mind you know that the mental
states also have feeling tone so happiness you know that happiness or
delight or joy these are pleasant anger tends to be unpleasant you know so so
recognizing that all of our experience has feeling tone and that curiosity kind
of doing a little bit of an investigation or an exploration around what are the
feeling tones so that you what it's kind of like what you're doing there is
sensitizing the mindfulness to the the area of feeling so that it's more
familiar with it when we're more familiar with an area of experience through
mindfulness we it tends to kind of as I said earlier you know we we initially
kind of notice the reactivity because it's so obvious because it's something
that we've paid attention to it's it's one of the more obvious things and so it
tends to wake us up when it happens and that's a great thing you know it's a
great thing actually when mindfulness can wake up with suffering but also as we
kind of begin to attune to or take some time to be curious about feeling tone
then we might begin to wake up with feeling tone to before it might lead
into reactivity so that's that's one way to begin to kind of move in the
direction of seeing feeling tone before reactivity would happen the other piece
about that about seeing feeling tone before reactivity and the way it's
happened for me primarily is more in more often in more in long retreat when
there's a little bit more continuity of mindfulness when there's continuity of
mindfulness and there's that attunement to the feeling tone you know there's
there's just the kind of a place of the mind which can be very interested in
seeing or experiencing feeling tone coming and going and in that kind of a
place or time you're you're kind of attuned to feeling and may be in a place
of equanimity just like yeah there's unpleasant feeling there's pleasant
feeling and we feel that kind of sense of it not being a problem that there's
pleasant or unpleasant there's no movement of reactivity but that that kind
of happens a little bit more as there's more continuity of mindfulness as there's
more balance in the mind is there more stability in the mind that's something
that happens more than something we try to do in my experience it's it's kind of
like the gift of the practice over time the gift of the practice allows us to
see things more continuously and have a little bit more ability to notice the
feeling tone before we end up reacting to it might be one more piece actually I
think that's probably enough for me I want to see if there's any comments
or questions from what I've said because I ended up being a little more than a more
like a Dharma talk so yeah comments or questions about about that yeah I'll be
under thank you for your explanation it is just like so fresh for me today that
you were saying in the afternoon I was talking to the insurance company and
then one said one thing one rep and then the other one said something else so I
was just very confused and then there was a view in there that how incompetent
these are so that was the view but then I when I sat down to my calf was cold you
know just I said good let me sit with it and just see if I can feel it after the
conversation was over sit with it see if I can feel this first of all it was I
was sitting in order for that to go away and then but that didn't happen so I
called again hoping to get a third person to to say another person another
representative to say what I wanted to hear you know the ones that was in my
favor that didn't happen so I was open he would pick up but it didn't happen so
anyway but that was my exploration of that was happening but it was
interesting when I saw my reactivity on the phone and just you know getting
excited and all that kind of stuff sitting back and then I was able to drop
in my feet to go a calf and then that that's like where I felt it this time
I've had it before also but so do you have really happened sorry you have a
sense in that experience of what was unpleasant I mean you you you pointed to
it I think but do you have a sense of what was unpleasant I mean you said you
were sitting with an experience because you wanted it to go away so there was an
unpleasant experience you were having there you know what was that what was
that unpleasant experience well the experience of like maybe I should have
handled it better I mean why would I be getting so you know worked up over this I
don't know if that's the experience I don't know why would I get so worked up
over this you know conversation yeah so that's the place to kind of look I mean
I've seen in the past you know it's like I'm sitting with something in order for
it to go away instead of just sitting with it in order to be curious you know
and so what what is the actual feeling what's there you know so that that's
the that's a place to explore yeah but the mind is just so reactive like a cup
few five minute three minutes right after that it can't slow that much down for
mine for me yeah and and that's why we kind of have to start from the
reactivity often that's where we have to start
thank you thank you Charles Lee hi thanks yeah that was a wonderful answer
but I guess three things came up for me one was a teaching that I think I've
heard many teachers say which is kind of asking the question of you know what
am I willing what am I not willing to feel in this moment what am I you know
what am I glossing over what am I avoiding feeling and then the other two
have to do I guess with the chain of dependent origination and I like when
you said that that even the reactivity or the craving can condition or can
create a different feeling tone itself so is there a way that dependent
origination actually it doesn't necessarily go in one direction but it
can go in the in the other direction or or it loops all the way around it
loops yeah and then yeah and then also the the the
relevation a revelation that the chain can be broken at kind of at any point
it you know it doesn't have to be just you know just at that vein taunha link
yeah and that's that's an important one because I think so often in the teaching
of dependent origination that that link is emphasized and you know it is maybe
what we could call a weak link you know in terms of seeing the feeling tone if
we see the feeling tone then you know it can kind of short circuit the movement
to to craving but there's definitely other teachings that that point to one
particular teaching that that like looks at every single link and says yep you
can find you can find freedom there find freedom there so it doesn't matter
like so we don't have to come back or like walk our way back to feeling tone
in order for freedom to happen so that for me was a really a big kind of
relief in a way the first the first piece you you mentioned that question of
what what is like what did you say not wanting to be felt or what am I not
willing to feel what am I not willing to feel that's a great question to help
maybe find or open to some feeling tone that is under the surface you know that
that's a good way to explore into some of those you know some of those subtler
feeling tones yeah
