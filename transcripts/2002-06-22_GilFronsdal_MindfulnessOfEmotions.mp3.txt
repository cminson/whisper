 So, welcome to our hard day long. And today is more or less like a regular one-day sitting that we do from 9 to 4.30, except the theme of the day will be mindfulness of emotions. So there will be more focus on practice of mindfulness in relationship to emotions. I don't have great ambition for the day in terms of resolving everyone's possible issues around emotions and that you'll become experts. But just to begin, kind of emphasizing the importance of mindfulness of emotions and some of the tools of mindfulness in working with them. As I got out of my car just now, I flashed through my mind that I should have the title of the day. I apologize before I tell you, but I thought emotions are us. Because I was thinking emotions are so central to being a human being. So we need to look at them, we need to include them as part of the practice. I think part of the strength of mindfulness practice as a spiritual practice is that it attempts to be all inclusive. It attempts to include all aspects of our humanity, all our experience, as part of practice, including as part of something we pay attention to, as opposed to just saying, this is important, this is what we pay attention to, this over here we don't pay attention to, we exclude that from awareness. This is unacceptable. My hate, that's unacceptable, I just ignore it. My greed, all kinds of things that people very commonly in our culture and probably in your own psyche, certainly in my own, a tendency to separate out what's acceptable and what's not acceptable, what's sacred and what's not sacred, what's whatever. And so what we're trying to do in mindfulness is to include everything as part of the practice and not have any outside. Nothing, for the purposes of mindfulness is unacceptable, for the purposes of how you want to behave among your friends and family and neighbors, and there certainly are things which are considered unacceptable. We don't go around and beat people up, but in terms of what we open the awareness to is to really include and feel and see and admit and be honest about, nothing's considered unacceptable. So we meet with a friendly attitude of mindfulness. And then hopefully with that as a foundation, then we decide what is a wise way of acting in the world. So everything is, so emotions are included. I'm aware that in America, maybe even California, maybe this part of California, there's a trend or a tendency left over from maybe the 60s and 70s to validate emotions too much. And people have manifestos about their beliefs around emotions. They'll kill based on their beliefs around emotions. Certain people, I wouldn't want to be in a debate with them about how you're supposed to relate to your emotions. And sometimes there's an over evaluation of the importance of emotions. And focusing on emotions for this day, I don't want to single it out as this is all important or this is a defining characteristic of what our life is all about. It just happens to be that it's one of the important areas. Early in the year, I focused a whole day on mindfulness of breathing. That was as important as a whole day on emotions. Then you had a second day on mindfulness of the body. And that's as important, maybe more important than just doing emotions. And today it's emotions. So not to single out as being the most important, but rather it has its important place in this wider mandala of who we are as human beings, as important as other things. I am also aware there's a lot of people who under evaluate their emotions. And some people have emotional illiteracy. They're not aware of their emotions, they don't know what they don't have a big vocabulary for the emotions. And I think there's a kind of a story that goes around in our circles of someone who came to retreat and came to interview and said, I'm having some, you know, something unusual is happening to me. I don't know quite what it is, but it's quite unusual. And then coming back the next interview or two and say, oh, I figured out what it is. I'm calm. And the person that never really experienced calm, it didn't have the vocabulary to identify it when it came up. So some people, you know, don't have the vocabulary to identify certain emotions. And some people are shut off. Not so uncommon for me to have someone come and tell me that they don't feel anything from their neck down. And if you don't feel anything from your neck down, you don't have that good access to the wide range of emotions and the subtlety of emotions and how they work for us. So that can be the over evaluation and that can be the under evaluation of emotions. And for us as Buddhist practitioners, we're trying actually to do neither, but rather to meet each emotion that arises in and of itself as it is, very honestly, very directly, very friendly. And in doing that, be very balanced about it, not putting meaning on it that's beyond what it is and not under, you know, meaning both in terms of it's unacceptable or wonderful, or we're not trying to celebrate emotions. And we're not trying to denigrate them. We're kind of a balanced, equanimous attitude that sees it all. Now in focusing on equanimity towards all emotions and including all emotions in our life, that doesn't mean that Buddhist spiritual life is meant to be plain or meant to be kind of, you know, unemotional, which was a criticism or kind of a charge that Buddhists had to respond to in ancient India. There were people who learned about Buddhism and learned about the Buddha and heard that Buddhism teaches or that Buddha was someone who attained non-passion or the word is Aragha, so a passion or non-passion or was an unpassionate person who was attained, but went beyond passion. And the word Raga, I'm choosing to translate this passion in English because if you went around and said, you know, you're on a spiritual path that's going to lead you to having no passion, most people in California would say, well, forget that. That's not for me. Passion is an important part of my life. And so when people heard that the Buddha was someone who had gone beyond passion, they said, well, that means if there's no passion, then the Buddha certainly had no love and no compassion. There's no metta, no compassion, because that's not possible if you have no passion. And so he was a completely kind of emotional neutral person, a neutral emotionally neutral person, right? And so the Buddhists had to respond to that and say, no, that's patently absurd. The record of the Buddha is that he was filled with loving kindness and filled with compassion. And in fact, he's considered to be kind of attained the pinnacle of the potential, our potential for compassion and loving kindness. So in being beyond, in being beyond passion, he wasn't beyond this very rich emotional life. So then you have to ask, you know, how do you define passion? And how the Buddhist, the word raga, which is the word translated as passion, often into English, it has a connotation of, it often is used for the word lust. So lust is less problematic. You know, we often see lust as being a problem. It consumes us, we have it, we are not in our right mind, we're filled with lust. We do things we later on, we'd rather we didn't do. If we can't fulfill our lust in the moment, then we're tortured by it sometimes. And it's very painful to be in the throes of lust, and you'd rather not have it. And that can be sexual lust, it can be addiction to food, to all kinds of things that we really kind of feel this addiction to, or just drive for. Raga, in this connotation, this kind of passion, can also be rooted in aversion, in anger and hate, kind of a certain kind of passion of hate. And so raga in Pali, in the Buddhist language, has this connotation of something which overtakes you, and you become a slave to, contracts the heart, drives you in a way that you're not in control anymore, you're not free. And that is what the Buddha has become free of, that kind of passion. You know, the latin word for passion meant suffering. The passion of Christ was a suffering of Christ. So over the centuries, a number of words in English changed their meaning. Like the word emotion is a relatively new word to be so, to be kind of just used in common parlance. The word, you know, 200 years ago in English was sentimental. At the same meaning is pretty much as what we say now, the word emotion. A person who was sentimental was a person who was emotional. You had sentiments, you had emotions. We don't use it that sentiment has a different meaning now in English. To be sentimental is to be a little bit, doesn't always have a kind of ennobling feeling to it, that person's so sentimental. It's kind of dismissive sometimes to use the word sentimental. But if you say someone's emotional doesn't, I think has quite the same connotation. So the word passion has the same thing. It's shifted its meaning over the centuries. But earlier, I think my understanding had much more to do with suffering, to suffer, compassion to suffer with. So the Buddha was someone who had a very rich emotional life. And in fact, the Buddhist path, in my experience, is a very emotional path. And I was surprised to the degree to which my emotional capacity was awakened through practice. And primarily, it was very positive emotions, experiences of love, experiences of compassion, experiences of intimacy with others in the world around me, feeling of joy, of delight, of warmth, of satisfaction, of contentment. There's a wide range of kind of emotions. They became much stronger for me in the context of doing practice than I ever experienced before. In fact, one thing which maybe is not so popular to say for various reasons is that, but a number of people have come to me, and I've had this experience, that the ecstasy, the bliss that they've experienced in meditation sometimes, is much more satisfying, much more intense than that of an orgasm. That's saying a lot, right? For some people. And so you find out that actually meditation provides that level of emotional intensity that's part of the path. The Buddhism includes that as a possibility. So the path of Buddhism is very emotional. But the way that emotions are looked at in Buddhism is there isn't a categorical attitude towards emotions except in Vipassana. My understanding. The categorical attitude in Vipassana towards emotions is when you're practicing, when you're meditating or sitting or in the meditative mode, there is no emotion which is unacceptable. There's no emotion that needs to be denied or pushed away, and there's no emotion that needs to be indulged in or held onto. That all emotions can be included and opened up to in the field of awareness. There's no reason for the heart to be contracted towards any emotion. You can sit here and have desires to kill someone. Tremendous anger and hate and aversion. And sitting here, this is one of the safest and appropriate places to feel that without feeling you need to censor yourself or judge yourself as being bad or wrong for having those kinds of feelings. That we allow those things to surface and be there. The floodgates of grief are opened up in this practice and it's okay to let the grief kind of break through. The floodgates of compassion and joy. For the purposes of awareness, everything's included. How you want to act on this and what you want to do with this in your life, that's where the wisdom part comes in. Hopefully you don't want to go and act on your anger or your desire to kill someone. That'd be a very unwise thing to do. But for the purposes of awareness, this is a very permissive environment, the practice itself. You're allowed unconditional permission to feel who you are and what's going on. So on one hand, there's that accommodation, that permission, that's the categorical attitude in Deepasana practice. In Buddhist teaching, in the Buddhist Path, there is no one right attitude towards emotions. But rather, emotions are looked upon as some as being healthy, helpful, and some emotions are unhealthy or unhelpful. There is a selection of choosing to go, choosing to be involved in those which are helpful, and a choice is made to let go of or abandon or avoid even for those which are unhelpful. Avoiding does not mean denying or judging when things have arisen. But when there's some healthy choice involved, okay, I'll choose not to go there. I'll choose not to think about that, or I'll choose not to go watch that movie because watching horror movies just makes me feel certain ways it's not helpful. It's possible to make a choice. Buddhist Path involves choosing to avoid or not indulge in unhelpful emotions and choosing to get involved in, I'm lucky to use the word indulge, those which are helpful. And part of the Path of Mindfulness is learning how to do that in a healthy way, how to make that distinction in a healthy way. Before we can make that distinction in a healthy way, it's really helpful to learn how to do Deepasana to our emotions, which is this very balanced, accepting attitude awareness that sees everything honestly for what it is, and learns what our relationship to our emotional life is. It's very helpful to get to know the trends, the common attitudes you have towards your emotions. When an emotion arises, how do you, or a particular emotion arises, how do you relate to it? Do you think this is, you know, you judge it as being something to hold on to, something to push away, something to deny, something to be embarrassed about? As we become aware of our relationship to our emotions, we can simplify that relationship in the practice. And what we're looking for, in a sense, is an uncomplicated relationship to our emotions when we sit and practice. Where it's okay to have it, it can just be there, kind of like it's floating up as if it's impersonal. Part of the wisdom of Buddhism is to see the impersonality of so much of what we usually take as being very personal. And seeing is impersonal, not to negate it or dismiss it or to be aloof from it, but not to be entangled with it in this complicated way in which we then take things personally and we measure ourselves and define ourselves by the presence of this. To no longer define ourselves by our emotions, it turns out to be a very wise thing. In doing that, we all want to give freedom to our emotions to be as they are. So it's this wonderful kind of double movement of freedom of our emotions to be as they are, at the same time as not defining ourselves by them. So uncomplicated emotions. So the Buddhist path is quite emotional. Mostly it's opening up to our emotional life as it is. When there's anger and fear and all grief, it's to give lots of space to the arising of those. In the process of opening up the heart that way, we at the same time open up our capacity to feel all the so-called helpful emotions, the joy, the compassion, the love, and all these things. The paradox or the irony, I guess, is that when we close our heart down to the emotions we consider unacceptable, we also close down our capacity to feel the opposite or the wide range of emotions. So if you want to really open up to the freedom of the emotional life, we have to open up to that which we often don't want to look at. We've been held at bay and repressed for a long time. And then we have to learn the skills, how to open to that in a helpful way. And then as we do that, things will process, things will unfold, things will change for the better, though sometimes they get worse in the short term. Working with emotions requires a lot of patience, a lot of friendliness, a lot of generosity of spirit, and hopefully some understanding of the principles of mindfulness so that the old habits of our attitude towards emotions, even when they're seemingly overwhelming, don't kick in and get the upper hand. So today we'll be focusing on this topic of emotions, and we'll be alternating some periods of sitting meditation, probably for about 35 minutes at a time. Probably most of them will have some guided meditation as part of them or the beginning of them. And then we'll do about the same, about 30-35 minutes of walking meditation, which will also give you instructions for that as we go along. So we'll go back and forth between those two, and hopefully by going back and forth, one of the functions of that is to maintain a good energy as we go through the day. If we just sat all day, it'd be, you know, we all get kind of sleepy. Then we'll have an hour lunch break somewhere in the middle of the day. I'm undecided at this point to give a talk at the end of the day. Usually I give a talk at the end of the day. I'm undecided because it might, like this morning I've talked already for a long time, and I might talk a little bit as we go along. So then, you know, it's enough. So we'll just kind of keep practicing right up until 4.30. So we'll see how it goes. There are two bathrooms on this floor, far in by the kitchen. There's also a bathroom upstairs. If there's a line for that one, you can take the spiral staircase upstairs, and there's a bathroom upstairs. There is, for walking meditation, you know, you can use the hallway out there. And maybe we shouldn't use this hallway for walking meditation for this day, because maybe people like to kind of just be someplace quiet, or some people like not to walk, or for some reason, this can remain quiet. And then the parking lot. If anybody is parked in our parking lot, maybe you can move your car, because it's nice to keep that empty for walking meditation during a day like today. And some people like to walk around the neighborhood during the walking time. And so hopefully we'll find enough places to the side of the building, wherever you kind of find. I think most of you understand about the DANA system, the donation system we have. There's two baskets there by the door. One basket is Operations DANA, which is for the operation, the running of our center. The running of our center is entirely done by the volunteer donations that people give. And we ask on a day, we suggest, you don't ask, we suggest for a day like today, that's just a donation is five to ten dollars. Then there's a Teacher DANA donation basket. So if you want to make a donation towards me for the day, you can put it there in that basket. And the same way the center operates on, you know, completely support the livelihood of the center is on donation, operation of it. So my livelihood is also completely 98% dependent on the DANA, the donations that support my livelihood. So you do that as you wish. So that's what I can think of in terms of, yes. And if not, what would it be for the day? Yeah. So do you have any logistical questions for the day? Yes, please. So the question is, how do you come up with more food for the day? If you have no choice in the matter, then there's nothing I can say. Right. Except, you know, if you start doing it, then you think you're frightening people. Maybe you should get up and go outside or something or try to stop it if you think you're setting people. But if it happens spontaneously and you have no choice, then there's nothing I can say. If you have some choice in the matter, then it's best in this environment not to express that kind of stuff. If you have to make a lot of noise, you have to cry. You're welcome to cry and to sob. Again, if your floor is shaking, probably it's fine to go someplace a little bit further away. But if you want to suddenly laugh, for example, some people want to laugh a lot or if you want to just kind of yell, I don't think it's very helpful both to the group and also probably not helpful for you in this context. Probably what's more helpful is to not to exactly suppress the energy of it, but not to give into it either, but rather feel the tremendous impulse as it courses through your body. And so just, and to really, it takes a lot of strength sometimes. You're really staying in there and just stay very mindful of that impulse and really feel what's going on in your body, that impulse and just feel the push, the drive. And it probably would be very empowering for you to discover the capacity to be present for something, feel tremendous push and drive and demand the insistence sometimes of certain emotional expression and not give into it. And just let it course through your body and watch what happens as you do that. And what happens often is what I call the, what did I call it? I call it the riding the wave of an emotion and it'll peak, it'll get stronger and stronger and it's going to be so compelling and it feels like this, you know, it has to be now, are you going to die? And often, many people in their lives will give into that impulse, but if you hang in there, it can feel like the rodeo sometimes and just watch it and watch it and watch it and let it course through you. Don't deny it, don't repress it, but don't give into it. Then it's sooner or later the wave will crest and break and you'll find yourself on the other side and it'll quiet out and you'll realize that it can get quiet at some point and that compelling nature of that impulse will lose its deductive quality to you. It's very empowering for people to understand, to realize that capacity. So it probably serves you better not to yell if you have a choice, but also do not deny or repress it, it's happening exactly, but just really feel that impulse and don't give into it if you can. If you feel like you just simply can't hold it back, then maybe open your eyes, take some deep breaths, because I think probably if you yell and hear, a lot of people can get frightened and it's not so good to frighten people like that. It's okay, I mean, these are mindfulness students and they're supposed to have the skills to work with it. And is that okay? You're welcome to cry, this is considered a very safe place to cry. And what sometimes instructions were given on retreat is if people around you hear that you're crying, it's okay, it just opens their hearts. So that's a little bit different than yelling or screaming. Well, if you're sobbing and it's kind of shaking the floor and it's not going to interrupt the process by going to the next room or going outside, it's probably a kind thing to do is just go outside and come back in a while. We have this creaking floor, so to hear you cry and hear the creaking floor at the same time. And I hope that's okay, I don't want to say that with any suggestion to inhibit what's going on, because this is supposed to be a safe place to let these things course through you, but it's really the learning how to let it course through you without giving into something. And sometimes it can feel like a rodeo, you feel like you're going to need to bolt, you know, just like got to run, I got to get out of here. And it's successful meditation, the fact that you kept your butt on the cushion and you know, it really can feel like a rodeo. And we open to that, allow that to be there. It's kind of like we allow everything to be as it is, all the emotions in the container of sitting still. So it's not repression, but it's not expression either. So it's kind of the middle grounds, the middle way between that. And it's really safe, it's an amazingly safe place to sit here quietly, I feel like the rodeo, but to sit here quietly and let these emotions course through us. And it's what your emotions and your body probably most wants. It's really healing to do it, to give expression sometimes is not so healing. There's a place for expression. And sometimes I'll encourage someone to go out into the woods and emote in an expressive way, yell or something. But any other questions before we start? Oh yeah, it's a silent day except for me. So it's most helpful, what's most helpful for a day like today is if you all keep it in silence. If during lunchtime you have someone, you hear with someone and you know they want to talk with you, you know, then I ask, we ask you to kind of go a little bit further away from right in the central area here so that your talking doesn't change the atmosphere, the feeling of it all. It's most helpful in days like today. The continuity, the momentum of the practice builds the best in the context of kind of silence. Okay, another, yes? Why would the expression be? Oh, not necessarily. I mean, it can be productive, that's why sometimes I send someone out into the woods when we have woods to do that. But the expression of emotions sometimes can reinforce that particular forms of response, that's a habit. So if a person is angry, used to be like in the 60s and 70s, catharsis was really important and a lot of therapists encouraged their clients to cathart. And catharsis brings a lot of relief and sometimes it can bring understanding, isn't necessarily it's always wrong, but it turned out that it was over-evaluated. Most therapists now feel like it was over-evaluated and rather than helping people, if you cathart too much, it reinforces the tendency to get angry, if you cathart your anger. So the expression of something sometimes feeds that tendency. Mindfulness, which sees it clearly for what it is, doesn't feed it, but rather helps liberate it. Kind of the attitude of Buddhism is that, kind of, is a little bit metaphorical speaking, but in the center of everything is a seed of liberation, where everything wants to be liberated. It doesn't want to be expressed, it wants to be liberated. Liberate doesn't mean the free expression of it, liberation means the release of it in some way. And so the mindfulness, the holding things in awareness, helps the process of liberation, liberating, self-liberating aspect of things. Expression solidifies something. So, unless a person, one of the reasons to have someone express, there's a lot of places for expression. I mean, if you love someone or if you'll join someone, that's really helpful to let that become more of a habit. And so to express it, you know, I really appreciate you. It's a beautiful thing, and so that reinforces that part of us. If I say, you know, you irritate me, that can reinforce, you know, get angry and yell at someone, that can reinforce that. So we have to choose, you know, what we want to express in a time and place for it. But now I forgot the question I was going to say. So that's... That's the way it goes. So is that okay? Is that an answer? So let's start. But now, you know, it's been half an hour of sitting here listening to me. I think probably it'd be good to take a couple of minutes to stand and stretch. And if you need to go to the bathroom, some of you can go quickly. And... So in meditating, it's helpful to take a stable posture, an alert, upright, stable posture. So you might take a few seconds to be careful with your posture and kind of explore what it would be like for you to be upright, alert with your spine, with your torso, and also stable. Stable with the base, against your chair, the floor, your cushion. One of the classic images for meditative posture is sitting like a mountain. The image works really well with sitting on the floor, crossed like it, because you're kind of a triangle. But the idea of sitting like a mountain stable becomes a great aid with emotions, you know, when the rodeo begins, when there's very strong emotions. Because if you have the stability of your posture, you compose there, then it's a lot easier to let the emotions course within. But for many reasons, it's good to have an upright posture, alert. And then it's usually helpful to softly close your eyes. Some people like to let their gaze be inward, down and in, if it's easy to do that. And since the subject of today's is going to be emotions, why don't we just start directly by checking in to see what the mood you have right now. What's the mood or the emotional state that's present for you? It may be very subtle, but there's always one. There's always something going on emotionally or mood wise, mental state or attitude. It could be anxious or contented. It could be impatient or calm. Could be happy or sad. Or related or feelings of grief. Confused or hesitant, resistant, eager. At ease or uneasy. It might be a word or some words that you have that you can characterize your mood with. Or perhaps your mood is kind of undefinable or vague and just kind of there with a general vague sense of what's happening. And as you sit with your emotional mood, notice if there's any tendency to identify with it, to take it personally, to let it be a way that you define yourself. Some attitude or some assigning of meaning to it. This means that I'll always be this way. Or this means that this is going to be too hard. This is going to be great. Can you allow it to be just the way it is? And feel the mood or the attitude or the mental state, the emotion, how you are in your body. What areas of your body express or are activated by how you feel? Some people don't have a clue how to do this exercise of how you feel it in your body. But is it happening in your little toe? In your ankle? Is it happening more in your torso or your head? Particular areas of your torso or your arms or your hands, your shoulder, your face, jaw, or eyes? And see if for a few moments you can be quite relaxed about what's happening. And notice what happens, how it changes as you watch it. Does your mood or emotional state change in any way? Does it get stronger, weaker? Does it fluctuate as you're just open to it? No, it's very helpful in meditation for the mind to become stable, to have a little bit of calm and concentration. And for this purpose, it's very helpful, it can be very helpful to stabilize the attention on the breathing. Staying with a breath for a while, it can for some people be a neutral place where you begin to free the mind from its normal habits of always going and thinking certain ways, or reacting certain ways. Letting the mind become a little bit independent from old habits, from tendency to always be distracted or obsess with thinking. So when you turn your attention to the breathing, you can help at first to very gently, lovingly, takes a few long, slow, deep breaths. And as you breathe in, to feel a connection with your body, the expansion, the pressure. And as you exhale, to let the body relax. And letting your breathing be normal. Notice how your in-breath, your inhalations, feel different in your body than your exhalations. Notice that in exhaling, part of that process is letting go, releasing. And it can be helpful to appreciate or enjoy that process of releasing or letting go. Each time you exhale, let go of your thoughts, your thinking. Each time you let go, appreciate the silence between your thoughts or beyond your thoughts. Breathing in mindfully, breathing out. In being mindful of the breathing, in riding the breaths, riding the sensations of breathing, as if the breaths were waves coming in and coming out, rising and falling. Stay there with the rhythm, the alternating rhythm of breathing in and out. And if there are moods or emotions or body sensations, they're coming in and pressing for attention. Continue being with the breathing, but imagine that the breath includes or embraces all that. So you don't get involved with the other things, but you don't deny them or stay unaware of them. You continue to ride the breath, the ocean of breathing, aware of the way in which the waves of breath can include or wash through whatever else is going on. When the mind wanders away in thought, and you notice that, the noticing that you wanted away in thought is a very important moment. It's a moment of mindfulness, natural mindfulness. And when that happens, invite the breathing back into your awareness. Very gently, without comment, let go of your thoughts. And begin again breathing in and out mindfully. And as you're staying with your breathing, if there's very small ways, easy ways of adjusting your breathing so that it's more comfortable and more enjoyable, you're welcome to do that. Breathing a little bit more fully into parts of your body, relaxing your diaphragm in your belly, and letting the exhalation be smoother and more extended. You can sometimes bring more enjoyment or comfort. And if it's not easy to do that, to adjust, then don't worry about it. It's quite significant to entrust ourselves to the breath, to really trust your breathing. Breathing in, breathing out. And now, become aware of what mood or emotional state is present for you. Same way you did at the beginning of the sitting. Is it changed to the same? If it's the same mood as before, has it changed in intensity or in size or quality? If it's gone away and replaced by something else, notice the absence of what was there at the beginning. And notice what has come instead. Is it easier now to hold it with composure, with generosity, with non-identification? Not taking it personally. It's just there. Or is it harder? After sitting for a period of meditation, do you bring a different attitude or relationship to yourself and your mood and your emotional state? And then in the last few minutes of the sitting, the last couple of minutes, you're turning into your breathing. Maybe breathe a little bit more fully and let your breathing kind of wash through you. Wash your mind, your heart, your body. Let it have a calming influence. And then take the last very last minute now and using your thoughts, reflect upon what happened to you during that sitting. Going to review it. The beginning, the middle, the end. How were you engaged in the practice during this period and what happened to you? I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. The practice of reviewing a meditation session can be very helpful sometimes. It's not the same thing as meditation where there isn't that kind of reflective kind of thinking going on. But the end of a sitting to review something can strengthen the process of mindfulness. Because mindfulness and remembering are actually closely related functions of the mind. And if you actually try to remember back over, review what happened, it can strengthen the capacity of mindful in the moment. Also, you can learn from reviewing. You can learn a lot of things. You can learn how it went and how you engage yourself and maybe realize, you know, I could have tried more. Maybe I should have tried a little bit less. I was a little bit trying too hard or, you know, I was a little bit complacent there. Or, you know, oh boy, why did I let myself get carried away with those thoughts for 20 minutes? And that recognition of that, what happened, can then make it a lot easier when you come next time to sit, to come with a little bit more of a healthy resolve, to realize what's going on, the trends in your mind, trends in your meditation, and maybe be a little bit less willing to spend 20 minutes thinking about something. Because, you know, oh, next time I think I'll take the practice a little bit more intently and be able to resolve to be present and wake up. Also, we can learn from our experience. We learn, for example, a lot of things we can learn by reviewing. And a lot of the wisdom of practice comes from just understanding the processes of what happens to us. And with emotions, it's often very valuable to review a little bit. When they're gone, for example, when they pass, to recognize that they're gone, but also to review a little bit what our attitude had been. I've been in situations where I had a certain emotion or mood. And my rational mind knows better, but my other mind relates to it as if this is it. This is forever. This is the way it's always going to be. How can I possibly live my life this way? And how can I possibly be around other people because it's going to be this way forever? And by reviewing, recognizing it actually doesn't happen that way. The emotions arise, moods arise, they pass, they change. And it's very, very helpful to not be so caught in the grips of it while it's happening. Now, to practice very simple breath meditation, to develop concentration and calmness, can also be very helpful in this process because often when we're in the midst of the throws of our emotional life, kind of caught by it, we often take it very seriously, as if it's the whole world, the whole thing, everything is going on. But when the mind is calm, the strength of a calm mind, it's easier not to take the emotion as being everything, as being, you know, it's going to be lost in it. And we can have a different relationship to it. Oh, we kind of see it for what it is, mind is stabilized, it's certainly important it's there, but we're not so much right in the middle of it. There's something else going on. There's a stability, there's a calmness involved in the middle of it. Kind of like the difference between if you're in a maze and you're lost in the maze, you're kind of in it and you've been in it for days and you can't find your way out. But it turns out the maze is only, you know, half an inch or an inch above your eye level. And if you just stood on your tippy toes, you can look over the edge of the wall and see, you know, how the way the way out and it'd be fine. Having a little bit of calmness and concentration, it lets you kind of stand on your tippy toes in the sense with your mind and you see beyond, see above it all. So you're not kind of in the midst of the maze of life, but you kind of have a little bit of overview of it all. And the overview, you know, it doesn't seem so bad or it doesn't seem so, and trapping or so, you know, this is everything. I remember once when I was 20 or 21, I had a very, very happy, very ecstatic, actually, summer, not meditating, but just doing things, other things, vacation. And I lost some perspective of it all. And I kind of thought, I said to my friend, I said, you know, I'm never going to be depressed again. It was so powerful, the joy, and I thought, this is it, you know. And then within a few months, I was more depressed than ever been in my life. And then it was, oh, I'll never recover. This is it. I'm depressed forever. You know, I went on for some weeks, you know, and this is it. And wasn't it? Then something else happened. Something else happened. So I made it. Yes, please. Sure. Very close one. We'll talk about that later as we go along in the day. So let's do a period of walking meditation. And what I'd like to propose is that part of this walking meditation is that you just go for a walk. Don't do anything that looks like a Buddhist practice, particularly. I mean, you know, don't walk in such a way that anybody would notice, you know, if you're doing some kind of practice. And, you know, there's four blocks, you know, connected to this corner here, right? So maybe just walk around the block, but maybe walk clockwise. Most people don't know that's the Buddhist direction. So it's okay. And just walk clockwise and circumambulate the blocks. Just choose your block, one of these four blocks, this one or the, you know, kitty corners. And as you walk, just walk in an easy, casual way. And be with yourself. Track what your mood, your emotions, your reactions are as you walk. And let the walking lubricate your relationship to your mood, your emotions. So that in the walking, the physical body of walking, the steps walking, the movement of the body of walking, somehow keeps you in motion, keeps you moving. So that whatever the emotion of the mood is that you're recognizing, whatever's happening, somehow begins to be more fluid. So you're really with yourself. You're in yourself. You're kind of internal in many ways during this walking time. Tracking what's going on with your feeling. And then as you walk around, if you run into someone or some stranger or whatever's going on, notice how subtle the shift in mood, the emotions might be. Suddenly, you know, you see some huge, huge towering, you know, Goliath, walking down the sidewalk. And you notice your stomach contracting the fear. And then you notice, you know, some kid playing and you feel the delight in that. You know, you get all these changes and the kaleidoscope of changes as you go. There might be an overall overarching mood. And then notice how the subtle changes, depending on you walk into a shady area after being in the sun. I don't know if that happens today, but suddenly you feel more contracted. You walk into the darker place and more expansive in the lighter place. So walk at least once around the block, maybe twice if there's time. And we'll start again in here. And now I have 10-20. So let's start in here at 10-55. And so we have about 35 minutes. And so you're walking around the neighborhood, you have to track yourself for time. If you walk at least once around and you want to come back and just do a regular walking meditation here and you know how to do it, then you're welcome to come back here and do that. But mostly I'm not interested in you doing regular meditation, regular walking meditation. I'm interested in you being normal, walking around in quiet, normal way. Don't talk, but normal way. And just in that normal mode in walking, being with yourself and feeling what it's like to be with yourself. Your mood, your emotions, your states. And see if in the walking, if I can lubricate and keep it fluid. Okay, is that okay? So enjoy your walk. I kind of called my emotion meditation. And what it involves, I usually do it when I'm driving, like especially on the freeway, when I have long stretches of the freeway to go or someplace. And I'll start paying attention to my emotional responses or my emotions. The very subtle ones, I might have a general mood that I'm in for the day, kind of for a while. But there's a, but I pay attention to the subtle shifts that are going on as I drive. And it's like a kaleidoscope. Even subtle enough, I mean, suddenly there's a, someone cuts me off and I get irritated. Someone pulls over to make me go by and I feel gratitude. And a police car comes up near too close and I feel fear. Some beautiful car drives by and I feel desire. And it's kind of constantly shifting because all this car, all this stuff is going on. It's a constant little shift of emotions and feelings going on. And what I find useful about doing that is that because I'm tracking it, being present for it, there's much less residue. But if I don't track it, it's happening anyway. And then there's much more residue and especially those emotions which cause stress or tension. That tension remains as a residue and builds in the course of the drive or the course of the day. And so by the end of the day, if you have enough of this residue, enough of this little tensions that are unresolved or unrelaxed, then no wonder some people have a headache at the end of the day. Really tense. Often these little teeny things. But if you're actually there to track it and watch the teeny movements of emotional reactions and the tensions that arise because of it, then there's a greater chance that it stays fluid. It doesn't build. There's no residue. Any other comments about the walk you'd like to make? Reports of how it was? Yes. Yes. No, it's very interesting. And it often is the subtle ones that are the foundation to creating the big ones. Yes. So there's a kaleidoscope of emotions that can happen and small reactions, responses. And there's big ones that kind of stay around for a while. It's interesting that in Pali, which is the Buddhist language of church Latin, the Buddhist language of the Theravadan tradition, there's no word that easily corresponds to our word emotion. There's some words that kind of are sometimes used, but it's been pointed out by a number of scholars that there's no word for our word emotion. And that seems very odd because emotion is so important for us, the word. And we think we know what it is and we have these manifestos and what to do with our emotions. And there's no particular word for it. And what does that mean that the Buddhists don't have emotions? You go to Asia to Theravadan countries and there's a lot of emotions there that people have pretty much the same ones as we do, it's seemingly. But so why isn't there no word for word emotion? And I think it's because the word emotion is a category word. It doesn't really point to anything specific, particularly. It can't point to something which is in emotion. Emotion is a category as opposed to a thing. It's a category of things. It's a set. And the human experience can be categorized in different ways. We divide it up into different subsets. And the way we divide up the subsets of our experience is variable from culture to culture. So if the human experience is a pie, then we cut out a pie piece and our pie piece is called emotion. It's one pie piece. And maybe the Theravadan Buddhists, they cut the pie slightly differently. And so they have a different category of what they call. And I say that so that we don't have some fixed idea of what emotions are. Emotions are one thing and now I know what they are. Emotions are actually, it's kind of a little bit vague what the category of emotion is. There's a wide range of things which are included in the category of emotion. Also, if we use the word emotion, it might hide the fact that most of the things we call emotions are composite things. They're not single, unitary things, but rather it's made up of many different aspects. They're made up of thoughts, some people mentioned, the thoughts are related to them. They're made up of body sensations. They're made up sometimes with intentions, things that we want, desires. Even when there's fear, there's kind of a pushing something away or recording from something. There's a movement for or against things, often with emotions. So often intentions are part of it. There's an evaluation sometimes that is part of the emotion. Without the evaluation or the assigning a meaning to an experience, maybe we wouldn't have any emotion. Someone gives you an old postcard, it's not that old, it's not like an antique, it's an old postcard, and you look at it and say, there's no feeling, no emotion for it. And then you're told that this postcard was... It gives some wonderful story around what happened with this. Suddenly this postcard has meaning, and maybe it's very personal meaning for you, and suddenly you just feel as delight to have this in your hand. There's an evaluation assigning a meaning to it, which is not inherent in the postcard itself. And the emotion arises not in the postcard, but it arises out of that evaluation, assigning a meaning, the understanding that the mind holds that postcard with. So certain emotions arise out of that evaluation and meaning making ability of the mind, which is not always accurate, as many of you know. We assign meaning sometimes, and we find out later the meaning was wrong, it wasn't that way at all. And all the emotions that we had based on that meaning then become... I don't know what to say here. They wouldn't have been that way if we had the proper understanding of it. So one of the things we do in Buddhist practice is begin to tease apart what an emotion is. So we don't just see it as being a unitary, solid thing. And that's what we do with a lot of our experience. We begin teasing, looking at it very carefully, and don't take it for granted, but investigate what that experience is. And that act of investigation then becomes very important. Investigation does two things. Investigation helps you to see more clearly what's there. And investigation also, as it says in the newsletter article, it changes the ecology of your mind, because you're bringing something new into the equation. Investigation. So if you're wallowing in self-pity, kind of lost in its drowning in self-pity, the whole ecology of the mind is one of drowning. But then if you get interested in what's this like to wallow in self-pity? What's that like? How does it feel? How does it feel around my eyes or in my shoulders or my body? Or what's the flavor of the thoughts when there's self-pity thoughts? And suddenly this other thing which is not self-pity is operating in the mind. It's adding another element to the equation of the mind, to the ecology of the mind. Something that's considered in Buddhism to be wholesome, helpful. And suddenly you have a very different animal, a different situation going on. And the stronger the power of investigation, the stronger the mindfulness, the stronger you're bringing in healthy attitudes, healthy factors of the mind into what before was kind of locked in, kind of unhelpful kind of state to be in. Makes sense? What I'm saying? So what we do is, so first hand we want to learn how to be present for emotion as it is. Not push it away, not hold on to it, not express it, not deny it. Just allow it to be there in whatever way it wants to be. And then the next thing we want to do is begin investigating it, seeing it more clearly what it is. Now one of the things that emotions are part of, part of the composite element of emotions that in Buddhist psychology is considered to be very fundamental is the feeling tone of the emotion, a feeling tone of our experience. The feeling tone, the Pali word is Vedana, it's sometimes translated in English just as the word feeling. That's interesting because the word feeling in English has I think maybe many, many, but two primary meanings. We often refer to our emotional state as our feeling. What are you feeling now? And the kind of implication is you're feeling some emotion. But feeling also refers to the sensations you're experiencing. I'm feeling the texture of the wall. What are you feeling? The texture of the wall. So feeling also refers to sensations. And that's very interesting that it points to the close interaction between sensation and emotions and response and reactions to what's going on. So in Buddhist English the word feeling technically refers to the sensation, a feeling tone of the sensation. In every experience, every sensation we have, whether it's sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, internal body sensations, or the sensation, the awareness, the perception of mental states and thoughts and all that, is said to have one of three flavors, tones. It's either pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant, neutral. And this is a very significant, everything we look at, everything we experience, everything we touch, everything we feel inside, has some quality of having been pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. To a great extent, the mind reacts to things being pleasant or unpleasant. We go towards what's pleasant, we hold on to what's pleasant, and we recoil or pull away or push away what is unpleasant. The pleasure, pleasure, I was going to say, pleasure, pain, response. Very basic. I think Freud kind of talked about how basic this level of the mind's movements is. And sometimes we build huge philosophies, political creeds, to justify why we simply going towards what's pleasant or recalling from what's unpleasant. The philosophy follows the kind of amoeba-like reaction that we have. And if you want to justify, if you live in your philosophy sometimes, you sometimes miss the fact that you're actually responding to something very, very amoeba-like, very basic to human psyche. That this human psyche sometimes will go towards what is pleasant, hold on to it, or push away or recoil from what is unpleasant. It's fascinating. It's very significant in mindfulness practice to begin tracking how this works. To see actually this working, usually it's a very subtle thing. It doesn't have to be subtle, but to watch it in meditation is relatively subtle. The mind has to be somewhat stable and quiet in order to see it. And again, there's another kaleidoscope, kind of constantly shifting to watch how we go forward against something. Some people have all these attitudes towards pleasure and pain, which makes it even, which kind of magnifies that reaction. If our attitude towards life is that life is only successful as a human being if you have a lot of pleasure, and somehow there's personal failing when you feel things that are unpleasant, then you magnify the reactivity that has. So suddenly you have some pleasant experience, oh, you're now a successful human being, you got it, you're getting close to it or whatever. And something unpleasant is happening, it's a personal failure, something's wrong. I have to change something. In meditation, if you feel something unpleasant in meditation experience, this means that I'm not a good meditator. I'm having a pleasant experience in meditation, this means that I'm a successful meditator, I can't wait to let my friends know. And so we exaggerate, so we feel joy because we're successful in making a good self-image. So there's ways in which we can exaggerate the pull push we have towards pleasure and pain. It's said that with neutral sensations, one response the mind has is confusion. It doesn't know how to respond, so it's confused. So the example is that someone comes in, says someone of you comes in here to meditate, maybe you can recognize yourself in this. You came in here this morning to find a place to sit, and you might just kind of very quickly scan the room and notice where it's more pleasant to sit, more pleasant people are sitting over in that corner. So you kind of feel kind of like, you know, you gravitate towards there because it's a pleasant place to sit. Or over there that's an unpleasant place to sit. And so you feel that kind of, you know, pulled away, you kind of avoid the unpleasant. It's very simple, it's very rudimentary, basic sometimes. Or say that you can't tell whether it's unpleasant or unpleasant in here. So you're confused, just stand there for a while and where should I sit, kind of debating in your mind, knowing what criteria should I use. Pleasant unpleasant is very basic, and it's one of the building blocks for our emotional reactions. We have feel something unpleasant, and there might be anger towards it. There might be self-blame, there might be fear for the, you know, in relation to that which is unpleasant. We feel something pleasant, and there might be joy, there might be the light, there might be happiness, contentment. And then if we evaluate, put meaning on pleasant and unpleasant experience, then the emotional reaction can get much more complicated. This is if I experience something pleasant, and the meaning of that is that I'm a successful human being, then I feel even more happy because it's good to feel like you're a successful human being. So the emotion then builds based on the evaluation we have, the assigning a meaning. Is this making sense? Somewhat? Any questions? Can I make it clear? Yes. What should your intent be? Uh, yeah, why are you asking that question? My intent is to try to be helpful for you. And it would be nice if those reciprocated. It's a good question. And what's the purpose of being a human being? What's the meaning of life? What's the intent that we should have? It's one of those big questions. And in terms of what I'm talking about right now, sometimes our relationship with that question can be simply a response to pleasure and pain, pleasant and unpleasantness. So for example, if we feel kind of uneasy about life, kind of unpleasant about life, then there's a drive to try to find a solution. And one of the solutions some people find, try to go for is to find meaning or purpose in life, in response to the aversion to things being unpleasant. But rather than looking for meaning in life, if a person turned the attention back to how we respond to discomfort, you might be able to resolve the fear and learn how to be content or be at peace or be free in the midst of this uncomfortable situation. And then there's no need to be driven to find the meaning of life because the primary reason was simply trying to avoid something uncomfortable. Here in America, maybe I shouldn't say this, but now that I've gone this far, I guess I have to put my foot in my mouth. So we've spent a lot of time and effort and money at Marin County to create the state-of-the-art meditation center. It's Spirit Rock, it's a beautiful place, probably hard to find a meditation center as beautiful anywhere in the world, especially in Buddhist Asia. Beautiful place, and beautiful facilities and rooms for people. Ajahn Amaro, when he saw it, when he first opened, he said, now people will suffer more because they can't blame something else for their suffering. But it's very comfortable there, relatively comfortable. And then people come to Spirit Rock and there's mostly single rooms there, but there's some double rooms. And now they wish they'd never made those double rooms because it means in order for the center to be full, a certain number of people have to be assigned to double rooms with a roommate. But they know most of the other people don't have roommates, they have their own room. And so people get upset, and they get angry, and they feel like they've been discounted, and they feel that their retreat's been ruined because they have a roommate. And the poor managers have to deal with all this. So when many of us, this is what I shouldn't be saying, it's comparing, right? But when many of us went to Asia, the conditions were comparatively primitive. It's to say it well. I mean, as conditions were often, many of us got sick, all kinds of illnesses, and the food would be pretty bad. And you didn't quite know what was in the food sometimes, and we'd be careful with the food we ate, and there were all these mosquitoes. And I was given this bed. The one place monastery I was in, it was about eight months, I was given a nice bed, a nice regular kind of sized bed. But it didn't have a spring, a mattress, it was just wood planks. But they didn't expect me to sleep around the wood planks, so they gave me one of these very, very thin bamboo straw beach mats they have in America. Well, that was my mattress. And conditions of cold, of wet, scorpions and cobras, and the heat, and our knees swell up. Sometimes we didn't get enough food to eat. And in terms of accommodations, I remember sleeping, I spent a lot of time in Asia sleeping in a room with other people. Sometimes I spent one practice period sleeping with a room of 30 guys. That was every night. We ate all our meals there, we meditated there, and we slept in this one room together. I want my own room, please. And then, you know, I remember when Nepal went to sleep in a little place that was just big enough for four of us to lay down our mattresses next to each other. So we were just right next to each other. And that's the way we slept for. That particular time, I think it was four weeks together. And now, I'm trying not to say this, to say, you know, those are the golden age of practice. But rather, there was a lot of value in putting ourselves in situations which are uncomfortable and coming to terms with that, seeing how the mind reacts, how the mind wants comfort, seeing how the mind wants to be protected, and safety, and wants all these things that actually, in and of themselves, are maybe innocent enough things to want. But they don't challenge us to find out how to let go of our attachments. So you come to Spirit Rock, and it doesn't offer you the same kind of a challenge to many things we're normally attached to. So, and sometimes it's very simple, it's attachment to pleasure, it's a kind of attachment to not having discomfort, is so primary. And to track this and watch how this works is one of the very, in Buddhism it's said, it's one of the really important doorways to freedom. Just simply to watch how the mind goes for and against pleasure and pain. It's a doorway, it's a door to freedom, because it's so primary to what goes on. There's much more to be said about emotions and freedom, but this is really primary. And since the beginning of this day, I want to focus a little bit on this. So we're going to sit again, if you'd like to stand for a minute, because now you've been sitting for a little while listening. Please stretch. So again, take a comfortable alert posture. Softly close your eyes. And then straight off, become aware of the mood, the emotional state that's present for you, how you're feeling right now. And then notice whether that's pleasant or unpleasant, or neither. And how do you relate to it being pleasant or unpleasant? What's your response? Is it okay? Hold on or push away? Do you make a story about it, designing a meaning? Scan through your body and see if you can find a pleasant sensation in your body anywhere at all. It can be your lips touching or your hands touching. Sensations of breathing or temperature. Find a pleasant sensation in your body. And as you feel that pleasant sensation, notice if there's any response to it. For or against. Assigning a meaning or stories or ideas about it. Wishes concerning it. Notice anything that happens that's different than the very simple being present for the pleasant sensation in and of itself. If it disappears as you watch it, then find another one. Notice how your mind is or your attitude is in relationship to the pleasant sensation. And now just take a deep breath and let go of that. And now find an unpleasant sensation anywhere in your body. It can be subtle or great. Let your attention be there, settle there on that unpleasant sensation. And as you do that, notice what happens. For, against it, story making, meaning, attitudes. What shifts in your mind? How it is now to be aware of unpleasant. If it disappears, then find another one. Unpleasant sensation. And then let go of that. And now find a pleasant sensation. Maybe the strongest pleasant sensation that's available to you doesn't have to be that strong. And hang out with it. Let your attention settle there on the pleasant, exploring it, feeling it. And notice what shifts in your mind, if anything, in terms of for, against, meaning, texture of the mind, heaviness of the mind, feeling pleasant. And then let go of that. And now find something unpleasant, uncomfortable in your body and your experience. And let the awareness open to that, feel that, explore it, sense it. And notice how your mind, your presence, what shifts and changes. If the reference point is the potential to be present for it in an uncomplicated way, within any for, against, free floating, as if it has nothing to do with you, just an ex-sensation, kind of neutral in a sense. Notice what you add to the experience of being present for the unpleasant. What happens in your body as you're present for the unpleasant? And then let go of that. And then begin being aware of your breathing. Breathing in mindfully, breathing out mindfully. And then being with the breath, feeling your breathing, like in your body to breathe. Become aware of the pleasant or unpleasant qualities of the breath. And then notice your response, your reaction to the breath being either pleasant, unpleasant, comfortable, uncomfortable. Do you do anything about the being this way? If the reference point would be a mind that does nothing, just allows things to be as they are, like you're a naturalist, just studying it, letting things be, no for or against. What effect does pleasant and unpleasantness have on your psyche, your mind? Feeling the pleasantness and unpleasantness of the breathing. It could be very subtle here, but just... Can you discover how to be equanimous about it? Not for or against, just letting it be as it is. Not making anything of it. Not attached to it being one way or the other. And then stay with your breathing. Let it be the center of gravity. Where your mind settles. But if anything else happens in your experience, anything grabs your attention or pulls your attention, lots or feelings or emotions or body sensations or sounds or smells or whatever it might be. It's okay, let your attention become aware of those things. And notice very simply whether the sensations are pleasant or unpleasant. Or neither. And in noticing whether they're pleasant or unpleasant or neither, how does that affect you? Is there very subtle reactions to it being either pleasant or unpleasant? Let this be a period of discovery, how it is for you, rather than some idea of what it should be, how you should be. Pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. Whatever you're experiencing, notice if it has these qualities. So if you get caught up in your thoughts, notice if they're pleasant or unpleasant. Not so much the content perhaps, but just the quality of that thinking or the content. Notice if you react not to the content per se, but to the pleasant and unpleasant quality of those thinking, those thoughts. Can always come back to your breathing and rest there for a while. If you find it helpful to stay present, you can label each experience you're aware of as being either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. So you and then as a continuation of this exercise in pleasant and unpleasantness, I'm going to recite the list mostly of different emotions, different words. Say them out loud and then as you listen to these words, take them into your body, into your psyche and mind. Notice pleasant and unpleasantness. Notice how you respond, react to that. Are there common tendencies? Notice what happens in your body. Joy. Contentment. Danger. Grief. Delight. Tear. Delight. Tear. Happiness. Anxiety. Appreciation. Calm. Restlessness. Calm. Restlessness. Restlessness. Restlessness. Ease. Ease. Fear. Love. Tenderness. Guilt. And to wholeness, feeling at home. What did you notice in response to those words? Were there pleasant and unpleasant experiences? Were there movements for, against, contractions, expansions? Stories, ideas, kicked in? And then please come back to your breathing. It gives me a very matter of fact. Breathing in, breathing out. Tying the waves of inhalation, exhalation, washed through you. So then spend the last minute of the sitting. Reviewing that sitting, best of you can, without straining to do so, just a very relaxed way. Thinking it over. Experience of being with pleasant and unpleasant. What was difficult, what was easy. How you reacted to it all. So. So. So. I think sometimes it's quite humbling to become aware of how our reactions to life can be so basic as simply going towards pleasure and avoiding this pleasure or uncomfortable unpleasantness. And so much is based on this very simple phenomenon. So what did you learn? What would you like? What was it like to do that? What did you discover? So the question would be, how do you take care of your body? How do you move without it being an aversion to discomfort? So rather just a wisdom. You know what your tendency is. It's uncomfortable and you know that in a wise way you should move. But so there's the movement for or against in the mind. There's a movement of wisdom. Oh, I need to move. Right. Hating the cold. Yeah. Yep. Did you discover when you went back and forth in pleasant and unpleasant and different things, did you notice that you had common reactions or responses to pleasant and unpleasantness? What did you discover about that? That it wasn't inherent in pleasant and unpleasant, but had to do with the way you responded. There is this expression in English called the acquired taste that certain things can be unpleasant in and of themselves. But then we kind of hang in there with it and we through associations and whatever we use, we eventually get to like it. So I found that was true for beer. When I first had beer as a teenager, I was like, how could anybody in their right mind drink? It's like cold pee or something. And or the coffee had the same reaction. It's a few times like, God, they're drinking dishwashing water. And then it's acquired taste after a while. Now at their times where I can enjoy these things like beer, I don't drink much beer now, but I came to a point where I could enjoy it. But in and of itself, there's something in and of itself which is unpleasant, but there's something else that makes it pleasant. When I was, a story I tell is when I was in Davis going to school there. I would ride in the morning to school in the wintertime with a tule fog in my bicycle. And I wasn't smart enough to have gloves. And I would come to school and my hands would be so cold, I couldn't hold my pen in classroom because my hands, it took a while for my hands to thaw. And there was very biting pain. And I used to go, you know, bike, bike to campus that way. And I'd feel miserable and have self pity and, you know, all these wonderful, painful kind of associations and ideas. And what is the really unpleasant experience in and of itself. And then I, but suddenly had a flash of insight riding my bike one day where the insight was the sensations I had in my hand, the biting pain, were exactly the same sensations I had in my hand when I was a teenager and used to go skiing. And it was cold. But when I was skiing, it was part of the exhilaration, part of the delight and the joy, same sensations in the hand, but a different association. And I realized how much of the experience of the painful hands was intensified. It wasn't unpleasant sensation in and of itself. I'm not going to deny it was unpleasant. But there was such a big layer of story making, interpretations and associations that tied into it, that that's where a lot of the intense and pleasant it was, not in and of the experience in and of itself. Part of the part of the opportunity, we're starting to notice the pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral experience, the raw experience, the basic raw primary experience of things, is we can begin noticing what we add to it. And what we add to it often is unnecessary. And that's why we can see the door of freedom. We can leave things at the primary level, and we don't have to add suffering or clinging or attachment or all these other things on top of it, which sometimes make things more unpleasant. It's like I can have, I used to have, be able to have, I guess still a little bit, knee pain. And then, horrified anxiety would arise. And I would tense up around the pain. And then it would hurt more. Physically, physically I hurt more, but because, only because, because I was tensing. The way we react affects our experience. Is he following me? So the whole world of emotions, to understand them, we need to also understand how primary our response is to pleasant and unpleasant. And to see that. If we don't see that, then we might be operating at a very, you know, more abstract, more removed level. There's tremendous insight available when we see that very primary point of pleasant and unpleasant. And then how we build, sometimes whole emotional worlds based on that. So that's it for the morning. And so we'll take an hour for lunch. And so one of the reasons that it's important to become aware of emotions is so we can become aware of the effect that emotions have on our life, on our, on how we see world. The Buddha said that if you take, based on the water, a body of water, and you're going to look at your reflection in the water. If you put red dye or green dye or mud or something into the water and you try to see your face, you're not going to see a true reflection of what's there. It's like if you, I guess in modern, modern language would say, you know, if you put on rose colored glasses, then you see a rose colored world. And in order to have, in order to see clearly what's there, the water needs to be pure, needs to be clear. And then you can see clearly what's there and see yourself clearly. And emotions have the effect of coloring the way that we experience the world and see the world. And we'll make conclusions about all kinds of conclusions that are not inherent in the situation, but are very much influenced by our predisposition, our emotional predisposition. So sometimes I do an exercise, a guided meditation with people and I ask them to imagine themselves in a, in some lovely situation. They've been lovely day. It's just a very really comfortable, warm temperature and beautiful blue sky and springtime and beautiful meadow. And wild flowers and they pick on a beautiful hike and just the right amount. They're not exhausted, but they're quite refreshed by it. And they have sit underneath a beautiful oak tree and they had just the right amount of lunch, not too much, just the right amount and it's very comfortable. And they lay down and they just kind of drift off into a nice little nap. They wake up a short time later and everything's right in the world, very relaxed, very at ease. And then I ask people then imagine yourself in that state and then you turn to your friend who's laying in the grass next to you and you just volunteer a lie to your friend. You lie. And how would that feel to lie in that kind of circumstance? And most people will say something like, well when I'm not calm and settled and content and at home with myself, it feels like a violation to myself to lie. In the same way, if someone, then the other, then take that image away and take a different image of yourself and rush our traffic on the freeway and big accident up ahead and traffic is not even moving and all the cars are on and the fumes are blowing in and it's a really hot day and your air condition doesn't work and windows are down and some guy manages to cut you off anyway even if no one's moving and you're late for this really important meeting which the consequences not making to it are just awful and you're afraid of what's going to happen to the rest of your life if you miss this meeting and you can't get anywhere. And the person behind you is honking her horn and then one more person kind of cuts you off and it's just so easy kind of just to do something with your middle finger and it's just like almost automatic and you hardly feel the pain of that because you're so stressed out and so angry and frustrated and afraid that that it's just you know what you do with one little finger is kind of you know it's pretty minor compared to all the agitation you're feeling. And so the mood we're in, the state we're in has a big effect on our ethics and what we're willing to do and we're not willing to do. It's a lot easier to be unethical when you're all stressed out but also our mood our emotional state then affects how we see things. Aversive people have a lot of aversion will go into a situation and they'll see everything that's wrong. People who have a lot of desire might go into a situation see all the things that they want all things that are going well. People have a lot of fear will see everything as being a threat. See, ready to see a threat to all kinds of situations where there's no threat at all. People who are ready to take everything very personally see everything in terms of themselves. Maybe they have a personal hole or a sense of lack or sense of insufficiency or something and so everything is measured against that feeling of insufficiency and so whatever they pick up in the environment they're ready to read it. How does this relate to my insufficiency or whatever. Our mood our emotional state our inner life has a big impact on how we respond to the world and how we see the world and one of the reasons to become mindful of our emotions is to become aware of how we're being influenced how we're being biased in how we see things. You might still see it that way but then you might see oh the world's a threat but then you know from your mindfulness I'm feeling fear and I have this interpretation of the world's a threat. I don't know whether it's a threat or not. I'll keep my eyes open in case it is but chances are I've done this you know 95,000 times before I thought it was a threat and it wasn't. So part of the function of mindfulness is to add a question mark at the end of our emotions and the conclusions we make by our emotions. Is this the really way it is? Are the conclusions really the way it is? It isn't saying it isn't that way. It's always putting a question mark. Is this the way it is? With the possibility maybe it's not. Maybe it's different. It makes a world of difference to have a question mark at the end of stuff than it is to kind of this is the way things are. Now I know this person really treated me awful the worst possible thing and I'm just angry at that person who's so disrespectful versus that felt really disrespectful in the question mark. Maybe let's find out what's going on here. So much of suffering in the life actually arises out of false interpretations of what's going on. So the exploration of emotions becomes important and in the exploration of emotions the what we discover is that emotions for the most part are composite events. They're made up of many different factors and events and as we become aware of the different elements that make up a particular emotion then it's easier to be may not be caught up by the interpretations the idea the power of that emotion that it has on us the influence. The mind in Buddhism is not a thing. Human being is not a thing. It's an activity. The mind is an activity and so it's constantly in action. It's constantly moving and flowing and changing and doing and it's changing and evolving based on the conditions that influence it that feed it and with the conditions change then the activity changes and conditions are always changing. If we're aware of how external conditions change and how we react and respond to that then we have some ability to be decisive have some choice about how we allow the mind to flow. If we're not aware of how we take on the conditions of the world then it seems seem like we're victims of faith or victims of whatever's going on that we were preordained that this is going to be our reaction. If you're in some horrible situation and someone yells at you in a horrible angry way and you feel afraid or you feel angry in return it might seem that that's preordained that's the way it should be that of course if someone's yelling at you you should get angry or afraid or whatever your response would be. It's not preordained. It depends on how you receive those conditions and then how you choose to respond in return. Anger of fear is not an automatic built-in part of nature. It's a choice that we make to respond a certain way and part of the function of mindfulness is to place us in that point of choice so we can make wise decisions not repressed ones not denying ones but wise decisions about what we choose to pick up and how we want to respond. So emotions are composite things. When you say I'm angry and that's all you know is you're angry or you're happy and that's all you know is you're happy it's kind of like saying that you know what a painting is because you know the title. If you know the Mona Lisa I know the title so now you know I know what it is right you don't really know the Mona Lisa but on the title you have to actually study all the different elements of the painting and the color and all things. So the same way with with emotions just because you know that it's anger doesn't mean you know much about the emotion and part of what we do in mindfulness practice is to begin exploring what are the different elements that make up this experience. One of the elements we talked about this morning is the very basic aspect of pleasant unpleasant and our relationship to the pleasant and unpleasant and that can function at all kinds of level. It can function at the micro level and it can function at the macro level. We can have this macro kind of bad experience rush hour traffic that's all blocked up. It's an unpleasant experience. How do we relate to that big macro unpleasant catastrophe? It can happen at the micro level we're sitting here and we feel a little itch a teeny little itch someplace and it's an unpleasant sensation. How do you relate to that? It doesn't matter what the experience is but what do you relate to how do you how do you respond? There's one of the elements of when it makes up an emotion. Another important element of emotions is that they're bodily they involve sensations in the body. I would say I would argue or at least my view is that all emotions have bodily expressions as part of them. There's something in the body happens. William James said something like if you didn't have a body you wouldn't know if you had an emotion or not because it's the bodily experiences that tell you the emotion is there. So you know if you feel angry you feel a tightening someplace or heat or pressure. If you feel love you feel kind of soft and bubbly or tingly or something wonderful. There are bodily sensations directly connected to the emotion. This is pretty standard you find a lot of psychologists talking about this too. In Buddhist practice it's very important to start recognizing the physical side of an emotion so that we can ground our attention in the emotion we can feel it and be present for it without getting caught up in the story because mostly what feeds emotions and a big part of where emotions originate is not in external conditions but rather the story making we have about the presence of that experience. Some of you probably know you can have an emotion that has nothing to do with that happening in the external world. You're sitting here peacefully minding your own business and meditation and suddenly you have a memory about something happened 20 years ago and you get angry or I've gotten angry at things that I think are going to happen. I have no idea whether they're going to work out that way but I have this fantasy that things are going to happen that way and then I can feel the energy and the tightening inside of me and upwelling feeling it you know I'm all you know rallying the forces you know to take care of this. It's just a pure fantasy and I'm capable of having an emotion based on you know a figment of my imagination. Do some of you have the same experience? And so mostly a lot of emotions arise out of story making and if we stay connected to the story making part of the mind then we tend to it's very easy to get caught up in cycles of more and more stories and reacting and responding and doing that but we want to stay present for the emotion without getting caught and lost in the story making part of the mind relationship to it and one of the ways to do that is to feel how the emotion is felt in the body to drop down into the body and experience it there. The bodily experience of emotion is always something that's in process. The body is not a thing in Buddhism it's an activity. The muscle is in a sense you know you say there's a muscle in a sense but the muscle is constantly an activity unless it's frozen and locked in place but a natural emotion is constantly moving and flowing and tightening contracting. The body from Buddhist perspective is seen as an activity meaning that if we have an emotional response and the bodily aspect of that is something which is moving. The word emote means literally the etymological sources of the word to move out. The emotion, motion. It's in motion and it's a lot easier to allow the natural processing of movement of an emotion to occur if we drop down and feel it in the body. Also the body is for most people a much more neutral place to feel an emotion than the story making part of the mind. It's a lot safer to feel your emotion in your body. The body is always in the present moment so you know you're in the present moment when you're in your body. If you're trying to be aware of emotions and you're thinking a lot in story making then it might you might hardly be in the present moment at all. It might be still fantasizing about the future. To drop down into the body and let the food of attention, the nourishment of our awareness flow into experiencing what's actually happening in the present in the body. It allows that food to nourish that which is helpful. If the food of awareness flows into more story making it feeds continual story making. So one of the reasons why we emphasize the body so much is to drop out of the story making and be and but still learn how to be present for the emotion in a very direct way. Does that make sense? Any questions? Yes, true. So it sounds like the story creates the emotion. I think there are two, I'm not an expert on emotions in terms of you know what psychology is. Psychologists have been studying there's a whole science of different theories about emotions. I've read a few books and there's all different kinds of theories different theoreticians about what an emotion is and how it works. So maybe no one really knows. This is a little bit tangential but yesterday we did a one day sitting here and we were talking about joy the end of the day and I was merely going ahead talking about joys if I know what I'm talking about and then it came up that what's the definition of joy? And I was completely stumped and I went home and looked it up in the dictionary and dictionary definition was circular basically said something like joy is experience of you look there too is gladness it's be yeah you look up gladness and it says it's experience of joy. So why am I saying this? So you know story making so so so so so so so I was going to say this so in my and Gil's theory of emotions there there are primary emotions and secondary emotions and primary emotions are those who don't come from a story but if you're standing on the edge of a cliff I think a lot of people just feel fear or suddenly a car kind of comes 70 miles an hour directly at you then you know fear is an appropriate response it's very gut reaction and there's a number of very gut kind of responses that seem very prime or very immediate they don't necessarily go through the normal story making processing of the mind evaluations of the mind there's another category of emotions called secondary emotions which are evaluative in nature they come with some evaluations and story making some assigning a meaning and probably for most of us a huge percentage of what emotions we feel in the course of a day belong to that secondary level of emotions they're not primaries they're not that often the mountain lions are ready to jump at us but we feel a lot of fear and a lot of anxiety and that fear and anxiety often comes from the story making capacity of the mind or the underlying belief system of the mind the world is out there to threat you know to attack me all the time and so part of what we want to do in practice is to also question that our cognitive belief sets the story making capacities see see the connection between story making and the emotion and you'll see that very clearly as you continue with mindfulness practice sooner or later you'll notice very clearly that the you'll see you see have a thought arises in the mind and then you'll see following that thought is an emotion and you know you're suddenly thinking about the future and fear suddenly the memory of the past anger suddenly a you know fantasy about some sexual fantasy about someone some wonderful fantasy about some person and all this energy begins rising up in the body you thought you were sleepy but suddenly you're very awake the um and you can see that connection between a thought and an emotion sometimes you'll see it the other direction you'll see there's an emotion first seemingly first and that emotion then gives rise to certain kinds of thoughts so say that you're you're um you know when you're afraid for maybe for good reason originally and you go into a situation and you're ready to kind of to think oh that person you know and you suddenly the mind starts making thoughts of ideas think thoughts and stories about that person because you're predisposed to be afraid thoughts about how that person is threatening so to watch that relationship between emotion and thoughts and thoughts and emotion can be very liberating because you don't have to believe it then if you can see it if you don't see this difference between them then it can also be in all be kind of one big kind of package and it can seem very believable so again one of the one of the values of mindfulness practices become quiet and sensitive enough to see that difference so i would say that most of us i would guess that most of our emotions that we experience are what i call secondary emotions what do you think of that the rest of you is that seem to go along with that yes or something but exactly What makes a lot of sense? There are so many parameters, how they all feed into each other is part of what we become aware of. What you describe now is pretty common for someone who feels all stressed out for some reason. And then the same situation in which the day before they were very quantum-less about, today they are all upset about, and so they don't see it. You raise the issue of hormones, who knows all the different influences on their mood and their emotions. Maybe we should have a third category besides primary and secondary, besides the mountain lion and our story-making ability, hormones and food and other things that might have an effect. And so then how do we hold that when we see it? And part of the function of mindfulness is to help us not be influenced unduly by the states that are there. Right. Right. One of the primary stories we make is around the self, who I am in relationship to it. And another important aspect of mindfulness practice is to learn to disidentify from the emotions or the story-making, the thought flow of the mind. Have you ever had the experience of being lost in your thoughts? You didn't know it, but you were lost in your thoughts. And then at some point you woke up and you could see, you were still thinking in the flow of thought that was going on, but you were the watcher, the observer watching that flow of thoughts. Have you ever had that experience? Who are you? Are you the thoughts or are you the watcher? I think you don't have to answer that. But I think the tendency when you are lost in your thoughts is identification that your thoughts and you are the same as really strong. It's kind of like the operating mode we are in. When you become the observer or the observation is going on, you step outside of that flow of thoughts. It's really a miraculous moment to see that the thoughts don't have to be you. And that lends itself to all kinds of opportunities. One is, don't take it so personally. You have some horrible thought and it's just the conditions of life. It's the mind. So not to take the mind as a personal thing. The mind is a process and activity which can be seen almost as if it's outside of you or it belongs to someone else. It's just something there. You don't have to take it so personally. Every movement of the mind doesn't have to be some statement about who you are. And that's very freeing. Every story the mind makes doesn't have to be taken to be a true story. You don't have to live in that place. Yes? So emotions are motivating and therefore they are justified. No, but isn't that almost the implication? Or they have an important role in our life. So emotions are a very important part of our life. It's been said that part of our ability to understand life, understand ourselves, part of the way we process our experience of life and the way intelligence works is through our emotions. It's part of the processing process. If we didn't have any emotions we wouldn't be human. We wouldn't be able to understand very well this life that we're living. But then emotions are also motivating. This is beyond just helping us understand. So it's very common for people to raise their hand and say, for example, if I give a talk on anger and they raise their hand and say, well, I think anger has a really important place because it motivates me and I can get things done. I can fight injustice. I have a deadline. I can suddenly do a lot of things, a lot of energy. And I feel really sad when I hear this. I agree with them. It's true. But I feel sad. And the reason I feel sad is that I believe that there are other emotions which can motivate us to be just as much energized to do things that don't involve this painful experience of anger. Compassion, for example, to see what the suffering of the world, the suffering maybe that the government makes, for example, and respond out of compassion can be very effective. Compassion is motivating. And the advantage of compassion is that it doesn't have some of the deleterious effects of anger. Anger is often alienating. It tends to add to conflict rather than remove it. It tends to reinforce anger in ourselves. Anger also tends to influence our perception of we can't see very accurately when we're angry. So we don't really know if we're doing the right thing because we don't really see. So I think we need to be very careful about how we use our emotions as motivators and try to be wise about what we allow to be motivating and what not. So I think that's really identified and feel with really what it is that you're living in and is it, you know, is that the sort of that accommodation that I want to have? Or can I spend my time in transition so that I don't really stay in the same entity place but motivate or come from a place of compassion and love. And it takes a lot of work and it's interesting that people are taught outside of mindfulness and really active thinking. And it's interesting because for me when I was working on a memory relationship and when I finished kind of to be able to find my anger and work out or get to that step, it's like what am I afraid of? What is my issue? Keeping me active in place where I'm assured this could be from another person or another person. So what I would like to do is to try to see if we can explore a little bit the emotions in our body and how our body feels about them. And so let's, if you want to stand now, we've been sitting for a while, stand, stretch, loosen up your... So sitting upright, sitting quietly, closing your eyes and then very directly becoming aware of your body. Very matter-of-factly, as if you're a naturalist out in nature, just there to discover what it's like in nature. Very matter-of-factly, become aware of your body. Don't try to change anything or make anything happen now as you sit down. Just sit quietly and let your attention roam around your body as if it's not your own body even. Miraculously, you've sat down and you've closed your eyes and you've popped over into someone else's body and you've never had a chance to experience someone else's body before. And isn't that something? So what is this person's body like? You're not going to change anything now because you just want to find out. So using roam around and feel your body. Noticing how you feel right now, the emotion or mood that you have and how that is manifested in your body as energy, as sensations, and then notice what the strongest sensation is in your body that's related to your emotional state, to emotion or mood. And then bring your attention to that part of your body and very gently feel it and sense it as if awareness is a soft, cotton gauze that you're very gently going to just tap, touch, feel, sense that part of your body. And then find out what sensations characterize whatever mood or mental state you have. It might be very subtle. It might be a broad feeling of a big expense of your body. It might be a very precise feeling in a particular muscle. Is it sensations of tightness or looseness, warmth, coolness, pressure, softness, hardness, energy, vibration? How big of an area of your body is affected by this emotion or mood that you might have? Be very allowing of it. Just feel it. Drop down into your area of your heart, the heart center area, sternum area. And feel what sensations are there. Even if you feel very little there, it's okay. Just feel that part of your body. Feel it there. And as you feel sensations in that part of your body, are there any emotions that are related to those feelings, those sensations? And if there are, be very allowing about the feelings and the sensations. And take refuge in the sensations. Just feel the sensations as if they're permission to be there. As if awareness is a wide, vast screen upon which the sensations can do whatever they're going to do. Move or expand, contract, get stronger or weaker, vibrate. And drop your attention down into your stomach. And feel whatever sensations you feel there. Are there any obvious emotions or feelings you have connected to those sensations? And then feel the sensations of your back. Are there any emotions? There might not be. It's okay if there's none. But are there any, since any emotion is connected to the sensations of your back? Shoulder blade area, spine. Let go of the story making. And just feel this physicality of the emotion of the sensations. Come aware of the sensations of your neck. Explore your neck a little bit. Throat area, neck. Allow it to be as it is. And are there any emotions or feelings connected to the sensations of your neck? If there are, allow it to be that way. Feel the sensations. Explore them. Rest in the sensations, not in the reactions or story making. And then bring your attention to your face, jaw, mouth, nose, eyes, forehead. Feeling the sensations there as they are. And are there any emotions, feelings that seem to be manifested through those sensations? And then check in again overall. How are you feeling? What's the mood or the emotional state that you're in? There's no right or wrong way to be. Just how are you? And overall, how is that manifested in your body? Very quietly, very softly continue breathing. But breathe into or through or with the physical manifestation of your mood or mental state. And then pay attention now what happened in your body. Notice the shifts in your body sensations, in your emotions, the expression of those emotions in your body. And I tell you what we might be doing next. And that is, we might be turning to a person next to you, sitting facing them and look them in the eyes deeply. And then talk to them about your deepest fears. Anticipating such an exercise, what happens in your body? What do you hold on to? Is there any holding, gripping, resisting? To the flow of feelings and emotions? Any thoughts, judgments, story making? And then take a couple of deep breaths and let go of all that. And then very matter of factly, begin again with your breathing. Feeling your breath in and out. Settling yourself on each breath, letting go with the exhalation. Letting the breathing have a calming effect on the body and mind. If you were going to choose one emotion that had the greatest power over your life, greatest hold on you, what emotion is it that has the greatest hold? What does it feel like to have that emotion when it's there? Where in your body do you experience it and feel it? If there's a place in your body where you tend to feel this emotion, rest content to keep the awareness in that part of your body. Just feel it there. Staying with what's physical, staying with the sensations, naming them, feeling them, staying present, noticing what happens as you stay with the physical. Stay in your body. Stay in your body with the breath or sensations of your body. As if your body is your best friend, as your guide. Putting aside stories and ideas and thoughts. Be with your breathing, be with the sensations of your body. Let them unfold as they wish. Let the awareness flow as it wishes in the body. Sometimes when you feel carefully your body, you can feel how you brace yourself against life. Hold yourself. If it's possible as you exhale to soften the holding. Stay in your body. And in the last minute or so of the sitting, review what the sitting was like. Review, think a little bit about what your relationship is to your body and what your relationship is to experiencing your emotions in your body. So, is there anybody who would like to share a little bit with what that was like? To be able to follow your emotions through your body and feel the sensations connected to the emotions? So you'd have a thought and there'd be fear in your stomach and then the thought goes away. There's a residue that would last maybe a minute or so. Good. Good observation. Most people don't have a chance to unwind much of the residue. Maybe 99.9% of the residue disappears but 1.1% remains. And that becomes accumulative over time. 0.10% over a lifetime becomes greater and greater. The Buddhist tradition talks about the accumulation, what we accumulate over time. And that some of the process of practice is a purification of what we've accumulated. Letting go of some of the tensions and holding patterns have built up slowly over a long time. So emptying ourselves are the traces of the residue. Could you see the difference between being in your thoughts with emotion and being in your body with it? Which felt more comforting for you? To be within your body, your emotional body, or being in your emotional thoughts? I apologize for those of you who this has been an emotional roller coaster. And especially a little piece about we might be turning to the person next to you and sharing your darkest secrets and that change your body sensations? It seemed like maybe it was like a cheapo way to get to make a point. I apologize. I woke you up. So the tremendous thing about the body is that the body is a really good friend. It's one of your best friends if you know how to be mindful of it and use it and be present for it. It's really great. Let's take half an hour to do some walking. It's almost 2.30. So let's be back at 3. I'd like to recommend for the walking time, it's similar to this morning where you walk around the neighborhood clockwise if you like. Maybe go a little bit further down to El Camino where it's really more interesting down there. Watch the traffic when you cross the street. Please be careful. And as you walk normally more or less, and as you're walking, do a few things. Keep going and ongoing labeling and noting of what you're emotionally feeling. You might have one primary mood or emotion, but pay attention to all the subtle variations that happen. Suddenly a car comes down the road and you feel some apprehension. So name it. Just make an ongoing slow, easygoing naming of what's happening. If you can't think of anything new that's happened emotionally, just repeat the same name for what's still there. If you don't know what to say, say confusion. It's an emotion of sorts. It's confusion. If you're getting bored with doing this, if you can't find anything and get irritated, you can say irritation. Just name it. Just an ongoing naming of it and an ongoing naming of how that feels in your body. Tightness, warmth, softness, pleasantness, unpleasantness, contraction, expansion. Two things you do is you name the ongoing feeling emotion and then the corollary in the body, what you feel like in the body. Just walk around the neighborhood, doing whatever you can so you can stay in touch with that realm. Keep the ongoing commentary of the labeling going to keep you on track. Just enjoy the kaleidoscope of emotions, the subtlety of emotions, walking around. Maybe, whatever way you want. If you want to do the advanced course, you go down to El Camino. Then we keep track of the clock so you can come back. We start again at three. We're waiting for people to come back. What was that like? Did I walk? One of the suggestions in the Buddhist tradition is that it's very helpful when you're able to disidentify from your emotions. It doesn't mean denying them. It doesn't mean avoiding them or disowning them or remaining aloof from them. It has a very simple meaning of no longer using the emotions as a way of defining who you are. If anger arises, you're not then worried that other people are going to see you being angry because that's going to characterize you as a bad person. That's why you're being defined by the anger. You're thinking other people are defining you that way. If you feel a lot of joy, then we define ourselves without joy. I really want people to notice that I'm happy because that's my true nature. They'll really see who I am. It's really important. They better see me right now. I'm still happy. We take the life out of it because we're holding on to it so much. To not define ourselves by our emotions, to not identify with the emotions, to not take them personally, is very helpful. The question I have for you is, what have you found helpful in learning or in your ability not to take your emotions personally, not to identify with them? What have you learned that helps you not identify with your emotions? Feeling the universality of the emotions, that you're feeling joy or fear or anger or discouragement. Billions of people out there are probably going through the same. Billions of moms going through the same. Haven't gotten enough sleep. It's not so personal when you realize it comes with a human condition. Yes. Identify with one of them, then something had to die in the next second. You had to let go of something. On retreats, there's a phenomenon, some people experience, we go 10 day retreat, where the first day of the retreat might be really difficult, and they're tired, and from all their busy lives or whatever, and they feel so awful, and they can't get concentrated, and they say, oh poor me, I can't believe I signed up for a retreat, what I was thinking of, it's going to be forever, 10 days, and oh poor me. The next day they get their rest and they feel calm, and it's relatively easy to stay with their breath, and wow this is great, I'm calm, and boy I've got a maid, I'm a good meditator, and I think I should pay for one of my relatives to do this, and when can I sign up for the next retreat, this is really great. The third day happens, it's like up against a wall of fear, you never get to know there was so much fear inside of you, and boy you're just reeling in fear and worry and anxiety, and oh my God, why did I sign up for this retreat, and these teachers don't know what they're talking about, and these people I'm sitting with, who are these bozos, and then the next day the fear drops away, and then you feel not just calm, but you feel tremendously peaceful joy, you never have a sublime kind of peaceful joy, you never experienced so much peace and joy before, I got a maid, this is it, I've arrived, and all these beautiful people around me, just look at them, you know, you feel so much compassion and joy in them, and all those great teachers, and then the next day, and sooner or later they'll catch on, it's always changing, and then seeing that things are always changing is one way not to identify so strongly with them, not to take them so personally, and you see people who've been on retreats a lot, they know the cycles, they're much more gracious about the cycles, say oh, it's like that today, oh it's like this meditation is like that, it'll change again, I've been through these cycles before, and there's this ease, and kind of float with it much more than oh my God, this is it, you know, whatever, make some great conclusion about it, so that's change, what else, what else helps you not to identify, forging ahead with what has to be done, and not letting them limit you, the emotion or the experience sometimes can help with the disidentification, because sometimes our evaluations, our story making is optional, just not necessarily even accurate, and so being creative and maybe thinking about more useful stories, and the story, you know, like you had, which is a very good one, very wise one, you know, there's all these other mothers all over the world having the same thing, it's not so personal, it's not just me, it just comes with motherhood, and that's a story, you know, it's a useful, maybe truer story than what you used to have, but it's still kind of re-evaluating coming with a different perspective to understand it. It's one of the shifts that sometimes happens in Buddhist practices, to move from the personal story to the universal story, and so much of what we take as personal comes with being a human being, human beings as well as gain and loss, all kinds of loss, and people are born, people die, we get old, we get sick, and those have, those are universal human experiences, they're part of the universal story of people, it's like this template, human beings will experience loss and death, and that's just kind of universal, and then we take it so personal, it's just me, it's all about yourself, me, myself, and me, myself and mine, and the shift from the two, from personal to universal, helps with some of the loosening of identification. Any other ideas? So, the investigation of emotions is very important. So the, so recognizing an emotion is paramount, without recognizing the presence of an emotion, then you're caught by it, there's no freedom there, so we have to learn to recognize emotion. After recognizing it, it helps if we accept it. An acceptance in Buddhist language doesn't mean condoning it, or it doesn't mean kind of being a pushover for things, it means that the heart of the mind, the heart of the mind doesn't contract or hold onto or push away with the experiences. What your wise common sense will say, but what to do about the situation will vary, but there's no reason for your mind, or your heart to contract, or to resist, or to push away, hold on. So acceptance means what you do with awareness, be accepted into the field of awareness fully and completely. So there's recognition, there's acceptance, then there's the investigation, which is very important. And one of the reasons why we try to learn to recognize an accepted presence there, learn how to be present for it, is so we can investigate more precisely what's going on here, what are the different elements of the emotion we're having. If we simply give expression to emotion, or just simply take it to the surface of what it is, we miss some of the roots of it. And what we want to try to do is get down to the deeper roots that are stimulating, those seeds, or maybe it's the wrong mixing of similes, but that's a source for what's on the surface. So for example, if you feel, it's very classic, often anger is more of surface emotion. And often what's underneath anger might be hurt, it might be fear. And if a person can be present for the anger, accept it, not push it away, just really feel it and see it. Allow it to be there. Then it might be possible to see in the cracks of the anger that actually is being fueled by fear, or by hurt. And I find in my personal life that I found it's not very useful to have conversations with people when I'm angry with them. What I try to do, I don't try to ignore it, it's a conflict, but I try to wait until I'm no longer angry. And in exploration of my anger, I also try to understand what else is going on. And if I can find that there's fear or hurt that's underlying it, then I'll talk from the place of fear or hurt. I feel afraid. When you said that I felt really hurt. And then I found that the conversation works a lot better, because a person is less likely to get defensive, and it's not about them attacking them. So it's to come back to the subjective, what's going on here? One of the keys to this exploration around emotions is to notice whether the emotion or the story around the emotion is pointed outwards to someone else. If there's an object to the emotion, are you angry with that person? Are you desirous of that person? Is it something to do with the other person? Then there's a very good chance that you're missing what's really at the root of the source of the root in yourself. If you're always focusing outside to the person, that person is to blame, that person is the source of my joy or my happiness. I only have love in my life if that person gives it to me. And that's kind of surface, and it's a very important part of our lives in its own way. But what we're hard to do in mindfulness is turn away from, in mindfulness practice, in common sense situations you might not want to do this, but in mindfulness practice you want to turn away from the object of your emotion. And turn the attention around to be with the subjective experience of the emotion. And then it might break up and open up to be something else. If you're really hanging on to the person you're angry with, or the person that you love, or whatever, and it's all about that object out there, the object of your desire, it's actually in some ways blinding. And if you're holding on to it, clinging to it, you can't really see what's going on with yourself. So there has to be a turning away, a turning around of the attention to be with this objective state, so we can really see what's going on here. If a person is filled with fear, and it's uncertain what they're afraid of, but they're always directing their attention external to themselves as a way to somehow find safety or security or protect themselves or something, it might be useful to do that in certain circumstances. But again, it's always turned away. You want to turn around and feel this subjective state of fear. If you have delight, when I was in the monastery in Tassahara, I saw myself and a lot of people, the monastic life lends itself to becoming very open-hearted, and lots of feeling of love and being open-hearted. And one of the consequences of that is it's really easy to fall in love. And people are falling in love with Tassahara all the time. And you can fall in love inappropriately because you're so ready, you know, like, wow. And what I found is that if I turned away from the object of my desire and focused again on this objective, it was actually much more sublime and much more profound. The open-heartedness, the depth of what's possible there, the doorway into deeper access to the light and love. But if I took a detour and got focused on the person, and something outside of me became the object of the love or the desire, it tended to again blind me or put blinders on me from what was possible deep inside. So part of the training of mindfulness is a training to learn how to turn around to what's happening subjectively. You stop blaming someone or wanting someone, and what's happening here inside. And then it can sometimes start breaking up into not just being this kind of solid thing, but into all the different elements to make up that experience, all the different emotions that make it up, all the different aspects of it, the stories, the beliefs, the sensations, the different emotions that make it up. At the root of a lot of things, our fear, our desire, our hate or ill will or aversion is delusion. And those are considered in Buddhist traditions to be very primary, not in the way I talked about earlier, but very root. It's called the roots. To the whole big edifice of our emotional life. Those are called unhelpful ones, unwholesome ones. And then there's generosity, love, and wisdom, which are considered to be the wholesome roots. So our whole edifice of our emotional life can be built on this foundation of either the three unhelpful states of greed, hate, and delusion, or the wholesome states of generosity, love, and wisdom. And that requires this subjective turning in so we can get to the roots and really see what's going on here. Using the word subjective probably isn't completely adequate, but I think so many of us are focused on objects, the object of our attention, the object of what we want. We can treat ourselves as objects, which is very painful also. We treat ourselves as an object that we, as a self-image, we hold ourselves as an image of who we are. That's treating ourselves as an object. If we have some fixed concept of who we are, that's treating ourselves as an object. There also you need to turn away from the idea we have of who we are and into what's actually subjectively going on in the moment. And that's where it begins loosening up. A lot of what Buddhist practice is aiming at is loosening up the frozen way in which we hold on to our emotional lives, we hold on to our thoughts. And the grip of the mind is quite powerful. The grip of desire, the grip of fear, the grip of aversion. The mind kind of tightens down on its ideas, on what it wants and doesn't want. And to begin loosening that grip, the grip of thoughts, the frozen thoughts, the frozen feelings in the body, so to begin flowing and breaking up and dissolving is part of what happens as we practice. So the function of investigation is to begin seeing more what's going on, to look and discover. Do you have any questions about that? Yes? No, it's clinging. What is that? Not knowing, being confused by how things are. Being confused by who you are. Being deluded by who you are, for example. There's a lot of self-delusion going around. As soon as we've put ourselves into a category, say, this is who I am, this delusion is operating. Any fixed category always leaves something out. So we're always more than a fixed category. So any fixed category that definitively defines, this is who I am, is always more than a fixed category. So any fixed category that definitively defines, this is who I am, is a form of delusion. Is that right? Yeah, it can be. We can cling to our aversion, too. Okay, let's sit again. So again, if you want to stand and stretch in your body, in your body in a dignified posture. There's a wonderful relationship between our emotional life and our body that goes in both directions. And so if you take a posture that is dignified, upright, it actually helps your emotional life, it helps your inner life. Take a posture that expresses being alert, being awake. Focusing on your spine. Kind of slowly go up your spine and be very attentive to as many of the vertebrae as you can from the bottom going up. That your vertebrae are not just comfortable but upright, alert. Sitting quietly. Taking two or three deeper breaths. It's a way of connecting to your body. And as you breathe out, breathe out a little more fully than usual and let go. Let go of your thoughts, let go of your attention in your body. Letting your breath be normal. Very softly, but firmly. Let the breathing be connected to your awareness. Let the breathing come into the field of your awareness so that each breath that occurs passes across the field of awareness. Kind of like waves washing back and forth up and down across the beach. So the waves of the breath wash up and down across the field, the beach of your awareness. And then as you're sitting here quietly, become aware of your thinking. Don't need to stop thinking. If your thinking stops, then you can go back to your breathing. And when the thinking starts again, see if you can become aware of your thinking. Not what you're thinking about, but as if there's an inner voice that does the thinking. There's a speaking in there. And notice the quality of that inner voice. Does that inner voice, is it soft, is it harsh, is it kind, is it soft? Is it soft? Is it soft? Is it soft, is it harsh? Is it kind, is it aggressive? Is it hesitant, assertive? Is it scared? Is it confident? Don't strain to notice this, but as you go proceed through the sitting and you notice your thinking, see if you can kind of listen to your way you think. See if you can notice the quality of that inner voice. Is it loud or very quiet? And then that thinking process that you can tune into, the thinking mind, is there any emotion that seems to characterize it? Is it delighted or oppressed, worried or excited or calm or agitated, afraid? It might be very, very subtle, the emotional sense, most emotional background for that thinking mind. As if your awareness is very relaxed and broad, be aware of the emotional tone of your thinking voice. If you can't do it, just be open to the possibility you can do it. If you need to go back to the breathing at any time, you can go back and stabilize yourself with the breath. Be with the breath for a while. Enjoy the breath. Be at ease, at ease with whatever is going on and mindful. Awake to the particulars of your experience, the breath, the thoughts, the feelings. Notice the emotion that may be very subtle, but those that are connected to your thinking mind. And then coming to the last minute of this sitting, spend the minute reviewing the sitting. What happened? How were you? How were you engaged? What did you discover? Without judging the sitting or yourself, are there simple ways in which you might have been more engaged or more present? One of the advantages of having this mic right in front of me is that when I started drifting or a little bit falling asleep, I knew right away. Will any of you be able to track your thoughts a little bit and the voice that does the thinking and the subtle emotions of the thinking mind? What did you discover there? The only small thing I wanted to say as a footnote to what you said was in being raped there's a kind of loss of self, I suppose, fear of losing self. And Buddhist tradition puts a lot of emphasis on losing self. There's ways in which they can be done in a healthy way and an unhealthy way and that they too can get confused. And that can be a problem when they too get confused. I think if it involves a denial or a dismissing of parts of ourselves or a disowning of parts of ourselves, the thing about not taking things personally and identifying with things doesn't mean disowning them. It doesn't mean this is not happening to me or being dismissive. So if there's a denial or a dismissive of part of ourselves or shutting down part of ourselves, then it's unhealthy. Probably not. Probably done enough of it. Not all of them. I asked you at the last minute or so to review the sitting. Did you find that useful to do or interesting to do? What were the benefits of that for you? We're going to do our, it's now 4.12 from my watch here clock. So we're going to have a last sitting. Before we do that last sitting, if you'd like to stand again and stretch and get some energy, swing your arms, whatever you can. In the Buddhist tradition, we don't have to only leave our emotions to chance, just whatever arises and be mindful of it. There's also practices to cultivate certain wholesome emotions, helpful emotions. As I said at the beginning of the day, the Buddhist path is an emotional one with a lot of helpful wholesome emotions arise in the course of the path, but also they get cultivated in the course of the path. There are particular practices for cultivating and developing the capacity to feel certain helpful emotions. These are helpful in and of themselves to develop these things, but also they work really well as antidotes or as healing qualities for our emotional life when we're really in deep emotional distress or really stuck and frozen with certain emotional difficulties. They're very helpful to bring in some of the opposite quality of what we're stuck in. The two practices that I'm thinking of that are very helpful in the relationship to emotions and getting our emotions to move again so that they're not so stuck. The first is forgiveness practice and the second is loving kindness meditation. Sometimes those two are done together. Forgiveness meditation does not entail condoning or accepting as if everything's okay, something turns into an aggression or some problem that's happened. It's always recognizing that the transgression and something wrong has happened, but forgiveness means even recognizing that something terrible has happened to me, wrong has happened, it's been a transgression, I'm willing to open my heart, to be good willed towards this person again, to be kindly disposed to this person, not to hold my heart frozen or tight or have a barrier between me and this person or a barrier between the person and me. It doesn't ignore what's happened. Forgiveness meditation is beginning to release the grip held in our own heart. Then loving kindness meditation is to cultivate further the good will we have towards ourselves and to others. To wish ourselves happiness, to wish other people happiness can be done with clinging. It can also be done as a natural innate goodness of our own heart. To simply see someone who you feel nice towards and wish them further happiness or happiness is a very innate natural thing to do. It can seem not natural to do it towards ourself, but actually it is also. When the mind is really settled and quiet and all the superficial judgments and ideas and fears kind of settle away, it's quite innate in the goodness of our heart to wish ourselves and want ourselves happiness, safety, health, well-being. It needs to be done without expectation or demand, but just kind of to have that natural wish. That natural wish in and of itself can bring happiness. So know that that's not part of us that wants others to be happy, to know it wants us to be happy. That there's that part of us that kind of looks out for ourselves or wants the best in ourselves. To know that that's part of who we are can be very helpful. It can help loosen up the emotional life. When there's a lot of fear, a lot of anger, it can replace that with a whole different quality and it can be very healing for that part of us which is afraid, the parts of us which feels really hurt. To find the capacity in ourselves to have kindness, to have happiness, to have loving kindness, to have tenderness. So we don't have to always look outside of ourselves for a solution, but rather we can turn the resources inside of ourselves. And as the practice of loving kindness becomes something stronger within us, it becomes a real sense of strength, a sense of refuge, a sense of support so that when there's anger or fear or hurt that we're meeting it with another capacity, another strength of character, strength of ability so it doesn't overwhelm us. It can still be there, but we're able to meet it then or join it with feelings of goodwill and kindness. It makes us angry. Right there, close at hand, is our wish. It would really be nice if that person was happy. The person's a jerk and it would be nice if the person was happy. It's a kind of a natural tendency, a quick tendency. It's almost a habit. So take a comfortable posture. Really close your eyes. Very gently, softly. Take two or three, four breaths mindfully. Each time you breathe, you breathe out, drop down into the area of your heart. Letting yourself feel whatever might be there. In particular, see if you can notice any tenderness in that part of your body. A weak tenderness, aching tenderness, whatever tenderness it might be. Letting your breath move in and out through that area. To tenderize the heart, to release the grip we have on things, the grip of resentment, of anger, of fear. So to start the process of forgiveness, it's a process that could take years, but that's to begin feeling that this is a good direction to go and a willingness to begin the path of forgiveness. It might take years before you actually can, but the willingness to begin what it takes is a very significant moment. And it's done by repeating the following phrases, silently to yourself. Each time you say the phrase, to see if the intention of the phrase can kind of sink into your heart. See if you can stand behind the phrase and see in what ways it can be meaningful for you. The phrases are this. For whatever hurt others have caused me, intentionally or unintentionally, may I forgive them. For whatever hurt others have caused me, intentionally or unintentionally, may I forgive them. For whatever hurt others have caused me, may I forgive them. And then the other is, for whatever hurt I have caused others, intentionally or unintentionally, may I, may they forgive me. Whatever hurt I have caused others, may they forgive me. And then finally, for whatever hurt I have caused myself, intentionally or unintentionally, may I forgive myself. For whatever ways I have caused harm to myself, may I forgive myself. And then if it's available, staying with a sense of tenderness towards yourself, within yourself. Begin by having some thoughts of goodwill towards yourself. Just think. Reflect think any thoughts you'd like that express goodwill toward yourself. That would be nice if you could be happy. And then you can repeat the following phrases silently to yourself. Sinking into the meaning or the intention of the words. May I be happy. May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I be at ease. Feeling your physical body, your emotional body. Feeling yourself from the inside out. Just try to be a little bit at home with yourself, accepting of yourself. Friendly with yourself. Repeat the words again. May I be happy. May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I be at ease. And then bring to mind a benefactor. Someone who has cared about you. Someone who has extended themselves to help you or care for you in some way. Maybe think of this person when this person is happy. There's a smile on the person's face or glitter in their eyes. Imagine the person with their full capacity for happiness. Wouldn't it be nice if this benefactor was happy? Repeat the words. May you be happy. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be at ease. And then bring to mind some person, friend or colleague or relative or someone you might be seeing this weekend or the next few days. Bring them to mind. Maybe visualize them or reflect on their capacity that they have a capacity to be happy. They have the capacity to be at ease. And wish this person the best. May you be happy. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be at ease. And then relaxing and extending yourself out to the people in this room. People you've been sitting with during the day. Some of them you've heard and some you haven't spoken. Everyone here. See if in your own way, whatever way your is, whatever way is your own, extend your goodwill to the people here in this room. Including yourself. May all of us be happy. May all of us be safe. May all of us be healthy. May all of us be at ease. And then beyond this room, out into Redwood City and the rest of the peninsula, all the many beings and people it will encounter. Wouldn't it be great if there was happiness and safety and joy for everyone? Of course, you can't expect it to be thorough, but it's such a wonderful thing to wish it to have the intention that this be the case. To have your open heart and this spill out so there's the cynic, the skeptic in you, the fearful one in you, the aversive one in you. It doesn't limit, it doesn't put a hold in your capacity to really wish the best for everyone throughout this wider community. May all beings be happy. May all beings live in safety. May all beings be healthy. May all beings everywhere be at ease. May all beings be happy. And may whatever benefits that have come from this day of practicing together, may we share it with all beings everywhere so they may be happy and safe. As we leave here, driving our cars or walking, encountering other people on the streets, and visualize yourself giving away whatever benefits you've gotten from the day. Your calm, your concentration, your self-awareness. Give it all away so all beings may be happy.
