Greetings.  This morning  is the last of the five talks on 
anukampā , a concept  the Buddha  used  many  times , 
and which  I’m translating  as ‘care.’ While  it is 
sometimes  translated  as ‘compassion, ’ I’m suggesting  
that ‘compassion, ’ as wonderful  and important  as that 
is, has a narrower  range  of meaning  than the word  
‘care.’ ‘Care’ – in addition  to caring  for people’s 
suffering  – also involves  caring  for their welfare.  We still 
care for people  who are not particularly  suffering.  We 
have  a general  benevolence  for all beings  in all 
circumstances.  
 
I’m suggesting  that the word  ‘care’ is simpler  than 
attitudes  and emotions  like loving -kindness  and 
compassion.  It requires  fewer  concepts  and ideas  than 2 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg what  is often  associated  with compassion  and love.  
Love and compassion  are not always  accessible  to us, 
because  we don’t necessarily  feel this automatically  for 
the people  we meet.  We can certainly  try to develop  
universal  kindness  and compassion.  But it’s easier  to 
do so if we recognize  that underneath , we have  a 
sensitivity  and resonance  of the heart , which  is care – 
anukampā .  
 
As I’ve been  saying,  one of the reasons  for 
distinguishing  this word  from compassion  is that the 
Buddha  used  the word  anukampā  repeatedly  as the 
motivation  for how we care for the welfare  and 
happiness  of others.  The Buddha  never  used  the word  
karuṇā, often  translated  as ‘compassion, ’ as a 
motivation  or source  from which  to actually  support  and 
help people  in the world.  
 
This is very different  from how karuṇā came  to be 
understood  later in Buddhism.  But in this early  tradition,  
there  was anukampā  – a word  which  I think  got 
forgotten,  lost or subsumed  underneath  karuṇā over the 
centuries.  By bringing  forth the word  anukampā , I find it 
very helpful  to recognize  something  so simple,  which  
may be the foundation  for these  things.   
 
I’m interested  in exploring  this, because  for a long time 
I’ve been  interested  in the ethics  of freedom  and 
awakening.   3 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg  What  does  that look like?  
 What  are the ethics  of awakened  and liberated  
people?   
 What  are the ethics  of mindfulness  when  
mindfulness  becomes  strong?   
 
To answer  these question s, it might  be best to drop the 
idea of ethics,  because  it has associations  in English  
that might  not be a very good  fit for the teachings  of 
early  Buddhism,  which  is my reference  point.  
 
The closest  word  in the Buddha’s language  for the 
English  word  ‘ethics’ is probably  the word  kusal a, which  
is usually  translated  into English  as ‘wholesomeness ’ or 
‘skillfulness. ’ So the question s in early  Buddhism  are: 
Is what  we’re doing  skillful?   
Is it wholesome?   
 
This gives  you a different  flavor  than asking , “Is it 
ethical ?” 
 
Many  people  will say that the Pali word  for ethics  in 
Buddhism  is sīla, (śīla in Sanskrit ), but that’s not quite  
right.  It’s okay  to say that that’s what  it is. But again,  if 
you go back  to the early  Buddhist  texts , and see how 
the word  sīla is used,  it really  means  our behavior,  what  
we do. This is so much  so that, in his latest  translations  
of the Pali suttas,  Bhikkhu  Bodhi  now translates  sīla as 4 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg “virtuous  behavior  and virtuous  conduct ,” where  the 
emphasis  is our conduct  and what  we do.  
 
Action  is important.  Action  has to do with how we live in 
the world  and interact  with people.  Another  way of 
talking  about  the ethics  of awakening  and non-
attachment  is to call it the conduct  of awakening  and 
non-attachment.  I’m interested  in what comes  forth 
when  our conduct  is skillful  and wholesome.  
 
Certainly , one of the inspiring  statements  of the Buddha  
was when  he used  the word  anukampā , speak ing of the 
actions  that come  out of awakening , which  he said to 
the first sixty students  who practiced  under  him and 
became  fully awakened.  They  were  traveling  together.  
They’d done  what  had to be done.  They  were  liberated  
and free. And the Buddha  said this to them:   
 Travel  forth for the welfare  of many,  for the 
happiness  of many,  out of care for the world,  for the 
good,   
 the welfare , and the happiness  of gods  and 
humans.   
 
So this is the Buddha’s instruction  to people  who were  
awakened  for what  kind of behavior  they should  engage  
in – to go forth in order  to support  and promote  the 
welfare,  happiness,  and good  of others.  Here  we see 
that the idea of going  forth out of care (anukampā ) is 
intimately  connected  to awakening .  5 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg  
Care then is the source  of enlightened  behavior  in the 
world.  We see this in passages  where  the Buddha  
refers  to anukampā . He visits  people  out of anukampā . 
That characterizes  how the Buddha  engages  in his 
world,  caring  for the world  in all his teaching.  Maybe  all 
his teaching  was inspired  by anukampā  – care.   
 
There’s a fascinating  story  of a doctor  named  Jīvaka,  
who is talking  to the Buddha.  Jīvaka  says that the great  
god Brahma,  the overlord  of the gods,  lives with a mind  
of the divine  abodes  of mettā , karuṇā, muditā,  and 
upekkhā  (loving -kindness,  compassion,  sympathetic  
joy, and equanimity ). These  are the four flavors  of love 
that characterized  Brahma.  Jīvaka  says to the Buddha:  
I’ve heard  that the god Brahma  is characterized  by 
these  states.  Now I see this in the Buddha . I see 
that you abide  in loving -kindness.  You abide  in 
compassion.  You abide  in sympathetic  joy. You 
abide  in equanimity.  
 
To my mind,  the Buddha’s response  is very unusual.  He 
says: 
No, don’t say that. However,  if what  you mean  is 
that – if I abide  withou t the greed,  hatred,  and 
delusion  that give rise to ill-will, to cruelty,  to 
displeasure,  and to repulsion  – then I allow  you to 
say that I abide  in loving -kindness,  compassion,  
sympathetic  joy, and equanimity.  6 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg  
In other  words,  the Budd ha is reluctant  to be 
characterized  as living  or abiding  in these  four 
Brahmavihāras . But he is willing  to say that he abides  
without  the greed,  hate,  and delusion  that give rise to ill-
will, hatred,  cruelty,  displeasure,  and repulsion .  
 
Maybe , if there’s no greed,  hate,  and delusion,  then 
there  is love and something  that looks  like care, 
compassion,  and all these  things.  So what  is that?  The 
absence  of certain  things  then looks  like something  
else.  
 
I want  to give a small  example.  There  are two people  
who look from the outside  as if they’re patient.  They’re 
both in difficult,  challenging  situations.  However,  for the 
first person , on the inside  all their buttons  are being  
pushed , and it’s really  stressful  and challenging.  
They’re constantly  getting  irritated,  angry,  and 
discouraged.  For that person,  it’s a lot of work  to keep  
breathing,  to relax,  to be mindful  of what’s going  on, 
and to stay connected  to oneself  so they don’t get 
caught  in reactivity.  They  have  very strong  mindfulness.  
So with all the work  of paying  attention,  they are able to 
visibly  appear  nonreactive.  It looks  like they’re 
physically  or behaviorally  equanimous.  Others  would  
say, “Look,  that person  is equanimous. ”  
 7 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg The second  person  looks  just as patient.  However,  
inside  they have no buttons  that are being  pushed.  The 
second  person  doesn’t get irritated,  angry,  or 
discouraged.  No attachments,  preoccupations,  or 
worries  are being  triggered.  For this person,  patience  is 
not something  they have  to do. They’re not working  at 
being  patient.  It’s the absence  of anger  and irritation  
that makes  them seem  patient.   
 
So in that sense,  when  the Buddha  replies  to Jīvaka,  
“You can refer to me as having  abandoned  greed,  hate 
and delusion  – and in that sense,  you can say that I 
have  loving -kindness  and compassion, ” it isn’t like 
compassion  and loving -kindness  are something  to be 
done,  or that the Buddha  is working  on it. But somehow , 
that absence  of greed,  hate and delusion  looks  like 
what  we would  call loving -kindness  and compassion.   
 
If Jīvaka  had asked,  “Does  the Buddha  abide  in 
anukampā? ” I suspect  the Buddha  said,  “Yes, that I 
allow  you. That I abide  in.” The Buddha  really  felt that 
someone  who abides  in anukampā  has abandoned  ill-
will and hatred.  It is said that to dwell  in anukampā  for 
all beings,  one abstains  from harming  them.  When  one 
has abandoned  ill-will and hatred,  one abides  with 
anukampā  for the world.   
 8 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg So anukampā  is primary  for the Buddha.  He’s willing  to 
say that anukampā  is what’s there  when  there’s no 
greed,  hate and delusion.  
 
I’d like to end with a few things.  One is that the care that 
seems  to be there  in the absence  of greed,  hate,  and 
delusion  is not an obligation.  Sometimes  when  I hear 
teachings  about  compassion,  it feels  like I’m supposed  
to be that way. I need  to cultivate  it, and to be in the 
world  in a compassionate  way. I think  compassion  is 
fantastic.  But the idea that it is obligatory  feels  a little bit 
oppressive,  like, “Oh really,  I’m not good  enough?  I 
have  to do this now?” 
 
But the idea that care is found  through  letting  go of 
greed,  hatred,  and delusion , and the idea of awakening  
this deeper,  natural  sensitivity  means  that – rather  than 
being  concerned  with ethical  responsibility  – we who 
practice  can be concerned  with ethical  responsivity . We 
want  to discover  that place  of ethical  responsivity  where  
we can respond  skillfully  and wholesomely  to the world.  
Rather  than discovering  what  our responsibilities  are, 
we discover  our capacity  for responsivity.   
 
My hope  is that as we discover  this, it is applied  to 
actively  learning  about  the world  enough  to unders tand 
when  our lives cause  harm , and how in our lives we can 
benefit  and support  the world.  That responsivity  can 
travel  out through  the circles  of care and into the world  9 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg – so that our circles  of care become  all inclusive . In this 
place , we do not succumb  to greed,  hatred,  or delusion.  
 
I hope  that this discussion  on anukampā  (care) has 
given  you some  food for thought , and a new concept  to 
explore  in yourself.  Maybe  it has some  interest  and 
value  for you. I hope  so.  
 
In a couple  of minutes,  I’m happy  to take a few minutes  
of questions  for those  of you who want  to stay.  I’ll say in 
closing  that I’ll continue  with these  morning  sittings.  For 
the next four weeks,  the theme  for the talks will be the 
Four Noble  Truths.  Now that we’ve done  beauty  last 
week  and care this week,  maybe  we’re ready  in a 
different  way than we would  have  been  otherwise  to 
look at the very important  teaching,  practice,  and insight  
of the Four Noble  Truths.  Maybe  we’re ready  to look at 
and explore  the topic  of suffering.  We’ll spend  one week  
on each,  going  deeper  into each  Truth  as we go 
through  the week.  
 
Thank  you very much  for being  a part of this. For those  
of you who are listening  to this on Audio  Dharma,  thank  
you very much  for being  interested  in following  this 
series.  I’ve had a chance  to share  something  that’s 
important  for me. Thank  you. 
 
 
Q & A 10 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg  
“Can I speak  about  the Brahmavihāras? ” Thank  you, 
Sandy.  Maybe  that can be another  theme  for these  
early  morning  sittings.  I can do one week  on each  at 
some  point.  That’ll be nice.  Also IMC has a happy  hour.  
I think  they’re doing  it every  afternoon  this coming  
week.  At happy  hours,  they do the Brahmavihāras  – 
mettā  and so forth.   
 
“Can you also say that care is a direct  liberation  
practice,  because  it lessens  greed,  hate,  and delusion? ” 
Absolutely.  I think  that’s a wonderful  thing.  So if you 
want  to be free of greed,  hate,  and delusion,  go out 
there  and try to care for people  and the world.  But do so 
paying  careful  attention  to what’s going  on inside  of 
yourself,  so that you can notice  what  gets in the way of 
care.  You could  notice  how greed,  hate,  and delusion  
operate.  There’s a whole  different  perspective  on 
attachment  and clinging  that can come  from being  of 
service  than if we just sit and meditate.  It’s very 
valuable  and important.  Service  is a path in itself.  
 
It’s very heartwarming  to see all the Thank  you’s and 
Good  morning’s. Very nice.  
 
“If I understood  correctly,  you believe  anukampā  is a 
better  foundation  for ethics  than compassion.  Could  you 
explain  more  about  the relationship  between  
mindfulness  and ethics?” Well,  is it better  than 11 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg compassion?  It’s a tender  answer  to give, since 
compassion  is a foundation  for many  people’s religious  
and personal  life and what  they do. I can also say for 
myself  that was true. For decades,  I believed  that 
compassion  was at the heart  of my ethical  life. But over 
the last years,  I discovered  for myself – especially  when  
I discovered  the word  anukampā  as ‘care’ – that I had 
subsumed  and combined  two different  feelings  or 
attitudes  that existed  within  me. I saw them  as being  the 
same.  I saw them  both as compassion.  Just as some  
translators  translate  both anukampā  and karuṇā as 
‘compassion, ’ I had no language  to distinguish  a very 
simple,  quiet,  tender  care that has no object.  Sitting  
quietly  by myself  and meditating,  it just exists  as 
‘caringness ’ without  an object.  I called  it compassion  
without  an object  – that’s how I saw it. Then  there  were  
other  kinds  of compassion  where  I encountered  
suffering  in the world , and clearly  felt empathy , wanted  
to alleviate  it, and wished that suffering  could  go away.  
But now I’ve separated  out these  two, and the simpler,  
almost  non-conceptual  place  of care,  I call ‘care.’ It 
depends  on how you define  it. Compassion  is the 
concern  for the suffering  of others  and wanting  to have  
that suffering  go away.  It is a little bit more  conceptual.  
It involves  self and other in some  way. However,  for 
something  that is not conceptual  and doesn’t involve  
self and other  – I used  to call that tenderness  
‘compassion, ’ because  I had no distinction  between  the 
two. But now I think  I’d like to go along  with the 12 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: LK_mg distinction  that the Buddha  makes , and call this ‘care.’ 
This is a bit of a semantic  issue,  so we have  to be 
careful  not to treat this as some  absolute  difference.   
 
LH, I think  you said you’re from Iran,.  If that means  that 
you’re Iranian,  maybe  you’d be interested  to know  that I 
had a discussion  with an Iranian  Dharma  teacher  about  
the possibility  of offering  an intro online  class  in Farsi.  If 
that actually  happens,  maybe  you’d be interested.  We’ll 
do it through  IMC,  and it will be on the website.   
 
It is wonderful  to have  all this. I just love seeing  you and 
the questions.  I want  to thank  you very much.  I look 
forward  to more  opportunities  to be with you in this way. 
Thank  you very,  very much.
