 So, what I'm doing these Mondays for a while now is slowly going through the different exercises of mindfulness, different practices of mindfulness, that's given in the Satipatthana SÅ«ta, the discourse on the foundation of mindfulness, on establishing mindfulness, that the Buddha gave. And there's something like, I have to count again because now I'm a little bit confused about how to count because of, but anyway, there's something like 19 exercises given in the text. And it's a source for the kind of mindfulness practice we do here, this text, so it's a kind of a derived source because over the centuries the practice has evolved somewhat and developed and so rather than taking it directly from here, the practice we do at IMC, it's more kind of evolved from this core text. But really, people go over and over again and go back to this text. This particular discourse for inspiration, for guidance, how to practice, and it's kind of like the standard or the reference for how to do Vipassana practice. And some people are quite surprised to learn what some of the exercises are because if they've been in particular traditions of Vipassana like at IMC or with Guenka or different places, they tend to choose certain sections or certain aspects of the text and emphasize those. So in our tradition that IMC is part of, it tends to be more kind of mindfulness that is non-reactive and non-evaluative where you wouldn't kind of engage and try to manipulate your experience. You would just let your experience be as it is. And some people think that's what mindfulness is, just be aware of your experience, what your experience is and leave it alone. But some of this practice here is actually quite involved. And actually, not only, it does involve a little bit of change in your experience. Some of it involves more than just being aware of things as they are, but being aware of things in a particular way, a particular focus. In particular, the next one is sometimes the biggest surprise. What's this doing here? I was thinking of doing show and tell as a way or something as a way of illustrating this section. We have at home in our lawn this metal bucket full of bones and vertebrae and that's soaking because there's still kind of like meat and stuff on it or something like that. My wife's a botanist and she does field, psychologist, she does field workout on some of the open space districts on the peninsula. And she came back last Friday or some point, I don't know, recently with all these bones and the vertebrae, long vertebrae and still hanging together kind of. I thought of having it here in the bucket and some of you wouldn't have known what kind of vertebrae was spilling over from this bucket. But I didn't. Anyway, this particular exercise is called the Nine Charanal Ground Contemplations. This involves going to a charanal ground. Now in ancient India, apparently, they didn't bury people that commonly. They do have the custom of burning people. I don't know when they started doing that and there's still people that get burned in India to this day. You can go down to Varanasi and the burning docks there and watch the bodies being burned. Sometimes bodies are thrown into the rivers and you can also take the ferry boat or the rowboats out into the river at the Ganges in Varanasi. There's a little rowboat, you're out there in the rowboat and you kind of look over the edge and there's a body that's floating by. That's one way of disposing bodies is you just put them in the river and let them, kind of, the river take them. And then to Beth, there's the practice of feeding corpses to, I guess, the vultures. So they go up in these high mountain places and I've seen photographs of movies, I forget which it is now, of, I guess, people's job is to cut off the flesh. I thought, first I thought, when I heard about this, I thought you should just left the body up there naked, you know, and the birds would come down and take care of it. But apparently they cut off the flesh and so that's easy for the birds to get it and clean the bones quickly. And I think, in my understanding, part of the reason why they do this in Tibet is that it's difficult to bury people in the very high mountains of Tibet. The soil is not so deep and it's a lot of work to do that and so this is a way of kind of cleanly disposing of the corpse and the body and returning it to nature in a way. And so, at least in the ancient times in India, one of the customs was that these charnel grounds were sometimes they just bring the bodies out there and leave them there in the charnel ground on the surface of the ground. They wouldn't bury them. And so then the local animals would come and whatever would come and slowly do their thing or the body would just sit there for a while and get bloated and do all kinds of interesting things that corpses do. And there'd be this place you could do that. And in Thailand they have places where they burn corpses. They still burn them outdoors, apparently. And at least they did until very recently. Anyway, so you can go and see these places. You can go and hang out there at these places they burn the bodies and sometimes you leave the bodies there unattended as they're kind of smoldering and the last stages of their burning. So this is about charnel ground contemplation, about contemplation and mindfulness established through the idea of a charnel ground. So bear with me. I know it's gruesome. And some of you are wondering why did I come tonight? And some of you who might be brand new to Buddhism and to Buddhist meditation, what have I got myself involved in here? I just thought, you know, stress reduction. Listen to the people who love to do loving kindness meditation. So here it says, again, bhikkhus. Bhikkhus is the word for a monk. But the commentaries make it explicit that bhikkhu means anybody who's a serious practitioner. Again bhikkhus, as though one were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and oozing matter, a bhikkhu compares this same body with thus, like this. This body too is of the same nature. It will be like that. It is not exempt from that fate. In this way, he or she abides contemplating the body as a body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. And he or she abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body. Again, as though one were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, or various kinds of worms, a bhikkhu compares this same body with thus. This body too is of the same nature. It will be like that. It is not exempt from that fate. In this way, he or she abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body. Again, as though one were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinus, a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinus, a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together with sinus, or disconnected bones scattered in all directions, here a hand bone, here a foot bone, here a shin bone, here a thigh bone, here a hip bone, here a back bone, here a rib bone, here a breast bone, here an arm bone, here a shoulder bone, here a neck bone, here a jaw bone, here a tooth, here a skull. Abhikkhu compares this same body with thus. This body too is of the same nature. It will be like that. It is not exempt from that fate. Again, as though one were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, bones bleached white, the color of shells, bones heaped up, more than a year old, bones rotted and crumbled to dust. Abhikkhu compares this same body with thus. This body too is of the same nature. It will be like that. It is not exempt from that nature. In this way, one abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world, and that too is how Abhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body. I don't know how easy it is to go to a charnel ground anymore, but I do know that this is a practice that's inspired many people in Asia, in Southeast Asia, monks particularly, to do something comparable. Some monks will get photographs of dead bodies, sometimes bodies that have somehow been in states of decay or sometimes corpses that have people injured pretty dramatically from automobile accidents. They will have those pictures of those bodies on their bedroom, on their walls. Once I sent a book, I sent something, a present to an abbot in Thailand, an American, a Canadian. I ordained the Thai tradition, been there for 20, 25, 30 years, I don't know. Was an abbot of a monastery, a thriving monastery. He sent me a very nice thank you card, letter back. It was lovely to get this to be very warm and very friendly. Then as a gesture of generosity in return, he sent me a gift. The envelope was a photograph of a partially burned corpse. Some people... What? They have in Bangkok, they have a forensic museum. I don't know what it would be called, a medical museum. I was trying to go to the medical museum where they show all these body parts and stuff, but I ended up in the forensic museum where they show body parts, but then they have knives stuck in them and bullet holes and all these interesting stuff. I had heard that this was a practice of spending time with corpses and doing this thing with the charnel ground based on this thing. It's still something that people try to do in their own ways, this particular practice. I've thought of taking students from our group and maybe taking them to, if we can get access, maybe to Stanford Medical Center and visit the anatomy class there and spend some time with a corpse. It's not just a practice that's talked about in ancient texts, but it's still done to some degree in modern Buddhism. The ultimate function of this, it says, is to become independent, not clinging to anything in the world, which is another way of saying become free. Now I'll ask you. Yes? If you wish to do this practice, go to a nursing home. To the Alzheimer's. If you wish to get an intimate sense of what happens to bodies, you can't do it at the same time. I did it at your... Where is it? This body too is of the same nature. It will be like that. It is not exempt from that fate. Another question is for you. I realize that it's very foreign to many of you and maybe gruesome and wondering what places it has in a spiritual tradition and Buddhist practice. But I'd like to ask you, why do you think this is in Buddhist...why is it considered a Buddhist practice? And why it would be included in instructions on establishing mindfulness, establishing a way of helping one bring a mindful presence to this life that we live. What is it? What's the value of this? Yes, Mark? I think we have almost an innate blockage to see maybe beyond where we were. I remember as a teenager looking at people 30, 40 years old. I just couldn't imagine being like that. And now I'm quite desperate myself. But it's still like people 80, people in nursing homes, I still have trouble connecting that that's...I'm going to be there. It's getting easier. But it's still there. And I think that the whole truth about impermanence is something that really takes a lot of practice and a lot of focus to get to really know that that is true. Great. Thank you. Yes? I think it's coming face to face with a fear of death also. So coming face to face with a fear of death. Right? Yes? What's a little different, Spinn, on the center, because we never talked about it, being around people as they die. I feel like that's not a gift to be around people as they die. And it's not as gruesome. It's not like gruesome like what you're talking about here, but it does give to you very much in touch with people you know and love or whatever. Does he ever talk about that? Spinn? Does he ever talk about that? Spinn? People as they're... Dying. No, I don't think so. I mean there are stories of when... I don't know if the Buddha, but certainly stories of monks who were with people and counseling people as they were dying. There was one, most famous one I know of was, I think it was Shari Putra, was counseling some man who was dying and giving him kind of practice to do while he was dying. And afterwards he went to the Buddha and told him what he did, and the Buddha reprimanded him and said, oh you gave him the wrong practice to do. This man had the opportunity to get enlightened. If you'd give him in a practice that leads to enlightenment. And he said he gave him a practice that led to rebirth in the heavenly realms. Yes? As you talked, I had a sense of peace if you will. I could visualize very vividly what he was talking about. It became very clear to me that I was not in the body, that this soul was something else. That was quite what you should've been. Surprised with him. So there's kind of a peacefulness of reassurance that sets in when a person no longer identifies with the body. I think the body is who I am. Is that right? Right? Yes? When I hear this I always think it's to put things in perspective. And also the other thing I think of is times of the essence. So to put things in perspective and that time is of the essence. Because you never know when it's going to happen. Yes? I think it really goes to the heart of mindfulness. We spend so much of our time with our minds in the future, worrying about what's going to happen next, our minds in the past, about what's happened. This meditation, I was just reading this the other day, allows you to, no matter what you do in the future, this is what's going to happen to all of us. So focus on the present, focus on the impermanence, focus on the emptiness of everything. I suspect that a lot of people will find themselves very present if they walk through a charnel ground. There's also a book that's come out recently of a woman photographer, I can't remember the name, who's taken pictures of, there's a site where they follow the decay of bodies. And I've just ordered it, I haven't got it in yet, but I'll bring it to you. Great. Thank you. It's kind of an artwork, look at all of this. I was just going to say, there are a few people that are at the, what do you call it, I feel like they're going to be in the circle of life. And if there isn't a fear of death, I've seen it. I've had my mother and my father both die before me, and it's so peaceful. There's no mental fear. And I think what this does is just cement it, and it's the reason that I've gotten into this this late in my life, is that the most important thing in the world is right now. I mean, I know perfectly well, I've got good health and all, and that's very precious, and I feel very grateful. So that's my concentration, and whatever is done with the body, in a way it might be better to recycle the kind of population we're growing in this earth, that maybe they've got the right idea. So the most important, so this kind of contemplation reinforces, that right now is the most important time, and that as for our body, with population growth and all that, maybe it's better to recycle it. It would be, because even though we keep saying, well, and friends will say, well, get cremated, but that's good for the earth. Yes. And there's a movement, a green burial, which involves no formaldehyde and just putting the body in a simple cardboard casket or pine casket and letting it decompose someplace. So it goes back. It's kind of nice because, you know, someone has said, the body is made up of, it's just made up of recycled materials anyway. And then just to take off a little bit on what you said, that the present moment is the most important. From a certain analysis that Buddhism offers, the present moment, the now present, is the only thing that's real. And so if you want to be connected to what's real, you would be connected to what's present. But if you are present, there is no other response than compassion. You can't stay there without a certain degree of loving and accepting and sharing humanity. So compassion is loving, accepting, and a sense of our shared humanity in that situation. Thank you. Smita. Well, also in this culture, there is so much emphasis on youth and health and looks. And you could do conservation of death, looking at a very peaceful and beautiful part of what the Buddha said is really gruesome. And I think that really helps to detach yourself into this context even more. That is not a beautiful thing. And it's not a real use. In a sense, how far do you take your objections with your body that doesn't? Thank you. I have a practice that's not like that, but similar. I picked out where I want my ashes to be scattered, which is in the bay lines taking off in San Antonio Road all the way at the end. And I walk out there once a week, and I sit where I hope my ashes will be. I'm rethinking it because I might want to donate organs. It's kind of neat to do that. So she says her practice is similar. Her way of doing this is, until recently, she thought she would cremate her body and have the ashes spread out in the bay, beyond the bay lines there, where she goes for a walk once a week. So once a week, she gets a chance to go and look and see where her ashes are going to go. Some people will go and sit if they have a grave site. It's been the plot someplace that's been planned. They'll go visit that plot periodically, and they'll know this is where I'll rest. Similar. And I've heard of Catholic monks who would have the casket they're going to be buried in, in their room. Just a reminder, it's always there. I think the initial aversion that arises when you see death, or mayhem, or gruesomeness, but teaching is also really, hopefully, if we really pay attention to this, another aspect of interconnectedness that, as this gentleman said, will all be gone 150 years. Some of us. I might be in a magazine technology, but basing on the idea of interconnectedness, not just the idea of aversion and confronting of death and so forth, but the underlying teaching as well, is that this is what connects us all as human beings. Beautiful. This kind of practice is also a practice of interconnectedness, really interconnectedness with life and sheer. And with the bones. With the bones. Buddha Dasa, who was one of the greatest meditation masters in Thailand in the last century, he died in an old age, but his explicit instructions were to... He had a forest monastery that he spent most of the time outdoors, and he had an outdoor section where they did their chanting, rather than indoor hall for worship. His instruction when he died was that his body was just taken out into the woods there, and just propped up against a tree, and let nature take its course. And partly to, as a teaching, his final teaching, about nature and how nature works. It's all nature, it's all natural, it's all part of the natural world. And rather than being horrified by it to appreciate that natural aspect. But he didn't get his wish, because he was too famous. What? He didn't get his wish, because he was too famous. So all these important people got involved, and they had a really big state, cremation and everything, because... Well, we're talking about, you see, different people are doing positive inputs. I can't help thinking how much of this we already see on a daily basis. It seems every time I turn on my computer and log into AOL, there's a picture right there, and often it's a rather gruesome picture, some kind of violence in the world. And it's on the television on the phone. It seems like some nights if I turn on the television, every one of the regular channels has some kind of cop show or detective program or more thing, and they all seem to have this element of bodies all over the place, and people getting shot. And I understand that doing this practice is a way of focusing in a different way than my television, but I'm just curious, in listening to this, if there might be a way to use this to utilize what we have right there in front of us on a daily basis as a model of practice in a way, observing in a different way what we normally, I think, probably as compassionate people, don't want to watch that stuff, perhaps, but didn't watch it in a way of mindfulness, and perhaps you could say something more. What you said was great. The idea of using reality as it is as a contemplation of death. In our society, it's often been pointed out how in American society death is often hidden. We don't see it so much. It's kind of pretty, it's often hidden. Whereas in other cultures, it's quite a public thing, death for various reasons. The first corpse I saw was when I was 11, and was not in America, it was in Nepal, where there was a corpse being carried down to a river, someplace to get burned, because people were carrying the corpse in a stretcher, and the corpse was basically exposed. But you're saying there's lots of opportunities to contemplate death, because the media and things like that. I think it definitely can be used as a contemplation. I think it's important to use it for something besides numbing out or getting insensitive or getting more afraid or more outraged. We have the opportunity here in the street corners to do this kind of contemplation on Thursday and Friday mornings. Those of you who haven't been here, we have Planned Parenthood is across the street. It seems that they do abortions there. There's an anti-abortion protester who's there every Thursday, Friday morning. I think it's a professional job he has. He gets support for it from somewhere. He has these very dramatic, vivid photographs of aborted babies, big blown-up posters. One way to see that and take that is to think about that, and try to put aside a little bit for the moment, why it's there and what he's trying to do, and just look at it and recognize that this is in nature also, what death is like. Your comments also made me think that there's also kind of a tragic side to death, a difficult side. What we see in the media, for example, it's tragic that it sometimes gets glorified, what happens, people have counted how many people get killed on television every night, some astronomical numbers. If you watch two hours of television, you see 32 people get killed. That's kind of tragic, that kind of input. Then there's a tragedy of just the reality of the way people die sometimes and there's a lot of violence in the world. I hope that rather than becoming numb or afraid or angry, it becomes certainly something that generates compassion, because compassion is empowering. Compassion is something that becomes a source for acting and doing something to make a difference in the world. But certainly I think this kind of meditation practice is meant not to be something to take us away from the world or numb out, but rather to kind of wake up and be present in a very realistic way. Let's see. I'd like to make one more comment about the text that you might not have noticed as I read it. It says here, in each of these exercises, the nine charnel ground exercises, again, bhikkhus, as though, one were to see a corpse, and the expression as though. This in the tradition is sometimes interpreted to mean that it doesn't actually require going actually to the charnel ground and actually sitting with a corpse. It's a visualization practice. You visualize this, you sit and imagine this, you're using your powers of imagination. That, for some people, puts a little bit different spin or context of what actually the practice is. So yes. You mentioned the spin and the ground, I just remembered my daughter saying she spent a year there as a medical student. But more to spare the medical students the experience of really dealing with the fact that this is a dead person, they covered up all the faces and all the hands. Because the hands currently personalize this thing that's in front of you. So unless you were working on a hand, the hands would always be in front of you. It seems odd, at first thought, it seems odd to treat someone like that or not to really confront it. The other hand, I know that sometimes medical school is so intense overall. Maybe anything to reduce the intensity is helpful. When I was a freshman in college, I took a drawing class. Halfway through the quarter, this was at UC Davis, now UC Santa Barbara, the professor took us twice during one week to the anatomy lab and they rolled out George. And there was nothing, he was, you know, nothing was covering any part of him. And the idea was we were supposed to draw him. And the reason he gave to us for that exercise was that his students always drew a lot stronger after that. I went twice, so two days, three hours each time to draw. And the first time I went, I drew the foot. Because the foot was about as far away from dealing with this and confronting this as a coagette. I had to draw, you know. And so then the next time I went, I realized what I'd done, it was an avoidance. The next time I went, I drew the face. And it was kind of dramatic in many ways. And that's not only because of the corpse, but because the corpse rolled out and he said, the technician or whatever said, what parts we'd like to draw. And what do you mean, what part? You see, you know, the guy's naked. And then he started peeling away, you know, parts of the body like a banana. Because he'd already been cut in various ways. So you could want to, if you wanted to see muscles or the bone or, you know, you see different parts. And it was a very, very strong experience for me. Very powerful to spend this time with it. So the ultimate aim for this is in some way to use this as a way to find freedom, not clinging to anything in the world. And if it has the opposite effect, if it's depressing or discouraging, then probably this is not the right meditation practice or the right way to practice at a particular time. And I can well imagine for some people at times it could be that way. I think of freedom, this abiding, independent, not clinging to anything in the world, as being basically synonymous to having a heart that's ready for compassion also. I think in every culture there's a different relationship to death and what sitting with death means. And it's been pointed out by anthropologists that in the West, in America, when Buddhist teachers and people talk about this particular kind of practice of spending time with a corpse or contemplating a corpse, it's usually done with the rationale that it helps to put your life in perspective and helps you straighten out your priorities and really get a sense of what's most important. And the same anthropologists say that if you go back and read the ancient Buddhist texts and how it's done, not ancient, but how the practice is done in Asia, they usually don't give that as a rationale for this practice there. But they usually give it rather as the rationale as helping a person disidentify and free oneself from the attachments to one's own body as the primary one. Yes? Something else you might learn from that exercise is not hating other people, nothing endures with them simply because they want to be in that state as well. It's really an equalizer. For people who study. So he said that this exercise can also teach us not to hate other people, be envious of them, because they too will be in that state. So both they'll be dead, they'll be corpse at some point, but also most people will die, will go through the normal, or universal kind of aspects of life, sickness, old age and death, some form or other. And sometimes they realize that we all share that nature. Part of Buddhist spirituality, one of the strong emphasis of Buddhist spirituality, has been historically focused on that aspect of our experience which is universal, as opposed to that aspect which is individualistic. So a lot of the wisdom comes from recognizing what's universal rather than recognizing what's particular with me. We use the word insight, and in the psychological West people often think insight means psychological insight into what's particular about how I take, how I work. But in traditional Buddhism insight is not into what's particular to yourself, but rather those very deep insights where you understand that aspects of yourself which is also universal, what we share with everyone. And that gives birth to freedom and to compassion. Last thing. I have a problem contemplating my own death and my own disintegration, but when I think of this happening to the people I love, I cannot handle that. So I'm thinking maybe that's where I need practice. To truly be. Maybe. I hope you don't have the opportunity. In your imagination. Yes. Maybe. I don't know. Usually, in this kind of example, in the way that I know that monastics and people do it in Asia, unless it's in a monastery where it's a fellow monk or the abbot or something like that, it's usually people you don't have a close relationship with. So there's a kind of impersonal distance. And it's said in the ancient text that, I think it says, I might be making it up here, but getting confused about it, that if it gives rise to fear or regret or grief, then one shouldn't do that practice that way. So I can imagine when there's your loved one that maybe that's not the right place to do that kind of this kind of exercise. Maybe. So I hope this evening was useful, significant, or in some way for each of you. The contemplation of death is a very important practice in Buddhism. There's different ways of doing it. Some of them are a lot less gruesome than this. And it's considered to be one of the meditation practices which is universally useful for people. So anyway, it's an important meditation practice in its own right. I hope that it was useful for you tonight. If it hasn't been useful for you, then I would encourage you to leave every single part of this evening's discussion here in this room when you leave. Thank you all very much.
