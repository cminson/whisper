 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So a really warm welcome. Really warm welcome to everybody. What a pleasure it is to be here. Yeah, so we'll begin with a guided meditation. In general, I don't like to have too many words during these meditations, but just an encouragement to maybe incline the mind a certain way. So taking an alert posture, a posture that reflects your intention to meditate, to be present, as well as having some ease, as well as having some softness rather than too much stiffness. And then checking in with the body. What is it like to be in this body at this moment? Can we sit and know we're sitting? Maybe the body is a little bit tired, a little bit restless. However it might be, can we make room, can we allow the experience as best we can? And allowing our attention to rest on the sensations of breathing. Without pouncing on the breath, without ignoring the breath. But with some gentle noticing, gentle in the sense that we're not grabbing on, but we are connecting with the breath, the movements of the body associated with breathing. End of video. Connecting with, feeling the expansion, the contraction of breathing. Connecting with, feeling the expansion, the contraction of the contraction. Connecting with, feeling the expansion, the contraction of the contraction. We can characterize our experience that when we're not on the breath, this may be either being pulled towards something else that seems desirable, or being pushed away from something that's not desirable, this push and pull. It can be helpful to just acknowledge, oh yes, there's a pull towards something I want, or a push away from something I don't want. Sometimes just noticing that movement, push or pull, can help weaken the pushing or pulling, make it a little bit easier to come back to the breath.... We might notice that it's the habit to do a little more pushing or a little bit more pulling. Are we moving towards something we want or away from something we don't want when we're no longer being mindful of the sensations of breathing? It can be empowering to notice our habits of mind. We have to make a big story. It's just a habit of mind........................................
