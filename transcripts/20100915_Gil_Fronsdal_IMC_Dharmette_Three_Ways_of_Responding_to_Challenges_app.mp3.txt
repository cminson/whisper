Dharmette : Three Ways of Responding 
to Challenges

In thinking about how we practice with challenges in 
Buddhist practice, or in meditation practice, it might be 
useful to consider there are three different general ways  
to deal with things that are difficult. Each way is 
sometimes appropriate and sometimes  inappropriate . 
Part of wisdom, and part of the exploration, is to figure 
out which  way is appropriate at different times.  
 
One approach is to ignore the difficulty . People usually 
don’t associate mindfulness practice with ignoring 
what’s going on , but s ometimes it’s helpful to ignore  or 
avoid  it. Sometimes if we focus on something , it makes 
it stronger, whereas ignoring  or avoid ing it can just let it 
settle away so that  it no longer grabs us.  
 
For example, thinking. If you’re bother ed by your 
thinking , then focu sing on your thinking can just make 
you more bothered , and you just spin out on more 
thoughts. Sometimes it’s better with thinking just to 
ignore the fact that you’re thinking , and pour whatever 
attention you have into your breathing. J ust let your thinking do whatever it does in the background . It’ll 
settle down by itself, and i gnoring it might be the best 
thing to do.   
 
If you’re very stressed out at work , it could be that 
staying at work  way into the eve ning is not going to help 
you. Maybe you need to go home at five and  go 
exercise, go for a walk, have a nice meal, take a nap, 
have a nice night’s sleep. And then perhaps  you’ll come 
back  in a refreshed way, and you’ll be able to deal with 
the stress  with a fresh, open mind . And then y ou’ll see 
the situation in new ways that you couldn’t have seen it 
if you s tayed enmeshed in the situation:  “I’m just be 
mindful of it. I’m goi ng to stay and work through it.”  
Maybe you ’d  better take a break. Get a fresh 
perspective.  
 
There are  many time s in life where avoiding, ignoring, is 
very he lpful and strategic. And there are  certainly times 
when ignoring or avoiding is a big problem. Problems 
can fester. They can get worse. They can continue. 
They can keep coming back and biting us unless they’re 
really addressed. Ignoring is closely related to 
repressing. If we  repress something,  then it can come 
back and bite  in other ways. Part of wisdom is to know 
when  ignoring a problem i s appropriate and when it’s 
not appropriate.  
 
Another app roach is to let go. Often Buddhism is associated with letting go. Just let go of the problem. It’s 
different from ignoring  or avoiding . It’s more about how 
we hold the problem, how we hold our relationship to it, 
and how we hold ourselves in relationship t o it. There 
might be some attachment, clinging, or attitude we 
have. Then it’s good to let go. Just let go of that.  
 
For example, you might be feeling tense in your 
meditation practice . You investigate: “What is that 
tension about?”  It might be because yo u have a 
perfectionist streak in your meditation. You’re supposed 
to be the perfect meditator at IMC today. You  had better 
do it right  – otherwis e you’re not perfect. You realiz e 
that what you  need to do is not to avoid this tendency to 
be a perfectionist,  but to let go of it. Perhaps you can let 
go of it  once you see it . Maybe you can let go and 
lighten up on it. So letting go is sometimes a very direct 
and powerful thing to do in situations  where things are 
challenging. “ What do I have to let go of here?”  
 
In some situations it can be very useful to let go of the 
need to be right. Or let go of our attachment, or of 
having opinion s. Or let go of needing to be seen  by 
other people  in a certain way. Maybe it’s an 
uncomfortable situation. Maybe people are not behaving 
properly , but the hook that keeps  us struggling in the 
situation  is not the situation, but rather how we are seen 
by other people. But maybe we don’t need to be seen in 
any particular way. Let people  see us the way they see us. It’s okay. So you let go of the need to be seen in a 
certain way.  
 
There are  a lot of things to let go of , and it can be very 
helpful to do that. It’s not helpful to let go when the 
letting go is a denial of something that’s i ntegral to what 
it means to be a human being. People let go of 
inappropriate  things sometimes. What we need to let  go 
of is our clinging to things, not the things in the world. 
So you find sometimes, people let go of their money, of 
their possessions, of s ome of their relationships, or of 
their sexuality because they think, “ Oh having money, or 
being sexual, or having possessions – that s not 
spiritual. So let’s just let go of all this stuff.” And so, 
sometimes, if you deny and let go of something that’s 
integral to what it means to be human , it can come back 
and cause problems if you let go in the wrong way.  
 
Another problem with letting go is when  it’s only 
temporary, or if we only let go of the surface symptoms 
of the situation , and the deeper roots of t he challenge  
are not addressed. You might have to let go a lot. It 
keeps coming up over and over again. If it keeps 
making a problem over and over again in our life , just 
letting go is not going to be very helpful.  
 
The first approach is to ignore or avoi d. The second 
approach is to let go, to see , “What do I have to let go of 
here? ” The third approach is to go into and through  the situation. This is much more the mindfulness approach, 
which generally  is to really be present for what’s here, 
and to be present and mindful in a respectful way. Not 
trying to push it away, not trying to ignore it, not trying to 
hold onto it. But really see what’s really going on here. 
To investigate, be present, and to let the difficulty  show 
itself. What’s the situation  really  all about? Rather than 
avoiding or letting go of the challenge, you go through it 
to the other side , and see what happens.  
 
There’s a cliché that’s used somet imes in our circles  
that the quickest way to g o from A to B is to completely 
be A. It’s not a matter of focu sing on getting to B , but 
really entering into A in this situation. What’s going on 
now?  
 
If you’re angry, for example, you want to let go of the 
anger, or you want to find resolution of the anger . A 
powerful way of doing that may be to  just allow yourself 
to be completely angry in a safe way. The safe way is to 
do it in meditation. It’s one pl ace where  it’s safe, and 
you really feel it and are present for it – not pushing it 
away, not doing anything , but really being present , and 
then going into it, and seeing what’s there . Seeing what 
needs to be expressed, what needs to show itself, see 
what’ s going on in a deeper way that you can’t see if 
you’re avoiding, or denying, or repressing . Or even if 
you’re letting go, you can’t really see the deeper thing 
that’s going on.   
So you go through it, go into it and through it . I think this 
last approach is one of the hallmarks of mindfulness 
practice , because mindfulness is to respect everything, 
and in a sense to  trust everything. Not to trust that it’s 
trustable , but rather that  it’s trustable to be present for it. 
It’s trustable to s tudy it , and to learn the information 
that’s there. Learn the lessons that are there. Learn 
what needs to be learn ed from this situation. We don’t 
dismiss anything. We enter into, and are really present 
for it, come what may – and we see what happens.  
 
Sometimes that’s a really useful strategy , but 
sometimes it’s not useful . It’s not useful when  there may 
be unconscious or subconscious reactivity to the  
situation that gets triggered by being  presen t with it. For 
example, with fear – some  people, when they focus on 
their fear, there can be su bconscious or unconscious  
reactions , where they just get more afraid , and spiral out 
to a panic attack. It’s not useful to stay present for fear if 
you’re going to end up having a panic attack.  
 
Or with certain fantasie s or desires. “I’m going to really 
be present for my sexual fantasies”  [laughs] . That can 
be okay. It can be useful to go into them  and find out 
what’s on the other side. Some people have done 
benefitted from doing that, but others  find that by being 
prese nt for fantasies,  they just end up spending hours 
fantasizing  in ways that are not useful, and that are disconnected  from life itself. So being fully present for 
that may not be useful. Maybe there’s another approach 
that’s needed.  
 
There can be all kinds of delusions of grandeur . When I 
was a new meditator, when I was twenty, I remembe r I 
spent a fair amount of time  when I was listening to 
Dharma talks, not listening to them , but imagining how I 
was going to give a great Dharma talk  [laughs].  
 
Studen t: “That’s what we all do  here!” [laughs]  
Gil: It worked out for me – thirty -five years later!  
[laughs]  
 
You can be present for challenges  in the wrong way. I f 
you don’t know how to be present in a useful way, this 
can feed something that is not useful to feed. Part of the 
art of mindfulness is to learn how to be present , to go 
into so mething in a way that’s helpful  and not to feed it, 
not get engaged in it, not be lost in it, and not reinforce 
it. Sometimes it takes a wh ile to learn that balanced, 
non-reactive presence , which allows us to go through 
our challenges.  
  
Three app roaches: to ignore or avoid, to  let go, or to go 
into to, study, or investigate. All three are useful at 
certain points. All three should be avoided at certain 
points.  
 Part of your j ob, as a practi tioner, is to know these three 
options and to start getting wise about when it might be 
useful to use one of them. One of the ways you get wise 
is by trial and error, by experimenting. One of the ways 
you get wise is by making mistakes,  realizing, “Oh that 
didn’t work!”  
 
So try it. Explore it. Look at your situation through these 
three ways and see what you learn in the process.
