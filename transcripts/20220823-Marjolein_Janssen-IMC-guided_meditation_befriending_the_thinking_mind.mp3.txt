 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Let's start this meditation by intentionally relaxing the body a little bit. First of all, maybe just invite the body as a whole to relax. May the body relax. Sometimes help us breathing in and out a little deeper for two or three times. Letting all the tension flow out with the out breath. Now we can check in with the body if there are areas that carry tension, discomfort, or even pain. Just with this gentle and kind attention, we can attend to these areas. We can invite them to relax a little bit more for as far as possible. For example, may this shoulder relax a little bit more. May there be some ease. May the forehead relax. May the forehead relax a little bit more. May there be some ease to the body. May there be some ease to the body. Thank you. Now we can switch to paying attention to the breath. Paying attention to the breath for a little bit helps settle the mind because we don't pay attention to anything else, just the breath. You can feel the breath with your nostrils, with your belly or your chest, or the whole breath, whatever works best for you. You can also use a different anchor as we call this, like sounds, the touch points of the body in case the breath is difficult for you. Just relax into the simple knowing of the breath. Or another anchor that you've chosen. Simple receiving of the breath. Thank you. Thank you. If you feel like you're ready, you can open up to all sensations, all experiences, at the sixth sense doors, sixth sense being the mind. Whatever is most prominently present in each moment, maybe it's a sound, maybe it's a thought, a body sensation. Maybe it's a emotion. And it will change from moment to moment what is most predominant in your experience. Some things might last a little while and others might be fleeting. But it will change. Now it is our simple task to just follow where the attention goes, moment after moment. And sometimes we get lost in paths. Then we become aware again. And in that moment that you become aware again, you can see what's happening. Maybe an imprint of the thought still there. Like you know what you just thought the thinking process was like. Maybe a whole new experience is in the foreground, like a sound or a body sensation or a different thought. Maybe when you become aware again the thinking stops right away. Maybe it continues. What is it like to become aware after thinking happened? Can you feel the difference of the thinking mind not being aware versus awareness coming back? Thinking is not our enemy. It is just another thing happening just like any other sensation or experience that we can have. We don't have to get rid of thinking. We can just become aware of it. That's our only job. We don't have to try to think less or try to get rid of it. Just be aware. We'll continue in silence for a while. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are you aware? I have the mind taking you on a little journey thinking that maybe you can be glad or joyful that awareness is back now. Now that I asked the question, are you aware every time awareness comes back, I can rejoice in that. That's awareness is a very wholesome quality of mind. So maybe we can cultivate that attitude of joy or gladness when awareness comes back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are you aware? Are you aware? I am aware of the thoughts that This moment, this experience, simple knowing what is happening. And as we're coming towards the end of this meditation, you can take a moment to appreciate our efforts to meditate, taking the time, the energy to meditate together. Maybe you can feel a little bit of gratefulness towards ourselves, towards the others meditating here in the Zoom room. You can also reflect on the wholesomeness of meditation, the benefits we get from this practice. Even though we might not feel the benefits every time, but over time we start to see how the practice is benefiting us, the others around us. All this benefit, all this wholesomeness, we can share with all beings everywhere without losing it for ourselves. It just gets multiplied if we share. So may the benefits of this practice be shared with all beings everywhere. May they all benefit. May they all be a little bit more easeful, a little bit more wise, a little bit more free. Thank you.
