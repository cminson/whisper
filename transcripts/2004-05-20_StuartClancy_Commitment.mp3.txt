 So I'd like to talk about commitment to this practice, commitment, dedication to this practice. And a piece of that is that in picking, deciding what it is that I wanted to talk about tonight, it was probably my most difficult subject. In many ways, I've been with this practice a little bit before I found John Travis as a teacher for me. And in many ways, I came into this practice kicking and screaming. And I'm still kicking and screaming in the sense that Buddhism is a challenge. Sitting is a challenge. And the fortunate part of it is that it's a practice. And in many ways, a very long practice, as at least it's been for me. At any point, just if anybody has any questions or use words that you don't understand, please just feel free to ask. I know probably a lot of you come here for different reasons. And you'll probably find inspiration for coming here for a lot of different reasons. And certainly in terms of looking at developing dedication with the practice, commitment to the practice, you're going to be able to look to that little piece for inspiration in terms of finding what it is that continues to bring you back here again and again and again. My wife just got off a 10 day retreat and she was asked at the beginning of that retreat what it was that why was she there? And she had a hard time with that. But the answer that she finally came up with was that at the end of the 10 days, having experienced a 10 day retreat before, she was a nicer person. And I can I can vouch for that. She is definitely a nicer person at the end of those 10 days. As a matter of fact, I could like to ship her out maybe every 60 days for a 10 day retreat. I can say that because she's not here. And she also proved this message. So and for me, I started I started my Buddhist practice with a 10 day retreat. It was a call. I walked into it cold. And and so it was you know, it's it's if you've ever been on retreat and I'm sure a lot of you have. I'm sure you know that many of us look to retreats for for just that, you know, just that it's that place where you can get the opportunity to develop a different, different mindset, a different way of thinking than then day to day was frequently day to day. So in any event, I want to talk a little bit about how we apply ourselves on a day to day basis. And what I'm going to be talking about here a little bit is a quality of mind and. And just just developing a sense of what that quality is. Much of much of what I'm in sitting down talking and thinking about this, it's really it's really very basic Buddhism in a lot of ways. So I mean, this this could be a talk about almost anything. And and and Buddhist Buddhist thinking. But just just basically I'm trying to stay focused in on focusing, focusing your mind, focusing your practice, staying focused. And it's all about where we place our mind. So first I want to just talk about a few blockers, places that give us trouble, distractions. And then I want to talk a little bit about dualistic thinking. So I've labeled here three kind of distractions that are pretty typical about day to day life in general. And one of the things that we're faced faced with in terms of staying focused, in terms of continuing to look to the practice for insight is is just the enormity of the task. I I've thought often about thinking about, you know, being a monk. Boy, I mean, there's there's something that there's a real opportunity and a commitment. But I've never I've never had the opportunity to do that. And just just about picking up the idea of working on enlightenment and working on developing this quality of mind for ourselves, quality of compassion for ourselves. So in many sense, it's a it's an impossible task, but we do it anyway. So where is it that we can be empowered? I have a couple of verses here that I'd like to read out of a book called The Way of the Bodhisattva. And this is a really great book written by a nineteen ninth century monk called Shanti Deva. And Shanti Deva was was a simple forest monk who who was kind of chided into doing a talk, actually, because he had never done a talk and sat down and just the way of the bodhisattva came out of him. And this side of a chapter on village and village and sexually. Verse 13, to cover the earth with sheets of hide, where could such amounts of skin be found? It simply wrapped some leather around your feet and it's as if the whole earth had been covered. Likewise, we can never take and turn aside the outer course of things, but only seize and discipline the mind itself. And what is there remaining to be curved? So, again, we're coming back to back to our mind here and realizing the task is here. The goal is to end the poverty of mind. The goal is to is to end the poverty of beings as a bodhisattva would would work towards the end of the poverty of things. And it's a it's a it's a large task, but we do it anyway. And practice does give us a sense that things do change. Over time, you can see. Perhaps maybe developing a certain softness, perhaps developing a certain sense of compassion that wasn't there before. And that's the kind of kind of place that perhaps, you know, when you see that happen, it's an opportunity to realize that there's something here for us. Another place that is is a bit of a bit of a blocker is just our own tentative tentativeness with almost anything we pick up today. We're given lots of opportunities in this world. Verse 20, this is again from the way of the bodhisattva. For if I carefully protect my wounds because I feel the hurt of cuts and bruises, why should I not guard my wounded mind for fear of being crushed beneath the cliffs of hell? This is kind of unusual terminology for a lot of Buddhist texts. You don't hear him talking about hell very much. I think I think perhaps Shanti David may have had a sense of humor. But we're we're we're great sometimes at hedging our bets that, you know, we're great at being occasional opportunities. And and also, we we listen to our own committee, this this guy that goes back and forth and all over and around. And and he's he's somebody who who has a great deal of influence over us. But one of the things that it's important to recognize in terms of in terms of kind of what's going on is that it is a habitual mind that we bring here to ourselves. It's this mind that continues to to behave and look for things the way we always look for things. We're hunters or gatherers, perhaps at a very basic level. But it's a habitual mind that plays tricks on us. And and and maybe marching to the gates of hell doesn't sound like a great idea. But in some way, we have to remain open to our own wounds. And and part of that piece is is that because they are what they are. And and and Buddhist practice teaches us to look and sit still with what is it ask us to be in the present and and and be with what is. And it's not always a comfortable place. So another blocker here is just the onslaught of our culture and the onslaught of our lives. The information overload. We get a zillion mixed messages all day from our culture. And the barrage is endless. And we're all here sometimes into. Into realizing that, you know, we're very capable and very capable at dealing with with this barrage. We can turn it on, turn it off. We can pick. We can choose. But it's important to realize that it's there and it's in front of us. And it's it's a constant, constant, constant presence. It's the spell of the sensuous. And again, it gets reinforced by our committee. We may as well have Rush and Dr. Laurel, Al Franklin all running nonstop. Verse twenty seven again from chapter five and vigilance. Lack of diligence is like a thief. Who sinks behind when mindfulness abates. And all the merit we have gathered in, he steals. And down we go to lower realms somewhere near hell, probably, I guess. So how can we remain diligent, vigilant in in the face of this assault? We are easily distracted. Or maybe another way of saying saying this is that we are easily attracted by by what we're faced with, by what we're given, what comes to us. And again, it's important to to realize that there's opportunities to interrupt. Interrupt what's going on and realize that work. We can work with the mind that we can stop and slow down and and put the present moment in the middle of all of of this, of this onslaught for a present moment is an antidote. This is Pema Schrodron, who I who comes from Shambhala tradition and and who kind of turned me on to the way of the bodhisattva. When you don't have to grasp, there's an opportunity for a fresh state to arise. So now I want to say a few words about dependent origination here, one of my favorite subjects. Dependent origination is basically this how suffering escalates, how suffering comes to us. And so this is a this is a little primer on on suffering. And and basically it's it's it's it's what happens to us all very quickly. So this short little list here is a list that happens frequently very fast. Sometimes we don't see it. So a feeling arises, a comfortable one, uncomfortable one, neutral one. You have an emotional response. You perceive dualistically. It's a whole discussion in and of itself, certainly. But it's accepted as a given for the moment. You perceive dualistically. Then we try to interpret it. And that's when complications start to get set in. We develop beliefs, et cetera. And then we act out of this cycle of samsara. We act out of this cycle of suffering. So it's this it's this dualistic thinking that sets us apart, that that. It's real important to understand that it is present in our in our thinking, that it is present in the way we act. And one one opportunity here is to is to recognize that it exists and and put our awareness, put our put the present moment in at any point along this cycle. And as soon as you can do that, you get the opportunity to to slow down and you get the opportunity to see that you are in a cycle of suffering. So Pema says that finding yourself in a negative state is finding yourself in a dualistic state. Kind of one place to look, one place to realize there's an opportunity for interjecting interjecting perhaps the present moment. So I brought dependent origination up here just because I believe it's it's one of those places to to look to Buddhism, look to your practice, to understand that it's an important cycle. And and just having that knowledge is is for me an inspiration and it's for me a place that I can go to come back to realizing this is a practice that is useful to me. This is a practice that I can learn from. So one evening, a Zen master, Shutri, was reciting sutras when a thief entered his house with a sharp sword demanding your money or your life. Without any fear, Shutri said, don't disturb me. Help yourself with the money. It's in the drawer. And he resumed his recitations. The thief was startled by this unexpected reaction. But he proceeded with his business anyway. While he's helping himself with the money, the master stopped and called out. Don't take it all. Leave some for me to pay my taxes tomorrow. The thief left some money behind and prepared to leave. Just before he left, the master shouted at him. You took my money and you didn't even thank me. That's not polite. This time, this time, the thief was really shocked at such fearlessness. He thanked the master and ran away. A few days later, the thief was caught and confessed his theft at Shutri's house and many others. When the master was called as a witness, he said, no, this man did not steal anything from me. I gave him the money. And he even thanked me for it. So I kind of picked this story up in part because it's kind of a story that confronts you with a number of issues all of a sudden that you want to stand up and say, it's about this, it's about that. Not unlike what we're given and what our minds have to face, a number of different issues and how do you reconcile them all and where do you focus? For instance, there's the issue of the thief not taking what is not freely given to him. A monk who is not attached to his possessions, attachment being a great Buddhist notion. But for me, this story is also a little bit about how we perceive dualistically. It's taking that unexpected tact with the way that we think, the way that we act that is a noble step here. And it's this unexpected mind that that perhaps, you know, perhaps the monk was able to perceive the thief as his brother, as opposed to wherever else he could have gone. So recent bumper sticker I saw said, don't believe everything you think. So for those of us who like nice moral stories, the remainder of the story is the thief was so touched that he decided to repent. And upon release from prison, he became a disciple of the of the master and many, many years later, he attained enlightenment. So another little story I have for you is one that comes out of Folsom Prison. It's a difficult story to tell because, again, it's not unlike this story of the thief and the Zen priest, because it is complicated. One evening, this is a weekly sangha, a weekly community meeting. And many of these prisoners who come to this meeting are our lifers and they're very dedicated practitioners. They come because they want to be there. Many of them need to be there in order to to work with them with their lives. And a man, a member who was who has been coming for quite a few years and he got sent to prison as a young man. And at this point, he's been in prison for 20 years or better. And he started talking about the murder that he had committed 20 years ago and how how his process about being in prison was finding the gold in his murder. And when I first when I first heard this, I was taken aback because there wasn't there wasn't a lot of other things that I thought maybe should be present. Maybe humility about the murder or some sentiments about the life he had taken for the people that he had hurt. Maybe maybe there maybe there really is at the present time gold for and what had occurred. And and maybe this man is my brother. And maybe there is a connection that I have to him. Maybe that separation that I look for, that separation that I I really count on that dualistic thinking that I continue to go back to that sets me apart and separate from everybody else. It helps box my world so it can make sense to me. It's perhaps the kind of thinking that in some way isn't always useful to me. So two short stories about where we go from here and how we got here and what we do. So no birth and no death story. A Zen master urged his students to practice diligently in order to transcend the world of birth and death. A student asked him, sir, please tell me how to tell us how to transcend the world of birth and death. He said you have to look for the world of no birth and no death. The student asked, but where can we find the world of no birth and no death? The Zen master replied, you look for it right in front of the world of birth and death in the world of birth and death. So bugs in a bowl by a Chinese poet, Hanshan. We're just like bugs in a bowl all day going around, never leaving their bowl. I say that's right. Every day climbing the steep side, sliding back down over and over again, around and around, up and back down. Sit in the bottom of the whole bowl, head in your hands, cry, moan, feel sorry for yourself or look around, see your fellow bugs, walk around, say, hey, how are you doing? Say, nice bowl. So that's what I have to say about dedication. And again, as I said in the beginning, it really is about focus and quality of mind and developing an understanding of what that quality of mind is and how to maintain the focus. And if I have totally, totally run you rampant all over the world and you're totally unfocused at this point. I apologize, but I appreciate the opportunity to share this with you. So you have questions, anything you'd like to talk about? We probably have a few moments here. I wonder if you have anything more to say about the prisoners' meeting? Yeah. Every one of the guys in my group, they come to the practice with a real kind of fire in their belly about it. I think some of them perhaps may have gotten there in part out of perhaps maybe like with Tip, the crime he had committed was so totally overwhelming for him that he needed something. For some of them, prison is such a different place in the world. And I've heard some of them say that they have learned a lot and are very grateful for having had the opportunity to be stopped. And so, I mean, they're a disparate bunch. They all come there with a very different background, different reasons. But I think everybody who walks in the door there is dedicated in one way or another. Some of it is about I deal with a unique population in the sense that there's no reason for them to necessarily to come. There's a lot of programs in prison that look good on your parole record for the parole board. And so there's AA programs or those kind of things, educational programs that a lot of prisoners will engage in. But I must say that there's there's no reason for them to come other than their own volition here in our program, because they're not going to get any points for it. Yes. Pardon me. We live very busy lives and her life is is is busier than mine, for sure. And I and I bet bottom dollar, it's a lot about slowing down. It's really about, you know, just getting the opportunity to move slower. That for her is is very opening. Yeah. Thinking about myself, I feel like there's some kind of reactivity that's just always on this kind of you're so tempted to act out. It's like something like irritation or something. It's just so permeating the body. You get 10 days or something like that to just let go of some of it and just let it settle out a little bit. You're just that less trying to react to the person. Yeah. That lasts for a while. Yeah. Yeah. And for my wife, that's that's especially true in the sense that she's when something happens, she's on it. Like right away. I mean, I'm just I'm so totally impressed. And and by the way that she does get things done. And one of the ways that that happens for her is that she, you know, you know, whatever it is, it's up. You know, she goes after it, fixes it. So in that sense, I mean, have you ever done a retreat? I mean, there's a yeah. No, no. Yeah. I think that they're going to get made. Uh huh. Yeah. I guess I've also seen is. Yeah. And it's also transcendent time because it is a time to to slow down and and just develop space. I mean, just just, you know, it's a place to come to it to a realization that that. You know, this monkey mind that's always going doesn't always have to go. That there's a there's a different way to. Different way to look at it. And and for me, being in the day to day work a world that that is jam packed with a zillion different opportunities and things to do and and mortgages to meet and. It's difficult to find those spaces because I'm busy. And retreat is is for me one of those places that it does happen in a very, very large sense. Certainly a larger sense than it that even than it even happens here. I mean, you know, because. Coming to the mat. I think gets us a lot and. But it's it's almost the knowledge of what goes on in those retreats for me. That it's one of the reasons I keep coming back to the mat, you know. I wonder if you could say a little more about how the commitment thing has gone for you over the last few years. Built steady or dropped it and come back to it or. Hardly. Yeah, my practice is is, you know, I think I started this by all saying I kind of come to this kicking and screaming. And so I do not have a daily practice because I might my days are eclectic. So a lot of times I'm up and out, you know, or, you know, don't get home till, you know, nine, ten o'clock at night. And and so it's difficult to find the find the time for a daily practice. Over over the years, I would I would have to say an awful lot of. Of my practice in a lot of ways is is is is developing that that day to day sense of of how to how to work, how to develop spaces, how to work with your wounds. And and so I do think of it as I do think of like going to prison. As as one of one of the little pieces that I can put out there and put in front of myself as being some place that that I can work on those spaces, work on those wounds. And and and I and I think at some level they do work for me. And non traditional. You know, Buddhist sense is, you know, like coming to the mat and the places that that works. But this whole point about developing space is a real. While working. Working in the relationship world that way. Is is extremely useful in helping you develop the sense of sitting still. Or or from my case, the sense of not running away, even, you know. It is real important. And so that's the same kind of practice in that sense, you know, that that. That coming to the mat does give you. I've always had a kind of erratic relationship with daily practice. I've done a lot of retreats and I find it much easier. So it's over years. It's been sometimes easy and sometimes difficult to actually do that. But it's a commitment to your daily practice. Yeah. And yet it's it's one of those things that for for a lot of people works extremely well. Yeah. I like myself better when I do it. It's like the same result as the way it gets. Days when I sit or go better. Very slow. Yeah. Yeah, there's one place in prison, some of this. It really is. It really is a lot about, you know, we've talking that I've been talking a little bit tonight about distractions and. One one thing that's probably very true for at least the prison population is is just this whole business of of distractions and how there isn't the the the opportunity for reinforcement for being for practice. It's a noisy place. While we can come here and. And and reinforce our our our reason for being here and just trying to work out, you know, why it is that we're here. We have that opportunity. And in prison, you really don't have that opportunity. That weekly practice is the only thing those guys have that that that. Really gives them that community to work some of that stuff out. And and, you know, terms of in terms of. For the for those guys for work, you know, for or, you know, for the task and challenge that they have in terms of working with their stuff, you know, working with a sense of of of of the suffering. That they have to deal with. It's hard. It's it's really hard. So for a lot of them, as a matter of fact, I have a couple of daily meditators in my group and. They get up first thing in the morning and it's one of the quietest times. You know, that's it's a really great time to sit. I mean, you know, if I can sit in the morning, if I can if I can get myself on the mat in the morning, it's a great time to pull it off because providing no full back sleep. Because because the mind is is so very quiet in the morning, it hasn't had the opportunity to start rolling into the day. And it's one of those times that I think is a good time. A lot of other people I know that do do it in the evening just before they go to bed as well. The other really great advice, I think, is works extremely well for some people is is just is is just five minutes. I mean, say it for five minutes. I mean, you know, it's it's it's just that little bit of, you know, kind of opportunity to remember that this is this is worth doing. Or any other space you can create during the day. Even if it isn't on the mat, even if it's just a breath, a deep breath that you can take in the middle of the day when. Maybe it's something that would trigger it, trigger it like Pema's suggestion about realizing that maybe you're in a negative state. That you know that that you're in a dualistic state and maybe that's a place for you know, for a breath to occur a long, slow, deep breath.
