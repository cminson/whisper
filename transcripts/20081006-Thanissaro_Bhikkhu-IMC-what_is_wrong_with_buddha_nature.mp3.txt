The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
I read a cartoon several years ago about this magic medicine where two people take a pill,
and once you had shared the pill, one person would get, say, under,
and the other person would say, stand.
And you would know what was going on in each other's minds.
And tonight I wish I had pills for everyone.
I would just say under, and you say stand, because there's a lot to cover.
The topic is Buddha nature, and the topic is further, what's wrong with Buddha nature?
We in America tend to be very eclectic in our religious, our approach to religion.
Jewish people like to practice Vipassana, Christian people like to practice yoga.
When we become Buddhists, we not only like to bring along some of our old beliefs,
but we also like to add a few extra ones on top.
For instance, Rumi has now been made a Buddhist poet laureate.
Kind of like the Mormons baptizing your ancestors after the fact.
And not only do we take things out of non-Buddhist religions,
but we like to mix our Buddhisms, take some pieces that we like from Mahayana,
Vajrayana, Theravada, whatever, put them all together.
There's a good side to this. Is there something wrong with the speaker?
The good side is that we pick up more skills.
We expand our range of knowledge, we expand our range of approaches to the problems in our life.
And a lot of times the different traditions can benefit from cross-fertilization.
The problem is that sometimes new elements come in that we bring in,
and we don't realize that they kill off some of the good things we already have.
You might think of this as a garden.
We have lots of different flowers in our gardens,
and many times we like to add more different kinds of flowers,
because they're pretty, add more trees, because they give us shade.
But sometimes you will bring in a new plant that will kill off some of the good plants you already have.
It's like deciding that you want some more shade in your garden,
and you bring in some pine trees and some eucalyptus trees.
And you get fast shade, but you find out after a while that they're killing off your flowers.
And in the same way, in the Theravada tradition, more recently in America,
the idea of Buddha nature has kind of snuck into the tradition.
And it does provide some shade.
It gives a sense of self-esteem, a sense of confidence when you're practicing.
It provides some emotional warmth for what can often be a dry technique.
Many of the vipassana techniques can be very dry, the noting technique, or whatever.
And the idea of Buddha nature gives a certain sort of sense of warmth,
something that you can connect to emotionally.
And so we may hear that the Buddha himself never mentioned Buddha nature.
You would think that if anybody was qualified to talk about Buddha nature,
it would have been the man himself, but the Buddha never mentioned it.
But for most of us, that doesn't really matter.
We find that the idea of Buddha nature is actually very helpful.
It's a good tree to add to our flower garden.
But tonight I'd like to talk about the fact that, one,
there are other teachings in the early teachings that actually do provide shade.
And at the same time, they don't kill off the flowers.
And that Buddha nature actually does kill off some of the flowers in the practice.
So first I'd like to address some of the issues of how, say,
a self-esteem, sense of confidence, and sense of emotional warmth
are provided by the early teachings.
Living here in California, we all know the history of self-esteem.
Kids are taught in schools, got to have self-esteem in order to learn,
but many times self-esteem comes before any kind of skill, which is backwards.
You learn self-esteem by mastering skills first.
And traditionally, this is how self-esteem was generated in the teaching.
You start out by learning how to be generous.
From generosity, you develop virtue.
When you think about the times when you've been generous in the past,
when you think about the times when you were virtuous,
in other words, you could have harmed somebody,
you could have gotten away with it, but you decided it was beneath you,
or you decided out of the goodness of your heart that you didn't want to harm them.
You gain a sense of self-esteem from that.
Another way the Buddha taught self-esteem to his son was saying,
if you make a mistake, don't be afraid to talk it over with other people
and then learn to resolve not to repeat that mistake.
And many times this is the word genuine self-esteem that's developed.
It's by learning how to admit, yes, I did make a mistake,
I'm not ashamed to state that I made the mistake,
and I'm happy to learn from anybody who wants to teach me.
What this develops is a sense of yourself that's a very healthy sense of self.
I'm the kind of person who can learn from his or her mistakes.
You may have heard the story, I think I've mentioned it in some of the contexts here,
about a graduate school where they teach brain surgery,
and they had the problem of deciding who to admit and who not to admit into the school,
because people who apply to brain surgery school tend to have good grades.
But not everybody with good grades is going to make a good brain surgeon.
And so the question was, when you interview the candidates, what questions do you ask?
And one of the prime questions they found that was really helpful
in basically separating the sheep from the goats,
was that you would ask the person, can you tell me about a mistake you made recently?
What?
And if the candidate said, no, I can't think of any mistakes I made recently,
you don't want that person operating on your brain.
Second question, though, if they said, okay, I did make a mistake,
then the next follow-up question was, how would you do it differently?
That's the kind of person you want to have operating on your brain,
someone who can recognize a mistake and then figure out how to correct the mistake afterwards.
And it's the same way that you build self-esteem.
Now you can see one of the reasons why Buddha nature was brought in as
a eucalyptus tree to provide some shade for meditators,
because this way of developing self-esteem, by being generous in your life,
by being virtuous in your life, by learning how to be the sort of person
who admits mistakes and can correct them,
that's not something you can assume when somebody walks into a retreat,
that everybody has this level of self-esteem or has this kind of foundation.
Sometimes you can talk about, you can say, okay, think back on your generosity,
on your virtue, and the person might think, oh, my gosh, I've never been generous,
I haven't been virtuous, and they go into a spiral.
So sometimes for the sake of a retreat, you might tell somebody,
well, think about your Buddha nature, your innate goodness, that kind of thing.
That might get them through the retreat, but it doesn't get them through the practice.
We're taking on the practice as a long-term project,
where you want to have something a little bit more solid.
This is where teachings and generosity and virtue come in.
Secondly, in terms of emotional warmth for the practice,
again, retreat centers were not the original context for practicing Buddhism.
It was communities of people practiced together,
where you had a sense of basically extended family practicing together.
So you'd have a community of support.
Secondly, good strong states of concentration were taken as a given,
that this is something you want to develop in the practice
because it gives a sense of emotional well-being.
You just sit there and breathe, and you feel good inside.
So that when difficult issues come up, you've got a place that you can go back to.
And so this is some of the way the Buddha taught a long-term approach
to providing shade for your garden, in the word that's like growing oak trees.
It may take a little time, but the kind of shade they give doesn't kill the flowers.
To provide you with confidence, the traditional teaching is that all you need
is a human body and a human mind.
You don't necessarily need Buddha nature.
The fact that your human being is enough.
In Thailand, in the history of the forest tradition,
this was a theme that a John Mundt would repeat many, many times.
Because you have to remember, many of his students were children of peasant families.
If you live in a peasant family in Thailand, you've been taught from a very early age
that you don't have the connections you need, you're not going to get ahead in society.
And the society really puts its thumb down on people from poor families.
And here was a meditation movement that came from the poor people.
And a lot of it had to do with that teaching was, okay, you've got what you need.
All you need is a human body, a human mind.
You've got all the resources you need in order to become awakened.
There's a passage in the canon where the Buddha, excuse me, in this case,
it's an under-comments that concede.
And by here, he means simply having a good, solid sense of who you are,
not necessarily, you know, overweaning pride,
but the concede of having the confidence that I can do this is an important element of the path.
And it's simply based on other people can do it.
They're human beings, I'm human being, why can't I do it?
That's really all you need in terms of confidence on the path.
Now, this kind of confidence is grounded in reality, however,
because there are dangers in the human mind.
You've got to watch out for it.
The Buddha once said that the mind is more variegated than the animal kingdom.
You stop and think about it.
How many kinds of animals are there in the world?
I mean, they're uncountable.
You've got all the animals that fly, all the animals in the ocean,
all the animals on the ground, in the ground.
And yet, the human mind is capable of greater variety than that.
We can do all kinds of good, but we can also do all kinds of evil.
We have that potential.
On top of that, the mind is very changeable.
One time, the Buddha, who was an expert in finding app similes,
he once said, there really is no app simile for how fast the mind can change.
We might say it can change in the twinkling of an eye.
That's too slow.
We change faster than that.
And so you've got this changeable mind that's capable of all kinds of stuff.
Now, part of it, the good part, is that it can be trained.
You may have heard the passages in the canon where the Buddha talks about how the mind is luminous.
And when the Buddha is talking about the luminous mind,
he's not talking about Buddha nature.
He's talking about the fact that it's basically that you're simply aware.
We have this state of awareness.
We can know things.
We can be alert to things.
And it's because of this alertness, he said, that you can be trained.
Though we're not training for the luminous mind, it turns out further along the path,
the luminous mind is the most elemental form of ignorance.
When you finally get to the most luminous state that you can imagine in the mind,
you eventually have to let that go.
Keep that in mind because we'll be dealing with that further on in the talk.
Secondly, sometimes you see in the forest tradition,
they talk about the Buddha you have inside you.
And again, they're not talking about innate goodness.
They're talking about the fact that you have this awareness in you,
which you need to sort of dig out and look at.
Again, so that it can be developed.
Sometimes you may see in the writings of Ajahn Chah
in his reference to your innate Buddha, your innate ground of being.
Don't trust every translation you read.
You have to watch out.
I ran across this phrase one time in one of Ajahn Chah's talks,
the ground of being, and I don't want to mention the translator.
And I said, you know, I think I know Thai pretty well.
And I don't think there is such a word in Thai.
And I asked a number of my Thai friends and they said, what?
Ground of being? What the hell would that mean?
So watch out when you read translations.
So when the Buddha is talking about the luminous mind,
he's simply talking about the fact that it can be trained.
And also that it has to be trained. As I said, it is very changeable.
And the mind has a big problem with delusion.
We have all these potentials in the mind.
And one of the big potentials is to misunderstand our potentials.
Something we think is good could possibly be very, you know, be very, very harmful.
And the only way you can see through your delusion is think about
how are you going to see your own delusion?
Because by definition you're deluded.
You greed, you can see aversion, anger, you can see.
Delusion is really hard.
And the Buddha said there's only one way around that.
And that's to look very carefully at what you do.
Look at what your intentions are.
Look at what you're doing based on that intention and then see the results.
So you have to get very specific.
We're not dealing with delusion and the abstract.
We're dealing with it each time it comes up.
So you have to, and there's instructions to a son, Rahul,
he says, before you do something, look at your intention.
If you expect harm, don't do it.
While you're doing it, if you see any unexpected harm coming up, stop.
Once you've done it, if you see any long-term harm that came up,
resolve not to repeat that and then go talk it over with somebody.
So you're dealing with specific.
It's not the only way you can get around your delusion.
This is a theme that keeps coming up again and again and again in the Buddha's teachings
that when you meditate, you're looking at your intentions.
You're looking at what you do.
You're looking at actions.
You're not looking at your innate nature.
You're not looking at your innate self.
In fact, your sense of self is a kind of action.
And you want to see when it's skillful.
Sometimes it is.
And you also want to see when it's not.
So he said that our skillfulness in the practice does not come from Buddha nature
or trusting in Buddha nature.
It comes from heedfulness.
Now, heedfulness, you have to remember, is based on the idea that your actions are important
and it's very easy to make mistakes.
So you want to be very careful.
But you also have the potential to do a lot of good with your actions.
If you didn't have that potential, you wouldn't make any difference
whether you're heedful or not.
But it really does make a difference to be heedful, to be careful.
The second quality the Buddha said is appropriate for awakening
or most important for awakening is appropriate attention.
Learning how to look at things in the right way.
Ask in the right questions.
In this case, the questions are not, who am I?
What is my true nature?
But the questions are, what am I doing?
What are the results of what I'm doing?
Are they skillful or are they not?
Based on those questions, you come up with the formidable truths.
There's skillful causes and unskillful causes, good results and bad results.
That gives you the formidable truths.
Each of the formidable truths has a different task.
And that's why it's important to understand this as a basic framework.
When you're meditating, you're not going to do just one thing.
You're not just letting go.
You're not just noting or whatever.
There are four things you can do.
One is to comprehend suffering.
The second is to abandon the cause.
Third is to realize the cessation of suffering.
And the fourth is to develop the path.
So there are potentially four different things you could do
given any situation in your meditation.
And in order to figure out which is the appropriate one,
you've got to be able to sort of divide up your experience
into those four categories.
So what all this comes down to is it is important in the practice
that you keep focusing on what you're doing
with a sense of heedfulness and applying appropriate attention.
So you know what to do.
States of concentration come up.
You don't just watch them pass away.
You try to develop them.
When anger comes up, you don't just watch it for a while,
learn how to accept your anger, invite it in for a cup of tea.
You learn how to say,
how can I get rid of this anger effectively?
So there's the different tasks you've got to do.
Now the problem with Buddha nature as a concept in the practice
is that it distracts you from these activities.
It distracts you from heedfulness
and distracts you from appropriate attention.
The concept of Buddha nature comes basically in three types.
I'm going to speak briefly about each of the three.
The first one is the idea that you already are enlightened.
Inside you is this already enlightened nature
and the practice is simply a matter of letting it come out.
The second idea is that you have the potential for enlightenment,
which has to be cultivated.
And the third is that Buddha nature is the source of all being.
We all have this Buddha nature in common
and that we're trying to do in the meditation
is trying to get back to that source.
Now each of these, they sound nice, but they have problems.
First one, the idea that you're already enlightened.
When you pursue this idea a little bit further,
you run into the idea that any effort in the meditation
will obscure any vision of your innate nature.
Question, okay, for already enlightened and yet we're suffering,
that must be because we don't see our true Buddha nature.
The reason we don't see it is because we're efforting in the practice
so you don't want to do any effort.
So that right there immediately cuts through the four tasks
of the Four Noble Truths.
The path in this view of the practice
is simply one of just letting go.
That leaves out all three of the other tasks.
Secondly, what this teaching says
is the most important thing about it is something we all have in common,
which means we don't really have anything to learn from anyone else
when you pursue this further.
I've talked to some people who've practiced with this idea
and they've come up to that conclusion and said,
I don't really need a teacher.
My Buddha nature is already awakened.
What do I need a teacher for?
So everything that we have, what's important about it
is something that I have in common.
Our differences don't matter and there's nothing to be learned
from anybody else.
A dangerous position to put yourself in.
It breeds complacency and finally it cheapens the whole idea of Buddha.
I mean, if we all have Buddha nature,
what use is it?
You're still suffering.
Or a story.
I had time to tell a story.
I knew this guy who was first getting interested in Buddhism
in New York.
He was out one day jogging with a friend
and his friend was a long-term Buddhist
in a particular school
and they were jogging behind this one woman
who wouldn't let them pass.
They tried to move to the left and she'd move her left.
They tried to pass on the right, she'd move to the right
and so finally they got to a wider point in the path
so they could get around her.
And this guy did something, I'd never heard of this term before
until I heard this story.
He slimed her, do you know what sliming is?
It's when you're jogging and you're all sweaty and nasty
and you go up and you rub up against somebody.
You know what I mean?
And so after he had slimed the woman and got past her
and jogged on little ways
and he turned to his Buddhist friend and he said,
I guess that really wasn't very nice of him, was it?
And his friend said, oh no, that was the expression
of your Buddha nature, you have to accept your Buddha nature
before it is.
And so this guy came back to the person who told me the story
and said, this is what Buddhism is about,
I don't want anything to do with it.
But even if you're not a growing slimy people
it still cheapens the idea of Buddha
that we could still have enlightened nature
that's already enlightened and yet we're still suffering.
There's something wrong with that idea.
So we get past that idea,
something that seems a little bit more reasonable
is the idea that Buddha nature has a potential
that we have within us.
It's something that naturally unfolds
as we do the practice.
This particular version of Buddha nature
is more useful in that it does recognize
the need for effort,
but then the question comes effort directed
at what and exactly what is the effort doing?
If it's just simply providing the
circumstances for which this innate nature
can unfold,
it creates some problems
in exactly what you're going to be looking for
in the practice.
And also the question of exactly
what are you directing effort at?
You're trying to direct your effort at
seeing this Buddha nature,
making it more and more clear.
But this leads to a very different approach
to the practice.
It's not so much one of heedfulness
and appropriate attention.
It's just kind of digging out the Buddha nature
that's already there.
Or potentially there.
There was a koan I saw one time.
Anyhow, you read the koan
and many times you say,
what?
This is one koan I read it.
When I first read it, I said, oh, here's a koan I understand.
The koan is this.
The teacher sees this
fire in his endo.
And it's burned out.
All you see is ashes.
And so we ask the student, is that fire totally burned out or not?
And so the student goes in
digging in the ashes with his tongs.
He doesn't find any embers.
And he says, it looks like it's totally out.
And then the teacher goes in
and he digs around with his embers.
He dings around with the tongs and he comes up.
One last ember is still burning.
So I read that.
I said, oh, I understand.
The student thought they had gotten rid of all of this defilements
but the teacher said, no, there's still some defilements left.
See, here's one for you.
I was told, however,
that the explanation was that the student
was Buddha nature and the teacher showed him
that there really was Buddha nature in there.
You're looking for something very different
in the practice if that's your approach.
Secondly,
in the question of what you're doing,
you miss the whole idea
that a potential that you might have
is tested by
seeing what kind of actions it results in
and what kind of results come from the actions.
Because remember, you've got to deal with this delusion
that we've all got
that we can be confused about
which of our impulses is skillful
and which ones are not.
Again, the Buddha repeatedly would say
just keep looking at your actions
and his teachings are independent, chororizing.
There was once a monk who asked him,
are you talking about rebirth? Well, what is it that gets rebirth?
It gets reborn.
And the Buddha says, that's not an appropriate question.
He says, look at the process.
When there's clinging, there's going to be birth.
You're not asking who's born
or the birth of what,
but you're going to look directly at the process.
What are you doing that's causing the clinging
that leads to that particular action?
If, however, you look at, this approach
is obscured when you take the idea
that we're here in the practice
who's looking for the natural unfolding
of our Buddha nature.
Sometimes you see this expressed in the idea
that there are moments of grace in the practice.
And if you think, you know,
that suddenly there's this clearing in your mind
and for some reason you don't understand
the meditation is going well.
And if you simply accept that as a moment of grace,
you're not going to go back and look at,
well, what was I doing two, three seconds before
this happened?
And secondly, if you go around with the idea
somebody up there likes me,
how many of you in here have you read the book
Sirens of Titan?
Oh, very small group.
That's really sad.
That's one of the great dharma classics
of American literature.
It's a book all about the idea
of the idea that, you know,
my life is going well because somebody
up there likes me.
It's one of the worst ideas you can have.
You've got to look at, okay, exactly
what did you do
before that moment of, quote,
grace came, because that's what you're here
in the practice for, is to look at your actions
to see what's happening.
Secondly, the idea that you simply
trust in the process and it seems magically
to work, that discourages
you from questioning what you're doing.
Because the practice
is a combination of trust
and questioning. You've got to combine the two
in an intelligent way.
A good example is the way a scientist
would approach a particular problem.
You have to trust that the problem is worth
looking into.
You have to trust that you've got a hypothesis
that might work.
That's the element of trust in the practice.
Then you've got a question, okay, does the hypothesis
really work? Have I really figured this out?
And then you're willing to put it to all
kinds of tests and be willing to say
wouldn't you hear that maybe the hypothesis
will work?
At least you're pursuing a question that you
have to know is important.
You practice for it. You try to develop
discernment. But in the course of doing that
you're not just following orders.
You want to figure out what's good about
concentration. Why should I bother with this
anyhow? What is this doing to my mind?
What am I learning about the mind as I do
this particular practice?
A really good example of this is
in a John Lee's autobiography
when he mentions that when he first heard about
the idea of monks going out in the forest
he said that's crazy.
Forest is dangerous. It has animals.
They bite you. They sting you.
What was that?
In Calvin and Hobbes' comment
if nature doesn't sting you it has
all the squeaky stuff.
And that was the John Lee's original reaction.
He'd lived as a peasant. He knew what
was like to go out in the woods. He said
I'm not going in the woods. But he said the Buddha
over and over again would say it's really good
to practice out in the woods. So he gave the Buddha
the benefit of the doubt. But he still
kept questioning. I want to see what are the results
here. And then he talks about eventually
over the years he began to learn. You see
a lot about yourself. You wouldn't see otherwise.
Forest animals out there teach you
heedfulness. They teach you lots
of good lessons about the mind.
And you're also forced
to really take refuge
in the practice.
There's a great passage in the
Terra Gita in the Pali Khan
where this one monk says I'm out in the forest.
There's nobody around. I'm sick.
What am I going to do?
Do you want to go back and find a doctor?
Stay here. I'm going to develop
the five strengths. I'm going to develop
the seven factors awakening. Eightfold path.
That's going to be my medicine.
You've had that kind of learning how to
depend on the practice in that way. You find
areas of the practice or you find
potentials in the practice. You wouldn't have seen
the one. What you're doing here is
you're taking the Buddha at us where you
trust okay there must be something important
here. But you're also questioning. What is it?
You're using your own practice
as a laboratory. That's how you're going to learn
from the practice. Because it's only
when
you develop the skill,
only when you look carefully at what you're
doing that you can actually develop the skill
in the practice. Once you're skilled, you
want to look at it again to see what you've learned.
So eventually, once the practice
has done its function, then you can let it go.
It states a concentration.
It states the wisdom you gain. That has to be
abandoned at a certain point in the practice.
But you don't abandon it. It's like the raft
going across the river.
As long as you're going across the river, you don't want to let go.
You get swept down.
But once you've crossed the river, then you really do
have to let it go. You can't carry it around.
You can't carry something or you can't
let go of something until you really understand it.
So again,
the practice is not one totally of trust.
You trust up to a certain extent that this
is important. It says good potential for
training the mind. But you also
have to be willing to question it.
And trusting in
Buddha nature that's going to develop naturally
simply by doing the practice that obscures
this particular approach where you
gain more and more insight.
Finally, there's the idea that
Buddha nature is something that you
attain at the end of the practice when you
finally come into contact with the source
of all things.
This is a state of...
This is a particular
It's an assumption that can often come when
you get into the form of attainments.
You get to a state of infinite consciousness
in which you see things arising and passing
away and they don't touch that consciousness
at all. You say, my God, this is it.
I've arrived.
Defilements arise and pass away, but they
don't touch the state of consciousness in my
mind at all. Or you may be in a state of
nothingness or a state of neither perception
or non-perception.
You have to remember that the Buddha
said when we're here not to attain
these states, we're here to go something further
to nirvana, which is not the source of
anything. It's not where everything comes
from because you can't really trace things
and say ignorance is the big problem
in life. He says you cannot
find where is the first source of ignorance,
but you can see what you continue to
do right now that's keeping the ignorance
going. It gives a long list of things.
You've got these hindrances in your mind, you've got
inappropriate attention, you've got unskillful
actions. So again, what
he keeps pointing you back to is what are you
doing right now? That's keeping
the ignorance going.
If you learn how to stop that,
then you can get
beyond the problem of ignorance.
Once you've gotten beyond the problem of ignorance
then you really care where things came from.
Solve the problem.
So again and again and again and again
the Buddha keeps pointing you've got to look at your actions
very carefully.
The purpose of the practice is to set
the mind up in a state of stillness.
A state of confidence and self-esteem
that comes from where you enjoy life.
You should really look at what's going on in
your life without even denying
what you've done to yourself.
And you begin to see what am I doing
that's skillful, what am I doing that's unskillful.
As you get more and more sensitive
you drop the layers of unskillfulness.
And what you find
until you finally let go of
every area of
activity, then you see what's left.
Wherever you've
attained a state of luminosity in your mind, a state
of great compassion
and you just stop there thinking that this is
my innate nature. You blind yourself
to the fact that you're doing something to keep this
going. There still may be ignorance in there.
So these are the ways
in which the teaching in Buddha nature distract
you from the real purpose
of the practice is to look very carefully
at what you're doing right in here, right now.
So the point of this talk
is basically that, as I said earlier,
that there are teachings in the earlier teachings
which are very useful in providing
the self-esteem we need, the sense of confidence
that we need in the practice. We don't
need to depend on the idea of Buddha nature.
And we're really better off
without it.
Because as reminded
as the Buddha said, the mind is very
variable. It can do all kinds
of things and it can change
faster than the flash of an eye.
And so you have to be heedful and you have to use appropriate
attention to figure out what am I doing right
now that could be more skillful.
And it's
focusing on that issue of the particulars
of your action right here and now. That's what
leads you to something that glides beyond.
So I would propose
we sort of put Buddha nature aside
and focus on,
in this particular case, some of the earlier teachings
which I think provide the shade
that's provided by oak trees and other nice
trees that don't kill your flowers.
So those are some of my thoughts on the topic.
I'd like to know what your thoughts are.
Yes.
Buddha mind is the same idea.
Excuse me, would you please
get the microphone so you can ask the question
so we can get it on the recording?
I repeated that question already.
Any other questions?
The
thoughts or
images or etc that
arise in the mind,
you're equating those up
as almost the same as
one's actions. Exactly.
Thoughts are actions.
And so the
observing of the rising
of those and
sessing out
the source
or the...
First, when you look at your thoughts,
the Buddha's first question is
is it a skillful thought or is it an unskillful thought?
And the only way you're going to see that is
where does this lead?
And if you don't see a particular thought
in a particular direction, you say,
suppose I thought about this for 24 hours.
Where would it lead me?
And you see pretty quickly
that thoughts that have to do with sensuality,
thoughts that have to do with ill will,
thoughts that have to do with harmfulness
lead in a bad direction.
The notion that these thoughts are not
acted on and they're fleeting
but they reoccur
is there any notion of the duration
of those thoughts or the
I guess how much you either
ponder, wallow or
entertain?
The idea of entertaining is important.
How much do you want to entertain a particular thought?
And there are certain thoughts that we are really
protective of. We really like
our particular sensual desires
and our opinions and things.
You have to ask yourself, is this really my friend
or is this going to be one of those...
was that movie The Gremlins
where these cute little things came up and as they got older
they developed fangs, you know.
And a lot of our thoughts are like that.
They're looking at the cute and the nice, you know, pet them
and then they turn around and they eat you out.
There's that great science fiction
story of these astronauts
who have this, they're going
from planet to planet to planet and they've got this
machine on their
missile, on their landing vehicle
which tells them, you know, the friendliness
of a particular population
of a particular planet.
And so they land in this one planet
there's little furry things running around outside
they're climbing up the
the landing vehicle and
so they turn on the meter and it's just
paging out. These are really friendly little creatures.
And so they decide to open the door. They open the door
and here just come in and just eat them up.
So you have to watch out
for your friendly little thoughts, you know.
Question over here.
It wasn't clear to me when
you were referring to Buddha nature
you said we have to depend
on earlier teachings.
So the concept of Buddha nature
comes from later teachings
and is that the Mahayana?
Specifically, it started out
in response to the question
here we are such defiled beings
with all our bad actions in the past
how could we possibly ever
attain awakening?
And the problem with that, it starts
with this essentialist idea of who you are
that you are essentially defiled
and that somehow what you're doing
in the practice is changing your nature.
And
from the earlier teachings that Buddha said
what you are is an activity
you can always change your activities.
Your sense of who you are
is something that you can keep constructing
all the time. And if you look at your sense
of self you realize that it's not just one
sense of self.
It's a whole team.
It's a whole committee.
And who you are right now
is very different from your sense of who you are
at work or who you are driving
down the road
or in your family, in various different
search rooms. And we're always creating
different senses of self.
And sometimes they're a team
and sometimes they're at the Chicago City Council.
But
the fact is that you have so many
different senses of self as they can
observe one another.
And basically they can help each other along.
Because the Buddha
was not saying all ways of
selfing are bad.
If you have a sense of self-responsibility
if you have a sense of self, you know
a well-grounded sense of self-esteem
or actually useful senses of self.
Those are a type
of self that you want to nurture for a while
on the path.
But the idea of Buddha nature did not come until
much later. In the teaching there
it developed in various ways.
And we're talking
800 years after the Buddha.
It's a hand back here.
I think your answer to that was in this
Erli.
Hello. So Erli does not
mean like Erli in the Buddha's career.
It means historically.
It's a matter of thousands of years.
It's a good 800 years after
the Buddha, the idea of Buddha nature came up.
Why is
you quiet, Groom?
When I mentioned
Sirens of Titan, there's a character
in there who's just by sheer
dumb luck.
Somebody up there must like me.
And then he has a bad
run of luck.
He gets kidnapped and is taken off to the planet Mars.
I do have a preference
for science fiction.
But he starts thinking on the planet
Mars. He's been kidnapped
to be taken to this army that's going to
come back and attack
the world.
But the problem is he starts thinking up there.
He keeps clearing out his brain.
And then, okay, he finally
gets his brain so he can start functioning
again. And then they set off to attack
the planet Earth. And the spaceship
that he's in gets to go to Mercury instead.
So all the Mars' die and they attack
on Earth and he's the only one that's left.
And then finally, after many years, he finally
makes his way back to Earth.
And in the meantime, they've come up with this new religion
which heaps
abuse on the idea that
you have advantage over people. It must be because
somebody up there likes you.
That you deserve to be ahead of other people.
You deserve to be on top of other people.
So our guy comes back and he still
has that idea. I mean, after all, he's survived
in Mercury and all this other stuff. He comes back
and he's been made, he doesn't realize it,
but he's been made the evil man of
the new religion.
So he suddenly finds out that he was
the evil man.
And the worst thing he could have said would have been
somebody up there must have liked me.
And so he's taught,
you're going to go on public TV and you're going to say
I am the beneficiary of
accidents.
That's where it parts ways with the drama.
But there's a lot of good
other good passages in the novel.
My favorite one is when he's in Mercury.
His idea of Mercury is that Mercury is this
huge honeycomb crystal.
And because one side
is facing the sun all the time, the other side
is facing the cold, the crystal
sings.
And there are these little beings on Mercury.
They're like little kites.
And they have cuts with suction
cups on each of the corners.
And they just latch on to
the crystal.
And they can live off the vibrations.
And they have two messages
that they send to each other through the vibrations.
What I like about that is
they don't have to
eat each other.
All they have to do is feed
on music.
And this is
Kurt Vonnegut's argument against the idea
that we're living in the best of all possible worlds.
The best of all possible worlds would be
if the earth sang and all we had to do was
suck into the vibrations.
We didn't have to eat animals.
We didn't have to kill each other.
So it doesn't take much imagination
to think of a better world.
Yes.
Back to our nature if we have one.
Suppose you're sitting, meditating,
and your mind has gotten very still.
And
thoughts keep popping up.
Maybe you're skillful and very still
and quiet and so you don't latch on to those thoughts
and let go of them.
And so these thoughts just sort of
skitter around the surface very widely.
But they still keep coming.
So where do they come from?
Why does your mind do that?
Because it's used to doing that.
It's got an individual.
And one way of unlearning it is
to notice when the thought comes up
is there any pattern of tension in your body?
Can you notice that
prior to thoughts arising, there may be a tension
in some place. It might be around your head,
it might be in your arms, it might be in your fingers,
in your hands. Try to see where is the tension
and then can you relax the tension?
What happens to the thoughts?
And the purpose of this
is to realize that you can catch
the formations of thoughts earlier
and earlier and earlier as you do that.
Because you get more and more sensitive.
The slightest bit of tension there,
you finally get to the point where you realize
that sometimes there's this little
sort of disturbance in the energy of the body.
Which you could either keep as a
...
It depends on the label you put on it.
It's over. That's just a disturbance
in the breath and I can breathe through it.
Or you can say, ah, here's a potential for a thought.
Now do I want some entertainment?
And I can't think of anything else.
I can't think of anything else.
I can't think of anything else.
I can't think of anything else.
And nine times out of ten,
that your untrained mind is well
ten times out of ten, the untrained mind
will say, yeah, let's go for it.
My experience is
the thought just creates
more bodily disturbance, more tension.
Exactly.
But you can attack it from the bodily side
by breathing through the tension.
It irons out that tension
and the thought's going to go away.
So there's a strong correlation
between your body
being relaxed in your mind becoming relaxed
as in the last person.
There's all this tension going on
in your body when you're trying to figure things out.
You've got to keep this thought in mind
so there's a little bit of tension in your knee
as kind of that locator.
And that thought you keep in mind
so there's a little bit of tension in your shoulder
and complex thinking patterns going on.
Your body's going to be carrying a lot of stress around.
So if you can get to the point
where you're very, during meditation,
you're very aware that you really aren't
thinking
and then your body
becomes more relaxed.
So this is where the
sense of peace, peacefulness
comes from with the deputy line?
Yeah. But you have to be very alert
to protect this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So do you disagree
that we have a Buddha nature
or do you just disagree that it's a useful
postulate?
I don't think it's a useful concept.
But you think it's true.
Well,
I mean, with the concept
the question is
do you have the potential to be awakening?
The answer is yes.
Now is that part of an innate nature
naturally unfolding? Well, not necessarily.
It can unfold and they can
refold.
You can't trust that it's going to take care
of things.
And the Buddha is very
careful about
saying, okay, there are certain questions
that are worth pursuing and certain other questions
that are not worth pursuing.
And the ones that are not worth pursuing, he wouldn't really answer them.
One of the most famous
ones is this wanderer
comes into the Buddha and says, you know, is there a self?
The Buddha doesn't answer.
Well, is there no self?
The Buddha doesn't answer.
And you would think, well, this is a
basic question that people should ask.
Is there a self? Is there a no self? What is
myself? And the Buddha says, those are
not useful questions.
Now you think about it, for 800 years
after the Buddha was alive, people were
gaining awakening and they didn't have any
concept of Buddha nature.
And they were doing perfectly fine.
It's really not that
occasionally you might say, you know, if you're
on a retreat and you're feeling really bad
and you're trying to think of all your generous actions
in the past and they just kind of wither away
in your sight, you can't think of anything else.
You might say, well, I do have this potential.
But you don't have to call it Buddha nature.
You just say, hey, I'm a human being.
That's enough.
There's a question here.
You mentioned
Chinese medicine or something.
I've always wondered, because I studied that.
I've studied that a lot.
Why the Chinese have to have moving meditation
when the Indians imposes
whereas in dance
moving meditation which
moves the body to move the breath
and focus on awareness.
You don't see it in Indian and Thai medicine.
What you do see though is
using the breath energy
and moving around the body
without having to move the body.
I remember when I first went to study
with a John Furrier who was doing yoga
and he said, you know, you can do
think of the same effect sitting still
by moving the breath to the body.
I don't see the power of it.
There's a question over here.
You were answering this general question
about maintaining stillness of mind.
And my question is,
is it more useful
to try to maintain
stillness of mind
or to inquire about
the thoughts and where they come from
and what they mean to you?
When you maintain stillness of mind
then you put your better position
to look into the thoughts.
You want to be able to do both
but the stillness makes it a lot easier
to see what's going on
because once you've had practice
in what I call zapping the thoughts
so that you can turn them off at any time.
Then you're in a business
and you can kind of welcome in.
Let's look at you.
Then you look at a particular thought
because you've got to be able to observe it
from the outside
rather than getting into it.
You want to see where is the point
where you get into the thought
that you get sucked in.
That's what's called birth
if you've already got
you're already skilled at not getting in
then you're much better positioned
to watch the thought
and to see exactly where was the point
where you make the choice to go in.
So ultimately you want to be able to do both
but the foundation
of looking into the thoughts
and understanding the mass processes
comes from getting the mind still first.
That's an essential skill.
Because we do have this tendency
you know
it's like we're standing in the corner
and the car drives up and say hey come on
and we jump in
and then after they've driven off
they say wait a minute who are you
where are you going
if we lived our lives like that
you know
we'd all be dead someplace aren't we
and so you have to develop the skill
not to jump in
if you're there you've got to be able
to understand the person
who are you where are you going
why should I believe you
don't take candy from strangers
don't take candy from your thoughts
ok it's time to wrap up
ok well thank you for your attention
