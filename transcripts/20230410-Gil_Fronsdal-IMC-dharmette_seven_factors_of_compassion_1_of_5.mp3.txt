Hello and welcome to our Monday gathering.
Today I'm at the Insight Retreat Center,
lovely to be in this meditation hall.
The topic for this week is compassion.
To talk about it in a particular way,
building on two weeks ago, the theme was compassion as well.
We're building on this.
Last week the topic was different ways of being aware.
The importance of that for compassion is that if we only have one way to be aware,
that mode of awareness might not be the best and healthiest way for us
to be present for suffering in ourselves and suffering in others.
It might be, for example, that someone mostly is aware through feelings,
and that's the only way they know how to know anything is through the vehicle of feelings.
Some of the suffering in the world might just feel too much,
and our own suffering might feel too much.
It's important to feel, but it's also important to find the awareness
that we can be present for something where we're not weighed down by what the experience is.
And so someone who feels a lot might be able to shift a little bit into an observing mode,
maybe observing kind of from a little bit of distance,
or they might be more in a not feeling so much,
but kind of a clear mental recognition of what's happening,
and that the feelings are still there, but coming into the mode of recognition,
knowing, oh, this is pain, this is someone's sadness,
that then it might be easier to be present for it.
It might be able to find a place of a light touch,
being present in a way that has a certain degree of ease or lightness in the awareness itself.
Then that becomes that lightness or that ease or a little bit of calmness around how we're aware.
That makes room for compassion to arise rather than distress to arise,
rather than fear or alarm arising.
And so the mode in which we're aware can affect how we can have compassion.
And then also, if we're compassionate, the mode in which we're relating to things,
the mode in which we're aware, can affect how we enact the compassion,
how we live from that compassion.
And so the compassion is lived in a way that maybe it's not so heavy,
or doesn't come from a sense of duty, or doesn't come from a sense of, you know,
doesn't mix up with fear or ego or all kinds of things that can be there.
So what I'd like to do this week is offer you what I'm calling the seven factors of compassion.
And they're the same as the common Buddhist list of the seven factors of awakening.
And so the first one is mindfulness, so the mindfulness factor of compassion,
the investigation factor of compassion, the effort factor of compassion,
the joy factor of compassion, the tranquility factor of compassion,
the concentration factor of compassion, and the equanimity factor of compassion.
And what's kind of lovely is that when we live from compassion,
the seven factors of awakening follow along.
And the first one being mindfulness, there's a way in which coming from a compassionate place,
responding to things compassionately, brings with it mindfulness.
Mindfulness kind of comes along without any real having to work at it.
People only practice mindfulness.
There are times where it's kind of worked, you know,
you feel like you're doing the mindfulness, you're okay, I've drifted off.
I have to come back and have to do it again.
But when compassion is in the forefront, there's a way in which mindfulness can follow effortlessly.
It's not like we have to work at being mindful.
And so it's the same thing for the other factors.
So to make this easier to understand this,
I would like to give kind of a school playground example.
Say you're visiting a playground and there's a small child,
maybe a five, six-year-old child, four or five-year-old child, who's playing.
They have lots of fun in the playground.
But then the child trips and scrapes her, maybe she scrapes her knee.
She's wearing shorts and so the knee rubs across the asphalt and gets scraped.
And maybe it's dirty and there's little gravel.
And so she's quite stunned and shocked that, you know, she was having so much fun
and now suddenly she's in pain, she's confused, she's upset and in pain.
And relatively common schoolyard kind of injury.
And so she comes running to you.
And so you feel her distress, you feel her see that she has a wound.
But you've had this for yourself in playgrounds, you've seen before.
This is a kind of common thing.
She's going to be fine.
What she needs is someone who just cares for her, is present in a calm way
and begins taking care of her in a nice way.
And so you decide that she calms down and say,
you're going to, with compassion and care, you want to clean her wound
because there's gravel and grit in there.
And so, but it hurts for her to touch it even with a flow of water.
So you get maybe a soft cotton ball or something that's moist.
And you very lightly tap the wound in order to pick up some of the dirt that's there.
And you do it with, you really don't want to hurt her.
You care about her.
You want to settle her.
You don't want to agitate her more.
So there's this love and care to do this as carefully as you can.
And so you bring your attention into that, you know,
you're paying attention to her very carefully to see what the response will be when you touch.
So you can pull back quickly if it stings her too much.
But you know, just very gently.
And you're very careful about how quickly you do it, the pressure you put on the wound.
There's a lot of attention.
What's driving the attention is the compassion, the care for the girl.
What follows in the wake of that care is a lot of mindfulness.
A lot of attention there to really be present, to take in the situation.
No one needs to tell you, be aware, pay attention, be mindful, come back to the present moment.
That just follows along with this deep motivation to care for this person
and to be attentive in a nice way to not cause, you know, more pain for her.
And not only do you have to, you know, there's a lot of awareness and attention there.
There is what in Buddhism is called investigation,
which is to be very discerning about what causes more pain and what causes less.
What supports her, what doesn't support her.
What kind of tone of voice to speak, what tone of voice not to speak.
Partly taking in the cues from her and as you speak and as you say things.
And so there's a lot of care not only in being present,
but in making distinctions between what is useful here and what is not useful.
The compassion takes the lead.
And this idea of kind of being considerate about, you know, what's going to hurt her more
and what's going to hurt her less is kind of effortless.
It's like obvious, of course, if you want to carefully care for her wound
and to clean it and put a bandage on.
Of course you're going to try to pay attention to the way to do it
that causes the least amount of pain for her, the least amount of distress.
So you're tuning into all these little factors and what's useful and not useful.
And so what's in the lead here is compassion.
So one way to develop mindfulness is to be compassionate.
One way to be compassionate is to be mindful.
One way is to develop your capacity to be aware in a light way, in a calm way, in an open way.
So that then the tenderness, the warmth of your heart has a chance as a room to be there.
When we're aware in a heavy way or strong way or if we're angry and we're being aware,
the anger doesn't give much room if we're full of desires, if we're full of fear.
There's not much room for anything to arise in the field of awareness.
But if we can learn the art, even with fear and anger and distress,
the art of having a light touch, a lightness, an easefulness, and a mindfulness,
just that you might find that there's a little more space to have care and love
and compassion and kindness for yourself, for the distress you have,
and for others for the difficulty they have.
And then once the compassion is there, to let that be in the forefront, to act on that,
to live that way, to have compassion, maybe not in such a way that everyone knows you're being compassionate
because that might be a little bit too much for some people,
but you care. You're bringing a caring and a kindness to your things, to people and events.
And then notice that as you do that, can you notice the easeful way in which you are aware, you're mindful?
Can you notice the matter-of-fact obvious way in which you're investigating,
you're making distinctions between what supports the situation and what doesn't,
what's helpful and what's not helpful?
That compassion is wise.
Compassion, when we act on it or live motivated by it, brings along a lot of different factors that support the compassion,
sometimes even needing to think about it, provided that we don't get locked in with a compassion,
or alarmed, or fearful, or dutiful, and the compassion doesn't become heavy.
When there's a lot of suffering in the world, you might feel obligated,
I have to be heavy, I have to be serious, my compassion has to be strong now.
The paradox of all this is that the best form of compassion that we can have is not strong compassion.
It's heavy compassion. It's light compassion. It's calm compassion.
It's compassion that has lots of room for things, including lots of room for yourself.
And it's that kind of compassion that brings along with it attention, attentiveness, mindfulness,
and that brings along with it discerning about what's helpful and not helpful,
or that question, looking and seeing, what here is helpful?
All with a light touch.
All with a kind of light touch that is sustainable for compassion over a long time.
And that's one of the things we're looking for in compassion, is sustainable compassion.
Because compassion that is heavy or strong, or that's too tight or connected with other kind of challenges we have,
will have compassion fatigue, will get exhausted very quickly.
But this lightness, a light touch, so maybe think of living a life of compassion as more like a marathon than a sprint.
And so a marathon also, you kind of start off with a kind of a light run.
And so the seven factors of compassion that follow along, built on compassion,
and today I mentioned two, mindfulness and discernment or investigation.
And you might see as you go about your day today, maybe try to have a light touch with your awareness,
but have a light compassion, or light care, or light love, or kindness,
that allows there to be room for attention, awareness of what is happening in this field of kindness,
what's happening in this field of compassion.
And then maybe start seeing how mindfulness can follow compassion, how discernment follows,
and see how those work together. And maybe you'll find that it's even easier to be mindful and develop your mindfulness
if it's guided by compassion than it's guided by a sense of, you know, it's good for you or something.
So thank you. And we'll continue from IRC tomorrow. And thank you for being here.
