 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Greetings, friends. Greetings. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, whatever the time zone might be. Delighted to be with you, to feel your presence spread spatially, but the same temporal time, the same time, but spread in space. So today, day two of our exploration of the refrain of Satipatthana Sutta, which you've been studying thoroughly and systematically with Gil. So what I'd like to offer today and invite us to explore is the... So yesterday I tried to set the frame a little bit. I set the frame a little more today, but the importance and the significance of the refrain. And then we'll explore the first sentence of it. And I'd like to invite us to explore this first statement, this significant first statement in our practice together also. So the first sentence in the frame is, in this regard, in this way, in regard to the body, one abides contemplating the body internally, or one abides contemplating the body externally, or one abides contemplating the body both internally and externally. So I will decode that. I'll talk more about that in the Dharma, but in the guided meditation, I'd like to bring in some invitations for us to explore this invitation of internal, external together in one aspect, not every teaching of the Satipatthana. There's so many of them, but one of them, or maybe a couple of them, to have a taste of what this might feel like and what might mean. So without further ado, let's sit. Let's practice together. So let's arrive. Let's arrive in this body, in the seat, landing, arriving comfortably, arriving in our seat in this body, releasing, releasing, releasing whatever is not helpful right now, or supportive, releasing thoughts, releasing plans for the future, or preoccupations from this morning, releasing, releasing, releasing, not out of the should, but releasing because of love, because we love to do this, we love to practice, we love to cultivate our heart in peace and kindness for ourselves and others, to cultivate insights, so out of love, releasing, relaxing into the body, relaxing here, this body, when the body is relaxed, the mind can relax more easily, so relax the body if there's any tightness or holding anywhere, releasing with the out breath and taking refuge, refuge in this moment, the simplicity, the beauty of our intention here, here, in our hearts here. Let's take a few minutes to arrive in the body, releasing, relaxing, taking refuge together. Thank you..... The thoughts arise, entanglement arise, release, release and return, release and return to this moment here, no need for self-judgment, beating yourself up, oh, I was gone for so long, no need, no need, just release, release, and come back to the refuge of this heart in this moment, begin again, begin again, relax into the body... Feeling the breath in the body internally, this life-giving breath, the entirety of the in-breath, the palms, the entirety of the out-breath, the paws, the entirety of the breath felt sensed, clearly known, clearly known, clear comprehension. In this body, without making it effortful, let it be known, let it be known, the breath, this breath internally... The breath internally, this life-giving breath, throughout the body, nourishing, bringing life, the breath being sensed, unknown. Taking one more moment to really grok, to really know, let it be known, capture the sensation of the breath in this body internally, as if it were your first breath, or your last breath, the breath known internally. Now relax, release, and bring to mind, let's first bring to mind someone, maybe who's near and dear to you, you have an easy relationship with. And let their breath be known, this external breath be known to you. They breathe just like you, this human being. As you know your breath internally, knowing this breath externally by this other human being, life-giving breath, how it might feel for them, you can even perhaps in your mind's eye, imagine them breathing, seeing them breathing deeply shallow, and feeling them breathing, feeling them breathing, feeling them breathing, feeling them breathing, feeling them breathing, feeling them breathing, and now expanding this external knowing of the breath to as many beings as you wish in your mind's eye, many humans all breathing, the breath known externally. And if it feels overwhelming, then just stay with one other being, one other human or animal breathing externally. And now exploring the instruction of knowing in the body internally and externally. As you know your own breath, this breath being known, the body, the mind be relaxed, and knowing also externally, this other being in your mind's eye, the breath known internally and externally. Knowing, thinking, analyzing, just simply let it be known. And if perhaps you and your friend were breathing together, both breaths known internally and externally. Thank you. Thank you. Continuing to know the breath and internally and externally. Maybe at some point, the personality of the breath drops out and is just a breath. Not me, not mine, not internal external, it's just breath breathing happening. Internal external, just breath. Don't try too hard. Just let it be known first internal external, the insight might reveal itself on its own, when the time is right. My breath, this breath, their breath, their breathing. May just become breathing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Breathing internally, breathing externally, internally and externally. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May all beings be well. May all beings be free. Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice. Thank you.
