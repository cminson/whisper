 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. Beautiful. Hi, everyone. Lovely to see you. Be with you. So what I'd like to do this evening, offer this evening for practice reflections is to start practicing together. And I'll introduce the theme in the guided meditation. And I'll say a couple of words about it afterwards. So let's just begin sitting together, meditating together. So I invite you to settle, to arrive in your body. If you're sitting, let yourself feel a sense of integrity in your posture. You're sitting in a chair. Feel the bottom of your feet, both feet planted on the earth. A softening into your feet, a softening into your sit bones, into your abdomen. A softening of your neck and shoulders, your eyes in their socket, your forehead. Let the skin be soft, not wrinkled. Let your jaw, let it be loosened. Let your breath be free. Now it's controlled, constricted, but moving freely. However it wants to be, long or short. Let each out breath settle you, releasing tightness, holding, settling, letting go more deeply with each out breath. Thank you. Nothing needs to happen. Just here, simply here, being breathed, releasing, letting go with every exhale. Here, so delicious to be present with whatever is here. Not thinking, not analyzing what is here, but just being with it, breathing with whatever is present in the body. Thank you. ï¿½ you you you you I'd like to invite you to bring to your heart invite a presence of someone for whom good well kindness comes with ease you don't have a complicated relationship with them ideally and ideally they're alive could be a pad could be a child someone easy opening them into your heart space feeling their presence noticing how you feel when you invite them into your sphere of awareness does the smile show up is your sense of gladness sense of safety delight sense of care appreciation love notice the show from this felt sense however subtle it might be sharing your goodness your good well your appreciation for them could be without words without phrases could be with the simple phrases of metta I wish you well I appreciate you I wish you well or with the four more traditional phrases may you be safe do you want keeping their image or felt sense whatever keeps the connection with this being alive for you keeping it up may you be safe from inner and outer harm I wish you safety although I know absolute safety is not guaranteed in the world I offer this wish to you as a gift of goodwill I wish you well I wish you safety I wish you happiness may

share your goodwill cultivate metta for this their being all of them now consider an aspect of this being that you really appreciate particular aspect of them be the really kind or generous or or easy going or or they're a great cook and cook for you with so much love or anything else one aspect bring that to the forefront as you appreciate them as you share metta share your metta your loving kindness with them for them maybe it's indescribable that quality is just how they make you feel accepted it's just how they make you feel accepted it's just how they make you feel accepted it's just

accepted it's you you you bring yourself in to receiving metta as if you were giving metta sharing it both to you and maybe you're easy being dear being in you in this image they're interacting the way they usually do taking a walk sitting having tea or whatever might be share metta for both of them may both of you one is your dear being the other is yourself an image of you when interaction interacting with your friend may both of you both of you be safe from harm no way it's slipping outside of yourself and seeing yourself within interacting with your dear being is an aspect of impersonality cultivating the universality of metta may you may you both being dear beings may be safe may you be happy may you be healthy as much as possible having a felt sense an image of both of you these dear beings interacting may you both have ease may you be safe safe happy happy healthy ease appreciating that both of these beings are doing their best be kind show up as well as they possibly can see yourself in a in a kind light just as you see your dear being in a kind light see the two of you as a third person or a third person with good well and kindness describing goodness and good well and you appreciate you appreciate all of your dear being your friend and all of yourself understanding the good making space for what's challenging with kindness with compassion maybe even fears compassion but still making room for all parts with goodwill part left out and as we bring as we bring this sitting to a close together appreciating your own goodness for having showed up practiced as well as you're able to in this moment in time being your own goodness and making room for what's challenging inside and outside and all of us together having co-created the space to practice together to cultivate met kindness goodwill generosity of spirits sharing this goodness in our hearts with all beings everywhere trusting knowing that our practice isn't just good for us doesn't just impact us impacts others our loved ones our friends strangers reverberates in ways we cannot even imagine through the world may all beings everywhere including ourselves be happy may all beings including ourselves be free thanks everyone thanks for your practice so what we did this evening just a few words of review what we did was we began with settling in the body with the breath relaxing softening in the areas that were tight need to be released and then invited the breath to be releasing with every out breath to settle us more deeply into our heart into our posture into the present moment and then we invited someone we cared about we didn't met for them anyway that it was easy then brought to our minds an aspect of them that we really appreciate we really love so that we really our hearts gather around that around the goodness the brightness and then we invited ourselves as a beloved other in interaction interacting with our dear being something we haven't explored here in happy hours so many ways and then wishing well for both of these beings or doing their best interacting which is just a different way to get to meta for ourselves because sometimes meta for ourselves can be so challenging so these are so many different ways we we try to get to it so and yeah meta for beer being meta for ourselves through that seeing ourselves as a as a beloved other and also this way of stepping out of ourselves and seeing us ourselves in interaction with someone we care about this also ties into as I was mentioning there's a sense of universality that in personality not self like oh yes just goodwill goodwill with it is us here that's considering all of this and yet there is something tapping into the universality of goodwill that's just available so so I'd like to invite us to do not transition and doing things a little differently trying things out for size I'm going to invite us to transition now to small groups and then we'll have time for reflections after that when we come out and with the breakout groups of size roughly three hopefully the invitation always is as we connect with other people in the Dharma with other practitioners in this contemplation the invitation tonight with this question with this practice we did is for each person to perhaps if you if you would like to share a little bit of what was it like for you there's no right or wrong and say I fell asleep my mind was distracted it's okay fine or maybe something new came up when you saw yourself in interaction with someone else just offering that again as as a gift as a gift to the Sangha then notice also your intention why are you speaking is it to to be of service of to to also to serves to yourself and others but not in a way of self-aggrandizing but just humbly with humility sharing your your insights with others and you can also say pass or when you return come to say thank you pass and then maybe later when it comes your way you can say something or not it's all good and and each person maybe will just say something for a minute or two and then make sure you leave space for the next person and then the next person and then it'll come back to you so you can go around a couple of times and not no asking questions no directing other people's experience just sharing from your own experience very simple and then ask and then letting others share from theirs be kind this is really breakout groups are perfect place to stay embodied and speak from your body to practice mindfulness of speaking mindfulness of listening it's such such a beautiful practice instead of like okay it's recess blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah please don't do that stay in your bodies this is it's really important practice so many things can line up okay so I'm going to open the breakout rooms and I'll give a little extra minute actually can I do that right now let's see can I I'm gonna create but I'm gonna give you a few extra minutes at the end when the timer ends just so that you have a heads up okay here we go I'm gonna open them up take care of yourselves take care of each other be kind be kind the rooms are closed everybody is back and we have a few minutes for reflections questions comments observations either from guided meditation or from your group from your breakout connection with the Sangha you can either type them in chat if you like and if you type them privately to me I will just read your comment or question not your name or you can also raise your zoom hand so any reflections you like to share questions what was it like Pietro please okay yeah thanks thank you Nikki good evening everyone so that was very lovely meditation and very very lovely very interesting for me was seeing myself in third person something I haven't experimented with but it was very powerful so thank you so much for that and what I think that we discussed a little bit in our small group was how it's not always easy to find uncomplicated people to direct messages so if you've got family usually there's a lot of love but really uncomplicated is not always as easy and and I would just like it for me it happened that talk to a neutral person today did something really nice to me so I was able to bring that person in which I didn't I don't know very well at all and so but he did something nice so there was that it was so easy to open the heart there was nothing between us really a negative so it was it felt really a great choice to get a little bit but at the end was really really a great choice and really opened my heart a lot but just wanted to share that beautiful thanks so much for sharing that Pietro and I appreciate the wisdom that you had to to bring in a neutral person for you today this person that had done something nice to you your heart was open and many times it is skillful to bring a neutral person if if as you said some of the dear people we love you know the relationships are complicated and so yes very skillful beautiful how you you brought in a neutral person who would become a dear person in a way with their through their kindness and just let the heart be open and explore oh wow me as a third person being kind being interacting with someone so that can be very onward leading also glad that that lit something up for you thank you thank you Pietro thank you so much for your practice thank you yeah Serena thank you so much for your teachings I'm going to ask a question about how to skillfully deal with oh god I can't even think of the word right now okay maybe Peter can help me what was the word I used in our group you can type it in chat Pietro if you you can send it to Serena also it's a type of ill will you know it's like not not really resentment no no resentment is is no it's it's a lot less it's less heavier than we send an oil well irritation irritation irritation that's it that's what it was thanks Peter yeah so I felt a lot of irritation during the meditation and I really did not I didn't feel like I had the the capacity at that point in time to to handle the irritation so I basically try to do something else so let me ask you so what so I have an idea what the irritation I already have some thoughts but I wanted to ask you so if you can go back in time and get a sense of what was the irritation what was the source of it that as well as you can tell maybe it's hard to tell it was just a feeling of irritation like but you came in with an irritable mind yeah well I wasn't aware that I were I'm I'm actually quarantined from covid from covid right now and I it's the first time that I'm aware that I've had covid in the past three years and actually I wound up at the hospital for it so I was back since yesterday but what I have noticed is even at the hospital I was irritated with this lady who could not get it right something right so and so I guess the for me it's really important it feels so strong when the irritation comes on yeah that I feel like I I'm not able to really get a handle it on the time at the time that it it's on yeah so unless I could just totally turn it off to something totally different it doesn't feel like I can handle just be with your equation so for the benefit of time I'm going to I got it just of what's happening and thank you for sharing and I'm so sorry to hear that you've been so sick with covid Serena and had to go to the hospital glad you're back at home feeling better hopefully recovering so so regarding your question about irritation in the limited time left couple of things one is no if the body is feeling ill or or out of balance if you're sick with a virus fighting then there's less there's less room really it's like a tire you know there's less air in the tire so it's easier for that for for one to get irritated so so turn turn towards the irritation turns because when you're irritated you're the person who was like you're the you know you're both hurting yourself and you're harming others so bring compassion especially when you're sick especially when you're sick bring compassion which is like a soothing sound it's okay as well as patience patience and compassion those are the two antidotes for irritation especially patience it's not going to get any better or easier if you're irritated and you're it just you know that that that's a wisdom practice bringing the patience in so bring patience in as well as compassion for yourself was really hurting right now with the irritation and distraction is not this is not a very good strategy because I mean sometimes it can feel skillful but overall it's better to actually work with it head on with with wisdom bringing in a dose of patience and compassion for yourself who's suffering in that moment so thank you for bringing that in serena thank you so it is seven o'clock and our time has come to an end our time together thank you all so much for your practice for your cultivation cultivation of your heart for the sake of all beings may all beings including ourselves be well may all beings be free thanks everyone
