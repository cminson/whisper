It's good to, good to, say with you. 
So, as I began, I said that that dukkha is displacing dukkha, which is displacing dukkha, and it's almost hard to, hard to keep track of the, the impact of one crisis on another, the layering of, of suffering, and I think I, I heard etymologically dukkha, that word suffering, this unsatisfactoriness, some kind of connotation of, of an axle not fitting into a wheel perfectly, and so you get a rough ride. 
And in this, this time, fire season here in California, other places too, the smoke hangs menacingly over, over us, a testament to, to much, to our fragility and so far as it's, as its climate change, implicated, climate change is implicated as one of the causal factors and exacerbating things that it's the smoke, also a testament to our, our destructiveness. 
And in the context of, of this, I, I think of, I think of grief, I think of gratitude. 
William James, 125 years ago wrote, humankind is in a position similar to that of a set of people living on a frozen lake surrounded by cliffs over which there is no escape, yet knowing that little by little the ice is melting and the inevitable day drawing near when the last film of it will disappear and to be drowned ignominiously will be the human creature's portion, the merrier the skating, the warmer and more sparkling the sun by day and the rudder the bonfires at night, the more poignant the sadness with which one must take in the meaning of the total situation. 
We have to study those cliffs, we have to study them because if we don't, the mere sight of them will spin us endlessly, yeah. 
But one of the, the effects of, of our skating, skating on that ice is, is poignancy and, and gratitude, gratitude for what is here for goodness, that goodness exists, that asks us to be careful about acclimatizing to all the goodness that is here, easy to do that. 
We discuss the question, how much does one need to be happy, what do I really actually need? I was struck by this passage from a writer who died quite young of cancer, Amy Krauss Rosenthal, and she wrote this not, not so long before she died, I believe. 
She wrote, when I'm feeling dreary, annoyed and generally unimpressed by life, I imagine what it would be like to come back to this world for just a day after having been dead. 
Imagine how sentimental I would feel about the very things I once found stupid, hateful or mundane, oh, there's a light switch, I haven't seen a light switch in so long. 
I didn't realize how much I missed light switches, oh, oh, and look, the stairs up to our front porch are still completely cracked, hello cracks, let me get a good look at you. 
And there's my neighbor standing there, fantastically alive, just the same, still punctuating her senses with, you know what I'm saying? Why did that bother me? It's so endearing. 
Last time I was with you through with the IRC crew, I spoke about balancing compassion and equanimity, balancing the middle path being not merely threading the needle between unwholesome extremes, but also balancing between wholesome factors. 
And it would be so much easier if it were just one, if we just had one marching order, if it were just to rescue samsara or just escape samsara, neutralize samsara. 
If we were tasked with only one of those aspirations, it would be simpler for sure. 
But we're not, the Dharma is found is not one, but two. 
And I've been grappling with a set of questions for years, but even more prominent in my mind with COVID and George Floyd and Civil Rights Movement, next chapter of the Civil Rights Movement. 
And the question is sort of like, all right, well, how much do the teachings change in tone, in emphasis, based on the sociopolitical moment? How much do they change? And to some extent, this gets us into the terrain of traditionalist adaptationists, what we could call adaptationists, those who are maybe lean more in the kind of, I don't know, fundamentalist direction or those who are actively trying to adapt teachings to integrate other bodies of knowledge to address new concerns. 
And on the more traditional side, I thought of this moment, sitting with the tennis or a big group, great translator of so much of the Pali canon. 
And I asked, I asked how the analogy holds up. 
Christian is to the Bible, as Buddhist is to the Pali canon. 
And I guess in retrospect, a little bit of a provocative question, and how does that analogy hold up? And what he said was, not great, not great, Matthew, it doesn't hold up that well, because you have to test the Pali canon was what he said. 
But as far as I could tell, everything in the Pali canon passed his test, right? And so he represents a more kind of traditional approach. 
I don't know how he's teaching in this time, but he is a little bit of a kind of archetype for me of fidelity to the early texts and kind of unwavering commitment to follow that thread. 
And then, as I said, there are other voices that are very actively trying to integrate other discourses, other wisdom traditions to kind of diversify the heart, the Dharma heart, and meet the kind of ways that suffering constellates now here. 
And generally, I've been, in a way, I would say, erring on the side of the adaptationist. 
There is something like, I have been actively trying to tailor teachings to this moment, and that does mostly feel right, like some of the teachings, some of the ways of pointing out things from our tradition, it can almost feel like a kind of empathic failure to be on Zoom during a pandemic and say, see, the Buddha told us so. 
And so I've been emphasizing the centrality of grieving, of love, of refuge, which are aspects of the teachings, I believe, that are important, that speak to this moment. 
But you know, teachers don't merely transmit their wisdom. 
We necessarily transmit our delusion, too, because we don't know the difference. 
And so there's a self-reflective piece of teaching that is quite important. 
And there's some recognition that it's possible, that my heart is being blown around by the moment in ways in which I've been unaware, and that doesn't make me regret how I've been teaching or anything like that, and it doesn't make me walk it back at all. 
I don't know where this goes, but it makes me cautious, it makes me cautious because I don't want to act out whatever wobble there is in my own heart-mind. 
Not long ago, I was talking to a friend who had just taught a meditation retreat, and I was powerful to speak with her. 
I could almost taste the samadhi, the subtleness, the faith, the commitment in her. 
And she's quite a kind of active person, you know, has a much wider concern than just the narrow dharma community, but I could taste the effects of her practice, of the teaching that she had done, and her groundedness had a kind of strong impact on me, and the thought arose, has it been that my faith in dharma wobbled somehow, even slightly? Or was I being responsive to the moment in emphasizing other commitments, other traditions, other course, you know, paths of action that are part of the dharma, but adaptations. 
And there's this sense, these kind of multiple layers of crisis, that the dharma sort of almost like needs to be tailored to every new form of pain. 
Maybe that's right, but maybe not. 
And so, not to be crass, it's the language that I have always used, but the dharma is better at preventing fires than putting them out. 
There's an emphasis in, especially in mindfulness, secular mindfulness world on choice, on mindfulness affording us choice, when you're in a painful bind, you choose to respond rather than react, you know, become reactive and act out the defilements, yeah? And this is a model of mindfulness, of the path of practice putting out a fire that has already ignited. 
And that's not so much my experience of how practice works, of how it confers benefits, of how it protects the heart from suffering. 
Once we're really backed into, back deep into a karmic corner, we're going to suffer, yeah? There's no vapasana ing it away, no metta ing it away. 
We're actually going to suffer, and we bear it with as much grace as we can. 
We try, often I think it's helpful just to try to suffer a little less, not to be free of suffering. 
We are backed into a karmic corner, and we're finding our way out, and it consolidates the wish to practice so that that corner becomes less familiar. 
Recently, I was in a kind of tough situation where I was really watching a loved one suffer as painful, painful to see, and someone asked me, like, okay, how are you going to practice with this? What are you going to do with this? The response was, I'm going to suffer, yeah? There's no vapasana karate move to do on that. 
There may be a little bit of movement, maybe we can suffer a little less, but there is a sense of just like even the question is kind of misattuned, like, what am I going to do? I'm going to suffer, that's what I'm going to do. 
The dharma is not about putting out every fire, but cultivating a heart such that fire is less likely to ignite, and over the years it's not so much that I feel like I'm making choices that help extinguish the fires of dukkha, but actually tending to my heart, cultivating a heart that is less susceptible. 
It's a mysterious kind of process, but so much suffering simply melting away that does not ignite as it did. 
And so in our practice, we stay steady, we go slow, but we go with diligence and a sense of urgency. 
We won't be able to put out every fire, every flare up, but we prepare chitta not to burn. 
We prepare chitta not to burn. 
And in doing this, we generate a kind of surplus of well-being, it's well-being that needs to be spent, and we spend it on others. 
We trace out the ethical implications of the silence, of the stillness, of the poignancy, of the faces of those cliffs, the ice melting, and we engage from there. 
I offer this for your consideration, and please pick up whatever is useful and leave the rest behind.
