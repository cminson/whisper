 We'll do an official welcome to all of you to join our second class of this series. And some of you might even be new to this class at the whole Polycanon class, but I'm just happy to see many of you came back after the second class. So I'll just say a few words to briefly maybe review what we did in the last class, and then say a few words about what's coming up in today's session. So last week, we offered a little bit of big picture of the Polycanon world that we entered in, including some history and a little bit of a structure or the map of the Polycanon in the three baskets. And we also shared a little bit of the process of preservation, transmission, and translations. And then we meditated, maybe in a meditative way, kind of received some verses from Teragata. So maybe you have a little bit of a taste of how it feels to work with the text. And then this week, we'll continue on to offer some additional tools for us to navigate the Polycanon text in some practical way. So we'll start off by offering a tour around Suta Central and finding Suta's, finding our way into Suta's. And then I will also talk a little bit about Poly as a language, and if you have interest, I had to work with this. And then we'll share a little bit about how we incorporate the text in our meditative or contextual way or meditative or contemplative practices to allow it to become part of our path. And so that's what we planned out for today. And we wanna open it up maybe just to invite people to share some reflections, or if you have questions before we dive in. We have a few minutes for some interaction here. And please use your Zoom hands if possible. And it's a little hard to navigate to the three screens for me here. Yeah, so I see a bell at the hands out, please. Hi, first, thanks for doing this. I love this sort of thing. I've been in Buddhism for a long time because I believe the teachings are very profound and very subtle. And the way it's been taught at the places I've gone, I see a lot of opportunity to look at how my mind works in a very, very fine-grained manner. And I see a lot of teachings that are maybe counterintuitive. Anyway, I just love the Dharma, the way it's been presented. My question is, to what degree is, I have the teachings, the way it's been presented at IMC and many other places, firmly rooted in the polycanon. And to what degree is it maybe, does it derive from the Visuddha Maga? Or to what degree has it been processed or made up by current day teachers? Is the polycanon that fine-grained in its psychological study of how our minds work? What do you think? Wow, what a beautiful question. I love your contemplation also. I feel like this is a process in the world, not around, in finding our relationship with polycanon and understand our own stance and our own roots and our own relationships. And maybe different centers have different relationships with this and it's still a discovery process. And so I wanted to maybe open up to my dear co-teachers to say some words about this as well. And for me, I know personally, when I practiced for a while in a Burmese meditation center, the meditative practice is firmly rooted in the commentaries, but the teachings also goes back to suttas quite deeply. And so I feel maybe in certain strength or streams of Buddhist communities or schools may have various relationships they have with polycanon and the commentaries. Maybe I'll just say a word. I would say at IMC, if I wanted to make a global generalized statement, I would say it's rooted in the polycanon, not so much the commentaries. And of course, right, 21st century Westerners living in California. So it kind of is through that interpretive lens, but definitely an emphasis on the polycanon is what I would say if I, to generalize. I might add that, just in addition to what's been said, while you were speaking, I felt like the Buddha had almost anticipated this. So in the polycanon, there's a suta that says, there are two ways to misrepresent the tathagata. One is by offering an interpretation of a teaching that is meant to be understood directly. And the other is by not interpreting or what a teaching that needs to be interpreted, teaching it directly. So there's a sense that some teachings are just meant to be as they are, others will inherently require some interpretation, which to me means brought into the culture, brought through the person who's transmitting it, whatever. There's something there that needs to be drawn out or made specific to the situation. And so, but the Buddha doesn't say which are which among those. So I think built into the structure is that these teachings need to be alive in some ways. And yet there is an essence to them. That's what, that's my interpretation of that suta. So I create a question, yeah. And I would add, because it is such a rich question, and I think one that we've all given quite a bit of thought to just how much for, I think it's safe to say, all Buddhist schools, almost all, I'll hedge my bets, the Pali Canon is sort of a bedrock of inspiration and sometimes very, very specific and nuanced instruction and guidance. When we're given that initial instruction to sit down, cross our legs, close our eyes, bring our attention, our mindfulness to the fore, to the here and now of our experience, to bring attention to the breathing and thus the body. And the idea that there's something profound to be learned there, that maybe there's some freedom available there, that's in the opening passage of the Satipatthana Sutta. So there's this direct relationship. At the same time, I would just point to something that, something that hasn't been mentioned yet, which is that there's this intertwined, these intertwined traditions, Bill. There's the textual tradition, there's the combinatorial tradition, and there's an oral tradition. And they're all interrelated. And over time, it's almost like a triple helix, where there's this constant sort of conversation between the Pali Canon, if you will, the reflections upon the Canon and the instructions and practices that have developed as ways to practice. So that's what I would add to the responses. So it's all there in the text, but it's been brought alive for modern-day folks. We bring it alive, we keep it alive. We're doing that here and now. Thank you all very much. Yeah, thank you, Bill. And I see Tommy had a hand up. Thank you, Ying. Yeah, my question is, I ended up getting a Samyutta Nakhaya and started to look at that. And I actually, I'm curious why it's mostly Maja Menakaya as recommended and not this one. I found it very helpful to read a whole series of similes regarding a particular topic. I loved it. But I'm also curious about what do I, these are clearly, I think, what do I, these are clearly taken, they're little snippets, so they're taken out of context. How should I really relate to them? What do I need to know about how they were collected? Those, yeah, I think that says enough about my question. Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Tanya, for mentioning that. Yeah, so for me, for a long time when I was in a Chinese Sangha, we started with the Samyutta. We did not start with the Maja Menakaya and Dika. So maybe I think it's in different teachers or different centers and they teach this differently. I think later on, bringing Maja Menakaya, having some contextualization of the teachings that were really kind of allowed these teachings to be brought alive. But I feel that this may have certain variations and if you enter into the pavi canon, maybe at certain time, just because the teacher had offered a series of teachings, then you ended up kind of entering in the middle of the Samyutta or Maja Menakaya. And so it's a kind of a long spectrum that may be happening. For me, Samyutta and Nikaia are getting a sense of the core teachings through the categories of teachings that have been very, very helpful. And maybe this is something we're all exploring in terms of how to enter and where to enter. And maybe this is different from individuals as well as you engage with the text. Maybe other teachers might wanna say something. I can add one little comment, just that I also very much appreciate the Samyutta for its nice categorical organization. My mind really likes that kind of thing. And one time when I was going through it in a class, it occurred to me that when you read an entire Samyutta, an entire chapter essentially on one topic, what you're getting is the equivalent of a tag cloud on the internet, where they have the words that are the most often are bigger. And so you get a sense of what is the flavor of this term. And so the name of the Samyutta would be the big one in the middle. And then there's all these other things you realize, oh, when the Buddha teaches about, like I'm teaching currently on the Vedana Samyutta, and we see again and again, the Vedana is taught through Anicca. That's the main connection, but it also goes with a bunch of other things. And if you read the whole Samyutta and kind of take it in as a whole, you realize, oh, when the Buddha taught about feeling tone, these were the other little threads that it connected to. And then if you read several of them, you start getting this really beautiful interconnected, you know, multifaceted view of how the teachings all fit together. And for certain stages of practice, that is actually just what a person needs in order to go farther on the path. And then maybe I'll just piggyback a little bit on what Kim said. I don't wanna take too much time. And maybe I'll say for those of you who don't know, the Samyutta, many of the suttas are one paragraph. That's it. The Maja Ma often has a narrative arc. Somebody had a question, they went to the Buddha, they said this, the Buddha responded, and, you know, and there's some back and forth. So there are very different tones, but maybe to build on what Kim said about the Vedana, Samyutta Vedana meaning feeling tone, there's a story in the Digha in the Caya, the long discourses where Vedana is tied to dependent arising, conditioned arising, and then it gets tied to, is people fall into quarrels and fight because what starts with Vedana. So it puts it into a bigger context, how as practitioners we might apply to our daily lives. This is why sometimes if you don't really know Vedana, well, I don't know, they're just two different ways to deal with it, I'll say. Are there any cautionary notes about, because it is so decontextualized, right? You know, is there any good way to read those suttas or advised way to take them in, I don't know, beyond what's been said, I'm just curious, given that a lot of times we talk about the historical, contextual sort of elements that are generating the responses and this one doesn't seem to include that. Maybe I'll say that in my exploring these different texts, middle length and the connected discourses, they're not exactly the same as much as I would expect them to be. So what's in the Majjhma isn't exactly what's in the Samyutta just fleshed out, there's like a different little bit of a tone. And then maybe also if you're thinking about the Samyutta, a little bit of what Kim pointed out is a tremendous amount of kind of repetition and patterns. And you see patterns, like not only within Vedana, but the Vedana in particular, it sets a pattern for the subsequent connected discourses, they all have the same, you just, trends just insert one different word. So it's a different feeling. Yeah. I just say this and then pass it on to David for helping us navigating. I worked for a long time professionally as a data scientist. And one of the things that we realized that for certain people, when navigating a large body of information, sort of this way of categorizing tech clouds are really helpful for our mind. It's so orient towards this whole set. But that I recognize, not all people's mind work this way. And so maybe it's a self discovery process as well in terms of how we connected this and yeah. So to David. Thank you. Thank you everyone for those great questions and colleagues for such good answers. For the next, we have about roughly half an hour to do some like looking around, kicking tires, finding things, and some questions and answers. And I wanna move at a pace that will sort of not be confounding because really what we want to do with all of this is provide easy access or sort of, I think we said at one point, open a door and provide also a guiding hand. So I don't wanna go so fast that it's more confusing than useful. But yeah, what do we do if we're curious and we wanna learn more or we wanna go to a specific SUTA. Somebody's mentioned, for example, the Satipatthana SUTA or somebody who appears more knowledgeable than us says MN10 or makes a reference to the Samyutta Nakhaya and its structure. And I might add, I think there's sort of a master plan to the Samyutta Nakhaya that emerges as you work through it. It's a text in which as a whole, there's a sort of nuance that Bill talked about that in some ways is missing maybe in some of the other collections. At any rate, what if you wanted to explore the Samyutta Nakhaya having heard these words from Diana and Kim? So here's some ideas on how to begin. And I was probably asked to do this because I'm the least adept of the four of us, frankly. And so I'm more maybe like you in average. I just bump around and try to find things. I don't frequently know where I'm going. So here's some basic guideposts. And those who have worked with me previously know, I love to share Zoom. I love to share screen in Zoom, I should say. And I'm really gonna get a chance to get into that here. I'm gonna share a lot of screen and hopefully it'll all work. The first thing to sort of bring attention to is some of the ways that abbreviations are used. And we've heard it already. Somebody will say the Majima or they'll say the Majima Nakhaya, or they'll say M-N. And or they'll say the middle length discourses. And it's just useful to know what people are referring to. There are just to make our lives complicated a couple of different systems by which we refer to them. And yet they've sort of fallen into a pattern. People talk, I'm just gonna, because we've mentioned the Majima and the Samyuta, people talk about the middle length discourses and you'll find that that is most typically abbreviated as M-N for Majima Nakhaya. For Majima Nakhaya or S-N for Samyuta Nakhaya. In an older and still much used system, these are simplified further so that D, and there's no reason to keep repeating the N for the four major collections, of course. So you'll see sometimes just D used for D-ga Nakhaya or M for Majima, S for Samyuta, et cetera. To make it, again, to keep our lives interesting, you'll find that within each collection, there's different ways of organizing the references. And I'm gonna move my navigating tools out of the way so I can keep highlighting. For example, you'll see things like D-ga Nakhaya, D-N 5.2. And yet in the alternate system, you'll frequently see something that just shows the name of the collection, in this case, Majima, the volume it's in, and the page. And this is a reference to the Pali language text produced by the Pali Text Society, 57 volumes. And in some ways, this gives you a more accurate reference because it goes to a page number in some cases. And you can find, let me think how to proceed. I'm gonna go in this order. By the way, this handy reference created, I think, by Kim, will be shared with you in some form. These things we will pass along to you should they be useful to you in finding things. There are, fortunately for us, handy references out there on the internet where people have provided, I always say concordance. I don't even know exactly what a concordance is. But these look something like this. Where if you see a reference to something like DN 147, or let me go down to the Majima, since we talked about it a lot, we talked about the Satipatanasuta. If you see a reference. I can't see anything, David. Yeah, we're not seeing your screen. All right. How's that? Better? Yes. Don't know why that didn't work, but my love is still there for sharing screen. We've made reference many times to Satipatanasuta. And yet, if you see a reference to Majima Nikaya 10, you might know where you are. If you see a reference over here to MN 1, page 55, the first volume of the Pali language version of the Majima Nikaya page 55, you might know where you are, not know where you are. With this handy reference tool, you can see the Dr. Satipatthana Sutta. And yet, if you see a reference to Maja Minakaya 10, you might know where you are. If you see a reference over here to MN1, page 55, the first volume of the Pali language version of the Maja Minakaya page 55, you might know where you are, not know where you are. With this handy reference tool, you can see the correspondence. And in this case, and we'll again provide you this link, you can go to a Pali or an English version of the text. If you hang around with Kim, Ying, Diana, myself for any period of time, you will see us flash these volumes in front of the screen. These are the bikubodi translations of the Nakayas. In the case of the Maja Minakaya, it's bikubodi and bikunya, Moli's translation. In the case of the Diga, it's Maurice Walsh's translation, all published by Wisdom. And these have a very handy feature, which is that in them, and again, I'm going to share screen. So this is the, just for reference, if I can find it. Make sure you can see this. This is the title page of the, thank you, I'd appreciate that thumbs up, Diana. Yeah, that's useful. So this is the Maja Minakaya. And within it, because we've been talking about the Satipatanasuta, let me see if I can find it. You'll find that bikubodi does this very handy thing, thanks for the thumbs up, where he provides his way of organizing the text. So we might make a reference to Maja Minakaya 10, the Satipatanasuta. Let me see if I can just give me one second. I'm gonna get a big arrow here. You'll notice that up here in the top, he also gives the Poly Text Society's edition, Maja Minakaya, Poly Text Society, Volume 1, page 59. In addition, and it's a wonderful thing if these volumes can be made yours, because they include, in addition to bikubodi's amazing scholarship, very detailed footnotes. And I just want to give you an example here. This is, I'm afraid, my marked up copy in which you can see my thumb this morning. But the notes to the Satipatanasuta include very detailed things, frequently making reference to the commentaries, but also to bikubodi's word choices, competing word choices, and the like. And for example, here, I'm just noticing, I'm not even going to try to draw a box around it. But he mentions, for example, this idea that the four Satipatanas may be understood as four ways of setting up mindfulness, right? Or four objective domains of mindfulness. So I just want to say that the bikubodi volumes, the wisdom volumes, are marvelous resources, and in and of themselves provide a really great introduction to the text. Among them, I wasn't going to mention this, but there's a volume called In the Buddha's Words, which collects together bikubodi scholarship, wonderful introduction, and selections from all of the Nikayas that he's translated. And that can be a really wonderful way to get into things thematically. It includes most of or many of the classic texts to which people refer constantly. So in the Buddha's words, which I'm sure we can provide as a reference to people. Just checking the time. So the next thing to do is to show you a little bit about Suta Central. We highly recommend looking for texts in Suta Central because it's come to be a wonderful repository of online resources related to the Pali Canon. And there's a couple ways to get there. And again, let me share a screen. If I can. Yeah, tell me if, and can you see the Suta Central site now? Okay, good. So I'm going to use the Satipatanasuta as an example, because we talked about it, but you might find, okay, people keep talking about the Satipasanasuta, they go on and on about it, or they talk about establishing mindfulness or the four foundations of mindfulness, right? And you want to be able to try to find this text. And I want to, I guess, start at the top and tell you that the search function in Suta Central is of limited power. You must spell things correctly, put them in the order it wants it in. It's kind of a older fashioned search engine. One of the quickest ways, and tell me if you can see this new tab coming up, everybody got it? Yeah, so I can go in here, and I can misspell, this is just a Google search, I can misspell it. I can probably misspell it much worse than that. I could say Satipatan, I just hear people talking about this. Okay, I don't know how bad I can get off. Now that was too far out for even good old Google. Okay, Satipatanasuta, point being, this provides a way to search that allows you to make mistakes. You've heard the term, you don't know what it means, or you don't know how to spell it, I should say. And if you scroll down for a while, you will find the Suta Central version of this and entry into it. We would, I think, recommend doing this rather than going to any of the other things that pop up, although, as we'll point out, there are some good ones here, access to insight. The Suta Central is a very good place to begin. And this is what, again, if Diane will give me a thumbs up, the homepage looks like. Suta Central is a wonderful resource. Occasionally it freezes, and I'm just telling you in advance, it may happen even right now. And there are ways to save yourself. If it happens, I'll show you what I found out. And again, I'm going to move kind of quickly now, but hopefully not too quickly. So there are several ways to find something like the Satipatthana Sutta in here. If you want to go straight to the Nikayas, you can push on the basket of discourses, right? The Sutta-Tipitika, or yeah, the Tipitika, the Sutta-Pitika, I should say. And you may know that it's in the middle length discourses. Further, you may know that it's in the first 50, because it's number 10. And you can scroll down and find Majima Nikaya or MN10. Here it comes. Look away if you have motion sickness. When you get here, you'll find this amazing thing, which is that it's here in several translations. It's here in 26 other modern languages. There are 13 parallel text. You can go very deep in this. And here is the root text from which these are translated. I'm just going to pick this Bhikkhu Sujata translation, and particularly because I want to show you a couple of features that come up with the Bhikkhu Sujata translation. It'll probably first appear like this. And you can, though, by going up here to views, ask to see it side by side with the Pali. And just for reference, these are the early phrases we heard chanted at the end of last class. This is the Satipatthana Sutta that we saw chanted. And I'm going to show you one further feature here, which is that if you click on a word, I'm just clicking on Vedana or a version of Vedana because Kim mentioned it, you can find, oh, Kim used this word Vedana. She didn't define it. And in this version, it allows you to select terms and see their definitions, which is super handy. This is true for most words. If you can't find it, like, there goes my coffee. For example, this word, this is here too. Sometimes a longer compound word won't be defined. And okay, so probably enough about this. Let me see. The other thing I wanted to just point to was this. Say you don't know, you know, you want to explore more than you want to go to a specific text. You can go down further. And there are wonderful things here in Sutta Central, where to begin, what's here, how the Pali, you know, much what we're doing here. This could be a refresher course, or we could have just pointed people here instead of having a two-day class. But this is so fun. At the bottom of this, there's two resources that I find really useful. Indexes, this is a useful thing, the Reader's Guide to Pali, to the Pali Sutta, but the indexes are marvelous. There are indexes to subjects, similes, names, and terminology. And for example, subject to subject, you go, well, this is all about mindfulness. I'm literally making this up as we go. I hope it works. Mindfulness should be in here somewhere, right? Key teaching. And as you'll see, there's other things here. Metta, well, yeah, heard of Metta. What is that about? Maybe I would benefit. Mindfulness, it says, oh, see Sati. Oh, yeah, I've heard this word Sati. And then we get to the Sati Patanasutta. And here's another way back to Majjhima Nikaya 10. So I did need to know it was Majjhima 10, or anything about where it is. If I click here, I go right to the Sutta and it's translations. So I don't have to go through Metta like this courses and know where I am. If you've heard, I'll get it just names. I mentioned the other day, and the Ying made reference to it, the awakening poem of a character named Anguli Mala. Right. And you could go, wow, yeah, Anguli Mala. I don't even know if it's here, friends. Let's just see. It's got to be, right. I'm hoping taking a deep breath. Anguli, come on. There he is, Anguli Mala. And I made a reference not to the discourse. I hear Dayan's applause, even though it's silent. Thank you. But here's the here's the verses that I chose to read from from the from the Tati Gattas. And I don't know if I use this translation, but somewhere in here. Yep, here are the phrases I used. And I've made my own little changes to get the gender straight. I said a practitioner who was once heedless, but turned to heedfulness lights up the world, like the moon freed from a cloud. So I want to end in just a moment. And I think I would do that by saying, we have found over time that there are other reliable sources out there. We don't want to, you know, we're not getting paid anything by Suta Central. In fact, they need all of our support. And there's, I think, a donate button somewhere. But there are other good sources out there. And we will help you by providing a list of them. But Suta Central and this ability to find your way by the index, I didn't, I didn't, because I ran out of time, click the one that said similes. But if you've heard of a famous simile, the simile of the raft, the simile of the arrows, right, two arrows, first arrow and all those additional second arrows, you can go to that index of similes and choose arrow or raft or snake, and find your way to the Suta that in which those similes are featured, which is another way to kind of look through it. At any rate, I hope that is useful. As a way of introduction, we've I've left about 10 minutes for questions, maybe specifically about navigation. And if anything really tricky comes up, I'm going to pass it over to Kim, Diana and Ying. But that's how I find my way through. And partially, I wanted to give you a sense of, yeah, you can just find your way around. And you don't have to know anything about it. And as Ying pointed to, this is part of a practice. So if you find yourself thinking, I don't know anything, or I really need to know this, or, you know, everybody else seems to know a lot, and I don't know very much, or I really need to master this material, those can all be ways of bringing this exploration into your practice. As we notice how we engage with texts, how we engage with the internet, how we engage with search engines, there's a very direct way to bring it into practice when you notice any sense of inadequacy, or any sense of, on the other hand, pride and how you can go straight to Majin Nakayatin faster than David. I'm just showing you this is how the lay practitioner does it. Okay, questions, thoughts? I see Alex and Randy have hands up. Alex. Okay, so when you were talking about the references that exist in Biku Bodhi's translation of the Nikayas, I was wondering one thing, and that is I have the audio books, so I can listen to them, which is great for being when I'm at work and everything, but, you know, I'm just wondering, would it be useful for me to have the actual text, the books, for that particular reason? I think I would say yes. My way of reading these books, and I think it's true of people who read them, is with two bookmarks for the suttya reading and the notes. It's a whole, I mean the notes are probably actually, you know, the notes are about 500 pages, so the notes are very detailed and super, super useful for practice. Some of them are very much inside baseball, but most of them are very, very useful for understanding the teachings and applying them to practice. So yeah, highly recommend these books if you can get your hands on them. Maybe I'll just a little bit kind of flesh out what we find in the notes, both just exactly what David pointed out, but also earlier we were, Bill asked this question, is it the Pali Canon or the commentaries, or what is it that IMC relates to? And in the notes, Biku Bodhi will often say, well here's what's in the suttas, and here's what's in the commentaries that are like about 800 years after the suttas, after the time of the Buddha. Here's what they had to say, which is often different or sometimes really flushes things out, and also Biku Bodhi will say, yeah this is like maybe like a, just a reference to something, go look at this other sutta that flushes it out, and then I'll say the fourth thing that we find in the notes is it turns out that the Pali Canon that's preserved in the Burmese tradition is sometimes a little bit different, that's what's in the Thai tradition, which is a little bit different, which in the Sri Lanka tradition, and sometimes they're just typos, but Biku Bodhi fleshes that out too. That's probably a lot easier to navigate through the books, and just whether you have the audiobook, you're kind of, it's much more difficult to do that. All right, thanks. Thank you for the question. I was just looking through the chat briefly to see what's come up there. Randy? Oh, unmute please, Randy. Sorry, I have a technical question. If you use Judeo-Christian analysis of the Bible, the Old and New Testaments, on something like Bible Hub, there is a tab that's called Interlinear that will tell you the translation of every term that is used in the text. So I'm wondering if that exists for the Pali Canon, or whether you just have to, as you were showing in Suta Central, click on the Pali word, and then it comes up with definitions. Yeah, am I unmuted? Where am I? Yeah, I only know part of the answer to that question. I think it is incomplete at present. I think a lot of these studies are still in their infancy compared to the studies, the kind of body of work and scholarship you refer to, and yet there are some that show you and you can go word by word, but it doesn't make for a complete collection. And what's available at Suta Central is really, I think, becoming sort of the most comprehensive sort of view we have of that kind of thing. Kim, you unmuted. Do you have additional thought there? Oh, did I? Okay, yeah. I just wanted to say not on Suta Central and not complete, and I'll give a reference to this later when we talk about Pali, but this book by Bekubodi, reading the Buddhist Discourses in Pali, includes a sort of a triple reading. He'll say the Pali, and then he has a word for word definition translation of it, which sounds very strange in English because the word order is different and so forth. And then he gives a natural English translation after that. So if you're really wanting to, and of course there's only a few select sutas in here, but this is starting to become available through this new book, which was published last year. Maybe I'll just add, Suta Central is fantastic, and it only kind of came into existence with this kind of fullness, maybe in the past three years, two years. So it's really new. We're like, you know, Buddhist studies, Pali Canon studies are just in their infancy in this way. So I think we have time for the two remaining questions. We'll see because we want to, at 9.15, move to another aspect of the study, but Carlota, we'll see if we can get quick answers. This is going to be a quick answer because it's just a reflection of how ignorant I am on the topic. So David, you mentioned something about the snake and the rat, and I didn't understand that part. Yeah, yeah. So real quickly, let me see here if it's still, I think I can do this quickly. Yeah, if you go here to the simile subject, you could choose, for example, I'm just going to go to R for raft. And it will tell you the suit is in which this famous simile or metaphor is used. And we taught a class in the spring where we focused on it in Majima Nakaia 22. So that's what I was referring to. And we use the word simile, but metaphor is maybe a more helpful word. Yeah, thanks. Appreciate it. That was easily resolved. And Lori, this is very quick. You guys have mentioned the in the Buddha's words a couple of times and and the value of reading all the footnotes. I also wanted to mention that Biku Bodhi's introductions to each of these volumes are brilliant. And they're like a course in themselves. And I would not skip over the introductions. I'm so glad you said that, because I probably did skip over them. But yeah, I mean, I think somebody shared last time one of my esteemed colleagues that they received their book, I think Diana held it up and said I got this from Kim, you some of you know, I received this from a close shared Dharma friend from all of us just arrived from Amazon one day, I was like, what? And, you know, the first thing I read was the introduction, and it was pretty much life changing. I mean, it provided a way to seat a long established meditation practice in the Buddha Dharma gave it a purpose in a sense. And so the introductions alone are just, you know, worth the worth the worth the price of entry. And each volume has a different introduction, they introduce the volume, and they also are sort of consecutive, they in a way make improvements on the previous introductions, they have to read them all. So even in probably what is everybody's least favorite, Nikaya, the Anguttara Nikaya, the one that goes by number, even that introduction is wonderful. And it's quite recent. So yes, thank you, Laurie. And now, right on time to Diana. Thank you, David. Wow. I feel excited. Like, well, I want to go click on Suta Central and check this out. But maybe we should have like the next time we teach this, let's have this Suta Central, like right before a break or something like this. So let's just take a breath for a moment and kind of arrive here, we're going to shift gears, we're going to shift pace. And so here we talked, David talked about how to find Suta's. I'm going to say a little bit about how do we, once you found them, how do you engage with them? How do you make them part of practice? How do they enrich your life and come alive or not? So I'll say a few words first. And that the obvious way we can engage with who does is like, I don't like that one. I do like this one. That's perfectly natural. It's a human experience. We have preferences. But I would like to suggest that we are shortchanging ourselves. If we just leave with this, I like it, I don't like it. But instead to engage with them in a way that, okay, what can be here? What might be helpful? And so I'll say that often when we don't like things, we tend to be dismissive. But it might be that we learn the most or what's most helpful from what we don't like, because that's pointing to, well, what underlying beliefs do we have? That maybe this, we don't like it because it's not congruent with what we think the Buddha Dharma should be about or how we think the Buddha should be or the tone of the teachings or something like this. Or we might, if we don't like it, we might also just notice that we have some tender spots in our life and our understanding of the Buddha or something like this. So instead, what we might do is ask ourselves kind of this question, well, how does this fit in with what I already know? Maybe, maybe it's just a different phrasing, a different angle into something we already know, like, oh, this is like the Four Noble Truths. It's pointing towards clinging and suffering. So maybe it just fleshes out something we already know, but using different language, different examples, maybe similes. So how does it fit in with what I already know? How does it fit in with my experience? Like, I really don't know what they're pointing to here. Maybe other people have this experience. I haven't had this experience yet. Or maybe, oh yeah, I do see things differently after I've been meditating. Or things often see more clearly, or even when there's a settling of the mind. And maybe I haven't seen this, but maybe there's some more settling of the mind that's possible. So how does it fit in? What is supportive about this? We might, and maybe some of these passages are pointing to things that we haven't considered before. Like, generosity is really foundational to Buddhist practice. It tends not to get as much talk. And when we hear just Dharma talks, partly because Dharma teachers feel maybe a little bit hesitant to talk about generosity when we're built on, most often, very often, built on the generosity system, Jhana for people, then a kind of Dharma teachers sometimes feel awkward talking about generosity. But when we read the suttas, we start to see, oh, generosity is showing up all over the place as a foundational practice. So what is supportive? Maybe it's pointing towards something we hadn't really seen, or maybe our Dharma teachers that we hear about don't talk to, talk about as much. Another example is Jhana, somebody's meditative experiences. Dharma teachers don't usually talk about that in Dharma talks. They might on retreat. But so there's a little bit difference. And maybe for us to ask, what is challenging about this practice? Maybe I'll just say a few words here. The suttas are androcentric, that for the most part, they're preserved by men, and are addressed to men. And for the most part, there's masculine pronouns. So Dharma teachers are often kind of changing it to make it more gender neutral. We'll also say that earliest texts that are attributed to women are in this collection. They are beautiful. It's amazing. It's women talking about the difficulties of child or the difficulties of being a wife, the difficulties of when your child dies. So some of these uniquely feminine aspects of life are also in there. As well as the Buddha just flat out says, of course women can become perfectly awakened. So there isn't a sense that women aren't capable. It's just the nature of these texts being preserved that we have today have been preserved by men. So maybe we find something challenging in it. Maybe it's something like this. Or maybe there's a tone that we don't like that feels not quite our understanding. One last thing I'll say about this, and then I'm going to share some passages is to recognize that translation is an art. It's also an interpretation. How can it not be, especially with Pali, which has such a different syntax, the way the grammar is, and also the grammar is, and I'll point to this a little bit, is so different than how English is. So how to interpret it, how to understand it, it's impossible for the translator's hand, so to speak, to not kind of show through. And we can see this when if you were to read a whole bunch of translations by one translator, and then you read the exact same a whole bunch by a different translator, you walk away with a little bit different feel. Like, oh, one translator tends to emphasize kind of maybe effort making, and maybe another translator types to emphasize the importance of understanding clearly. You know, something like these are subtle things that often you can't tell until you read a whole bunch from one translator versus another. Okay, so with that, I would like to suggest that we just take a moment and maybe get settled and close our eyes. And I'm going to read this one verse by three different translators. And we'll feel our way into it. And maybe this idea of getting getting beyond what I like, what I don't like, that's maybe our first stance. But to get beyond that, how does it fit in with what I already know? What is supportive about this passage? What is challenging about it? Okay, and I will share my screen after this. So first, I want it to just to be how we hear it. And then we'll do how then we'll talk a little bit more about the specific words. Okay, so take just a moment to get settled. Maybe feeling connected to the chair or cushion or whatever it is we're sitting on. In a few breaths. Here's the first translation. For meditation springs wisdom. Without meditation, wisdom ends. Knowing these two paths to progress and decline. You should conduct yourself so that wisdom grows. Here's a second translation. From striving comes wisdom. From not, with wisdom's end. Knowing these two courses, to development and decline. Conduct yourself so that wisdom will grow. Here's a third translation. Wisdom arises from spiritual practice. Without practice, it decays. Knowing this two way path for gain and loss. Conduct yourself so that wisdom grows. Okay, so now I'm going to share my screen so that we can look at it. And I'll say just a few words about this. So this is from Dhammapada 282. David, can you give me a thumbs up that whether you can see this? Yeah, great, thank you. So translator A is saying from meditation springs wisdom. Translator B from striving comes wisdom. Translator C, wisdom arises from spiritual practice. Here's the Pali. We have this word yoga. When there's a long A is a. As opposed to a short A is a. So yoga. What's interesting, so how they chose to translate this word, and you'll see in the next line is a yoga. So it's just the negative of whatever yoga was. We don't use this so much in English. I mean we do, but not as much as we see it in Pali. So here they're saying from meditation without meditation. They're using a word without and from striving from not maybe. But also something else we see this here. So however you translate this translator says progress and then V, they're saying decline. Here they're saying development and decline. Translator C is doing gain and loss. So you know how they choose to do it. Maybe one last thing I'll point out here. This word burry is being translated as wisdom. We also see burry here in this compound word burry. And then we see it again down here. Sometimes it's tricky to figure out these compound words, the relationship between the two words. This is like the bane of all the translators. It's like how do we work with these compound words? What's the relationship between them? Is this a list of two things? Is it the Sanchayo of the burry? Is the Sanchayo after the burry? You have to figure these out. So maybe I'll reveal now who these translators are. Translator A is Sujakta. Translator B is Tanissaro. And translator C is Fransdal. These are three translators alive today, actively translating today. And they just have a little bit different feeling. We can send this out to you guys as a handout so you don't have to take notes of this. But I just wanted to point out that the translators themselves, of course, have a little bit of a... Not a little bit, they have a lot of influence. And the Dhammapada, which is a book that's inside the Kudaka Nakhaya, just the fifth book. That is the most translated of any Buddhist text. There's maybe 30 different, I don't know, 20, 30 different translations. So if you wanted to, you could drive yourself a little crazy and compare them all. So I took a little more time than I was expecting. I wanted to be able to take a break. But does somebody have a comment or a question? Yes, Fred. Yeah, I find comparing different translations and different translators to flush out and fill out the meanings in such a wonderful way. It's just not there when you read one translator. So I just wanted to say how valuable that's been for me. Yeah, yeah. And maybe I'll insert, David went through Sujakta Central with us. That has all of Bhikkhu Sujakta's translations. It has a few of Bhikkhu Bodhi's translations. So you need to have the book for Bhikkhu Bodhi's translations. And Tanisaro Bhikkhu, his some, very few of them are in Sujakta Central. You have to go to another website to get those. So maybe someday Sujakta Central will have everybody's translations in one place. But just a heads up about that. Different translators are in different places. Do any of my co-teachers have something they'd like to say? Okay, so Marianne. So I think it was it was a good, very helpful to hear that not to trigger off a word like, for example, striving in the second one would have maybe turned me off a little bit, but to just look for what well, what does that mean and not let the translation really take the meaning away. And then I have a really super uninformed question is what are what are the commentaries that were being referred to? Yeah, thank you. I'll just say briefly, these were composed about 800 years after the time of the Buddha. And there's two types of commentaries. There's like a commentary specifically for the Maja Menaka'a where it goes through every single word and this really dry way and defines it. That has not been translated into English. So the commentary to each of the four Naka'as, the Samyutta, then Gudara, the Diga, Maja Menaka. Huge books, not translated into English yet. And then there's a different type of commentary, which is more like a treatise of how to practice, and that is the Vasudimaga, which means path of purification that has been translated into English. And that's really available on the web. And that is attributed to Buddhaghosha and it's how to practice. But there's a lot in the Vasudimaga that is not in the suttas. There's a lot. And so that's why there's some kind of threads, lineages of Buddhism that tend to be a little bit, we're going to focus more on the Pali Canon, and then there's some that tend to focus more on the Vasudimaga that is about 800 years later, say well, there are some real strengths there or something like this. So thank you. That's an excellent question, Marianne, actually. Can we take the briefest of breaks maybe just standing up and stretching and come back in about three minutes. Until then.
