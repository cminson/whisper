Welcome dear Sangha. How's the sound? Okay I'm taking that to mean it's good. So my dog is
also deciding that this is a good time to make sound. So let's hope that it stays
to a minimal. It doesn't interrupt too much. So here we are in our retreat
together from all over Puerto Rico, Brazil, all over the United States and a lot
of us here in California. How amazing it is that we can bring our practice
together. And the Buddha and the teachings the Buddha went to many
different places and told stories. The Buddha was an amazing storyteller when
you read through the sutras, all of the parables and the similes that bring the
teaching to life. And when the Buddha offers us these stories we begin to see
the fabric of who it was that was practicing. Sometimes the Buddha was
talking to kings and sometimes the Buddha was talking to cowherds, courtesans,
acrobats, musicians, charioteers, merchants, potters, and then of course there
were all sorts of stories about animals. And so we can see through the richness of
the Buddha's teachings the vibrancy of the who and he lived. And I think one of
the powerful things about stories is how they can touch and inspire us and move
us to connect deeply not only with our own stories but others as well. And so we
can see how we are similar and then that which is universal. And so as
we practice we often touch into our own stories. They arise in our practice and
tonight we'll speak to wise reflection. How is it that we can reflect and bring
these stories and our own personal experiences into our practice? How we
can practice with them as we have this inner knowing of our own hearts and minds
which is essential. Many of you know that I taught elementary school for many
years and my mother was also a kindergarten teacher so I was raised on
lots of stories. So I love stories and you know because I was raised pre-internet
books were actually the way that I learned about the world and you know I
went to the library every week and got new books and I love the stories that
told about kids in different countries because it helped me know that there was
a world outside of my world. And this is one of my favorite quotes about the
power of stories. James Baldwin says you think your pain and your heartbreak are
unprecedented in the history of the world but then you read. It was books that
taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that
connected me with all the people who are alive and who had ever been alive. That
way that our individual stories can connect with these more universal
stories and that the depth of those stories can bring our aliveness. And I
think that perhaps we can say you know you think your pain and your heartbreak
are unprecedented but then you practice but then you practice this and you
realize what it means to be human. This condition of suffering for people who
are alive. So tonight I want to share a story from the suttas. This is from the
Majjhima Nakayas and it's a sutta of an exchange between the Buddha and
Venerable Rahula. And many of you may know that Venerable Rahula was the
Buddha's son. And so this was sutta was told to Rahula when he was about seven
years old shortly after joining the monastic order. And so in the commentaries
it says that this the Buddha offered this story to Rahula because Rahula was
careless with his speech. So what it said is that when the Buddha was present
and someone came to ask Rahula and said is the Buddha here? The Rahula answered
mischievously. No he's not here. I mean that happened to you when you were the
kid when you're standing right next to them they're like no he's not they're
not there. And then when the Buddha was absent and someone asked Rahula is the
Buddha here? The Rahula answered mischievously. The Buddha is here. So
here's the Buddha. Rahula is a new monastic also his son and the Buddha is
going to offer instructions to Rahula. And so I find these instructions to be
very telling and very tender and very kind. So the sutta starts off as so
many others have and once again for those of you who are interested this is
Majumannakaya 61. Thus have I heard at one time the Buddha was staying near
Rajagaha in the bamboo grove the squirrels feeding ground. Then late in the
afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to see venerable Rahula. Rahula
saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. He spread out a seed and
placed water for washing the feet. This is very similar how so many of the
stories start right? And then the Buddha begins to expound on the importance of
ethics. I really love this because the Buddha doesn't just go like you should
this that. The Buddha takes the pot that had been used for the washing the water
and there's a little bit of water in it and the Buddha says to Rahula, do you
see this little bit of water left in the pot? Rahula says yes and the
Buddha says that's how little of the practitioner's nature is left in those
who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie. And he continues to go on using
this pot to illustrate ethics. And then at the end he turns the pot upside down
and the Buddha says do you see how this pot is turned upside down? And the Buddha
says that's how the practitioner's nature is turned upside down in those who are
not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie. And so to me this is so illustrative of how
useful it is to have specific examples. How discombobulated one can feel when one
has said something that's untrue. And so I love this story the beginning of the
story we're going to continue with it because the Buddha models so clearly
the impact of telling a lie like what it means like you feel turns upside down or
you feel empty. And he also does it in such a way that it's tender and
compassionate not judgmental. So the Buddha begins this encounter with Rahula
by reminding Rahula the importance of integrity of Sela of ethics. And for all
of us the first day when we came on retreat we we focused on Sela. We
focused on ethics. We focused on the importance of having that foundation to
what we're doing. That this is a whole-hearted practice that we align
ourselves with integrity by taking the precepts that were offered by Mary
Grace. And really taking them into our heart. It's not to be taken lightly. It's
really such a precious community where we are all leaning towards each other
with this intention towards non-harming.
For so many of us, we've had experiences with humans that have been harmful. And so
to be in a community where we are all turning and aligning ourselves to trying
to practice non-harming can really help to disrupt the climates of distrust and
fear that we may have accumulated through our lifetime. And as we offer this gift
to ourselves and other of non-harming, we can begin to allow an opening and
letting go into the container and the freedom that comes from holding the
precepts. A teacher who you may know, Tennisara, who is a Western Buddhist
teacher who ordained with Ajahn Chah, she speaks the importance of each of us
holding Sela ethics, integrity. She says, an inner ethic maintains values that
are deeply resonant with the interconnectedness of everything. An
appreciation of causality and a sense of care for the whole web of life. An
inner ethic needs to be guided by wise reflection, enabling the negotiation of
complexity, including the many gray areas of daily life. So I really like how she
points to integrity and Sela is tied into this interconnectedness of
everything. And when we offered the precepts, Mary Grace pointed this out,
that we are offering them for ourselves and for the community. And yet even with
those precepts, there's this need for wise reflection to negotiate the
complexity of what it means to uphold those precepts. And even for us in this
retreat where we have pared down our activity, there still is daily life
creeping in, especially since we're many of us are in our homes negotiating
housemates and other people who we live with and other things that may be
happening in the home. And so these are the gray areas that arise that this wise
reflection, the tenacera points to is so essential to how do we engage. And so I
want to focus tonight on this aspect of wise reflection, which forms the framework
for the rest of the Suta. And that's the main focus that I'll be talking about.
And wise reflection, once we have established as we have for the past
few days of our continuity of practice and gathering our mindfulness and we
begin to settle in, we can bring in this area of wise reflection to work with
what's arising in our practice. And so we can think about the context that we're
in and what's arising, what are the patterns that we see. And so when we go
back to the Suta, we can realize and we look at Rahula, you know, we think he's
seven years old. And so that's one of the reasons why I love these instructions
because I'm like, okay, great, this might be good for me. Let me start at the
beginning. This is instructions for Rahula who's seven. There we go. All right.
And he was new to being in community. And he was learning. And sometimes I think
as an adult, I think, oh, I'm done. I've got this, you know, I'm not learning. And
yet, you know, don't we know that we are all learning. And so in this Suta, I love
how the Buddha, you know, doesn't start the conversation off with Rahula by
criticizing him and judging him. He shares like very concrete, specific examples
and then invites Rahula into this process of learning. Really recognizing that
mistakes are part of the path. Mistakes are part of the path. They're not like,
oops, let me get back over here. They are the path. There's a wonderful talk by
Pema Children about, and this is the title of her talk, if you look for it,
fail, fail, fail better. And so let me just share a little bit. If the whole talk
is fabulous. And let me just share a little bit of her talk. She says, if
there is one skill that is not stressed very much, but is really needed, it is
knowing how to fail well. The fine art of failing. There's a lot of emphasis on
succeeding. And whether we buy the hype or not, we all want to succeed.
Especially if you consider success as it works out the way I want it to. So failing
by that definition is that it didn't work out the way you wanted it to. And
failing is what we don't usually get a lot of preparation for. So she says, fail,
fail again, fail better. It's like how to get good at holding the rawness of
vulnerability in your heart. Or how to get good at welcoming the unwelcome. Let
me repeat that part. So fail, fail again, fail better. It's like how to get good at
holding the rawness of vulnerability in your heart. Or how to get good at
welcoming the unwelcome. And she continues, can you allow yourself to feel
what you feel when things don't go the way you want them to. When things don't
go the way you hoped and wished for and longed for them to go.
And even on our retreats, sometimes we expect, we have a certain expectation for
the trajectory of the retreat. And generally, those expectations include, you
know, something that's pleasant and going well. And how she says, it works out the
way I want it to. Maybe that calm abiding that we don't have in our daily
life. And can we welcome the unwelcome? Can we allow ourselves to feel what is
happening when things don't go the way we want them to. So this is part of our
practice of mindfulness is a part of welcoming. It's really this invitation to
welcome ourselves, all of ourselves. And I love how the word attention has the
word tend in it. And so I think of this practice of mindfulness of coming back
of tending like a garden like Mary Grace was talking about all these seeds that
we're planting. So can we rather than think of ourselves at this super highway
going somewhere, but like a garden that we're tending, sometimes raw and
vulnerable, falling and failing and experiencing things we weren't anticipating
over and over again, all these seasons of our lives, practicing with the way
things are, rather than trying to control and make things the way we want them to
be. So this sounds all well and good. And so in the Buddha's instructions to
Rahula, the Buddha actually gives specifics about how do we do this wise
reflection? How do we tend? How do we attend to this mindfulness, this way of
bringing about how we orient our lives? And so the first thing the Buddha brings
up and says to Rahula, what is the purpose of a mirror? And imagine maybe
the Buddha had a mirror there, I'm not sure, but and that Rahula says it's for
the purpose of reflection. And then the Buddha says, so too, Rahula, an action
with the body should be done after repeated reflection, an action of speech
should be done after repeated reflection, an action of the mind should be done
after repeated reflection. So then the Sutta speaks to reflection and
reflections on the actions of the body, actions of the speech and actions in the
mind. And these are the guidelines that the Buddha offers. And so this is
starts off with before, during and after. And so we're going to go through some of
it, we might not get through the before, during and after, but each one of these
reflections can happen before, during or after. So at any point, just like when
we're giving instructions at any point that you wake up, you can reflect. So
starting off with the body, the Buddha says, when you want to act with the body,
you should reflect. Does this act with the body that I want to do lead to harming
myself, harming others, or harming both? So there's self, others and both. So in
each action, we're making this reflection. Is it unskillful with suffering as its
outcome and result? If while reflecting in this way, you know, this act with the
body that I want to do leads to harming myself, harming others or harming both.
It's unskillful with suffering as its outcome. To the best of your ability,
Rahula, you should not do such a deed. But if while reflecting in this way, you
know, this act with the body that I want to do doesn't lead to harming myself,
harming others or harming both, it's skillful with happiness as its outcome and
result. Then Rahula, you should do such a deed. So I just want to look a little bit
more deeply at this passage here to see what's being said. And first, let's
consider the word reflection. And I love the word reflection because the image of
a mirror is just reflecting what is there. Not saying, compare yourself to the
person next to you or compare yourself to this norm of what should be happening.
Not judging, not valuing, a reflection to the best of our ability. We try to see
what is here with, you know, interest, but not with this analytical inquiry where
we're trying to categorize. And then we direct that reflection at what is
skillful or unskillful to both ourselves, others, and both. So our community, not
just the individual, like, oh, this is good for me. Or I'm going to do it because
that person needs this, and I really need to help them. Because then there's the
both. So we use that as part of our reflection. And then the third part of
the reflection is to reflect the lens of wholesome or unwholesome, often
translated as skillful or unskillful.
In this, in this case, this word wholesome or unwholesome, the word for
unwholesome is akusala, a-k-u-s-a-l-a, in Pali. And in that, how do we know how
what's the guide for what is unwholesome? And so we look to the three unwholesome
roots. And we look and we reflect to see if what's happening has any of these
roots of greed or hatred or delusion arising. And we reflect to see if our
action is bringing about any of those results. And then kusala, so it's without
the a-k-u-s-a-l-a, wholesome or skillful. And so then in kusala, that's when we have
accompanied by these wholesome roots. And so that would be non-greed or
generosity and non-hatred or loving-kindness, and non-delusion or wisdom.
And so these instructions have been very useful to me in knowing how to attend.
Where do I put my attention? What should I attend to? And so when I'm thinking
about, will my acts increase suffering or bring about happiness, I can think about
through this lens of, am I bringing about generosity and kindness and wisdom? Or am
I feeling that moving in that direction, I'll feel more greedy. I'm a little more,
you know, aversion and more confusion.
And as with all of these processes, it's not a striving into, but a gathering and
a gradual path this was spoken to. And in this way, I'm inclining my mind, paying
attention to the presence or the absence of these skillful or wholesome states.
And so the Buddha, Rahula, you can reflect before you do the action, and then you can
reflect during the action as well. And so during the action, you can, if you
reflect and you realize it's unskillful, then in the very middle of it, you can
stop. I think I better stop this now. And we know that when we're practicing,
sometimes we realize we get lost and we're boom. Oh, I'm thinking, you know, you
realize before you know it that you're heading off in direction, you bring
yourself back. And then after, sometimes something will happen. And then there'll
be that residue. I don't know if this has happened to you, but sometimes there's
a residue in the body. And then the thought arises of something that just
happened afterwards. And so the Buddha encourages us and says, does this act with
the body that you have done me to harming yourself, others or both? And so what
the Buddha suggests that you do after is Buddha says, if you feel something's
been unskillful, then Rahula, you should confess, reveal and clarify such a deed
to the teacher or a sensible spiritual companion. And having revealed it, you
should restrain yourself in the future. So I love this sense of wise companionship
on the path that we can share and we can support each other in sharing. Like, sure,
this happened. You're like, how help me with some guidance here. And then the
Buddha continues and says, if the act with the body that you've done doesn't
lead to harming, it's skillful with happiness as its outcome and result. Then
Rahula, you should live in rapture and joy because of this training day and
night in skillful qualities. And so I love this as well because the Buddha is
encouraging us to actually feel into that sense of the goodness of what we're
doing. So remembering like, oh, right, that was a good short that made that
happiness for myself and others. So I wanted to share a story about a time
that I was practicing and I was practicing in Burma and I was a period of
time that it was unseasonably warm there. And I was practicing in this monastery
where we had very long meditation periods in the afternoon when it was quite
quite warm. It was like over 100 degrees with 90 to 100% humidity. Some went up
to 114 one day. It was really, really hot. So practicing with the body, lots of
wet, dripping, heat, hot, you know. And the meditation hall was just beautiful. It
had these beautiful shiny wooden floors and a Buddha statue and lots and lots of
windows. And so there was windows and the air that was outside was the same as the
air that was inside. Very, very hot. And then on the ceiling there were these
rows and rows of fans, spotless fans. And I'm practicing and feeling the
sensations of the body and wondering how hot it needs to get for them to turn the
fans on. It's just like, why aren't they turning the fans on? And you know, I just
sit there sweating and dripping and sweating. It's connecting with the body
and I just all I could think about with these fans. Other fans work because
they're letting you know what's going on. And so I had practice meetings with the
Abbot of the monastery about every other day and there was another English
speaking person there from Taiwan. And one day she asked the Abbot about the
fans. And I was so grateful because I didn't want to ask because I was, you
know, like I was thinking it, but I was not going to name it. And so she asked
the Abbot, well, when will you turn the fans on? You know, wondering, you know, I
was just really, really excited to hear like if it was a possibility to turn the
fans on. And he looked at us and he said, you Westerners, you want to use the
energy and resources to change your circumstances when you could use the
power of your mind. Use the power of your mind.
Mic drop, right? So all I was focusing on was, you know, can't you change the
circumstances? That's greed arising. Whereas if I use the power of my mind, the
capacity of my mind, like so my desire was for just a comfort. And he really put
it in, you know, here we are, here I am, you know, someone from the U.S., from a
very wealthy country that uses lots of resources, used to comfort coming to
Burma, wanting them to turn the fans on, using resources for my comfort. And this
practice of renunciation, so beautiful of taking what is given, the unpleasant
sensation of the heat, not really that much of a big deal, sweat, drink some
water. And I recognize in my reflection is that the particularities of me being
from the U.S. in Burma and wanting the fans on to use more energy in this world,
in this planet, like we're not considering climate change or anything
like that. And so this practice of reflection can bring us into a skillful
way of attending, a kind of pausing that we can bring in before an action, during
an action, or after an action. So in that pause, we can begin to notice the
inclination of the mind that we talked about. It's the mind inclined towards
that wanting and greed. It's the mind inclined towards aversion or delusion.
And we can bring in that pause, we can bring it into the body. You know, if it
is for feeling, oh, I really want the fans, what does that feel like in the body
to experience that? And then can I bring in the generosity, the kindness, the
skillful qualities? How can I incline the mind towards generosity and kindness
for myself, for others, and for both. And I found this practice so helpful during
retreat, because I think that when we slow things down, sometimes we can begin
to see some of the thought patterns and the habit patterns of mind that can
illustrate some of the places that were caught. And so many of the places that
were caught are places that are around identities or stories that have been with
us for a long time. And the thing that I love about being on retreat is that
sometimes we think that the things that will be the most important have to be
these big ahas. And really they can be small things like the fans or this other
story that I want to share about a retreat that I was on in person. So my
apologies for sharing about a retreat in person. But it was about how baked
potatoes like helped me awaken. So this retreat was at the Insight Meditation
Society in Massachusetts. And when I'm on retreat, I often take the eight
precepts, which includes not eating after lunch. And so, you know, just like so
many of us, you know, I organize my retreat so that during the dinner time I
would do yoga and so that I was occupied so I wouldn't be so distracted by the
meal time. But nonetheless, the yoga room was right near the dining hall in
Massachusetts. And so I walked through the dining hall after I did my yoga and I
smelled what they were having and immediately I had this barrage of
thoughts. You know, first of all, I was indignant because the evening meal is
supposed to be a light dinner, generally soup and crackers. And I was thinking
baked potatoes are not light. This is a heavy meal. And then second of all, it was
a baked potato bar. They had baked potatoes with all of these toppings. And
so, you know, I was just like they're not following the rules. Baked potatoes
should not be happening at dinner time. This is not what's happening. And then
next thought was, I love potatoes. And, you know, so really it wasn't about them,
was it? It wasn't about them and their baked potatoes. It was about me. And I
wasn't getting these baked potatoes. And then the next thought was like, I'm
Irish. I should be having these baked potatoes. How could they have baked
potatoes without me? This is not correct. I don't understand why they're not
having baked potatoes for lunch. I need to be included. And I could feel that
sense of exclusion based in the sense of ownership. These baked
potatoes are mine. And this whole story arose based on these baked potatoes. And
the beauty of being on retreat was that I began to see all these thought
patterns, you know, and underneath there, you know, the wanting mind was creating
the story of wanting the baked potatoes based on these scent stores. So that
first input was the smell of the baked potatoes. And then the confirmation of
the sight of the baked potatoes. And then the mind proliferated going on and on
with mental elaborations, kind of getting stuck in this loop on the baked
potatoes. And so this whole host of emotions went through. You know, I was
angry. I was sad. You know, I think that there was a sense that the potatoes were
meant for me. You know, somehow or rather, there was, you know, there was so
many times that I had been left out, came up. And then I, you know, I could also
feel that righteous indignation. I was still am Irish. I know about potatoes.
You're not supposed to be having them, you know. It should be having soup for
your light meal, potatoes. And you know, and that feeling that you can feel when
you get self-righteous about knowing, I know how things should go. And then you
can realize that this is all these patterns. These are the patterns of what
it means to be human. This is who I am. This is a feeling of anger. This is a
feeling of self-righteousness. And they flow through us. And one of the amazing
things about having the continuity of mindfulness, that I was able with this
practice to not totally get lost, so that you can see there was a lot of
proliferation there. But I didn't get lost in all of these stories. I saw them
coming and arising and seeing the force of greed. And ultimately I knew that
having the baked potato wasn't going to solve the problem. But getting what I
wanted, what Pam and children spoke to earlier, was actually not what was
happening. That underneath this place of like me being worthy of needing a baked
potato. And feeling into that, because after I passed through the dining hall, I
felt this tremendous sense of unworthiness in my body. And I thought I
was going to going into a huge depression. And then I realized, oh, this is a
pattern. This is a deep-seated pattern of unworthiness that leads to depression.
And this is what it feels like in the body. And then when I could see that I
was no longer caught, I could just allow that to be in me without the names and
the stories. And that wouldn't have happened unless I had upheld the precepts
of Sila, because I had taken the eight precepts. And so if I was just like, oh,
cool, forget the eight precepts. And I'm going for the potato bar and gone for
that external pleasant, when I'm sure it would have been nice. You know, if I had
gone for that momentary external pleasure, I wouldn't have gone through this
process of really understanding how deep-seated was that sense of sadness and
not belonging in me, that I could feel and get a sense of how that arose. It
began to unbind the knots that were holding me there. And so I bring this
story in because we don't have to have big moments of awakening. It can happen
at any time. And I don't think that this is a big, big awakening, but it was
a loosening for me of this way of clinging that was arising in these knots
and these habit patterns of not being good enough, of not caring, and all of
this stuff that lived to my body. And this comes from inclining the heart and
mind in the direction of liberation. So paying attention to and reflecting on
our actions and our speech and our words. And so in this Suta, I find it so
useful because the Buddha shares how to train the body, the speech, and mind to
practice to incline ourselves towards non-greed and generosity, non-hatred and
loving-kindness, and non-delusion wisdom in this gentle way where he's telling
Rahula at any point, beginning, before, during, or after, we have the capacity to
reflect and change. It's this way that we can free the heart and mind from these
forces that we all have, forces that keep us on the wheel of suffering. It's not
my force of greed or your force of hatred or the confusion. These are the
forces that run through all of us. So we're cultivating this practice to be
with what arises. So we all have these seeds, as Mary Grace was telling us, that
we can water these seeds to blossom in this way and attend to ourselves with
care and kindness. And not only attending to ourselves, but the Buddha
encouraging us to look at self, other, and both, recognizing our interconnectedness,
not just the other and caring for others that some of us are very good at, not
just ourselves, which others of us may be better at, but both.
And so ending with a quote from the Dhammapada, which is a summary of this in
another way, avoiding all unskillful, cultivating the good and cleansing one's
mind. This is the teaching of the Buddhas. So bringing in the skillful, avoiding
those things in the prime reflection that we know are going to lead us, the ways
that we'll cultivate greed, and then also cleansing one's own mind, internally with
our mindfulness and intentions toward practice and with Sila holding ourselves
in this practice. So I hope that this teaching tonight, sharing a little bit of
the stories of what the Buddha and Sunrahula, that you have some ideas for
how to work with this practice of wise reflection. So as we are mindful of
something arises, we can bring in this non-judgmental awareness to help guide
us towards creating this freedom from greed, hatred, and delusion that is so
widely needed in our world. So thank you for your kind attention.
So we have a 30-minute period of movement, walking, and we'll be back for our
metameditation in 30 minutes. Thank you.
