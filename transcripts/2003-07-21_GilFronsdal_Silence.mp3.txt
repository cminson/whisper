 And I wonder today, looking at the announcements, I was thinking that maybe the function of the announcements for me is to get me talking. Because sometimes after I sit, I don't feel like talking. And in fact, there was once on a Thursday, we were back in Palo Alto, where we rang the bell to end the sitting, and I didn't talk. Was anybody here for that time? Anybody here that you were there that day? What was that like when I didn't talk? I waited about 15 minutes before I said that. So I didn't know what to expect either, but I sat there. I didn't feel like I needed to say anything or wanted to say anything. So I sat there, and after a while, they were sitting there in silence for a while. It was clear that something was happening in the silence, so I just let it be. And after some time, I said, I don't know how long it was, but then I said, finally, something like that. Or if you're waiting for something to happen, then you've missed the boat. And then we had more silence, and then people started talking, asking questions, I think, and we then had a discussion at the end. So because of the announcements, I can't do that. But I did last week here Monday night talk about Papansha, the tendency for the mind to proliferate and obsess with thoughts. And I made reference to how the Buddha talked about once he's obsessing thoughts, kind of get the upper hand and churn away. They, in return, attack us and feel assailed by them. And as I'm sitting here now, the contrast to a mind that's obsessed with proliferating thoughts and obsessions and churning of mind, it's silence. And I'm very fond of silence. And sometimes I think, you know, we should just sit in silence more. I've told a story recently, I apologize if it was recently for all of you. The first time I came into the center, which is very recent, it was last Monday I told this, forget. The first time I came in here was about two years ago now, it would be two years ago, I guess, beginning of September and of August. And we had been talking with the ministers about buying this church for some time, and I guess for about eight months or so. But we'd never been inside. We'd just been had these conversations on the phone, and they wanted to sell it to us. And they were pretty much set on selling it to us, I think, but they hadn't really showed it to us yet. And after about eight months of this wonderful telephone conversations with these wonderful mystical Christians, they were going to show it to us. And I came an hour early before the board, and other people were going to come and see the building for the first time. And I met them on the street out there, and they were lovely people and elderly. And they did the common sense thing, they brought me in here to do a tour of the building. And I didn't think about it until really afterwards, in a sense, but as we were going around talking about the building, there would be pauses in the conversation, the silence. And that silence, those pauses, became longer and longer. Until finally, we came in here, and there were pews all lined up here, and there was kind of a cross up there above Glenn. And we sat down in the front pews, and we had one of these pauses in the conversation. And I think we paused maybe about 10 or 15 minutes. And then someone came in, one of the board members then came in because it was time for the board members to come, and so they were showing up. And so then we just got off from our seats. And then at some point, I went over to the ministers and said to him, whispered to him and said, someday we'll have to pick up where we left off. And that sitting there with them in silence was actually probably the most significant, very powerful part of the meeting with them. It was very rich, very pregnant, very strong sense of presence. And the fact that we're really together in a way that we couldn't have been together, I think, if we kept talking. I really loved it, and they loved it, I think. It just was a natural thing to do. I suspect that someone could write a dictionary about all the meanings of silence, all the different kinds of silences, like the silent treatment, the silencing of, I guess it's kind of silencing of women, for example. There's all this stuff all around silence. Sometimes silence is very frightening for people. It's very oppressive for some people, the way silence manifests itself. But one of the aspects of silence is the silence of, I don't know what to call it, spiritual silence, or the silence of the soul, or the silence of emptiness, or the silence of... And there's a kind of silence that can be a kind of wellspring of energy, a wellspring of inspiration, a wellspring of health and healing, or a wellspring of joy, a wellspring of kind of feeling at home, or feeling well, or feeling kind of a depth of life. And I wonder how many of us give ourselves time to be with that silence, to appreciate it, to love it, to make it possible to happen. Sometimes it doesn't take much, but sometimes much is what it takes for the mind to be silenced to some degree. There's expression in English called, to have one's breathtaking away. And I think often one of the consequences of having a breathtaking away, something amazing happens, is the usual thoughts and concerns we had leading up to that moment of experience are usually quieted, silenced. Maybe they become irrelevant, or just become seeming so trivial and mundane, in relationship to whatever it has been. But sometimes the immensity, the awe, you step into the middle of the sierras, and it takes your breath away sometimes with you. Someone's dying, you walk into someone's room and they're dying, and it kind of takes your breath away. It changes a lot very quickly, or someone's just died, or someone's been born. The silence after someone has died is quite something at times. And it's been said, I think, by many people that our culture, our modern culture, doesn't have much place for silence in it. We're not built in silence, do we? Our culture tries everything it can to fill the silences. And you go to all kinds of places and they have music going. And people turn on the music at home when there's silence. And some people are oppressed or afraid of silence, afraid of being alone. And so they have music, kind of radio or whatever, to fill the space. And there's a kind of strong momentum for many people in our culture to always be doing, to be doing activities and engaged in many, many things. And it's almost as if the busyness sometimes precludes the possibility of experiencing the silence which is deep inside. I think when you really feel a silence, it maybe doesn't even make sense to say it's deep inside, but the silence. When I was a Zen student for a number of years, remember, we had to have these interviews with a teacher. And Zen interviews are kind of formal. And you come in and you have to do these bows. First you do a standing bow as you get through the door. And then you do a full bow to the Buddha, perhaps. And then you go do either a standing bow or a full bow to the teacher. And so as whole, this ritual takes a while to get in there. You don't just kind of show up and say, you know, you know, how are you and how's the weather? But you know, after a while you do all this very, very formal kind of paying of respect. And then you sit down in meditation posture. And you sit there and make yourself settled and composed. And then the interview starts. And from many times, I found that I didn't want to speak. I valued the meeting, the interview. But the sense I had was that if I said anything, there would be a loss of integrity. And so it was enough just to sit there. But it was a little bit awkward too. I remember that story about when silence was a little bit tangential. But how many of you know Stephen Gaskin? Stephen Gaskin was a ex-marine sergeant, ex-marine, who dropped a lot of acid in the 60s. And he was teaching English at San Francisco State and started holding these called Monday night classes and became kind of one of the great gurus of the psychedelic generation. And at some point, he got into a school bus. And all the school buses joined him and his whole caravan of school buses going across the country of hippies. And they ended up settling in Tennessee at a commune called the farm. And when I visited, there were 800 people living there in this commune. And by that time, they'd been busted for drugs and stuff. And they had decided that they didn't need to do acid anymore. They had found a better way. And that they found that honesty was more powerful than acid. So they dropped the acid. But and so Stephen Gaskin was in jail when I came there. And so I spent a couple of months there with him still in jail for the he took the rap for the community. And when he came out, I remember the first time I met him. I went over to introduce myself. And I said, you know, I'm like, I'm Gil, and I'm new here. And I expected him to say something like, Oh, that's nice. And you know, where you're from and, you know, something, you know, some kind of, you know, question. And there was no question. And I was met by the silence. But the silence was this man looking at me with his eyes and be looking at him in his eyes. And the next thing that happened was that my mind exploded. And it just exploded. It started going out into space, you know, into black space, kind of beautiful luminous kind of space is going out and out and out. And and then it was pretty amazing. But then I realized that, you know, the sky was there. And, you know, you're supposed to have a conversation supposed to say something, you know, some social niceties or something. And so I contracted and came back. And that was over that trip. And what would have happened if I hadn't been caught up in the social conventions, the ideas, the fear of, you know, this person gonna like me, do I just say something here? You know, I just kept going. What would happen? So, you know, but not being comfortable with silence, it's a quite common phenomena, a common, but at certain depth of meditation, it's relatively common that people feel afraid of either what's just happened, some experience of silence or stillness or emptiness, or they feel up against the edge of it. And they feel, oh, I can't go there. It's too much. I won't exist there as one fear. I'll die in some ways. I mean, this isn't exactly a physical death, but you know, the ego will die. You know, do we really want our ego to die? The ego doesn't usually want to. So, so he pulls back. So pulling back from the depth of silence, it's possible. I see one of the things that kind of inspired this talk was I've seen it just very, very powerfully in my own meditation at home sitting, how when I sit down to meditate, even here when I sat with you tonight, that I'll sit down and compose myself and get started with my meditation. And after about five minutes, I realized that mostly I've just been thinking and, and so, oh, I need to get serious here. And so then, but it becomes this point in my meditation where I kind of make a choice or can make a choice between where I'd rather be with my attention. Would I rather kind of let myself keep drifting back into that world of thoughts? Or would I rather choose something else rather than kind of drifting in my thoughts and concerns? And I've done enough meditation to now to know that there's something much more valuable for me, much more deeply satisfying and much more important than allowing myself to wonder and drift aimlessly in my thoughts and concerns and plans and wonderings and, and, you know, things that can happen. And so there's a shift away from that towards a kind of silence, towards a kind of silencing of at least the mind is very busy and caught up in thoughts. And it's exquisite. It's really pleasant. I really love it. And even though it's so pleasant, so, so, so, so satisfying or so profound or something appropriate or something like that, there's still this, this, these threads, these Velcro, these little things, you know, creeping up and, you know, grabbing my attention and pulling me back into this, you know, into the world of thoughts and ideas. And so like a superficial mind kind of kind of creeps in like creepers, like plant creepers that creep in, you know. And, and for a while I had to keep cutting away the creepers and to keep cutting away those plants that are creeping in and cutting with it, turning away or letting go of them or having a little more resolve to stay with the meditation. And, and then at some point the concentration kind of starts in a sense where the mind gets tamed or quiets down enough so that, that kind of proliferating thoughts, that kind of mind that's kind of superficial chatter of the mind quiets down. And it becomes a lot easier to maintain that choice if they focus then on, for example, on the breath. And as I stay more focused on the breath, then this wonderful thing happens occasionally where it seems to be, then I'm surrounded by silence or silence or stillness seems to be a very common phenomena of what's there. And in that stillness, that silence, the breath or a sense of presence and the mindfulness that I have, what's happening, seems to become much more highlighted, much more powerful, much more, much more aware of it. It becomes like, it sounds like, I wouldn't say it's louder, but it's like, it becomes clearer or more crisper or more prominent, prominent is a good word. And, and usually if things are going well, it feels very, very satisfying to have this prominence of mindfulness, this clarity, clear awareness of what's happening moment by moment, this constant stability of mind stays there. But I see in my own mind how much, how powerful the authority is of, seemingly authority or the allure of the mind that wants to think about things. And, and there has to be some wisdom in meditation about when it's useful to think, what kind of thinking is useful and, and what kind of thinking can let go of the 99.999999% of the thoughts, which is meditation are not useful for the purposes of meditation, probably not about meditation at all. Anyway, anyway. And to have some willingness then to see, oh, I don't have to fix my life. I don't have to organize my life. I don't have to solve my life through my thinking right now. And so to really, to be a willingness to kind of separate ourselves, not so much from the fact of thinking, but separating ourselves from being glued to the thoughts or wedded to the thoughts or invested in our thoughts, no longer invest ourselves in the world of thinking as if our, who we are is dependent on the conclusion, the results of our thinking. So that's the, some new orientation to the world of thinking. And I think that's one of, there's many kind of revolutions that happens in the mind as people learn something like meditation. And one of them, I think has to do with a wise relationship to our thoughts and to know when it's useful to think, perhaps when it's useful to thank me, gauge, gauge it. I love thinking. It's a fond thing. I'm a fond of it. But also thinking is salesmen attacks me. Sometimes it's completely ridiculous. And I know that at times it keeps me from this depth of silence and stillness that is available. So there has to be a willingness to turn away or willingness to let go of the investment into this. And that's really fascinating to explore how we're invested in our thoughts, how we invest ourselves in the world of our thinking that, you know, we, you know, we think it's going to do something for us subconsciously, perhaps unconsciously. What is it we think the thoughts are going to do for us? We wouldn't be so glued to them unless we really thought they were going to do something really important for us. And part of the path of meditation is to realize that perhaps there's something really valuable that can happen to you when you dissolve that glue. And when you don't try to negotiate your life through thoughts anymore. And so the one kind of meditation exercise that some teachers will give is to, in your meditation, look for the silence between your thoughts. What is that silence like? And who are you in the silence between your thoughts? There's no one there thinking, there's no one there having words telling you who you are. Because then you're out of the silence, right? So there's no one there to tell you. You're not there to tell yourself who you are. So who are you when you're not there to tell yourself who you are? You haven't died yet, so you're still just fine, I think. But for some people that's a frightening place. It's a challenging place because, oh, it's disorienting. Oh, I'm not telling myself who I am. Then what's going on? I think that part of the deepest silence that can come from meditation comes from a mind which is not relating to anything. Maybe that's a very poor way of trying to express what I want to express. But when the attention, when the mind, when our thoughts, it's usually focused on something. It's usually concerned about something. It's usually relating to something. So some of you are now listening to what I'm saying, so you're focused on this. You're relating to my words. Or maybe you're relating to your thoughts about what I've said. Maybe something's triggered something inside of you. And so you're thinking about your thoughts. Or maybe your emotions or feelings. Maybe you're inspired. Maybe you're depressed about this. I'll talk about silence and whatever, you know, bored. And so you're relating to that. It's about that. What's going on? Or maybe you're thinking about tomorrow or thinking about the television program you missed because you came here. You know, there's always things, your mind's thinking about something. It's engaged. It's relating to something. And there's a surface concerns which are quite easy to see. But underneath the surface chatter of the mind, there are very strong, powerful currents of the mind relating to something. Our deepest concern, our deepest worry. So some people, for example, being in relationship to other people is one of the deepest concerns. And underneath the surface chatter of the mind, even when that quiets down, scanning the horizon for it to be in relationship to other people is, you know, such a primary thing that the mind does. Or maybe a sense of security. So the mind looking out for security, trying to find security. Or the mind is, you know, a very deep level of the mind is concerned with boosting its ego, boosting itself, being someone, being a self, identity. So in the depth of meditation, there's an experience of the mind where the mind is not relating to anything. The mind is freed from always looking. It's not, the mind is not about something, not thinking about something or engaged in something or looking outside of itself or looking inside of itself towards something. The mind is not towards something or away from anything. The mind is not relating to anything. Now that can be disturbing to some people to hear the possibility. But it's, or that, you know, but that's innate ability that the mind has. The mind can be luminous or self-luminous. The mind can be, it's said that in Buddhism sometimes that the mind is luminous by itself except for the visitors that defile it or cover it or taint it. So in its essence, in a sense in Buddhism, it seems as if the mind is luminous, self-luminous, the mind which is not relating to anything. It's almost as if when the mind relates to something, it covers the luminosity of the mind. If we use different kind of language, some very deep sense of presence, deep satisfying still sense of presence, you might feel yourself kind of leaving it, kind of lifting yourself up out of it perhaps or contracting away from it when you start relating to something. I'll give you another silent story that again I apologize for saying this before. Some years ago I was teaching a retreat. It was actually a Catholic convent and so it was a Buddhist retreat, silent retreat for 10 days, two weeks it was. And there was a woman there who was quite disturbed. She had a lot of anxiety, a lot of worry about all kinds of things and very much involved in the world of thoughts and really didn't see any way out of it, didn't know there was anything outside of that and was only trying to negotiate the world inner thoughts and it's kind of like being stuck in a maze if you're only trying to do things inside the world of thoughts, there's no way out ultimately. And a very troubled woman, very much in conflict with herself and people around her and we had this morning sitting. We both were through that morning sitting. It was a beautiful sitting. I think it was a guided meditation which really helps people get really settled and quiet. And after that meditation, immediately afterwards I had an interview with her. So I left the hall to go upstairs to this little nuns room, very sweet little num, Santa Sabina, I don't know if you know it and it's beautiful. I love these little monastic cells. One of my hopes kind of like ideals or dreams, it's kind of like to die in a room like that. And so we sat there and the light was coming in and we both showed up, we also were sitting there and she came to sit next to me and we were so filled with meditation and stillness and silence of the meditation that we just sat there kind of, I don't know how I was but I shouldn't talk about myself but she was sitting there glowing and she was so much at ease and at peace and it felt like there was nothing we needed to say. And I was just in awe that she had come to that. I didn't know she had the ability for that and it was just like so beautiful to see and I knew her for many years. It was really to see this as a possibility for her and enjoying that together, just being in that space together, it's like this communion of silence. And then she said, this is really great. But yesterday was different. Yesterday I was having some trouble with these kind of things and as she started telling me about yesterday, I could watch transformation in front of my eyes of this woman who was radiant and peaceful into someone who was filled with anxiety and distress because she was telling me about it, recounting it, how it was yesterday. How sad I felt, you know, this was here, it was right here. But she had a mind which was so powerfully relating to something, concerns, worries, anxieties, that stuff. So the mind that doesn't relate to anything, the awareness doesn't relate to anything. In the Buddhist tradition, in the early Buddhist tradition, that experience of tasting the stillness, the silence of the mind that doesn't relate to anything is said to be something you touch with your body. I love that expression. They touch with the body, you touch it with your body. And so it's not something just with the mind, but something kind of embodied sense, something that kind of fills you, maybe fills your body. Something physical almost, a physical sense of maybe a very different kind of spiritual tradition, you'd say physical sense of presence. But a kind of stillness which is almost like a force or a power or a stillness or freedom. So the question I'd like to leave you all with is two things. Do you, in the course of your days and weeks and months, give yourself quality time to be in silence? Do you have access or ways of being in silence with others or with by yourself going in the woods or sitting and looking out the window? Do you have some ways to really allow silence to nourish you? You know ways that silence can really nourish you. And if there is those ways, if you know those ways, I would encourage you maybe to consider that that nourishment is probably worth a lot more than some of the other things you do for nourishment or for entertainment or for pleasure or for and but we so often sacrifice the deep satisfaction of silence for a lot of things, television. So that's one question, you know, do you have that access? Do you take the time? And I encourage you to make that time. And the second is in your meditation practice, can you look and sense, feel your way into the silence there in an appreciative way, in a way that brings you a huge kind of sense of satisfaction or joy. This satisfying silence, it's already there, we could say. And can you feel your way? Can you sense your way? Can you listen your way? Can you taste your way into that silence? Can you touch your way into it? Can you do that little bit of decision-making analysis consideration where you realize, oh these thoughts that I have, I think it's okay to let them be for now. I don't have to be engaged in them. Put them down, let them rest, not for now. To be inspired or to have the wisdom understanding that there's that the solution for your life maybe is not going to be found by thinking. And so maybe for a little bit you can put that aside. And having that consideration might make it a little bit easier to do that. But if you don't have some serious wisdom or understanding or appreciation of this little point, it's all too easy then to be swept up over and over again by your thoughts. Because somehow in the psyche, the psyche maybe even subconsciously thinks, this is really important to think right now. This is the most important thing that has to happen right now is thinking about, and you fill in the blank. Yes. When you go into the pool, oh the question is when you experience the silence and you're aware of the silence, aren't you then thinking about the silence? It can be. There are very powerful sense of presence or silence that it doesn't preclude the possibility of thinking about it. There's just a little small little voice in the mind that kind of says, oh there's real deep silence here. So there's layers of silence. And so this thing where you're breath's taken away, you see something really immense and the mind gets really still. And you can kind of some reflection about that as possible. That's possible. But it's also possible to be aware of that silence without thinking. So if you go, for example, on a hot day and lower yourself into a refreshing pool of water, are you aware that you're in the water without thinking about that you're in the water? Did you hear the laughter when you said that in the room? Did you hear the laughter in the room? Did you think about that laughter when you heard it? You did. Thanks. Thoughts are fast. I've never experienced this silence before. It's also partly a matter of degree. So you might look a little bit at your mind at the degree of that possibility because I'm sure you have to some degree. So you might look at the degree. And it might be most obvious when the mind is obsessing about something really caught up and churning away. And there's some time when it's not that, you know, when you feel more at rest than at ease with the world. A friend of mine who is a very good meditator said once that he was in a conflict with someone, very serious conflict about something. And it took him six months before his meditation could get really still again because that little conflict was kept pulling him in, pulling him in. So that points to something. Another thing maybe I should say is that it's one thing to talk about, like I talked about today, about going into meditation and putting aside your thoughts and going into the silence as if it's easy thing to do. It's not an easy thing to do for many people or most of the time for most people. And sometimes other things are needed as a preliminary or as a support for that as a possibility. And so, for example, when there's a lot of anger or resentment, perhaps a process of forgiveness is necessary or perhaps resolving some issue and is necessary. Going and talking to someone we have issues with. Certain things, you know, we need, you know, all kinds of spiritual life includes a lot more than just sitting in meditation. It also means taking care of other things. Today I had a conversation with someone who wrote a dissertation on right speech. And I told her my little story about the thought exercise I teach sometimes where I say, imagine yourself in a, you know, some, you've got a nice hike, you know, and it's been a beautiful spring day and the grass is green and you had a wonderful little lunch and you had a nice nap and you woke up, you're under the oak tree and just beautiful weather, just the right temperature and you just feel so refreshed and you're next to your friends laying next to you and you turn to your friend and you lie. And how does that feel? And probably in the context of being, you know, so calm, so peaceful, the lie feels like a real transgression. But then now in contrast, imagine yourself on Highway 101 at five o'clock, it's rush hour traffic, you're late for some really important meeting and people are cutting you off and there's smogs and your air conditioner doesn't work and, you know, and, you know, and you're getting more and more irritated and hot and, and, and some one person, one more time cuts you off and how quickly it is, you know, we'll say something or do something with a finger or something. The quality of our mind is what I told this woman today on the phone was the quality of our mind affects a lot. The decisions we make about how we express ourselves and, you know, affects our ethical decisions even. And her response, she said, great, you know, she liked that. And then she said, yes, but not just the quality of your mind, because I use the word mind. It also has to do with it also depends a little bit on your, on your, your physical condition. And, you know, if you don't take care of your body, how can you expect, you know, your mind or, you know, you take care of your body also. And so you need to do something like yoga or, you know, go for walks or do something for your body. The Buddha, you know, was a big time walker. That's what he did. I don't, there's no evidence he did any exercise, but he did a lot of walking. And walking is a great toner for the body. And so again, so if your person is only relying on meditation and not doing the appropriate things, take care of their body and just a minimal so the body's well toned and the energy goes smoothly in their body, it's very hard then to do the kind of deeper work that comes to the whole range of things that support this possibility. Yes. Is it ever possible to meditate with the intent to have some sort of something? You know, like if you have some decision you need to make about your career or something that you need to find a way to, you know, are you meditating? Is that then your thinking? Or is it possible to have the intent to have a meditation? Well, there's so many different kinds of meditation. There's like a whole big array of what meditation is, meditations. And so there are forms of meditation that are more contemplative in nature that actually involve reflection and using thoughts in helpful ways. We don't want to make thoughts the enemy in any kind of way. And, and thoughts have their role in spiritual life for sure. And the, and our ways of meditating where we put thoughts aside completely and we're not going to be engaged in them at all. And there are forms of meditation where we actually use them for deep reflection or even decision making. And one small way of doing that, for example, is to use your meditative ability to get as quiet and still as you can and really put aside your concern the best you can for 15, 20 minutes of meditation or however long you can and get as deep, still and quiet as is available to you. And then when you think you've come to some point where it makes sense to change the focus, then you bring up the topic. Maybe by having a very simple question or you just have a word and, and then let the mind begin reflecting in its own way. And sometimes the mind that's concentrated and still is much more creative in making connections and making understandings than the mind that's kind of surface chatter and worried and concerned and all that. And you can be much more productive kind of reflection when the mind is still. So that's a very wonderful thing to do. That kind of reflection is that what we would call thinking or is it dropping the thought in and then pretending it's not there, meditating, just to see what pops up like? Is this? Both, you know, anything's possible. It's all, it's all valid. You're asking me, is it okay or something? Yeah, yeah. I can give you permission to have fun with your meditation. Have a good time, try different things out and don't feel like it has to be one way. And there are some times when, when you might find that doing exactly what you said, just being really still and dropping a thought or the idea and just see what bubbles up. And sometimes the mind might stay silent and then there's a little explosion of some feeling or explosion of some thought. And and you're not really engaged in thinking per se, but you've made a space for something to happen that wouldn't otherwise happen. And sometimes you might, your mind might pick it up as a theme and you think about it and you look at it and you engage in it very intentionally, intently. And the mind drifts away, start thinking about what you're having for dinner tonight. And you say, oh no, that's not what I'm doing. I'm focusing on this issue, this question. And, and there's ways of doing that for personal concerns. And, and there's also ways of doing that for deep Dharma insights. Can we actually think about some of the teachings of the Buddha, for example, the deep reflection about the theme of impermanence or about death or about, you know, a number of things, but self, what is the self? And it can be very, very productive, very, very, very profound to do that kind of reflection. The problem with teaching it to Westerners is that Westerners are predisposed to think so much already that it sometimes it can get carried away and not be so useful. And so usually I think most of the Western Dharma teachers have really mostly emphasized the other side of the other kind of meditation that's focused much more nondiscursive awareness. As nondiscursive awareness is the one that really usually will take people to furthest in meditation. And so we don't teach that so much, but it's certainly a rich part of the Buddhist tradition, many different traditions of Buddhism. I don't know if it's useful, but even before I became a meditator, I discovered this when I was designing scenery, and I would be given the problem of designing a piece of scenery. And, and if I thought about it, I was lost, I was completely lost. So that the procedure for me has always been do the homework, but find out what the possibilities are, and then forget about it. And then the idea that you trust is the one that bubbles up from the deepest, quietest place. Do you hear that? Then one of the questions that that's good. So say that you've done your homework, you've done your engagement, and you put it aside, and you're sitting and meditating. And poof, the idea comes. What do you do then? Do you go with it? Do you then start thinking about reflecting on it? Because creative juices are flowing now. So, you know, the great American novel is happening. Or you put it aside in meditator for the purposes of your meditation. And it depends a little bit on what you want to do, of course. But there is a lost opportunity, I think. It's kind of like because in meditation itself, when the mind gets quiet and concentrated, it can't be very creative. And it's very seductive to be caught up in those creative thoughts that might bubble up. And, and it's fine to do that in a sense, but it is a lost opportunity because it's kind of like you're on a really good track in your meditation, things are going really well. And some of you're practicing really well. And then you take a detour. That doesn't take you further in the meditation. And since you are on a good track, what would have happened if you just kept going on the track and gone further? Don't take a detour. Let those thoughts bubble up and then put them aside. Anyway, thank you for listening. And I hope that this was a little bit evocative of a possibility for you. And as you explore your meditation and your life and your silence, I hope that you have fun and enjoy it and it brings you happiness and delight. Thank you.
