 Very nice to be here again. I always loved to come to California. I was telling my friend who I'm staying with, you know, just this weather is just so perfect to me. It makes me so happy. I said, I don't know how anybody could be depressed in California. It's just, I can't imagine it. It's so beautiful. So I thought, I talked some tonight about the Buddha's instruction on contemplating the body. You know, more recently just kind of revisiting the basic core instruction that he's offered in the Satipatthana Sutta and just trying to tweak it and understand it more. It's a very powerful teaching where he gives all of the guidance for how to be with our experience of the body and mind and so that we can have some insight into its true nature. One of my teachers, Ajahn Amara, said recently that, I don't know the source of this, but it was very fascinating to me. He said that late in his life, the Buddha said that he could have taught the Sutta for his whole lifetime and nothing else and that he wouldn't have covered everything that there is to cover in this particular teaching. I thought that was really fascinating. It helps me too, both as a teacher and as a student myself, to realize that oftentimes we come to the meditation practice and you hear the instruction, this one or two times and then you think we think we've got it. We think we know what to do. And so just that simple reflection can really serve as a reminder to keep visiting it, keep revisiting it and trying to get a direct sense not only from what he's saying, but then looking into our experience and seeing over and over again, just tweaking it and trying to get more and more precise on what he's telling us to do. Because really, remember, all of his teaching is about freedom from suffering. He wants us to be happy. He wants us to have a good time. So the idea is learn how to do this so that we can be happy and free from difficulty. So obviously, if he could talk about it his whole life and not cover it, we're not going to cover it tonight. And certainly the whole Sutta deals with the teaching about mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of feeling, mindfulness of the mind and the end of mind objects. So that would be like a series if we were going to do that. So we'll just stay with the body. And even within the body, I know I can't cover everything tonight, but I thought I'd just pick out some of the bits that might be most useful. So the effort here in the foundations of mindfulness and in the meditation practice is to really tune into the body and endeavor to have a precise and direct experience of it as we possibly can. I find this to be really, really huge because I think we're just not very connected with the body at all. Very few people are. Even people who make their living doing it because of the tendency of the mind to pick up physical experience sort of conceptually or to just either get totally lost in experience that's going on at this level or resistant and contracted around it or just ignoring it. I mean, really literally ignoring it. I remember a few years ago, I just had this sense of my being, myself as like this huge head walking around with these two little appendages for arms and these two little feet. It's just like the whole world is going on up in here in terms of actually being in the body and moving through space in it and having a direct experience of it. It's just realizing how rare it was for me and I suspect that's true of a lot of people. He's trying to get us to be with it. He invites this contemplation and in this sutta he begins with the mindfulness of the breathing which as you know is very important. It's a basic part of the meditation instruction. But still it has to be said that this particular sutta on the meditation is the shorter version is about 10 pages long and this awareness of the breathing is only the first half page. So there's a lot more to the meditation practice than this but it's not to de-emphasize it. It takes a whole, it ends up being a huge part of it because it's such an anchor that the mind keeps wandering so much that you need to lock onto something that is always there that you can always keep coming back to. So certainly as an anchor it's very important but the mindfulness of the breathing has a lot more to it than that. It's not just attending to it and trying to stay with it. And I think if I just read a little bit of what he's saying and dissect it a little bit I think you'll get an idea. So he starts off saying you go to the forest, you sit at the root of a tree, basically setting up mindfulness in front of us. So you can get the picture, he's sort of saying get relaxed, settle down, go out to the woods, pick an environment or a context that you have less opportunity for distraction and more opportunity for relaxation. So establishing oneself in that way. And then he says this, ever mindful one breathes in, mindful he breathes out, breathing in long he understands I breathe in long or breathing out long he understands I breathe out long, breathing in short he understands I breathe in short or breathing out short he understands I breathe out short. He trains thus I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body. He trains thus I shall breathe in experience, breathe out experiencing the whole body. He trains thus I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation. He trains thus I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation. So there's a whole progression within this that I think it's very important to take note of. First of all, starting out by noticing the breath without any opinion about how it is. Generally this first part breathing in long I know that that's what's happening, breathing in short and breathing out long and out short. The way that this is generally interpreted is that one is sitting here and not concerned about how the breath is, not interfering with it in any way, not trying to make it be another way, but just noticing that it's this way now. So I don't think the long and the short is particularly the point. You know what I mean? Like you don't have to sit there thinking oh that was a long one, that was a short one. I don't think that's the point, but more that you're impartial. So just feel what that takes. This is a very settled situation when you're that settled that you can actually actually noticing the way the breath is and not going with it either way or not caught up in it being some other way. So that's the standard interpretation for that. And I'd just like to offer another one that doesn't have to contradict it, but rather parallel it. And this comes from one of the monks at Chithurst where he was reading this and he said well I just can't imagine that the Buddha really means long and short breath in this. What could that possibly mean? And then just watching his experience noticing that when you sit down, when you first sit down to the meditation and you connect with the breath as an object, there is a way that one first rides the breath a little bit. It's like, see if this is true, you're sitting and you're breathing and you're kind of right up close to it and sort of riding it as if it was a wave and you were on a surfboard or something like that. But then after a while, maybe even just a few minutes into the sitting, you might notice a shift begins to take place where your back, it's almost like your back more from it. You've actually, from riding the breath, have gotten a lot more settled and now it's as if you're back here and the breath is coming up in front of you. And can you feel that? If you can feel that little shift taking place, then it's actually a sign that you've gone down a few notches. It's as if you got in the elevator and you went down a few floors. So you're a lot more settled than you were when you first sat down. Can you feel that? So that this he's saying like the long is this, you know, you're riding a little bit and the short is your back and it's like you're noticing it more like a conductor leading a concert or something. And it's at that point that you will notice, you'll begin to notice, you'll take in other things. Then you start to hear the sounds in the room and notice the sensations in the body, things like this. So can you feel that? There's a distinct difference in the degree of one's relaxation and awareness at this point. Then this next bit where he says, I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body. I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body. So you can notice that at this point, now that you're more settled, you're beginning to actually become aware of things that are going on in the body in a much more marked way. If you're focused, the attention will naturally begin to pick up more things. And while we're still with the body, it's going to pick up more things in the body. And then they said, this is actually sort of the basis for if you've ever done the body scanning meditations. This is part of where the basis of that comes from, noticing the whole body. You can actually literally start, we'll start with the head and go through the body and scan to the feet and back up again. Just being aware of what's happening specifically like that or just holding back in a more broad way, you'll just be picking up more that's going on in the body. And then this last bit, tranquilizing the bodily formation, breathing in, I tranquilize the bodily formation. Well, in other parts of the teachings, we know that the Buddha talks a lot about mental formations, where the formations are constructs in the mind, conceptualizations about experience. So what if in this he's actually saying that what's happening now is that one's conceptualizing about the body is beginning to drop away. You're actually experiencing it more and more directly. There isn't this sense of like picturing the breath coming in and out or conceptualizing about sensations as being pain or something like that, but actually feeling the direct experience. So I mean, looked at this way, this whole thing on the breathing, in some ways you can almost interpret this as not even so much an instruction, but a description of what will happen if you just pick up the breath in this way and pay attention to it, ride it a little bit, stay with it. Notice that as you stay with it, you're going to get more settled. You're going to start tuning into other things. The body itself, all the different aspects of the body will begin to become more apparent to us and the conceptualizing about the body will begin to drop away. So you can feel if that's what he's getting at here and I think it is, then he's setting us up very nicely for a lot more in terms of insight and understanding as to how the body works, what's going on with the body. And then there's this refrain that happens throughout the sutra after each section like this where he talks a little bit about insight into the impermanent nature of things. So I won't get into that, but just know that if you, you know, it's a very interesting part of the sutra, each aspect, okay, you've got the breath, okay, now you will begin to notice that it keeps changing. The next bit I think is really fascinating. At the second part, he goes into the four postures. So interesting because you get, you get all settled and now he's bringing in, okay, be aware of the body as it's standing, sitting, walking and lying down. When walking, Abhiko understands I am walking. When standing, he understands I am standing. When sitting, he understands I am sitting. When lying down, he understands I am lying down. Or he understands accordingly however his body is disposed. Now I don't think he's saying here that we walk around and think, oh look at me, I'm standing. Oh look at me, I'm sitting, you know. I don't think that's what he's getting at, but more that the understanding is more like just a very subtle awareness. I know what's happening. I am not, I haven't lost my focus. I haven't lost my attention. I am still very much embodied and I'm aware of the movement from one posture to another. Now often we talk about this as something that's done in a way, especially on retreat, that we do this so that we keep the mindfulness continuous, you know. That, you know, it's not just what you're doing on the cushion, you know. You've got to pay attention when you get up and walk around and when you're lying down and all four postures. And so that, you know, the idea is it's not very useful if it's only, if you can only do it on the cushion, you know. You want to be able to do it moving around and as well. So that's, I mean, that's part of it. I think that's part of what's being said here, but I think there's a lot more in this than just that, you know, than just this sense of keeping the awareness continuous. And just consider it, one thing, for example, one notices, if you really start to pay attention in such a way that you notice yourself changing postures a gazillion times throughout the course of the day, how many times does that happen? And most of it is happening, well all of it is happening, it's like we're not even thinking about it, we just do it. So if you keep watching like that for, as he says at the end of the sutra, just seven years, seven months, seven weeks, seven days, just do it for seven days, you know, it's got to begin to dawn on you that you're not doing this. This body is like running itself. It moves around, you know, none of it is, so very little of it is conscious. So I think he's really getting at a potential for some dramatic insight into the fact that the body is not self and intention is not self, that these movements are happening in ways that are outside of any CEO, you know, there's not somebody in here running this show. And you got to get that after a while of watching it, you know. So I think you can have a direct insight into non-self, you can certainly have direct insight into impermanence because of the changeability of the whole structure. But I think a really big one that you can learn a lot about is dukkha, suffering and difficulty because the one, it said that the one obstacle, the primary obstacle to insight into dukkha is changing postures. Because we, every time we get a little uncomfortable, you know, the slightest little thing and you're moving, you know, up, down, you know, go get something to eat, go sit, you know, sit down, stand up, walk around, whatever. You know, it's happening constantly. And you know, it's one of the things that like when we go on retreat, so many of the meditators comment about how much pain there is in the body, you know. And it's like, well, it's really not that there's any more pain than usual, you know, it's just that we're not changing postures all the time. So you sit there and you see it. And certainly we can whine and complain about it and then we won't have insight, you know. Or we can keep the attention as bare and clean as we can and we'll begin to see, you know, to really have some direct understanding of the truth of the way it is. You know, there is dukkha, there is difficulty and body dukkha is one of the biggest ones, you know. And it can be a great, great teacher, you know, anybody who's ever struggled with the aches and pains in the morning, you know, and tried to work with that as a practice can attest to that, you know. A number of people and I've talked about this, you know, how many years we spent trying to get the right mattress and the right pillow and the right pajamas and, you know, the right temperature in the room and eat, just eat before you go to bed, don't eat before you go to bed, whatever. All to avoid this ache that, you know, it takes place when you first wake up, you know. I've been battling that for ten years, you know, trying to figure out what to do so that my body won't hurt in the morning, you know, instead of just really getting it that, well, that's the way it is, you know, it hurts. And no amount of changing postures and fluffing pillows and anything like that is going to rid us of that experience. The irony is, I mean, I think the irony when we get that is you're so happy, you know. It's like fighting this discomfort in the body for so long, all one's life, you know, and you just get it that, oh, it's like that. You just settle down and accept it and receive it, you know. But I think a lot of that insight can come from attending to this simple thing of being in the different postures and noticing what happens around that. So there's a couple of other things in here that I think I'll just, I'm just going to skip and go to this other one, which I think is primary, which is contemplating the four elements. And here's what he says. In bhikkhus, a bhikkhus reviews this same body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of the elements thus. In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element. That's pretty far out. I felt like it was kind of, when I first read that it was like, oh, this is a, you know, I feel like I'm kind of in a, either in a Native American teaching or some kind of new age teaching or something like that, you know, it just didn't feel like Buddhism all of a sudden. But then look at it and see what he's saying in this, that really, when it comes down to it, the experience of physicality, the experience of matter, of the body, when we contact that in a very direct way, is nothing more than this, earth, air, fire, and water. He's talking about sensation here. You may know he talks about the five senses, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and sensing, touching. Seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting are actually not what he refers to as primary. They're what he calls derived matter, meaning that they're a combination in some way of earth, air, fire, and water, but that this fifth sense, the sensation, the experience of touch and sensation is this, is nothing more than this. And you know, he's inviting us to get a sense of our physical experience at that level. That calls for a fair amount of stillness and relaxation and a lot of attending because we very quickly add a lot on to these experiences so that if there's like, if there's a sensation in the knee, it's very rarely contemplated as like heat or hardness or air, you know, movement or something like that. It's very quickly in a finger snap and usually it's where we live is, you know, it's pain. It's conceptualized and once it's conceptualized in that way, then you're moved out of the direct experience of physical. You're into a mental realm, you're relating to it from as a notion, as an idea, and not actually for what the actual experience of it is. So he's saying, well, you know, try this out, get a sense of what earth is from within it. You know, all of this, he's saying the body as the body, the body from within the body so that, you know, you become aware of say earth element just as you're walking around throughout the course of the day. If you ever have this sensation of having this load to carry around, you know, it's heavy. This whole, this body is heavy and you know, you can feel it particularly when you lift up out of a chair or go back down into one, you feel the pull of gravity, the effect of that's a direct experience of earth element, this solidity, mass and what have you. So like say when you're brushing your teeth or something like that, you know, just getting a direct experience of the hardness, the various ways that the body is hard, the bones, the teeth, you know, the skull, just the mass of it, the weight of it and endeavoring to connect with that. I just feel that, I mean, if we could do that, even just a little bit more than we do, that right there, particularly the earth element, I think has a very calming effect. It's very linked with samadhi because it's a stabilizer, it's a relaxer, you know, when you're sensitized to the earth, you will be more calm. So it has this other value, you know, not just in getting a direct experience of the body. And the fire, obviously our bodies have temperature, you know, that's very easy to notice, especially if you're a menopausal woman like me, you just get these flashes every now and then, you know, the whole thing gets on fire and then recedes, you know. And we feel it with the various temperature changes throughout the course of the day, you know, where how many times a day do you take your socks off and put them back on or take your jacket off and put it back on. And just noticing that and endeavoring to have a direct experience of the changing of the body temperature, you know, and getting it, that that's what's going on here. I mean, this, it's wild. You can't, I can't explain it. It's like from the time that we're born to the time we die, there's like these elemental energies just kind of moving and changing and increasing and decreasing and stabilizing at some times. And it's just fascinating to become aware of it, let alone to have the insight into the nature of it. So the air is very evident in the breathing and things like that, or like, you know, after a meal, the gurgling and the gut and stomach, you know, burps and what have you, just that the movement of air in the body. And according to some Indian system, it's very linked with the electrical system, sort of the nervous system, you know, like you can almost feel like, you know, that little impulses that are going on throughout the body that supposedly very linked with the air element as well. All the space, you know, the space that's in the body as well. And then certainly the water, you know, you can feel it in certain, just the moistness or the dryness of various times, you know, the need to put on moisturizers or creams or you know, to take a drink of water, things like this. So just, he's getting at, endeavoring to have a lot more direct experience of what's going on with the body. And you know, you can do this by either featuring one thing over another, which I find very interesting, just take a period of day and say, you're just going to try to tune into the fire element, see if you can notice it over a period of time or the air element. And you can do this with the weather as well. He says it's the same internally, externally. What's going on outside of us is the same as what's going on inside. Or you can do it in this more raw way where you're like a juggler kind of tossing around four balls and you know, just noticing the change of one or another of these being dominant. So you know, here again, I mean, why do this? You know, I don't think that he's trying to get us to a point where we walk around saying, you know, something, look at me, you know, I'm the four elements, you know, it's like, you know, having a sort of a superficial insight into it at that level. But rather that this, this kind of contemplating, this kind of observing of the body experience is very, very, again, very much linked with insight. What he's saying here is I think the language is very important. Having an experience of the body as a body or in the body so that one can see that this is the way that it is, this is the way that it operates. It's not more than this, which I think is incredibly powerful, potentially powerful realization. If for example, one is, happens to be in a lot of discomfort and pain, then the capacity to contemplate it in this way actually gets us sort of under that conceptualizing about it into the direct experience of it. And if you ever do that, you only have to do that once for your views about pain to be changed forever. To really like to go into the experience of say, say you're sitting with a pain in the knee and see what is it? What is this thing that I'm going nuts about? That makes me go crazy, that the slightest discomfort or disease, what is it? And when you go into it, it's like, it's hard, it's hot, it's cold, it moves, now it's here, now it's there. And you can have these moments where it's like, that's what all the fuss is about. It's not that much, especially when it comes to things like pain. It's not only bearable, we're bearing it. We're actually enduring it, except for the preoccupation with hating it. And so if you drop it down to the actual experience, it's actually quite manageable. And one can find a tremendous amount of peace just in that capacity, developing that capacity. And getting quite skilled at it, which certainly for people who, anybody who is in chronic pain or something like this, this is a therapy that is being taught now to really get it at a more raw, experiential level. And so it also will help tremendously to break up all of the overlays that we put on those experiences, just to discern the difference between sensation, the feeling about that, which is finding it pleasant or unpleasant, and then all of the mental chatter that comes in about that. These are all very discreet experiences. There's the body, there's the finding in unpleasant and the trying to get rid of it. Dissect that, break that out, and it puts us in a tremendously powerful position in dealing with things that would normally just do us in. And I think the one that's been most helpful for me is just to begin to recognize that these elements are rarely, if ever, in a state of homeostasis. They're rarely balanced. It's always too hot or too cold. It's like the Goldilocks effect. It's too hot, it's too soft, it's too hot, it's too cold, there's too much air, there's not enough of it. Just look at our experience like that, look at how much we're affected by the changes and the imbalances of these elements if we don't understand it. But when you get it, that's the way they operate. They're constantly changing and constantly in varying degrees of balance and imbalance. Only now and then, really rarely, you have this moment where you, wow, I feel great, everything feels good, nothing hurts, nothing's too hot, nothing's too cold. But that is so rare. So just imagine life without the irritation that accompanies these changes. It comes from observing them and cutting through what the mind does with the changes. Just getting with them as they are. Last summer I was at Amravati doing a retreat with one of the nuns, Ajahn Chantasiri. The monks and nuns, they just really impressed me a lot with their practice. You can see the effects of their practice and it inspires one to do the same. This was during this heat wave, I don't know if you remember this huge heat wave that I had last summer in Europe. There were three or four hundred people who died in France, it was so hot. I was just across the channel in England and it was unbelievable. It started on the second day of the retreat, it lasted the whole retreat. We were dying. People were rolling out in the grass at night trying to keep cool, filling the tub with cold water and immersing our bodies and these buildings that they have for the retreat center there. I swear, I don't know, but it seems like they're designed to keep the heat in. It was like there was no place to get comfort. We would go out in the forest and then the forest was infested with fleas. Now you were hot and you had flea bites all over your body. There's a senior nun who was teaching the retreat. Here she was leading the retreat, holding us all together. She's in these ropes, layers and layers of fabric and sitting up a little higher where it's hotter and giving us Dharma talks and Dharma instructions every day. She never said a thing about being uncomfortable. I just kept watching her, sitting there with the rags. I thought, my gosh, such mastery. It's not coming from a place of denial. You could say, well sure, you could do that because you're repressing it all. It's a situation of having made peace with the changes of the temperature. I found it very, very inspiring to watch her and actually have tried since then to make that more of a practice myself. Just try to endure these changes and see what it's like not to say anything about it. Not to repress it, but to accept it, to be with it. Because often the saying something about it is pushing it away. The last bit about, one more thing about working with the elements. I think if we can do this then it can really help us to settle into a much more natural sort of organic experience of life. You're sort of getting with the natural rhythms of the body and the world that we live in. This is the way that it is. I find it very, very helpful connecting with the body in general. I've become keenly aware that there's an intelligence here that the mind is always overriding with ideas and views. A good example is just how much to eat. If we're tuned to it, it knows when it's time to stop. You can actually feel it. It's like a burp or something that happens and it's a signal. It's enough. But then you've got the eyes and you've got the mind and you've got liking and not liking. That looks good. The eyes don't have anything to do with it, but it looks good or it tastes good. If you could just tune into the actual experience then it's infinitely more helpful. Moving with this natural intelligence of the body. It's like the body fixes itself. It rights itself. It corrects itself. It knows what to do. It knows when it's too hot and you need to cool down. It knows when you're too cool and it needs to get warmer. It doesn't require a lot of mental activity. All of this stuff can happen without any thought and without any mental chatter or confusion or arguing, which is another big thing if you've ever argued internally over whether or not to put a coat on. It can happen. Something else is getting engaged and awareness of the body will help settle down into the body such that we're moving more with these natural rhythms. I think the experience of that is one of infinite more contentment and ease and relaxation. I've had a few more thoughts, but I'm aware I've been talking a while and maybe you have some thoughts as well or some comments or questions. Let me just see if that's true. Yes. I'm thinking that taking on one more. Do you talk about transforming of physical activity through awareness of the body? I think the breathless and some both could be applied the same principle to when we experience emotional emotions, except in a terrible sadness or frustration. Yes, definitely. Could you be able to detach from the emotions, try to move on to the feelings that you are like in your form? Oh, yes. Yeah. I thought at first when you were saying that, I thought you meant, but you can also detach from it at a feeling level and at a mental level, which is the rest of the sutta. When you know feeling in the same way that you know physical sensation as that and nothing more and thought as thought and nothing more, then that's some fine seeing. That's some mature practice to be able to do that. But literally what he's getting at is being able to know an angry thought coming up in the mind because you understand it as thought, because you see it as a mental event that is not you. You have the option of whether to think it or not, whether to go into it or not. That gets stronger and stronger with the months and years of practice to where you can actually just not go there. But where you went with that is also true that one of the best ways I find for beginning to be able to see it that way is to feel the effect of those states on the body, especially states like anger and restlessness and anxiety. If you get a good worry going over something and watch that go on for days and days and days, what's that doing to the body? If you turn the attention to the body and feel the consequences of that, that can be a great help in releasing it because it's very painful. That's another way where the system is tweaking itself. If we get the direct experience of it, it's like the mind and the body both know what works and what doesn't work, what is good and what isn't good. We start to naturally incline away from things that don't serve us, like obsessing, worry. The five hindrances are hysterical in that sense. I can't believe that we keep buying into these things. I'm afraid of something, so I know what I'll do. I'll worry about it. Just buy into that and live in that state for however long it lasts. Yes? I'm thinking about what you just said was very good in relationship to physical pain. It's easier for me to not conceptualize and avoid it with food. I have a physical experience. My tendency is immediately to start just future tripping. This is not just a headache, this is brain injury. Right, exactly. That's the part that is difficult to think about. My breath gets faster and my heart is racing and settling me down with pain is not that I need to focus on what's happening with pain. It's just getting the other stuff to be more comfortable. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that. It's coming from a tendency of the mind or a capacity of the mind, really. It associates and it imagines and it fantasizes. This is just what it does. This is how the mind works. So it will pick up any sensation, feeling or thought and do that with it. So it will remember. You get some pain and it will remember all the times that you had that pain before. It's like, is this helping? But that's what it will do. And then it will imagine, it will create a world wherein this pain is permanent, is never going to go away. It's like future suffering. But actually, if you look at that, it's fascinating to watch it doing that because that is all actually bubbling up out of and in a way is a reactive pattern to it. It's trying to get away from it. So you start to break this stuff down. We're not fooled by its tricks anymore. This is just one of the many forms that aversion takes. It's imagining this whole world. Fascinating. Yeah? I've also been struck at times when I accidentally injured myself and seen the separate part where it's almost this being just outraged that, hey, wait a minute, that's mine. I don't want to see that thing get out. And to be able to see that as separate from that's me. And then to realize that it's just and it's just in the way they use in this universe. Intimate with it because I always seem to follow it around somehow. Great. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah. I think this practice is fabulous. Yeah. A couple of years ago, I went through, I had quite a bit of computer work and I was working on the deadline. I started to see signs of repetitive stress. I was just so really focused on this work and had some healthy work, unhealthy work practice. So like tunnel vision that I wasn't really just being nurturing or being mindful that I can't just do that. Yeah. That second last very long. So I mean, it's kind of the opposite is in some ways being kind to yourself. Yeah. Noticing pain but also recognizing that there's time to switch positions and things that have to be done. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. You know, I think that tuning in at this level will actually help that as well. Yeah. Yeah. Like we're off to the races with ideas that are causing us to tune out from what's actually happening with the physical. Yeah. We've all done that. Yeah. I mean, a very common sort of everyday example is like not going to bed when we're tired and not getting up when we're awake. It's like, but the alarm didn't go off yet, but you're awake, but it didn't go off yet. That little battle that'll go on is hysterical. I mean, I've actually driven past exits on the highway making myself just self hold having to pee because it's, I don't want to stop yet. I don't want to stop yet. Instead of just tuning into what's going on with the body and do it, do what it needs. It gets very confusing when the mind gets in on the act. These are events that have to do with the body. It's not the domain of the mind, but it will pick it up and play with it, have something to say about it and distract and distort the whole scenario. So I mean, this bit of this sutra where he's helping us to connect with the whole body formation through the breathing and the four postures and the four elements, I think this is just some really meaty practice instruction. One that promises a lot of happiness that we can put it to the test. Yes. I know in sutra it talks a lot about internal and external. Sutra very, very talks about external. Yes. And I read that the external is contemplating that other people have the same experiences. Could you give some advice on practicing one thing? Yeah. That's part of that refrain that I said that keeps getting repeated throughout. It talks about contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally. And I mean, this is one of these things that the scholars go at a lot. What is he saying here? The classical explanation, which is what Bhikkhu Bodhi talks about in here, is that you can have insights seeing not only what's going on with you, but seeing what's going on with other people as well. And somehow with the body, it might not be so obvious. I think it's more obvious to me like when somebody's coming at me with a lot of anger. I can learn about anger and how it works by seeing what it's doing to them and seeing what it feels like to be on the receiving end of it and things like that. So I've had a lot of insights that way, like, oh, poor God, he's really pissed, that kind of thing. And understanding the nature of it and seeing how. I can often see how somebody else is suffering more with mental states than even I can myself. But the same is true with the body, that you can understand what's going on with the body and seeing what's going on with the body. And I think that's what I think is the most important thing about seeing another person. And there's some techniques where you actually sit and breathe together, you know, where you're actually watching each other's breath and working with it that way. Certainly, I think if you were working with somebody who was in pain, who was perhaps very sick or dying, and certainly, I think, like, say, the posture is one practice for people who can't move around, quadriplegics, paraplegics, or people who are bedridden for one reason or another. They can actually do the meditation watching other people move around. So thank you for your attention and your practice tonight.
