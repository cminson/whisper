So, everything is teaching us.
Ajahn Chah says, right, famously, everything is teaching us.
We learn from life.
And maybe we say implicit in that is that we either want to over-learn or under-learn from experiences.
So, over-learn. When we over-learn, we make an experience mean too much.
This or that experience disproportionately shapes our model of the world, our model of ourselves, right?
We know those experiences that have such a deep kind of emotional resonance, a deep impact that we make it mean so much.
Maybe an experience of fear, for example.
We can over-learn from it. We can generalize in ways that are not justified.
Like it mean too much about the rest of our life.
That experience means too much.
There's so much feeling and so much affect, so many thoughts that we endow it with this enormous significance.
We can over-learn, but we can also under-learn, under-learn.
And by under-learn, what I'm pointing to is the way we can fail to appreciate that this experience has implications for everything else.
And in our Dharma practice, we're sort of weaving and bobbing between over-learning and under-learning.
We're trying to learn.
And this week, I'll be exploring the theme of mortality.
And the ways we can learn from it, the ways in which you can be softened or hardened by it.
And this is a zone where we can over-learn or we can under-learn.
We can endow it with too many meanings or too few.
We can on the one hand just appreciate mortality, death is not such a big deal.
And we can also appreciate the depth of poignancy, this life, birth, death.
And so I'm thinking about this really because I sort of always am, but also had a death in the family one month ago.
And I've just been watching my heart, watching my heart.
And trying to appreciate the ordinariness of death, you know, like at the funeral, the gravediggers were like very respectful.
But they're there having a very different day than everyone else.
They're having their day, they're coordinating, they're eating their lunch, very, very ordinary.
And we ought not make death seem too ordinary or we must not miss its significance.
We ought not under-learn.
Or Kafka wrote, the meaning of life is that it stops.
And we can interpret that in a kind of very bleak way that death blots out all meaning, meaning of life is that it stops.
And here that finitude is what makes anything meaningful.
Immortality obliterates meaning.
Life is meaningful because it ends.
This week is about death supporting life, informing life, teaching us about dhamma, the ways that mortality informs our practice.
And I consider this sacred ground sacred ground.
I remember I was 29 years old and I was doing the year to live practice, Stephen Levine's practice of, you know, following a book with a group and living as if it's the last year of one's life.
And I was 29 and healthy.
I remember telling my neighbor who lived right across the hall and she was a Holocaust survivor, her entire family was killed and very, you know, that was an ever-present reality in her life.
And I remember she asked me about the program, like, what are you doing?
And then I remember her indignation, you know, when I explain this practice, you know.
I remember her saying like, you know, you weren't there, you weren't in the camps, you don't know, you don't play games.
Don't play games with this question, you know.
And, yeah, I don't know.
And I'm trying to understand and ask your understanding.
We all have our own relationship to this question and this is sacred ground.
I'm old enough now where Kaiser is actively searching for my death and testing my body each year and this year, negative, next year.
I don't know.
That's not negative forever.
My maternal, paternal grandmother, paternal grandmother died when my dad was 12, just before his bar mitzvah, actually.
And my paternal grandfather had mental illness and often thought he was dying even when he wasn't.
And maybe not an accident that both of their children studied medicine, my dad and uncle, study medicine, trying to navigate, master the realm of illness and birth and death.
And so somehow I've always kind of, yeah, just felt the presence of death, the meaning of it, trying not to underlearn or overlearn from it.
And so how can our Dharma practice be informed by this?
How can our wisdom and love be informed by mortality?
And I sometimes say something like, a good death starts now, good death starts now.
I get that, but I said that in some retreat in this yogi in one of our practice meetings, very thoughtfully kind of pushed back.
I was so struck by what she said, she said, like, what do you mean by a good death?
And she said that very great mystery, you know, really equivalent to the mystery of life.
And I took what she said to heart, you know, don't know.
And so we respect that, respect the mystery of it all. And I don't know that Dharma or anything is a kind of perfect, perfect consolation for death,
changing this of all things, maybe the perfect consolation.
But it's pretty good. It's pretty good.
So that's our theme for this week, how death can inform our practice, inform our samadhi, our sila, sense of self, inform our love, how death can inform our love.
So I'm happy to be with you and exploring this.
So may, yeah, may we have a good day and see you tomorrow.
