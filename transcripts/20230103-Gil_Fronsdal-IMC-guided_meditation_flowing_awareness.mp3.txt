 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone. Hello everyone. Hello everyone. Hello everyone. And for those of us here locally, we're kind of in a lull between storms. And maybe meditation practice for some of you is a lull between different kinds of storms. A kind of a Sabbath or a sacred pause in the middle of busyness or preoccupations. So welcome. In Japanese Buddhism, Zen, a monk, especially a young monk, is sometimes referred to by the title of an Unsui, U-N-S-U-I. And it's the combination of two words, cloud and water. And so it's kind of maybe an affectionate way of referring to a young monk who is to practice being like clouds and waters, not offering any resistance to anything, but kind of flowing freely and relaxedly between things or around things or through things. That offers no resistance but also takes the path of least resistance to go forward. So it's interesting to take this as an analogy or metaphor for what we do with our awareness when we meditate. That there is a kind of way that using awareness, being aware, being mindful is something we do. And so that while we do that, we can cease, stop quiet, being involved in all the other things that the mind usually gets involved in. So it's interesting to settle the water of awareness onto breathing in the body. But then to notice that this the doing, the activity of being aware, gets interrupted by things, gets interrupted by our thoughts and our preoccupations, gets interrupted by our reactivity to what's happening. If we don't like it, we don't or we really want it. And this interruption in the activity of being aware of being mindful is to be noticed, but then bring back the flow of awareness, the flow of the water and just kind of flow around, recognize, bump up against whatever is happening. But you just let the awareness be like water that flows around and comes back to the to the bottom of the lake, the quiet place of the lake in your body with your breathing, being aware with your breathing, flowing with your breathing. So maybe this metaphor is meaningful. So to assume meditation posture, one that allows certain kind of feeling of aliveness in your body, whether it's repositioning your hands and arms so that they're not completely passive, but also not active, kind of alive. Even if for some for a simple as turning the palms up to the ceiling, if usually your palms are down, can give a little bit of aliveness. So a sense of being vitality in the body, closing the eyes and then feeling whatever vitality or energy there is in the body, even if you're mostly tired and exhausted. Where in the body is there some aliveness, some vitality? And letting taking a few long, slow breaths, expanding the body and expanding into that place of vitality, almost as if you can expand it. Taking a few long deep breaths and relaxing, settling into the body, and letting the breathing return to normal. And the more held or tense the body is, the more difficult it is for the awareness to flow like water. The more things are kind of frozen, frozen water. So as you exhale, relax the muscles of your face. It might be helpful to drop your mouth open slightly and then float it back together. And the exhale, relaxing the shoulders, softening, almost as if something is melting in the shoulders and flowing down below into the chest, down the arms. And relaxing, softening the belly. And a global softening of the body in the exhale. And for two or three breaths on the exhale, relaxing the thinking mind, softening the mind. Quieting the thinking mind a bit. And then having your awareness, settle into the body breathing, settle into how the body experiences breathing. Quieting the thinking mind a bit. And the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out, maybe can be seen as undulations of the waves on the ocean. Maybe a gentle rising of the wave, rising up on a wave and down the other side. Awareness floating, riding the undulations. Knowledge where there is a kind of vitality in being aware If we're offered a little effort or see awareness as being something we gently do, we do it and there's a vitality and aliveness and being aware where awareness is maybe like water flowing over through with your breathing. And if your mental vitality goes anywhere else into your thoughts, your reactions, notice that the flow of awareness has stopped or hindered, diminished. Begin again with the flow of awareness flowing through or around, offering no resistance to anything, but finding the path of least a risk resistance around and through and under, back to the breathing. Keep flowing with your awareness, gentle, calmly. Keep flowing with your awareness, gentle, calmly. Let being aware be an activity, a gentle, gentle, doing that flows along so your mind does not get caught up in other doings. Notice when awareness stops or is lost and find a way to flow around your thoughts, your occupations, keep it flowing. Even if it has to continuously flow around something, it touches it, feels it, knows it and flows on and on. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, the path of harmony for love is to flow where there's receptivity, to flow where there's openings, to flow around and over, but never to assert, never to push the path of kindness, of friendliness, is soft like water, but always there available, flowing, ready to flow into where there's, it's welcomed. And when it's not, it just flows around, never disappointed, a kindness that needs nothing in return like water that just flows. And may it be that our care, our kindness, our love for the world flows through us freely and openly, generously because it nourishes us, it's healthy for us, it is us and may it be that our good will, our well-wishing flows in the path of least resistance to touch all people with our care, kindness, our friendliness. May the world know that we care, that we wish that all beings be happy, that all beings be safe, that all beings be peaceful, that all beings be free and may our good will support that in happening. Thank you. Thank you.
