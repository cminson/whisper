 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning and welcome. Nice to be back after being gone for a while. So, most recently I was at Spirit Rock teaching a week-long retreat. And I'll be here this week and then I'm going off to teach another retreat next Sunday. So it is poignant for me to be back. I appreciate so much the opportunity to do this teaching and to be with all of you on YouTube and see your names in the chat. Thank you very much. So, during this week I'd like to generally continue with the topic of compassion that I've done the last few weeks that I've been here. And as we begin today for a guided meditation, I would like to suggest a way of beginning that may come as a bit of a surprise to mindfulness practitioners. And that is to begin by thinking, rather than putting your thinking aside and not giving it any role for this practice. Begin with thinking for maybe a minute or two to think about how you are right now. Not just, you know, how are you, but to think about it. You know, what is it really and how is it and what might be a wise way of being with yourself the way you are. What might be a useful way to practice? Given how you are, what might be a useful, what might be a useful posture to be in for meditation? If you're tense, maybe a more relaxed posture. If you're tired, maybe a more alert upright posture. If you're aware of how you are feeling emotionally, what would be a useful attitude to have as you meditate? So these are all questions you can ask yourself. Questions that attune yourself to what's happening for you and how to meet it in practice, how to include it, or how to maybe even what to ignore at times because it's not really to the point. Maybe if you're mostly concerned about menus, dinner menus for the rest of the week, maybe you don't have to spend meditation thinking about those menus. But maybe there's some anxiety underneath those thoughts. So think about and recognize what's happening here and if there is anxiety, what would be useful? So I encourage you to spend about two minutes now just thinking about what's happening, how to be with it, as a way of attuning yourself, dialing in, in preparation for meditation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then if you are concerned with some challenge in your life and you're thinking about it, is the thinking somehow identified or entangled with the story, the events, the situation? Are there stories that are self-critical or involve self-pity, feeling sorry for yourself? What kind of thoughts do you have if you're aware or concerned with some challenge? And then see if you can step away a little bit and look upon what's happening with the challenge or thoughts and take a minute or so to think about it as an objective observer, not identified, not critical, not wanting anything or not wanting anything. Just thinking about it, looking upon it objectively, thinking about given that this is going on, what's a useful way to practice with it? What's a useful way to meditate? Maybe it's to put it aside for now and return to it later when you're more centered. And now having spent some time thinking, let the thinking mind rest. Let it relax. It's done its job and now it does not need it so much. And now take some long, slow, deep breaths. And as you exhale to relax into the body, letting your breathing return to normal. And again, as in the exhale, softening, relaxing the tensions in the body. And again, as in the exhale, relaxing the tensions in the body. And again, as in the exhale, relaxing the tensions in the body. As you exhale, calming the thinking mind. As you exhale, letting the mind rest in the body. The mind does not have to work so much. Let it rest in the body. With awareness centered in the breathing, the rhythm of breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. So then as we come to the end of the sitting, let yourself think again, freely about whatever benefit that has come from this minute sitting, meditating. Are you more self-aware? Are you calmer? Are you more centered, more grounded? Are you not more open? Maybe you're not so aware of specifics, but you appreciate the opportunity to meditate. Imagine what it'd be like, think about what it'd be like to live in the world with those benefits. As you go about your daily life today, how might those personal benefits be shared with others so they can benefit as well? May it be that this practice that we do benefits the world, those close to us, those not so close, those people we don't know, all beings. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free from all suffering. May beings be free of oppression, war, starvation, poverty. And may it be how we live this life of ours, that we support these possibilities. May all beings be happy. So thank you all. And while I take a moment to drink my water, I'd be curious if some of you would put in the chat what was beneficial or what was it like to spend the first few minutes of meditation thinking in the way that I suggested. I'd like to maybe read a range of how it was.
