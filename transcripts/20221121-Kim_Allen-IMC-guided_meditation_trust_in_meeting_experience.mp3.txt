 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, well, I think we'll go ahead and get started as people continue to arrive. Nice to see everyone. So this week, the theme is called Meeting Life Well, Five Dharma Resources. One could say that Dharma practice is a series of encounters. We sit on the cushion, and we meet the state of our body and mind in detail. And then we go out into the world and we meet other people, situations in our life. And amid all of that, we have our own mind's reaction going on also. So there's a lot going on in human life. And as we encounter our life, on what resources do we draw in order to meet it well and to respond well? Are there supportive qualities or assets that can come forth, in particular, when things get challenging or surprising or unfamiliar? Of course, I think we all know that mindfulness is essential. So we might call that the foundational resource. But the Buddha also named other qualities as forms of inner wealth or fortitude. And there's a list of five items that I like to call the Five Dharma Resources. That's my term, not the Buddha's. But you'll see as this week unfolds that these five, when they're readily available for us, can serve as highly helpful resources to meet life well. And the first of them is confidence. So we'll see the others as we go on. But let's go ahead and start sitting. So finding a posture where you can be upright and relaxed, or at least have a straight spine. Just allowing yourself to settle into a position that's relaxed and alert. Perhaps sensing the contact points where you're sitting or lying down. Maybe some of you are standing. So feeling your seat against the cushion or chair, your legs or feet against the floor, or your body against the surface. And just feeling the support and groundedness of that. Allowing yourself to be supported. We may find that as we connect with and trust what's supporting us, there's kind of an upward surge of energy, allowing the body to be drawn upward. Just allowing that also. So as we soften down, the body straightens. Softening the muscles of the face, the eyes in the eye sockets. The jaw. Softening down through the shoulders, allowing the shoulder blades to slide down the back. And then the chest tends to put the chest just a bit forward, waiting with the heart. Allowing there to be ease in the arms and hands. And then through the torso. Softening the rib cage, front, back, sides, sensing into the heart area. Just allowing that to be as it is. And then down into the belly. Just connecting in and inviting any ease through the belly area. The hips. The inner thighs. The knees. And all the way down into the feet. Just connecting in with the whole body, however it is right now. And inviting ease. And if there's still parts that are sore or tense, or you couldn't feel them very well, that's fine. And then gently ease in the mind also about how the body is right now. Gently turning the attention toward the sensations of breathing toward the breath. And if we can, we want to connect in with the very basic elemental sensations of breathing. Rather than an idea, or even an image of our lungs or something. Really feel the touch of the air on the nostrils or the upper lip. Some sense of expansion, coolness. It moves through the air passages. Maybe there's a shift of clothing against the skin as the chest inflates. Maybe you feel it even into the belly. And then at some point the inhale ends and there's a shift in feeling as the exhale begins. The lungs soften and begin to release and there's a different movement of air. Maybe warmth. So it's all part of breath, but there are these minute simple sensations that we can allow attention to just flow along with. That is in the service of establishing the quality of mindfulness. Being in the present moment. This is the foundational resource for us. And as we get used to the being with the flow of the sensations of breathing, we can of course be aware of other body sensations. There's also the sensations in the legs and maybe you have other sensations coming forth. There's the sound of my voice or other things in the room or the house where you are. And we can just breathe along with those. There may also be some emotion or mood present for you. It may not be prominent or it may be. We may have sense of tiredness or sadness or ease, joy, irritation. It could be anything we can breathe along with that also. And it's common also to have thoughts going on. Meditation is not about eliminating all thoughts. But we can simply be aware when there's thinking going on. So if you have some thoughts present, you can kind of breathe through them or along with them. Not trying to shut it off, but also not turning toward it. Silence. When the mind has wandered away, it's fine to just gently reopen to all these objects. When awareness returns, just start again with the breath or the body. Being with what's present. Just being simple. Anything in our experience can be touched or known by awareness. Anything actually. So this may generate some trust in this quality of knowing as the initial foundational way to meet life. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And we'll keep sitting in silence after that. So please recall how you first encountered the Dharma or meditation or mindfulness. How is it that you somehow came into contact with that? And then move on to recalling what kept you going with it. Even if you're quite new, or if you have started and stopped a number of times. What keeps you coming back? And then if you can kind of feel underneath the specifics, if there's some kind of quality like trust or confidence, or you might even call it faith in what you're doing with this practice. It doesn't have to be anything you can name or explain. It's more like the underlying feeling there. See if you can tap into that. And then perhaps with a bow to our heart, we can just go back to sitting with the flow of experience, perhaps infused a little bit with this sense of trust in the process of meeting it. However that feels for you right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Gently bringing the attention to the body sitting. Just in these last few minutes. Just touching in again to the upright posture. Particularly sensing into the chest area. Breathing in and out of that space. Allowing the shoulders to soften. To be forward a bit. The way it is on a Buddha statue. And the way it is on a Buddha statue. And the way it is on a Buddha statue. And the way it is on a Buddha statue. And the way it is on a Buddha statue. Is conveyed. Even silently. Definitely doesn't need to be overt. Or verbal. When I first attended a Sangha, just a local sitting group. And I was not at that time. I was not at that time. I was not at that time. I was not at that time. I was not at that time. So is there a way that. Whatever your sense of trust in the Dharma or in mindfulness. Might somehow just be part of your being as you go about today. With the hope that. Somehow that will be picked up. By others. Not even in a really a conscious way. But our way of being does subtly influence others. The world needs people who are confident in being present. For whatever's happening. May that be something that we can offer from our practice.
