 Okay, thank you, thank you. Maybe building a little bit on what Jerry said, I'm gonna talk about listening, because of course we don't just speak, we don't just talk, we don't give a speaking. And it's maybe noteworthy that in the eighth old path, there isn't right listening, but maybe we might think that part of the reason is because the equivalent today might be like right reading. Because listening was how all information was shared back then. And right now, if we think about how much resources and time in our lives is put toward learning to read, understanding, and how much help there is for people who don't read, or don't read well, or something like this, we might think about, okay, so listening back then, I had the same type of idea or same type of function, I should say, as speaking, I'm sorry, as listening. Maybe writing was about speaking, reading was about listening, right? And we see this that in poly, what we often translate as the description of a learned person is literally means a person who has heard a lot. So part of listening is to be able to gain some knowledge. And certainly we see this, the Buddha, and lots of passages saying, listen carefully, I will speak. So he's even like saying this specifically, reminding those who are listening to him, you know, pay attention, this is what noteworthy what I'm going to say. And we, as Kim was pointing to also, we might even take note that the Buddha himself, of course, was a great listener, because part of the way that he would engage with individuals who came to him with a question or a comment is that a number of different ways he would engage, but all them required that he was listening. Sometimes he uses the same language, the same key words that others had used, but maybe he's adding a little twist in their definition or broadening the definition of them. Or maybe when somebody's asked him a question, he asks a question back. Just this is a way that we can indicate that he was listening, he was paying attention, of course he was, to the people who were approaching him. So listening is an integral part of the practice, even if it's not part of the eight-foam pan. And we know that there's this course of practice, this progress of practice, sometimes it's called the gradual training. We taught, the four of us taught a course on this. Now I don't remember exactly when it was, but it always begins with somebody hearing the Dharma, listening to the Dharma and feeling inspired, feeling some confidence like, yes, this is something I wanna do. And then that begins a whole cascade of practices where they can find freedom. So this idea that the liberating process begins just by listening. And we could say by maybe hearing something, not just hearing, but engaging with something that touches our hearts, touches our minds. Maybe one more thing I'll say, kind of like tying in this idea of listening as being an integral part of practice is that there's a real connection between mindfulness and listening. Right, to really listen as opposed to just hear, but to listen is to give a little bit more attention and to lean in a little bit, rather than just half-heartedly kind of being not quite engaged, but to be mindful, to be really present. Because of course, listening happens in the present moment. So I talked about how listening to the Dharma is an integral part of a practice. And I talked about how the Buddha himself was a good listener, but also for us to listen to each other, what other people are saying, of course, of course, right? Not only is this a sign of respect, but it's also a way for us to practice some of these wholesome qualities that are such a support for our practice, some generosity, giving people the benefit of the doubt, some generosity of our time and energy to really show up. And this idea of listening being really important is in one particular sutta, that here's an excerpt from it. You can know whether or not a person has what's required by seeing how they take part in a discussion. If they lend an ear, they have what's required. If they don't lend an ear, they don't have what's required. And then it goes on to say, someone who has what's required directly knows one thing, understands one thing, gives up one thing, realizes one thing and experiences complete freedom. So quickly, as I'll say, what they know is the path of practice. What they understand is the truth of dukkha, dissatisfaction, suffering. What they give up is unwholesome qualities and what they realize is liberation. So the Buddha is really tying in this idea of listening and awakening. So it might be that, I mean, I'm not telling us anything that we don't already know. We all know we should listen, right? Perhaps our teachers have told us, when we were kids in school, our parents have told us, but so why is it that sometimes we don't listen well? Why aren't we engaged? And it might be that part of our conditioning, for whatever reasons, might be that we want to be right. So we're not really listening. We're more just formulating our response in such a way that we can be right, or we just want to get our own way. So we are, again, only listening half-heartedly, but more just spending time how we can have a counter argument to make sure we get what we want. Or we may want to be viewed positively. We want people to like us. Maybe we want people to think we're smart. Maybe we want people to think that we're nice and compassionate. So we're not really paying attention to what others are saying, but instead we're just trying to fulfill our wishes, our wishes, our maybe our conditions. Or maybe we just want to stay comfortable. So we're not listening. Maybe what we're hearing is a little bit uncomfortable, and we're just trying to change the topic or twist it around or something like this. This is part of what it means to be a human. We're not bad people because we do this, but this practice is an invitation for us to notice. When are we only listening so that we can come up with an effective counter argument and not really showing up for others, not really tuning into what they're saying with a generosity of spirit? Doesn't mean we have to agree with everybody. It doesn't mean that we don't have to defend ourselves, all these types of things, but to show up in a way that brings freedom to ourselves and maybe even helps the other person find some more freedom. The freedom that maybe can arise is when you feel like you've been hurt, when you feel like, oh yeah, somebody is here, present with me. Maybe they don't completely understand, but they are here. Then there might be something that relaxes in the one that's speaking. Maybe they can find some greater wisdom or some new understanding. Then maybe I will say one last thing here. I've been talking about listening and listening as part of the practice, listening to others, but also so much of this practice is listening to ourselves. Noticing the impact of what is being said, what we're hearing, listening like, oh, ouch, or like, oh, like with some warm heart, oh, or some compassion may come forth. But can we be aware of that and still keep our focus on what's being said, so not get lost in the stories, but not be dismissive of our own experiences too. As well as notice any unconscious bias we might have. Just notice, are we interpreting everything through one particular filter? Is everything, are we not listening to what they're saying because we didn't like the tone of their hair or tone of their speak, color of their hair, something like this, but are we not, is there a way in which we just have put a filter on everything that we're hearing? And then can we have compassion for ourselves if we discover that we do have bias or if we are feeling not completely present, is there a way that we can continue to show up with some openness and some warmth? And this is a practice, this is a practice, right? It doesn't mean that just because you've heard it once means forever more, you're going to be able to doing this, of course, but the better we understand what's going on within ourselves, then the better we can understand the obstructions and better that we can listen to others and have an integral part of our practice. So with that, I'll turn it over to Ying. Thank you, Diana. Thank you for all the questions. So we are going to then right away, we're going to have a dynamic talk, listening to practice a little bit of a mindful listening. And so we will be meditating for a short while. And so if you want to just use a few moments to shift your body into a, it's not a long sitting, it's just a short 10, 15 minutes of meditative practice. And we'll engage in this listening practice in a formal way. Yeah, just take a few moments to settle into a sitting posture that may be supportive for sitting in some stillness for a short while. If you'd like to gently close your eyes, feel free to do so. The body needs a little bit of the movements before you settle down. So just be generous for the movements. Once you take a seat, inviting a sense of arriving, arriving here and now. Again, offer some generosity for this arriving process to unfold. And make still lingering thoughts. And that's okay. And the body may feel energetic in some way. And that's okay. Just notice, body and mind, heart are arriving here and now. Feeling the contact of the body, or the floor, or the chairs. Resting down. Resting down. Allow mindfulness to become the forefront of your experience. Maybe you're aware of the body, the sensations in the body. Maybe you're aware of the sound, the sound of my voice, the ambient sound. Maybe there is a little more grounding that's felt in the body. And that's okay. And that's okay. So just be generous with the body. And that's okay. And that's okay. And that's okay. So just be generous with the body. A little more grounding that's felt right now as you settle in. More blush. Gently open your awareness to receive, the embodied experiences. The experiences. Awareness can be open to receive sound and silence in between the sound. Maybe there is the listening of the sound through our ears. One of the sense of faculties. Maybe there is a sense of listening through our bodies. Vibrations of the sound forcing through the body. The silence and quiet in the body. The sound fades away. And that's okay. And that's okay. And that's okay. Also listen to the inner voices. Maybe there are the thoughts. Maybe in the emotions. Maybe listening to the inner voices and dynamics. You are embodied by this. Maybe feeling into the tones of the inner voice. You are already practicing internal and external mindfulness. Noticing any inner dialogues. Receiving them through the body. As in the cells of the body. Those have to communicate with the inner voices. The body is tensed up. The body feels relaxed at ease. There is a story of a reporter interviewing Mother Teresa. And he asks Mother Teresa, I'm told that you are praying every day to God. What do you say to God? And Mother Teresa replied, I listen. I listen to God. And the reporter asked, What does the God say to you? And Mother Teresa said, God listens. And the reporter wasn't very satisfied and pressed on. And Mother Teresa, what the God listens to. And Mother Teresa said, If you don't understand it, I can't explain it. So trust your listening. Thank you. So we are moving to yet another mode of conversing and exchanging. And so we will open up for additional questions that you may have. Or comments, something you want to share with the group. Again, use your Zoom hand if possible. Okay. And Stanley. Hi. Thank you. I just thought of something. Someone told me once about when someone shares a story with you or speaks to you that that's a gift. So that's what's come to mind. I just wanted to share that. Beautiful, beautiful. There are always some perspectives that's supportive of us opening up and engaging in Fusan and wise ways. And seeing it as a gift, we kind of shift our inner dynamics with this. Thank you for sharing that. Maybe I'll just add that I also heard this such an epic impact on me. This idea that completely independent of whether or not it's articulated well or said in your preferred way, everybody's trying to communicate something. And so to show up for others and in that kind of way. And so, you know, getting past the ideas of whether it's the best way that they could be doing it, but just trying to feel and to understand what are they trying to convey here. Maybe it's that same thing, Stanley, it's a gift in some way. Casey. Yeah, good morning, everyone. Yeah, I just so appreciating this time and teaching. What just came up for me with regards to listening was I'm wondering if there's a time where you should restrict listening in terms of if someone's being verbally and emotionally abusive or hostile or or also like another case where if you're trying to listen to your inner voice that people are telling you what you should do and protecting either their fears their opinion. So thank you. Thank you. So much to respond to this and I want to take a pause and just invite my co teachers to see if there's anyone wanted to respond to cases cases question. Maybe I'll just say briefly. Thank you, Casey for bringing this up. I think it's important to allow ourselves to be the subject of verbal abuse or some way in which somebody is speaking to us or communicating with us in a way that's harmful. That's not at all what we want to do. Part of the, maybe the art of communication is knowing when is it best to say you know, I don't allow people to speak to me that way. I'm going to go in the other room right now. There might be times in which that's occasion appropriate or to say this pause, you know, I can't hear you anymore because I'm no longer present I'm feeling activated or something so I think let's best for us to stop right now or there's different ways in which this might come up but thank you Casey for bringing this up by all means we don't mean to suggest that just listen to everything all the time. And maybe Ying and Kim do you have something you'd like to add? Yeah, I'd just say that what Diana said also reminded me to the second part of your question in terms of when others have a lot of strong opinions and you should do this, you should do that. In the later part of our course, we will also be teaching about how we begin to discern what's wise, what's useful and cultivating some levels of discernment. Allow us to begin to be able to differentiate what's really beneficial, what's needed in this being, in this dynamic can be very helpful. And this aspect of cultivating external internal awareness and external awareness to feel into if the conversation comes from a strong sense of imposing something upon us versus out of care and compassion can be supportive. If the Kim has anything to add? Yeah, I think this fits right in with our understanding that we are included in the field of our mindfulness. So sometimes we believe mindfulness is either something that we just do internally, or it's something where we need to give all of our attention to another person, but there's more of this ecosystem idea where we need to be present for what's beneficial or harmful for myself, the other and both. And so if we're listening to something that is afflictive to us, then that doesn't work in the ecosystem. So something needs to be some action needs to be taken along the lines that Diana suggested. So just always making sure that we include ourselves as part of the big picture. So Heidi, maybe that's the last question. It's not really a question. It's kind of a, maybe it's a question of our comments, but there's also which part of ourselves is listening, right. So sometimes we can feel like it's hurtful speech, but it really isn't because it's the part of us that we're bringing to the table that's listening. And to go back to that mindfulness of like who's listening to this. Thank you. Thank you for mentioning that. That's right. I'm being able to observe which part can have a tremendous power as we engage. So I'm going to give it to Diana for her to help us wrap up today. Great. Thank you. And I just saw this chat quickly. Sometimes I can see the chat sometimes I can't just let people know this, but it depends whether my zoom screen is wide or narrow whether I'm looking at notes or not. So just a heads up about that. I can't always see the chats. I think that's true for all of us. So I tried to, but not always. But I did see this one for my name. Can Diana share that suit reference? Fantastic. Guess what you're going to get in an email after this class. So we have just a few suit of quotes that we'll share with you for this, this teaching and kind of like tying this into the suitas. And we're going to refrain from giving the usual suits of quotes. Many of you are familiar with right speech from the Eightfold Path. And if you aren't now and you're in the Eightfold Path program you soon will be. But we'll, throughout this course, we'll be kind of expanding and looking at speech from a number of different angles and a different emphases. And of course these are being recorded as well. So you'll receive an email with some, some suit of quotes from today. So, and then, as well as a link to the recordings. And we'll see you on Tuesday morning. And is there anything that my co-teachers would like to add before we end our time together? No, Kim says no. And Ying says no too. Okay. Okay. So what a pleasure it has been to practice together. It really is, that kind of fills my heart up that what a beautiful thing. Can you imagine like what this world would be like if so many people got together to talk about, okay, how can we communicate well? This is how the world changes is by people being thoughtful about communicating well. So thank you. Thank you for showing up and thank you for engaging in whatever way that you did. Thank you. So if you'd like, we can unmute and say goodbye in an unruly way. So goodbye and thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, Christina. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye.
