 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome, welcome. Nice to see you all. Nice to see you all. Nice to be sharing this practice. So today I'd like to talk a little bit or maybe just to build a little bit on this idea of this first phrase that we say when we're saying loving kindness phrases. May you be safe. So just to talk a little bit about safety, certainly not everything that could be said about it, but just want to add one little thing about this. And that is something that I stumbled upon and I've been thinking about it and I find really intriguing and evocative and uplifting and inspiring and something for me to really be considering. And that is that our being truthful in our speech is directly related to creating safety. We say we have this expression, may you be safe. But there's a way, this author, Gregory Kramer, some of you may know him, he's a Dharma teacher and has a book out. He writes that our deceit, those times in which we're not telling the truth, can be cancerous. And the way that it just grows through a community. That is the obvious ones, right, if that we're not telling the truth or exaggerating or, or just, you know, like blatantly lying or maybe even just kind of lying or omitting the whole truth or something like this. The recipients of our lives or those who hear us do this, in conversation with us, they may simply stop trusting us, right, if they discover it. This is not news to anybody, of course. But they may also stop trust us when we start telling the truth to write, then maybe they start to, you know, our credibility, our trustworthiness our integrity has been compromised. Or if they do believe us. Maybe they distrust others who are saying something different. Or maybe they begin to distrust themselves. Wow, really, I could have swore it was this way but this person saying it's another way. Am I like, something wrong with me or I certainly have had this situation where I had made plans to meet somebody at somewhere this was many, many years ago. And the other person didn't show up. And then later when I was saying what happened I thought you were going to a shop. No, we didn't agree but we had agreed but this person just didn't. I don't know for whatever reason, just trying to make me feel like we hadn't made this agreement, but I know that we did. It's just then I just started to feel weird about myself and everything so that's one way in which are being deceitful, kind of expressed as a cancer through our communities, and is the opposite of safety. Another way is that others may be see that lying is necessary to protect their interests too. They might think like, Oh, okay, if this person's lying in order and they may attribute a motive for that. Maybe I better lie to you. If I have anything that smells or looks like the motive that we are imagining that other person is trying to hide. If I have a similar motive I better lie and cover that up as well. Because whatever that motive was is clearly unacceptable or something like this right so or they may feel compelled to protect themselves in a way if they feel like, Oh, if this person is lying, it must not be a safe place around here, around here whatever community. And maybe they become silent and no longer really freely share, or maybe, as I said, maybe they start lying themselves but in this way, this dishonesty and mistrust really becomes contagious. And I hadn't thought about it so much as if this coming contagious within a community I was thinking like, you know, there's one individual to another individual, but there's a way in which the line just breeds all kinds of ways in that out in which people don't feel safe. So, we, with loving kindness practice we're saying, may you be safe. But there's also a connection to our behavior. In addition to you know loving kindness practice. One way that we can help people feel safe is to be careful with our words. Be careful with what we say. And to protect our integrity and to protect our trustworthiness. It's worthwhile. It's worthwhile doing that. Okay, so with that as an introduction. Maybe before we jump right into meditation practice maybe I'll just say, I'm linking, telling the truth with loving kindness practice through the bridge of safety, we both are related to safety. But I also want to highlight and those of you who've been practicing for a while, don't need me to tell you this you know it. We start to feel less and less like we have to hide something, like we have to show up in only one particular way. We don't care for ourselves. We really want to take care of our own integrity or credibility. And we start to have this confidence that no matter what happens, we can find our way with it. With loving kindness practice helps gives the mind and the heart, maybe a sense of safety themselves, which helps us to show up with speaking the truth. So, with that as an introduction let's begin some meditation practice. Just taking a meditation posture. A posture that feels comfortable that you can hold for a little bit of time without too much discomfort, as well as it kind of expressing some intention to meditate. Even expressing some dignity that we have respect that we have for ourselves. Just feeling into the body. Just feeling the pressure, the chair, or cushion couch or bed or wherever you're sitting feeling the pressure against the body. Grounded connected. Letting the attention come to the sensations of breathing. Just noticing the experience of breathing. Noticing the movement of the chest, movement of the belly, or the feeling of air going in and out of the nose. relationships. Maybe beginning with just the aspiration, the intention to just be there with the entirety of an exhale. The same, the middle, the end. And then setting that intention. And then the entire inhale, the beginning, middle and end of an inhale, the in breath. And then setting that intention. And bringing our attention to the transitions between inhales and exhales. And then setting that intention. And then to begin our loving kindness practice, remembering that we can always come back to this mindfulness of breathing practice. To mind a lovable being, someone for whom it's easy and complicated to have a sworn hearted feeling, to have good will, care, benevolence, kindness, love. Someone you know, someone you don't know. Maybe a being that you imagine, whomever it might be. And you connect with this lovable being in a warm hearted way. And to support our cultivation of loving kindness, can say these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Connecting with them. Be freshening up the visualization, this lovable being. And then to expand this loving kindness to include a good friend. Bringing them to mind. And of course, we wish safety, health, and happiness and ease for our friends too. One way we can support safety is with what we say. Be careful with the truth. And wishing our friend. May you be safe. May you live with ease. May you be happy. May you live with ease. May you live with ease. One way we can take care of our friends is to be honest. Honesty with recognizing the right time to say things. Honesty with sensitivity. Honesty with warmth. Connecting with our good friend. And a good heartedness that is arising to be a support. Be a foundation on which more loving kindness, more care can be built, shared. And then to extend our loving kindness further, include ourselves, of course. Including ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Can we extend the same warm heartedness to ourselves? Can we extend the same care to ourselves? Can we extend the same warm heartedness to ourselves? May I live with ease. May I be safe. And of course, one in a ways we can help with our feelings say is to protect our integrity, our trustworthiness. And others don't feel like they need to deceive us. Thank you. Thank you. May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. And then to extend our loving kindness to those we don't know. Choosing somebody we don't have a relationship with. A neutral person. Maybe somebody we see in the neighborhood on occasion. Maybe somebody on this Zoom call. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Thank you. Thank you. To this idea of helping to create safety for others. There's so many ways we can do this, but one is with our words that we say. And sometimes we say, I'm not compromising my ethics. So maybe that sounds even a little bit. I don't know. I don't know what word it is, a prudish maybe or something like this, but it's sometimes we just overlook it. I think it's worthwhile to pay attention and allow us to honor and respect. And to appreciate that. So I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms and talk about this idea about the importance of safety as well as the link between our language and what we and creating safety for others. So I'm going to try to straight up these rooms here a little bit. Sorry, sometimes this takes me a little more effort. Okay. More people are abandoned each ship as we go. I'm trying to like even out the room so then, you know, more people need so my apologies if by the time you actually get into a room. I'm setting them up so that they're even but right you can imagine how this happens in terms of people leave at the last minute. So, I think many of you have done this so many times, this recognition that just an encouragement to be open to be like stimulated for new ideas, as opposed to telling others exactly what you know, just an opportunity to listen and maybe hear some ideas like oh yeah it's not a bit that way, as opposed to just telling long stories that you already know. So, we'll be in groups of three I think here. And you can, if it's helpful you can choose to go in order, we'll say alphabetical order. And we'll meet for about 14 minutes so you have an opportunity to this discussion, and here we go. Okay, so welcome back. Welcome back. Does anybody have a comment or a question or something they'd like to share. Yes, Neil. So, what right. I find that the most difficult part about being honest is not being honest with other people but being honest with myself. You know, and, you know, I don't find so much that I'm telling lies to other people, although, you know, I mean, sometimes you know I guess I would tell, you know, mislead or tell a white lie but you know I don't. You know I'm not convinced that's a problem and it might, it certainly might be good. But I do find I'm repeating the lies I tell myself sometimes, you know, this is complicated. Yes, yes. I would say so much about this, about the practice of truthfulness remarks say is really about kind of like the talk last night and I called it the antidote to self delusion right this not telling ourselves lines. So, one way to work with us is just to notice. Is there one. They seem like they have a common flavor, maybe, and then just to, for example, of wanting something because I want something. I'm not seeing clearly how the way this might harm others or. I don't know what what else it might be. So, one way to work with it could be, well, I'm just going to look at my behavior and the things that I say, and just keep an eye out when this wanting, whatever it might be arises and I'm just kind of practice for a while, with a warm heart with compassion with some spaciousness. So instead of like I'm talking myself lies, maybe just take if there's a family of lies, or if there's a family of motives that are underneath the lies, just take one at a time and work with someone. When it arises like what's going on, what are the conditions that's making me feel like I want to behave in this way right now. What, how do I feel what's what's my mind state. Am I tired and my feeling hassled or harried or I don't know those types of things. What do you think now. That was a lovely answer. Thank you. Great, great. I thought about what's the, what's the right or the feeling to know where when you're saying too much is like this is some people you ask how are you feeling you end up knowing that their life completely TMI one point you say maybe it's too much. So what was the feeling that kind of tells you, I think will be an okay to say this much, instead of too much. But the truth. Yeah, about the truth or. Yeah, so, I feel. Yeah, I wonder if what you're talking about is something a little bit with intimacy right okay, is it can I share this much, or is it safe here to share this much with this person at this time. We share a lot in South America and here usually when I say something usually I get the answer, well thank you for sharing I'm like, wow, I didn't think that was chair and I was like, Hello, this is my day. So, it looks like there is a limit and. And how do you feel about this I feel this or I feel all this. And that's sometimes tricky for me to find that place where is still okay and still true. And after that will be too much information will be like, maybe that's for me to know or some other people to know. Yeah, I'll say that sometimes when I feel like I've said too much is that I'm a little bit disconnected from myself. There is I feel like this momentum to push and share, and I'm just like, you know, just comes all these words or something. And then I realized, Oh, wow. Okay. What was that but somehow I'm no longer really speaking from my heart, or maybe there's a little bit of anger that hasn't been processed or metabolized or something like this, but you may also just be pouring into a simple cultural sense. Right. That's, you know, here in North America, we're a little bit more stiff or we strained or something like this and. And I don't know, does it, does it feel like it's a big problem. I want to think that it's lovely that people from different cultures have different ways we don't all have to be the same, but I'm saying that living in the culture that I'm from so it was easy for me to say that's right but I don't know if this is helpful at all, Philippe. Yeah, there it is. Thank you. Thank you. We're a little bit over but let's go on and we need them if you'd like to. Well let me just add, I was speaking to the folks I was speaking to. What, what is it, where is it where the Buddhist, he comes across some students or monks, and he sort of asked them what they're talking about and they talk about it and he says well you should either, if you're not talking about practice, or something you know or something very mundane don't don't talk at all what, what is that saying. Yeah yeah so that's definitely in there. And I think what you said at the beginning is really telling. I was just talking to monastics. Yeah, it's a little bit different than I would say for us that are lay life, you know, they're have families and jobs and, you know, a little bit different like monastics you have dedicated their entire life, right, so much so that they only own what a robe a ball, and some medicine and a razor maybe or something. So, it's a little bit different than what he's saying, but it's true that the Buddha emphasize, yes as long as it went not to talk about essentially politics and, and gossip, and should talk about Dharma, but otherwise, for us, non monastics, kind, beneficial, true, and timely, or the guidelines for speech. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. Okay. So, what a pleasure it is to practice with you all. So thank you and thank you for your practice. And if you like, we can unmute and say goodbye. Thank you, Dan. Thank you everyone. Bye. Have a good day. Bye. Bye. Bye.
