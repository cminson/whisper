 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So hello and welcome everyone. Wonderful to be with you and see you. So for today's practice, I'd like to invite us to engage with the practice of compassion today. Compassion for the world, compassion for others. Especially with what has been happening on the world stage. The past few days. With the catastrophes internationally. Just to name a few, of course there's Afghanistan. And there is Haiti also with not just the earthquake, but also the weather now there, the storm. So just heavy heart. So much suffering, so much suffering around the world. And with the practice of compassion, the practice of compassion, especially in the way that I like to invite us to engage with tonight. Compassion supports us to meet suffering, to be with suffering, whether it's ours or others, to meet it. Not to drown in it, not to drown in the heartache. That is not compassion. That's basically overwhelm. That's grief. Empathic distress is another word for it. Whereas compassion is where we meet suffering, ours or others, with care, with kindness, with sense of stability, with an equanimity that's loving, that's caring. So we can hold presence. We can be present, we can hold presence for what might be painful, difficult, something that we cannot change. And yet we don't turn our face away that, oh yes, somebody else's problem. But we stay, we hold presence, we hold, we are present with the suffering. Whether it's ours or others, without pushing it under the proverbial carpet. And it brings a sense of strength, strength in the heart, strength in the heart. And compassion is different from empathy. Empathy is only the resonance resonating with suffering. So in one way we can think of it, if we think of the paradigm, say the neuroscience paradigm, it's just a mirror neurons resonating. And it turns out that, so that is really the aspect of when you feel empathic, oh yes, somebody hurts and you feel pain with them. And there are studies, there are research studies that actually when you see someone suffering, oh, the same areas in your brain that that experience physical pain light up. So empathy alone is not compassion. What is compassion is empathy plus metta, plus loving kindness, plus care, plus this feeling of warmth that I care I am present for you with you, breathing with you, holding. So it's both, it's not just empathy alone, and it'll become more clear in the guided meditation as I will invite you. And at any point, if you find yourself in empathic distress, know that empathy alone just feeling the pain without metta to balance it can fall into empathic distress so my invitation will be at that point to stop and bring compassion, bring care to yourself because in that moment, you're the one who's suffering. So again, if at any point you find your empathic distress and overwhelm in grief, stop compassion for others. Turn compassion, compassionate gaze to yourself so that you have enough stability. And at that point you can turn back out or maybe just stay with yourself. So, so know what is best for you. What is best for you. So to particular practice, actually, you know, I won't say anymore, I'll just lead you into whatever you need to know. And whether this is your first time or 100th time, happy hour whatever you need to know will be shared with you during this guided meditation. Okay, so trust, trust yourself, trust the practice. And again, if at any point it becomes painful and channel challenging, turn compassion to yourself. Just remember that. Okay. Alright. So with that, let's begin. Let's begin our practice. Landing, landing in this body. Landing in this moment. And as always, we begin, we begin by just arriving, letting go of any thoughts, stories, expectations. And just landing, landing this body in this moment in time. Letting awareness to connect with the sensations of your feet connected to the earth of your sit bones, your bottom connected to the earth. And with each breath. Landing, landing, connecting more deeply. Feeling your feet, your lower legs, you're sitting on the cushion, your bottom. The contact points, all the contact points, feeling them more and more to feel solidly connected embodied. Well rooted to the earth. Feeling your hands. Feeling your lower abdomen. Expanding and contracting with each breath. And its own. Thank you. Each breath breathed. Each breath breathed on its own. The breath has been breathing itself, breathing you for all this time. So don't make it effortful. Let it flow just as it has been flowing all this time. Just simply notice the movement of the abdomen. The breath received as if the body becomes more and more alive, more present. More settled, more relaxed through each breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to invite you to imagine the breath as if the breath is being received naturally on its own through the middle of your chest, the proverbial heart center. Little of the chest, as if the breath was entered and with each breath received its capacity of care, of warm heartedness, friendliness, kindness is breathed into, enlivened. Again, not so much that you are doing it, but that oh, there is friendliness here already. As if the breath is bellowing, bellowing on the ambers, on the fire, making it bigger. It's just happening on its own. As much as it's available right now, just witnessing, letting the breath be received gently. It might be a little tiny fire and that's okay. A few more minutes allowing the breath to be received from the heart center, bellowing throughout your whole body. Calming, settling, letting go of whatever is not needed, whatever is not necessary. Thank you. If thoughts are not necessary right now, letting them go. Thank you. Not needed right now. Please come back later. Coming back here, just here. Thank you. Thank you. Now, imagining, imagining that your heart center, middle of your chest, is this holy fire, holy fire of love, of care, of compassion. That is both yours and is not yours. It's not personal. It's holy fire of universal compassion. Burning brightly, beautifully. In your heart. As if it were a gift, a gift from the beyonds, a gift of grace. Oh, it's not mine. It's just here. It's part of being human. Breathing, breathing with, breathing with holy fire. It's holy fire of compassion. And imagine that with each out breath, each out breath breathed out of the heart center. Each out breath carries this goodness, goodwill, of compassion shining, shining the light onto the entire world, yourself and all beings who are suffering. And the out breath brings them comfort, soothes, brings the message of goodwill, of care from you. And now imagine that the sorrow, the sadness, the suffering naturally, as it gets breathed in into this incinerator, this holy fire in your heart, it gets transformed. It's not yours, this transformation. It's not yours to do, it's not yours to keep. Suffering as if it's smoke, as if it's a dark cloud. It's breathed in on its own. It gets transformed, incinerated, transformed in this holy fire of compassion, goodwill, to care, into goodwill, into a self-soothing, and breathed out, breathed out, delivering your care, your compassion to all who are suffering, which may include yourself. Thank you. And as this transformation continues, this dukkha, as suffering is breathed and transformed in your heart, breathed out, bringing comfort in these. There's a sense of courage, kar, heart, and French in your heart. There's a sense of courage, more and more courage to not turn away. At first it could be just a tiny little bit of courage not to turn away, to hold witness, to breathe with all these beings, all these humans who are just like you, just like me. Just like me, they want to be safe. May they be safe. Just like me, they want to be happy. May they be happy. Just like me, they want to be healthy. May they be healthy and strong. And just like me, they want ease in their lives. May they have ease. Just as I don't want to suffer, may they be free from suffering. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. At any point, if you feel more empathic distress, you can turn the compassion, care, love, mata to yourself. You can also lean more into the care, to the warmth, to the goodwill for others instead of leaning into the suffering. Lean more into the goodwill to balance. I care. I care for your suffering. I care. May you be well. May you be free. May there be ease. May there be peace. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I pray that you are able to breathe with, to breathe with, not to forget, to hold witness and breathe with. To breathe, to breathe with those who are suffering, which can include ourselves. Breathing with the pain. Letting the sorrow be breathed in. Breathing out care, compassion. Breathing out care, compassion. Breathing out care, compassion. And for the last moments of this practice period, connecting with compassion, with care, to yourself and all beings. Whatever this period of practice was like, whether it was distracted, sleepy, whether there was falling into empathic distress, sadness, greed, it's all okay. It's all okay. It's all okay. You tried. You showed up. You did your best to align your actions, the training of your mind with your intentions. And now letting go. Letting go of the rest. Letting go of what you cannot control, given all the causes and conditions that have come before. May all beings be well. May all beings be free from suffering, including ourselves. Thank you all for your practice. So the practice today was the practice of tunglen, compassion as it's practiced in the way of tunglen, which is the practice in Tibetan Buddhism. Breathing in sorrow, letting it be transformed, breathing it out. It's a different way of doing compassion than we tend to usually do. And also I tried to bring in and to say that tunglen can often be a very challenging practice. So however it was for you, it was challenging. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You showed up. You tried. Also in this practice, I brought a little bit of equanimity practice, which is being with, holding witness when causes and conditions are above and beyond our control. To acknowledge that and acknowledge the being with, holding presence and trying to have a bird's eye view. So, so you are welcome now, you're invited to share your reflections. If you like questions, comments, and you can type them in chat. If they're typed just to me, I will not read your name. If they're typed to everyone, I will read your name. You can also raise your Zoom hand. If you like to share your reflections, like to hear from you. What was the practice like for you? What did you discover? What did you learn? Could be a question. It could be what was challenging. What was a discovery? You know that you offer an insight, a question. You're offering it for the community, for everyone's practice. It's not just for yourself. Actually, if you're new to happy hour, I'd like to invite you not to feel that you're in the hot seat, but if you like to share, please Sharon. So today, especially reflecting on Afghanistan, I've also really taken into my heart today. I'm sure you're familiar with John Halifax, and she has a brilliant, beautiful teaching of strong backs off front. And you're holy fire beautifully with my reflections today. Thank you so much. Thank you, Sharon. And thank you for bringing in. Naming Afghanistan, again, as it is in this space, of course, the common humanity just like us, we're human beings, we could be born as them. And to bring in the beautiful practice of John Halifax, this strong back soft front, was a strong back, and I get lovely, beautiful and holy fire in the heart. Beautiful. Thank you, Sharon. Beautiful pair of reflections. Thank you for that. Yeah. Strong backs off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for that reflection. Now I don't know how to put my hand down. I will do it for you. Okay. Thank you. Others, please. You are welcome. What did you discover. Philip says I'm new your voice is quite soothing. I didn't realize you were guiding using tongue length, quite nice was helpful to my nervous system. Namaste. You are welcome. And you're also welcome if you like not to feel on the spot but if you wanted to raise your hand you could say more, but not needed. I'm not sure anyone else. Another moment, another reflection here. I appreciate your reminder to turn toward pain instead of turning away. Yeah, thank you for that reflection. That was sent to me. It's important. It is important. Yeah. I have to say, as I wait another beat for any reflections that might come from you dear song. Oh, here's. Here's another reflection from Richard on YouTube. I had distraction due to physical pain and difficulty tending towards pain. The realization came towards the end of practice. The meditation that it was all welcome, bless them to a body of compassion. Oh, thank you, Richard for sharing. It's beautiful, but of compassion of your practice to welcome it all. And then you're turning towards one more reflection, the breathing out compassion was interesting. It felt forced at first, but it went well after tuning into into to it somehow beautiful. Great. I appreciate that reflect the reflection that yes, it. It feels forced then, then bring in this reflection of this holy fire that the breathing it happens on its own this, this holy fire of compassion. Some ways it is yours and in some ways not so letting it just as if you're witnessing as if you're witnessing some of the fear that that happened. One more reflection I discovered how to have compassion for myself. Beautiful. Thank you for that. And Neil I see your hand, please. First of all, I really appreciated this was great timing. How do you remember that, you know, in particular in Afghanistan, that, you know, despite all the terrors that are happening, there were people deserving of your love on both sides of that. Absolutely. I'm so glad you brought this up. I'll share something with you from my own practice that came up for me tonight, because, as, as I was practicing for the terror of so many people who are scared. So many people who are scared right now. And once I, I was also seeing the other side. I was seeing the other side. These fighters as children. Because at some point, they were children and in some ways they are they. There's a particular way they see the world. And that is causing so much suffering to others and to themselves. So, and I'm reminded of the in Buddhism, the root, the root of all suffering all all ills in the world are greed hatred and confusion, or translated as delusion, and in fact delusion is the root of greed and hatred. Delusion really isn't anything but also translate as ignorance but it's not an ignorance of, of, of not knowing but it's like a not seeing clearly not seeing your true nature not seeing, not knowing how particular ways of being causes harm to yourself and causes harm to others. It's similar to the, to the prayer of Jesus, forgive them father for for the harm they cause I'm paraphrasing, as they do not know what they do, they do not know what they do so there's a sense of, oh, they, they don't know what they do they saw clearly if they saw without dust in their eyes, how the way of being is, is causing pain for people for, for women, children, etc. It's so in that way my heart can be open to compassion to all sides, forgive the father as they do not know what they do. So, this is what comes up for me Neil and I offer it as a reflection to you. Thank you. Thank you. So, so dear ones, time has come for us in this Sangha in this community to turn to practice in small groups which is what we do at this time, holding ourselves holding each other, especially tenderly tonight. And we
