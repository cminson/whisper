 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome all. It's nice to see the morning greetings over on the chat stream. And yeah, happy to again be with you. And yeah, we'll settle in and practice together. So yeah, finding a posture that feels sustainable. And maybe I was a little premature in the whole silence and stillness thing. If you need to check which friends are here, go ahead, check the chat. Forget about that whole silence and stillness thing. I see Stinson Beach is in the house, Boise. Yeah, welcome, welcome to all of you. So. Yeah. Just sensing the presence of others, the jewel of Sangha. Thank you. Just softening your face. We wear the self on the face. In other words, a certain kind of self consciousness creates tension in our face. So. Relaxing all of that tension, relaxing self consciousness, relaxing the grip of self. Relaxing self consciousness. Relaxing self consciousness. Relaxing the shoulders. Your belly. Hands. We sit on defended. But there's a deep dignity in being undefended. You. You. You. You. You. A game of fixing, optimizing this moment. Shoring up our resources. Maybe it feels safe enough to put all of that down. To rest in the good will of Sangha. To truly make peace with this moment. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. We just keep. Blessing experience with. Awareness. Non-equanimity arises as a kind of density friction. It's as if the awareness gets blown into that solidity. Everything becoming less dense, more like space. Giving up all our fights. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. Wherever story or narratives. Or autobiography. As that accumulates and we notice and we just breathe. Somewhere between suppression. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You. You.
