Satipa Tanasuta has a structure to it. 
It starts kind of with an overview, a definition, and I talked a little bit about some of that definition last week, talking about the four foundations of mindfulness and how we observe. 
We observe the body as a body, feelings as feelings, mind states as mind states, dhammas as dhammas, or experience as experience. 
It elaborates a little more on that, which I didn't go into last week, but I had talked about several weeks earlier, so I didn't bring it in so much last week. 
It has a phrase, one abides observing the body as a body, ardent, mindful, fully aware, setting aside desire and discontent for the world. 
Well, that's how we observe what and how we observe. 
And then the rest of the sutra is essentially an elaboration on that phrase. 
It goes through each of the four foundations, each of these four areas, elaborates more on what does it mean to observe the body as a body? How can we do that? What are tools for observing the body as a body? Observing feelings as feelings. 
How do we do that? Mind states as mind states, and experience as experience, and particular experience as experience through the perspective of the dharma teachings. 
Between each of these exercises, we could call each of these descriptions of how we can observe, for instance, the body. 
In the teaching on the mindfulness of the body, there's several, I think there's nine exercises of how to observe the body. 
It talks about observing the breath. 
It talks about observing the physical postures. 
It talks about observing all of our activities, walking, standing, speaking, being silent. 
It talks about that, and it talks about observing the elemental nature of our experience, the vibratory, heat, cool, hard, soft, all of that kind of elements, the elemental nature of our experience. 
And then it talks about observing or contemplating, reflecting on more the parts of the body. 
And it encourages us to reflect on that we are going to die, reflecting on corpse contemplation. 
Maybe that's six. 
I think it's six. 
Six exercises in that first foundation of mindfulness. 
Between each of these, and throughout the Satipatanasuta, there's exercises in each of the four foundations, between each of the exercises, there is what Bhikkhu Analyo has called the refrain, which is kind of a repeated statement. 
It's like the chorus of a song. 
It's repeated many times in the Satipatanasuta. 
And essentially what it's doing is it's encouraging, again, a particular perspective, how to pay attention, what's important to pay attention to. 
And I'll read that to you. 
I'm not going to try to talk about the whole of this refrain today, but one piece of it I do want to talk about. 
So I'll read you the refrain. 
And it's changed depending on whether it's pointing to the body or feelings or mind state. 
So I'll just read it related to the body. 
One observes, one abides observing the body as a body internally, or one abides observing the body as a body externally, or one abides observing the body as a body both internally and externally. 
Or else one abides contemplating the body in its arising factors, or one abides contemplating the body in its vanishing factors, or one abides contemplating the body in both its arising and vanishing factors. 
Or else mindfulness that there is a body is simply established to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness. 
One abides independent, not clinging to anything in this world. 
There's a little section marker before this section that kind of highlights it as the refrain. 
That section marker, the section markers in the various suttas were added several hundred years after the time of the Buddha. 
So the Buddha didn't say these things, but it kind of indicates to us what some of his followers over the course of the years of practicing in his teachings, that there was a kind of a kind of, this is like the headline or the title of the section. 
The title of the section doesn't say refrain, it says insight. 
So this section of the sutta emphasized each with each exercise is pointing perhaps to those aspects of attending to our experience that particularly are conducive to understanding, contemplating internally and externally, contemplating the impermanent nature of experience, establishing mindfulness, having that continuity of mindfulness, establishing mindfulness. 
The mindfulness there is a body is established to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness for understanding to arise. 
And then the aspect of abiding independent and not clinging. 
That's kind of the result or that's what the outcome perhaps we could say of this practice is, this abiding independent without clinging. 
So there's a lot in this refrain, and I did kind of point to a little bit in the guided meditation that last line or the second to last line mindfulness there is a body is simply established to the extent necessary for bear knowledge and mindfulness. 
And what I'd really like to explore today more is from the beginning of this section, when abides observing the body internally, externally, or both internally and externally. 
It doesn't really say anywhere, particularly what internal and external are in the suttas themselves, there's various ways internal and external are used. 
I get, I got my understanding of this, and the various nuances of ways it can be understood through exploring Biquinale's book Satipatana the direct path of realization so some of what I'm going to say is coming from that. 
The commentaries do point to internal exploration being mostly what we teach what we explore with mindfulness what our, our kind of usual instructions are observing our experience. 
And that seems to be a lot of what the teachings encourage in Satipatana Sutta, and yet he throws in this external piece too. 
And it's not really just thrown in it's repeated many, many times. 
So, the commentary say that externally means observing others, other human beings. 
It also can include other beings in general, potentially also observing the world, but the commentaries particularly point to observing other human beings, other, other, other human beings particularly I think. 
This brings into our Satipatana practice, a whole new area or a whole terrain of practice that we don't talk much about, actually, this area of observing others. 
Another place in, in the suttas the Buddha talks about to his son he gives the instruction that before we act we should reflect, think about how is our action going to affect ourselves or others is it going to create suffering for ourselves or others or both, encouraging us in this kind of an iterative way, first reflecting before we act, while we're acting, after we act, and encouraging us to, to be aware of how our actions are affecting ourselves and others. 
And so this may be a piece of, of this external exploration is looking at how there's an interrelationship between us. 
That we're not independent in the, in that we affect each other. 
That the conditions that arise here the choices that I make the, the actions that I choose to do the things that I choose to say have an effect on others. 
And so there's that possibility as a part of observing externally that that that would come into that practice that he offered to his son. 
That in order to see whether our actions affect somebody else, we have to be aware externally have to be aware of how they're responding. 
What they say in response to what we say what the expression on their faces, we have to be aware of their body, of their words, of their expressions, their moods. 
So while this internal external isn't completely clear what it actually means, the commentaries come down on this side of observing self, observing our own personal experience, and observing the experience of others. 
We've got quite a bit of experience, I think that a lot of the teachings that we do in the West, particularly I think that we that we have emphasized have explored this internal aspect of knowing what's happening. 
We get to know our physical body, we get to know how our, our emotions and our responses arise in the mind as a result of our conditioning. 
We see that the conditioned nature of our responses doesn't mean that that we have to follow those responses. 
And so we learn something about ourselves and this leads to insight, this kind of internal observation leads to understanding. 
And, you know, in, especially, I talked about last week, the kinds of insights and understanding that can arise as we explore or are mindful of experience in this way described the body as a body feelings as feelings, the body as a body, not my body, but a body feelings as feelings. 
This, this kind of exploration helps us to kind of take a step back and see that this body is a process unfolding. 
It's a set of causes and conditions, you know, that have come from the beginning of time, essentially, into this moment. 
And here is me, you know, Gil sometimes says he, he has reflected that this thought that's arising right now, this thought in this being, it took the entirety of the evolution of the universe for that thought to arise in this moment. 
It's that conditioned, you know, it is, it is dependent on all of the various conditions that have come to me. 
And so we start to see that the conditions are unfolding and that in this very moment in this very small window of the present moment, which actually begins to feel pretty vast once we enter into that understanding of this is where things are happening. 
This is the only place things are happening that as we open to that, we see that a choice that's made now that the seeing of that conditioning and seeing perhaps the direction is leading if we're seeing aversion arising in the present moment, for instance, the conditioned nature of aversion is to have us want to get rid of something to push something away to want us to separate from something. 
But if we see aversion arising in the moment, in that moment, then there's an understanding that we may have that having seen that happen many times in our past and having experienced at least sometimes perhaps the suffering of that aversion. 
Then the experience arising of aversion in the present moment with mindfulness allows the system to choose something different, allows us to go in another direction. 
So that's how the establishment of mindfulness helps to lead, it helps to lead towards insight and understanding and freedom from that clinging towards this aversion, this acting on this aversion is the way I'm going to be happy. 
And so we see all of that internally. 
That's a lot of what we have explored in our mindfulness practice. 
And it seems pretty clear how supportive it is for insight and understanding. 
What about observing externally, observing others? How can this lead to insight and understanding? First of all, what does it mean to observe others? Again, we're asked to observe the body as the body externally. 
Feelings as feelings externally, mind states as mind states externally. 
We're not sure yet about the fourth foundation how well I guess in some ways we could say is that that takes some specific lenses on experience. 
So for instance, it asks us to observe experience through the framework of the hindrances or the seven factors of awakening. 
And so we might observe for instance a hindrance arising in someone else or we might observe love or compassion arising in someone else. 
That would be within the fourth foundation of mindfulness. 
So what does it mean to observe others? The body is pretty straightforward, but even just observing the bodies of others from this perspective of a body as a body. 
That begins to help our minds, especially if we have done some of our own work of what it means to observe a body as a body internally, and how the unfolding of that understanding leads to a release from some clinging and how not seeing the body as a body kind of can get us tied up into knots, taking it as my body. 
And as we kind of understand the ways in which our minds and bodies interact and the conditioned nature of minds and bodies interacting, our own mind and body interacting as something that we don't necessarily, you know, that we think. 
We think we should have more control over our conditioning unfolding. 
And then as we start to observe what's happening, we see there's this moment in the present moment where we can affect how conditions unfold. 
But a lot of the time we're simply kind of seeing things play out, and even if we can be aware of it in the moment, sometimes what we get to do is see it play out. 
And so we see that the conditioned nature of our experience that we don't perhaps have, we feel like we should have more capacity to control how our conditions unfold than we do. 
And we attribute that to others, too. 
We think other people should have more capacity to be able to prevent themselves from saying mean things. 
We think other people, so we attribute more capacity to them. 
But as we've seen our own challenge with this, then as we observe others, we can begin to understand, yes, they, too, are living their conditioning unfolding. 
And it's hard. 
We know how hard it is to be aware and present. 
I mean, even sometimes when we are mindful, things come out of our mouths that we don't want them to. 
So in observing others, having had the foundation of seeing how our own system works and how hard it is to navigate our own conditioning, then observing others, we begin to have that same understanding, oh, yeah, they are living their conditioning as well. 
So it can allow there to be some compassion for how others are responding. 
It can also be inspiring, I find, in observing externally. 
I found on many retreats that inspiration observing someone externally. 
At one point I was getting up in the meditation hall, it was on a month-long retreat, I think. 
I stood up in the meditation hall and I turned around with my eyes open and I was just turning and I saw somebody in their sitting posture sitting very dignified and very slowly moving their hands to change their posture. 
In that moment, all I could see really was the physical body, but there was a way in which that action, the way the person was moving, created in my mind a mind state of very simple and clear awareness. 
It was as if I was kind of getting a hit of what their mind, how they were in their mind. 
And this is perhaps a way that we can, perhaps a way that we can start to observe feelings and mind states through, when we're really present and watching somebody else do what they're doing, there's almost a way that we can feel, it's an interpretation, it's clearly an interpretation, but there's a way in which we can impute or infer their feelings and their mind states. 
And so the observing of others can be both supportive to helping us kind of begin to break through our sense of others as self. 
A few weeks ago I talked about selfing and othering and how the othering, the quality of othering, we self, we take ourselves to be who we are, we have ideas about ourselves and we attribute a lot to ourselves because of that view of ourselves. 
And we do the same to others. 
And so sometimes we can see the mind attributing, you know, they, them, they do this. 
That's what this person always does. 
And so our minds kind of attribute a self to other, much as we attribute a self to self. 
And so this external contemplation through this perspective of body as a body, feelings as feelings, helps us to see the conditioned nature, helps us understand that others have this same conditioned nature that we do. 
And helps us to possibly be either inspired, you know, to be inspired by someone else engaging in the world in a wholesome way, or to have some compassion when somebody is engaging in the world in an unwholesome way, to understand this is conditioning playing out. 
And so this is one way that this can lead to understanding or insight is the kind of the seeing, kind of breaking down the sense of self, not only internally but externally. 
And as we start, these two play with each other internally and externally, because as we see internally the conditioning unfolding, we can at times deeply understand that it is just conditioning unfolding, and that there's not an I or a me here doing that. 
It's more, it's kind of like an after the fact attribution in a way sometimes. 
Oh, that's what happened, I did that. 
There's more to say about self, I won't, there's always more to say about self, but I'm going to come back to external right now. 
Another way or exploration that around the external that can help us come to understanding about ourselves, about our own delusions, is that, you know, we are acting out of our own delusions, our own views, our ideas, our beliefs. 
And as the, you know, I talked earlier about the, the Sutta that he gave to his son, the Ruhula Sutta, where he talked about observing, you know, reflect before you act, is this going to cause harm? Reflect while you're acting, is this causing harm? Reflect after you've acted, did this cause harm to self or others or both? And so sometimes our, you know, our actions come out of our conditioning, often out of very deep, old conditioning, that is not seen, that's hard, very deep, sometimes so deep that we're not even aware it's conditioning, we just take it to be, well, this is what's true, this is how things are. 
And so sometimes our actions come out of these places where we're often not so aware of those views or those delusions, those beliefs. 
And so, you know, in using this exploration of observing how others respond to our actions. 
So this is, this is where maybe internal and external begin to interweave. 
We observe, we look internally, is this going to cause harm? Well, I don't see any harm that's going to come from this. 
Okay, the Buddha says, if you don't see that harm is going to come, then do it, you're welcome to do it. 
But watch while you're doing it, is it causing harm? And so, you know, that's where we observe, how do our actions affect others? And I think what this does, and then also after the fact, because it may be that the consequences of something that we do or say doesn't arise until much later. 
You know, we don't see the effect until much later. 
And so the Buddha encourages us also to reflect after the fact, did it cause harm? So the, this exploration is encouraging us to look at our actions and how they affect ourselves and others. 
So witnessing, watching while we're acting, how is it, how is it landing? How are other people, what's the body language as people are in our environment and witnessing us do these things? What's the expression on their face? What do they say? Sometimes it's really clear. 
Sometimes it's not at all subtle, but they don't like what we've done and there's something that we've done to hurt them. 
So the Buddha, I mean, sometimes if we think, you know, just internally we might think, well, you know, sometimes there's this sense of, well, if they're getting angry at something I did, that's on them. 
You know, that's sometimes the way our minds work, especially using some of this internal. 
If we focus just on the internal, we see, yeah, when I get angry, there's something inside that I need to look at. 
But the Buddha encouraged us to undertake restraint if what we do creates harm. 
And I think also it is not explicit in the Ruhula Sutta, but also to reflect back on what was going on. 
So, you know, there is often a piece of somebody reacting perhaps to something that we said or did and there is some piece of that that is their own to look at. 
But there's also what I think this is pointing to, there's a real big capacity for learning here, that if somebody is reacting in a way that we did not anticipate. 
You know, so if we do this in this iterative way that the Buddha describes, we didn't think it was going to create harm going into it. 
We didn't think that was going to happen. 
And here we are in the middle of acting and we are surprised by that. 
What did we not know? What were we unaware of? And so this is, I think, encouraging us to begin to look at where are our hidden conditions, where are our hidden assumptions, our hidden beliefs and views that didn't let me see this was going to cause harm. 
This isn't a judgment. 
It's not to say I should have known it in advance. 
The Buddha encourages us to do this iterative process to learn. 
This is a way we can learn. 
We can learn about others and we can learn about ourselves. 
Hidden biases, unconscious biases such as racial biases can have this effect, you know, that we might do or say something that because it's coming out of unawareness. 
Do or say something that creates harm or pain for another person. 
And if we simply take it as well, that's their problem, you know, they need to look at their reactivity. 
We miss the opportunity to uncover our own delusion. 
So this is a way in which the internal and external together can help us to uncover hidden views, hidden conceit, hidden beliefs by seeing how do people respond. 
So these are most of the reflections I wanted to offer. 
So based on that comment or question, it made me reflect on how this practice of looking externally is ideally suited for daily life practice. 
You know, much of what we do in daily life practices, but again, we orient internally, you know, it's like the whole the whole retreat model of lifting moving placing, you know, we're we're looking internally at our body sensations and our feelings and our emotions. 
But in the in daily life, we also have this whole realm of external practice, seeing how other people are. 
You know, I came to this, I only go to the grocery store once a week right now. 
That's up from once every two weeks, so I'm getting more opportunities to actually be in physical presence with people. 
And I reflected on this topic after I went to the grocery store, and I had not remembered to do this kind of external contemplation at the grocery store but I'm hoping to remember the next time you know I want to put like a sign on my door because it seemed really exciting to me. 
I reflected back and remembered the cashier and some of his expressions and and thought there was something, you know, something there that would have been beautiful to to explore. 
So, you know, this is a whole realm of practice, this external exploration. 
And then again, as I pointed out, the way in which it can not only help us see like that other beings are conditioned that that, you know, that the how we impute self to others is just a view is just an idea. 
But also how we how we can, you know, uncover our own, you know, hidden beliefs through seeing how people respond to what we say or do. 
And this relates to the question on overthinking and in some ways to that that another question of, you know, what is harm is a kind of an overthinking in a way. 
I think at the basic level, it's unethical, you know, it's enough, it starts with unethical conduct create, you know, physical harm taking some something from someone. 
Sexual misconduct or, you know, creating harm through sexuality. 
So that would be the first level, kind of to look at is this a violation of the precepts. 
False speech, you know, that that and the encouragement there to in the in the precepts is that it, you know, if you engage in those kinds of actions, killing a living being, taking what's not offered, creating harm through sexuality or false speech, that those things will harm ourselves and others. 
So that it's, it's a benefit to ourselves also not to engage with those things. 
So that would be the first kind of layer. 
And then I think, you know, that that it is there is a kind of, you know, it creating harm, you know, for instance, might be saying something and again I think it does come back to some of why speech wise action wise livelihood, especially why speech, because so much harm is created through speech. 
And the, you know, so the, the precepts talked just about false speech, but the Eightfold Path talks about not engaging in divisive speech, or harsh speech, or idle chatter, the idle chatter. 
Let's leave that one to the side for now. 
It's more harmful in the sense that it tends to create a mind that's not settled. 
But the divisive speech and the, and the harsh speech, you know, so or and it could be action to I mean it could be harsh action or divisive action done through physical, in physical ways. 
You know, the Buddha encouraged us to, to look at that too. 
Are we doing something to divide these people here from those people there? Are we speaking harshly? Are we speaking in a way that is intended to hurt someone? So a lot of it comes back to intention. 
And yet, so and that's where we, we, we look at, we can look at it, you know, it's like, is this action that I'm doing, is it intended to make somebody feel bad? Is it intended to divide? And, you know, sometimes we are, we're kind of acting out of our conditioning. 
And yes, we are saying something that's nasty or, or, you know, cruel. 
And, and we know that it, you know, kind of some part of us knows that but then it like it comes out anyway. 
That's, that's the kind that the, you know, the Buddha would encourage his son to say, you know, think before you act and maybe try to not do that. 
But if you do, do, do it, then stop or, you know, make, make amends, etc. 
But what, what I'm pointing to, what I'm pointing to is that the kinds of things or at least in the seeing of the delusion is that you may not see that something is coming out of a belief or a view. 
It's, it's so embedded. 
It's so deluded that we wouldn't see it. 
It's not, it's not coming from an intentional place of causing division or, or to hurt somebody. 
We're not doing that intentionally. 
But sometimes our actions are motivated by very old delusive patterns that create division or create harm. 
And so that's where, you know, we don't, we don't know in advance. 
But if we see that it has created division or created a reaction, then what I'm saying is that that is something that we can look at. 
Was there something I didn't understand? Is there something I didn't know? And that, that might be something about the other person's history or background or something about my own conditioning. 
It could be many things. 
And so it's an opportunity to learn them. 
Now, it may be that it could be on one side or the other that more of the pattern was, or more of the kind of the unawareness was on my own side and that I didn't, I didn't know or see the deep underlying hidden biases or in my own mind. 
And that's where this action came from. 
And so, like, wow, I didn't intend for it to cause hurt, but it did cause hurt. 
And it was because of something that I hadn't hadn't seen in my own conditioning, that that action happened. 
And at other times it may be, you know, it may be that the other person, their response is, you know, so, you know, I had this with a partner at one point, I said something and it was so clear that the person's response was coming from their own conditioning. 
It's like, I knew that my, my own motivation and my own, you know, my own sense of what I was saying that he was responding out of his own conditioning. 
And like, I can't, I can't fix that part. 
But in this process of internal and external, we can look if we see something unexpected. 
It's important for us to look, is this something that has been hidden from me?.
