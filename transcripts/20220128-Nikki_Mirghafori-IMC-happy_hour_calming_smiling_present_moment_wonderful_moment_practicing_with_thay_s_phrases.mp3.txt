The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Alright, hello, hello and warm welcome everyone.
We're ever in the world, you're joining from, as mentioned earlier, in our hellos, whether it's snowy, no snow, temperatures in the 20s, ones or 60s.
Oops, anyway.
So, yeah, warm welcome, warm welcome.
So, for today's practice together, for today's practice in community, given that right now, as we, as in this moment in time, as we are gathered together on Zoom and YouTube to practice.
The funeral of Thich Nhat Hanh is being held right now, and it's being live streamed, his cremation and funeral.
So I figured this was a sweet time to dedicate our practice to practice, and happy are inspired by his teachings, inspired by his teachings.
I know Diana shared a poem or paragraph by him.
So I think I like to do that again tonight. So I pulled out my, my yellowed copy of pieces every step by Thich Nhat Hanh.
And, and I wanted to read just a couple of paragraphs from the very beginning of the book, and, and for it to inspire us, to inspire us for our practice tonight.
So this first, so the book, for those who may not be familiar with it, pieces every step is, is these very short chapters, I need chapters about maybe a page, sometimes couple pages, sometimes half a page.
And the very first chapter is called 24 Brand New Hours.
So let it wash over you these paragraphs.
So Thich Nhat Hanh, who is everywhere now, supporting us in our practice, I believe he said,
Every morning, every morning when we wake up, we have 24 brand new hours to live.
What a precious gift.
What a precious gift.
We have the capacity to live in a way that these 24 hours will bring peace, joy, and happiness to ourselves and others.
Such beautiful, simple, and profound teaching. I'll continue.
We can smile, breathe, walk, and eat our meals in a way that allows us to be in touch with the abundance of happiness that is available.
That's a profound statement. Everyone happiness that is available.
It's not that we have to search for it, look for it, happiness that's available here and now, if we change the way, if we shift the perspective of the way we're looking.
We can smile, breathe, walk, and eat our meals in a way that allows us to be in touch with the abundance of happiness that is available.
We are very good at preparing to live, but not very good at living.
We know how to sacrifice 10 years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get a job, a car, a house, and so on, but we have difficulty remembering that we are alive in the present moment.
The only moment there is for us to be alive.
Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy, and serenity.
We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment.
This paragraph especially resonated with me as many of you know, the course befriending mortality that I've been teaching started this past week on Wednesday, so I've been really sitting with reflections about being alive and what does it mean to appreciate being alive in this moment, in this moment, in this amazing, mysterious, miraculous moment.
And this is what he's pointing to.
We are so good at preparing to live, always looking in the future.
Oh, I will be happy when everything is okay.
I will be happy when I have my degree.
I will be happy when I have the perfect job, the perfect relationship, the perfect this.
I will be happy when I don't have to work so hard. It's just like the mentality of future orientation, future orientation.
And as he says, but not very good at living, not very good at living.
He is very gently pointing, very gently pointing us right here right now, right here right now.
Every breath we take, every step we make can be filled with peace, joy and serenity.
And we know this, we know this in this Sangha.
We know this, that as we turn, you know, as we turn our minds or hearts, we can be distracted and stressed out and perhaps we come to happy hour and we sit and we practice together and realize, oh, there is peace here.
Yeah, I had a hard day, I had a rough day and it's okay.
There's peace here right now in this tired body, in this moment, there's happiness, there's joy, there's gratitude.
And this is something we have been exploring together now over Zoom and YouTube over the past two years now in every session.
It's right here. It's already here.
It's already here. It's already here. We just turn our attention, our perspective to it.
It's already here saying, hello, I'm here.
So, and I want to offer this, this meditate, this, I guess, what do I call it?
Well, he says he calls it, he says there, okay, he says there are many exercises, there are so many exercises that we can do to help us breathe consciously.
Besides a simple in-out exercise, we can recite these four lines silently as we breathe in and out.
Many of you might be already familiar with these four simple lines and I know that I have used them before and they just bring joy and calm.
So, I'd like to invite us to practice with these four simple lines tonight.
Breathing in, I call my body. Breathing out, I smile.
Dwelling in the present moment. I know this is a wonderful moment.
I'll read them one more time. Breathing in, I call my body. Breathing out, I smile.
And let yourself smile. If you explore that before in this, in the previous sessions, breathing out, I smile.
Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment.
So, there's a lot more commentary, but maybe I'll just say a little more.
Breathing in, I call my body. Reciting this line is like drinking a glass of cool lemonade on a hot day.
Isn't that sweet? I just love this language.
You can feel the coolness permeate your body. When I breathe in and recite this line, I actually feel my breath calming my body and mind.
Breathing out, I smile. You know a smile can relax hundreds of muscles in your face.
Dwelling a smile on your face is a sign that you are master of yourself. And we also know that, by the way, smiling changes as other impacts, not just in the muscles of the face, but also other physiological and psychological impacts.
So, please do smile.
Dwelling in the present moment, while I sit here, I don't think of anything else. I sit here and I know exactly where I am.
And the last one, I know this is a wonderful moment.
It is a joy to sit, stable and at ease and return to our breathing or smiling or true nature.
Our appointment with life is in the present moment. I love that. Our appointment with life. We all have an appointment with life.
Our appointment with life is in the present moment. If we do not have peace and joy right now, when will we have peace and joy tomorrow or after tomorrow?
What is preventing us from being happy right now?
That's such a profound teaching.
As we follow our breathing, we can say simply calming, smiling, present moment, wonderful moment.
This exercise is not just for beginners, nor any of us who have practiced meditation and conscious breathing for 40 or 50 years continue to practice in the same way.
Because this kind of exercise is so important and so easy.
So with gratitude, appreciation for the gifts of takenaut han, let us begin our formal practice tonight.
Sitting together, breathing together, smiling together.
So I invite you to sit however is comfortable for you.
Move to a cushion or even lie down if that's what your body calls for.
I'm going to sit cross-legged here on my chair and landing, arriving here and here.
Breathing in. Breathing in, I call my body.
Let's start with calming the body. Ah, dear body.
Calming, calming, calming the body.
As if your body was a child, a sweetheart, sweetheart.
It's okay, it's okay.
Or maybe a pet, a beloved pet, petting the child, the pet, this body.
Breathing in, I call my body.
Breathing in, I call my body.
Calming, settling, breathing out, I smile.
Breathing out, I smile. Knowing that smiling relaxes your body, your heart, your mind.
Breathing in, I call my body.
Here, calm, soothed.
Age in breath, calming, soothing, soothing.
Age in breath, like a lullaby. Age in breath, calming the body.
Bringing care, love to the body.
Breathing in, I call my body.
Age in breath, calming, soothing, collecting.
And breathing out, I smile.
I greet, I greet myself. I greet this body.
I greet the world.
I greet my appointment with life in this moment right here right now.
This important appointment, the most important one I have with myself here now.
The reason to smile. Breathing in, I call my body. Breathing out, I smile.
Spend some time with the first couple of phrases and really settle into them before writing the others.
Thank you.
Breathing in, I call my body.
Breathing in, I call my body. Breathing out, I smile.
Breathing out, I call my body.
Breathing out, I call my body.
Breathing out, I call my body.
Breathing out.
Breathing out, I call my body.
Breathing out, I call my body.
Breathing out.
Now bringing in the other phrase. After bringing in, breathing in, breathing in, I call my body.
Bringing attention to the body, not in the head.
Calming the body, being embodied, feeling the body. Breathing in, I call my body.
Breathing out, I smile.
And really, do smile. What do you have to lose? Experiment.
Be a scientist of your own mind. Yes, lovely. Smile.
Breathing out, I smile.
See the shift that this smiling can make in your heart space. Notice if something opens up.
Something opens up when you smile.
Maybe a little bit of brightness.
Breathing in, I call my body. Ah, dear body.
Breathing out, I smile.
Dwelling, dwelling in this, dwelling in the present moment.
Dwelling, living, resting, abiding, spaciously embracing the present moment. Right here, right now.
I know, I know this is a wonderful moment.
I know, deep, deep in my heart. I know, I know this is a wonderful moment.
I know this is a wonderful moment.
I know this is a wonderful moment. Filled with miracles. Amazing to be alive.
Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is a wonderful moment.
Breathing in, I call my body.
Breathing out, I smile.
And see if you, when you smile, when you exhale, see if your body relaxes some more, it just settles some more.
See for yourself.
Dwelling in the present moment.
I know this is a wonderful moment.
Of course, the phrases when you say them in full will spread over multiple breaths. It's not a problem. Take your time.
Dwelling in the present moment.
I know this is a wonderful moment.
Dwelling in the present moment.
Dwelling in the present moment.
It's okay also to take one phrase and just rest with it for a few breaths.
Because sometimes the mind can get a little confused like, wait, what comes after what?
Just say, dwelling in the present moment.
Relish that for a few breaths.
Dwelling in the present moment.
I know this is a wonderful moment.
Just acknowledging that, bringing that into our heart space, and actually make us realize the goodness, the beauty, the grace of this present moment.
I know this is a wonderful moment.
Dwelling in the present moment.
You are welcome to stay with the long forms, just resting, dwelling, each sentence, or move to the short form.
Calming, smiling, present moment, wonderful moment.
You can synchronize the words, the phrases with your breath as you breathe in.
Calming, breathing out, smiling, breathing in, present moment, breathing out, wonderful moment, if you wish.
You are welcome to stay with the long form.
You are welcome to stay with the long form.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Meeting, meeting this moment right here, not past, not future, wishing for something different, wanting something that wasn't right here, meeting this present moment right here, with a smile.
This moment, present moment, wonderful moment.
Wow.
This is a wonderful moment.
I'm alive, I have awareness, I'm conscious, this gift of being human.
This mystery, being part of this amazing, ongoing form is called humanity.
I'm a part of this, me, this being.
In this moment I'm participating by just being alive, this wonderful moment, precious moment.
Calming, smiling, present moment, wonderful moment.
How lucky are we to be able to sit and meditate together in this present moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For the last moments of this practice, maybe connecting with one of the phrases that really came alive for you again.
Or maybe all of them, you don't have to choose.
Filling your heart one last time with the goodness of this practice, with your own goodness, goodness of the present moment, met with a smile.
May all beings everywhere, including ourselves, meet the present moments of their lives with awareness, appreciation, smile.
May all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you.
Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice.
And thanks to Thai, affectionate name of Thich Nhat Hanh, for the beautiful, beautiful gifts of his teachings and his presence in this world, for becoming the human being that he became.
Through all the practice, all the challenges, all the beauty, all the suffering that he had in his life, to gift so many gifts to us, with appreciation to him.
So we have time for reflections, if you like to share, the spirit of sharing your practice with others, with the benefit of all beings. You can raise your hand, your zoom hand, or type in chat.
If you type privately to me only, I will not read your name, just the comment. If it's public, then I will read your name also. Fred, please.
Thank you.
Tomorrow marks one year since my wife's death, and I began to come to the Sangha shortly after that. And I just want to take this moment to thank you, Nikki, and to thank each of you in the Sangha individually and as a body for a tremendous amount of help through the past year.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Fred, for sharing, for allowing us, for letting us in to hold this important anniversary with you.
And thank you for your practice and supporting everyone with your practice in this Sangha, showing up not just for yourself, but for everyone else. Deep appreciation from everyone to you.
Thank you, Fred.
Space, the floor is open for other reflections about the practice tonight or anything else, for that matter.
Were there any particular guidance, instructions from Thai that really resonated for you or lit up for you? Something opened up for you, if you're willing to share for the benefit of others?
Or anything else for that matter?
We are a quiet bunch tonight. I think somebody is trying to raise their hand, but actually that's the clap there. Somebody raise their hand, I'll ask you to unmute.
So, I was at the store, so I wasn't quite sure what you were talking about, but I think that you mentioned it about every day you have 24 hours to make a day bright or something like that.
I was reading since he joined late, I was reading from Pieces Every Step, which is a book by Thich Nhat Hanh, I was reading the very first chapter, and that's what he was writing.
So, I think that these days, almost every single day, I'm very negative. My friends told me, why don't you just take things positively every day?
That would be really nice. Having a different perspective of the same thing, but it was not really easy, but when I heard that words from you, and I'm thinking, oh yeah, right.
Well, things are not going to go as always as you want it, and a lot of things make me really disappointed too, but I still have 24 hours every day to make things brighter and nicer, make it something like that.
So, it was kind of struck me when I heard that sentence.
Beautiful, I appreciate that. So, if it really spoke to you, then I would recommend finding Pieces Every Step, this book by Thich Nhat Hanh, because there's so much simple wisdom.
So, it's just the first chapter I read, parts of it, paragraphs of it, and also I would maybe say one more thing in what you shared about, oh yeah, this negativity that we bring in, it's really a perspective that we bring in to our day, to every moment of living,
and having a different perspective can shift our lives, our perception, because it's really deeply deeply, you know, what I'm about to say, it both seems like a very simple sentence, but it's actually a profound insight, a mystical insight,
that everything, everything is our perception, everything is our perception, everything, even when you say, well, I'm disappointed things are not going my way, that's also a perception, because one is limited to this limited view of me, me, me, I want this, it's good for me, like,
ah, actually even that is a perception, so it's a radically different way of being in the world. So, I'll leave you with that. Thank you.
Nikki, please.
I was thinking about some of the pressures, some of the things that seem to be obligations to do, and how to be in peace with that and, and actually do that, because peace seems to be
sitting in quiet, and how to stay with that, as we take care of things that are what I, I should do, you know, but I prefer to prune the garden, how to stay in peace with less desirable lists of things to do.
It's, it's a perception, but if I don't do them, you know, the bells won't get paid.
So, if I'm, you're cutting out a little bit here and there, so it's just to make sure I heard the reflection that you're sharing, that when you're sitting quietly in meditation that lots of different things are coming up and, and how to be.
No, no, in meditation is very peaceful.
But during the day, each step is, if I'm peaceful, I'll be sitting.
Oh, actually, I would like to, to challenge you.
How can you be peaceful in the middle of busyness, in the middle of doing this and that and the other? Can you hold your peace? And it is possible. If it wasn't possible, I wouldn't suggest it, Vicky.
Right? Yeah. Yeah. So, so having peace, you know this, I'm not saying anything you don't know, but having peace doesn't mean that you'll just sit and meditate all day.
It's, it's how can we train ourselves in this practice? I mean, being a good Buddhist or a good practitioner isn't that you just check out.
It's just, you know, hang out. It's like you, in every interaction and the ways that you show up, you have peace. Yeah. Yeah.
You're bringing that in. Yeah. I think I got the point. Yeah. Right. Yes. Is that what you're bringing?
I mean, not that I'm peaceful every moment. No, but that's the intention.
That's it. Yeah. Beautiful.
Yes. Yeah. Cultivation and it is possible. Yeah. Thank you.
Yeah. And one private reflection, thank you for helping us grieve, dies, death and share him being everywhere now. Yeah.
So thank you for that reflection. I so appreciated his words of, yeah.
So, dear ones, this is the time that we turn to hold each other to practice in small groups and in small breakout groups.
So if you can stay, that'd be lovely because it's so sweet to connect with Sangha and just connect with practitioners.
And if you have to go, it's okay. No, no judgments at all.
So I am going to open up the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other, 15 minutes of maybe 15 seconds of silent, silent, smiling.
How about that? Let's bring in 15 seconds of silently smiling at yourself and each other.
It's just like, wow, these amazing human beings.
And then, yeah, share as little or as much as you like. Here we go. Opening the rooms now.
Okay. Welcome back, everyone.
We've got a couple minutes left for any last minute reflections, comments, questions.
Neil, please.
So the instruction, the first phrase is, I forget, while I breathe in, I relax the body.
Right. And it seems really difficult for me to relax on the inhale.
Yeah, yeah.
I see heads nodding here, so. Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
So, right, right. And, you know, I mean, I'm okay not doing it that way.
But I mean, why did he word it that way if there's not some point to it?
Yeah, yeah. So I'm so glad you brought this up.
So here are the two pointers I would give.
First, the way he words it actually is breathing in, I calm the body.
And there's a difference between relaxing and calming.
Tune into that, Neil. And you'll feel a difference because the in-breath can be calming to the body.
It can be tuned into how the, wow, how the in-breath, wow, how the in-breath can be calming.
It can be. So it's something that has not yet been opened up for you to be opened up.
It's not, right away, it's not on the surface. It takes a little bit of tuning into,
but I have no doubt that you will feel it, you'll tune into it.
Does that sound okay?
It sounds exciting. I look forward to it.
I'm excited for you, Neil, being excited. Awesome.
Thank you.
Thanks so much for asking that and for the benefit of much as yourself and everyone else. Yeah.
Sweet.
So, dear ones, we have come to the end of our practice time together.
So thank you so much for joining Happy Hour and practicing for your own sake and the sake of others in the world.
And also tonight for joining together to honor this amazing, beautiful, precious teacher whom we have been gifted.
We were gifted and we're still gifted.
So may all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thank you, friends.
