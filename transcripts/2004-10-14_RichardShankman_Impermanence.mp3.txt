 So the series we're going to do tonight and the next two Thursdays on this topic, the three marks are the three characteristics of existence, which is a pretty weighty title. As I look around, some people here I know, and I know there are people here who have been long-time Dharma practitioners and are quite familiar with not only practice but the teachings, and then many people here I don't recognize, and I imagine there are people here who might be relatively new and perhaps haven't heard this particular piece of the teaching. So what I wanted to do tonight is just take the first few minutes and kind of back up and just set a context on what is this about, where does it fit in, and why would we even care about it, talk about it. And then we'll actually start into this list of these three qualities, and as we go through them over these three evenings, we'll look at the teachings themselves but also how we can apply it into our practice, how it might be useful, why we might care about it, and actually from a practical point of view also. And then I also have some suggestions if anybody is interested to take a little homework, a class homework, and I have some thoughts on how you might work with it during the week if you choose to. I'm hoping we'll have plenty of discussion. I have a few things I want to say, but my intention is to open it up for as much discussion as we all want. So to start, it's important to understand the concept of what is called ultimate or unconditioned truth or reality and relative or conditioned truth, these two levels of truth, and all schools of Buddhism talk about these two levels of truth. Most religions, I have to be careful saying most religions, but of the major religions that I'm familiar with, most of them have some concept of whether it's the great spirit or God or the highest truth or maybe in Hinduism the highest ultimate true self or whatever they call it, talking about that which really is beyond words, beyond really the limits of the human mind. But it doesn't stop people from trying to talk about it. So for example, if you hear people speak of God, often there'll be all these positive adjectives, you know, God is fill in whatever it is for you. If you have a positive association, it might be infinite love or compassion or all-knowing or all-powerful or whatever. So we kind of point to something there, but of course anything we say is going to fall short of what that really is. We can't get it. It's beyond the beyond, if you want it. That's how it's talked about often. The Buddha, in later schools of Buddhism, this ultimate reality does get talked about more in positive terms. Some of the teachings that have survived to this day from the Buddha, as much as we can tell, he pointed towards it. Sometimes he tried to talk about it a little bit, but mostly he was concerned with this other level of truth, the relative or the conditional level. And when we use this word, I like the words unconditioned and conditioned. That's really important as we get into this, as we start looking at what this is really all about is our ultimate well-being or our happiness. And we'll talk about a relative or conditioned level of happiness, which is a condition because it's dependent upon or conditioned by circumstances, which is actually where most of us spend most of our time looking for our happiness. And we'll talk about that. The unconditioned, because it's not dependent upon or conditioned upon anything, it's that level of well-being or sometimes called happiness, doesn't depend upon anything. It doesn't depend upon having a pleasant or happy or good experience. It's if we drop down underneath the pleasant or unpleasant or the good or the bad, and it's a deeper level of well-being or happiness. That is really what's being talked about in Dharma teachings. It's pointing us to this unconditioned level. So these three characteristics of existence, as we'll see, are tools that are considered gateways when we really come to know them well, not just as concepts. We start off knowing them as concepts. And as we learn to practice with them and the direct, I was going to say experience, but that's not right, but the direct just insights and openings into one or more of these characteristics, and they're actually all intimately interrelated, is considered a doorway into deeper levels of liberation. I think it's also important to say that, which is, I think, obvious, that we all come into a meditation group like this for an evening or the Dharma, whatever level you plug into groups like this or this practice or these kind of teachings, we all come at it from maybe looking for something different. It may be a bigger or lesser part of each of our lives, just depending on how it fits for all of us. The beauty of these teachings is that to whatever and to whatever level we want to plug in, they work, and we're going to talk specifically about that. As I look around, I don't see any monks or nuns here, so some of us may have been, I don't know, but we're all living in the world. We have a life, whatever that is for each of us. I'll bet if we went around, we won't take the time to do it, but if we went around and asked people why they come to a meditation practice or what draws them, some people may not even really know, but I think for most of us, it will be some, the common answers you tend to get are people are looking for some peace, some tranquility, some kind of happiness. Maybe there's a part where there's the difficulties of just being a human being in life and trying to find a way to be in the world in the face of all the difficulties and challenges, just to be alive and just to be a human being. We really just want to be okay, really. We all know it's hard to do. That's not such a big goal, just to want to be okay, have life be all right. That's not asking that much. It's not like we're trying to be the president or a movie star. That's okay, but I'm just saying, we just want to be okay. We start to realize that we have times in life, hopefully, we all have some times, some of us more than others, where maybe we are okay. Also, there's that ... Actually, let me read something here. Some of you heard this before. This is from a teacher, and he's not a Buddhist. His name's Hari Das. He's in the Hindu yoga world. I think he really touches on something here. This is a quote from him. It ties directly into what we're going to talk about in the three characteristics. He says, our lives are based on assumptions about ourselves and the world around us that are thoroughly out of touch with reality and seriously impair our ability to function. It gets worse. These assumptions are more than intellectual beliefs. Quote, I am a human mind and a human body, unquote. He's saying, you may or may not agree with it or like it, but he's saying the notion that I'm a human mind and a human body is thoroughly out of touch with reality and seriously impairs our ability to function. He goes on, in fact, this notion is so deeply rooted in our consciousness that few of us would ever think of questioning it. We live our entire existence from this point of view, seeking those things, situations and people that make us happy and avoiding those things that make us unhappy. But even when conditions seem ideal to us, there was always that nagging certainty somewhere in our minds that the situation will eventually change, that the security and happiness of the moment will ultimately be lost. In truth, we are never totally at peace. There was always something to be anxious about. Ordinary life is really a constant dilemma. So that's pretty grim to me. And for me, it touches something that rings true for me. And you can just look into some people's heads or nodding. Others, you have to look into your own life. We don't need Haridass or the Buddha to tell us about difficulty and suffering. We're all experts. Isn't that true? We know, doesn't mean we don't have happiness in the good parts of life too, but there's also that peace. He goes on, he ends by saying that spirituality means learning how to live life as free, conscious and loving beings instead of from the point of view of dilemma. And that's the peace of hope and the promise that's held out with these teachings of this practice. It doesn't just end with it's all suffering, it's all terrible, life's horrible. It ends with that there is a way to live life as free, conscious and loving beings instead of from the point of view of dilemma. So these whole teachings on the three characteristics are one way to start to first look realistically at the human condition and then to make a shift in where we look for our happiness. That's the whole teaching. The reason the Buddha tends to look into the and talk a lot about how we live in the ordinary, I shouldn't say ordinary, but in the conditional or relative world is that's the world we, that's what we have to work with. So rather than talking, spending a lot of time talking about this ultimate reality, which we may or may not even care about or believe in. So much of the emphasis is put on looking to where we create our own suffering and how when we start to wake up, and which a lot of the meditation practice is about becoming more conscious and aware and awake so we're not so reactive, that we start, we stop looking in the wrong places for our happiness, which is creating our own suffering. And once that starts to fall away, and I don't know why this is true, but some of you know, and if you don't just, I'll tell you that there is such a thing as an inner deeper happiness that can be, that's accessible, that ties more towards an unconditional, I don't know what the ultimate unconditional happiness is, but that is less dependent on circumstances and more is that cliche of that inner happiness that can be found, it's talked about in meditation, right? Okay. So the three characteristic, well first let me just stop, now I was going to shift over, actually going into there, but I wanted to stop and see if anybody had a comment, a question of anything about what was said so far. Okay. So I'll say a little more, we'll take plenty of times to stop, or anytime if you want to raise your hand, that's fine. These three characteristics of existence then are qualities or characteristics of this relative or conditional world, that's what we're talking about, we're not trying to even talk about the ultimate anymore, we kind of put that aside. So let me, I'm going to give the English and the Pali words, you don't have to remember these Pali words and I tend to shy away from them, but for a few of the lists, there's a few of the words that you may be interested in, like we use the word dukkha a lot you may hear, right? That's one of the three. The dharma is another one. So the three are what are normally called impermanence, anicca, the second one, and don't worry if you don't remember it, you're going to know them by the time it's all done, the second one, dukkha, which is, it tends to get translated as suffering, but that's a terrible translation. A much better translation would be, I don't know if this is really a word, but unsatisfactoriness, which would include suffering, but it gets a lot more subtle, it's not just suffering, dukkha, and then the third is kind of the real tough one, probably for most of us, which is anatta, which is no self, right? That's a big, it's what Buddhism is kind of famous for, is saying that we don't have a self, right? We'll get to that, not tonight, but later, but that's something we need to understand clearly because it's not saying that there's not a, I mean, we're all here. So it's not saying that you don't exist, but it's really saying there's not a permanent fixed unchanging self, and we want to look and see, well, what is this thing we call the self? It's not saying there's nothing occurring. So impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, selflessness, anicca, dukkha, anatta. Definitely, there are times when people hear these teachings, they don't like it, right? You mean nothing's going to last? It's a characteristic of all existence? Nothing's permanent? Nothing's going to last? And nothing's, while it is here, isn't going to be satisfying anyway? I'm going to top it off, I don't even have a self? Wait a minute, this does not sound good. However, it's misunderstanding those that gets us into trouble. When we actually understand them clearly, and that's what I'm hoping we'll do, we see it's not bad news. It's just the way things are. It's not bad. Everything is okay. And that it's us who make a problem. Because we don't like how things are, right? So if it, as we talk about it, if it seems difficult, some of these you don't like it, or it makes you feel uncomfortable, or whatever, I just want to suggest that you, you know, let those feelings be there. You know, we're a preposterous practitioner, so we're good at connecting with our feelings and get to know those feelings. But hang in there with it as we go through, I don't know if some of you may or may not be here for the whole time, but hang in there with it as we go through the process. And just kind of let the process unfold and withhold judgment until the end. Maybe that's not freaked out about it. So the first on this list, well, let me stop again and see if anybody wants to say anything, because we're going to go into the first one, Anicca impermanence. Okay. You mean I was trying to talk about what in Buddhism they call the two truths. Is there, what's going on in your mind? Well, I'm just wondering, are those like just synonyms for each other? Yeah. I mean, that's not what I mean, although I think there is an aspect. That's why I like unconditioning condition, because I don't tend to find that some of these other words, they have a lot of connotations, excuse me, of different connotations for different people. So, you know, this unconditioned is God. Okay. There, you know, whatever ultimate unmanifest deepest, highest truth, even those words, they're so clumsy. It's already don't like it. I don't know what else. Maybe someone's got better words. And then everything else, basically all of existence, the entire universe is what's called conditioned. I was saying relative, conventional reality. And I'll just throw this piece in. In there, so there are, there's a traditional Buddhist cosmology that we don't really need to concern ourselves much with here, but I'll just mention, and you don't have to believe it at all, but there's no doubt that in the Hindu culture that Buddhism came out of and in Buddhism, a pretty complex cosmology developed that was believed in, the Buddha talked about it a lot, of all these different realms of existence. Here where we live is one out of many different realms. There's hell realms and heaven realms and all these different realms of existence. Okay. The only reason I mentioned that is because most people in the West don't tend to talk about it all that much. You don't have to concern yourself with it particularly, but we're not talking about, we talk about ultimate or this unconditioned, the Buddha's not talking about a real nice heaven realm. That's still, it's more pleasant than the human realm. And there's many different levels of these, what they call deva realms, heaven realms. I just want to make sure it's not like in a Christian or Jewish or Muslim, I'm going to say this all wrong, but the kind of view of a heaven, that's not what the unconditioned is. It steps out of that altogether. It's something even beyond the heaven realm. What's that? I don't know. I just wanted to say that. So everything, even if you believe in heavens and hells and this realm, whatever, that's all part of the word that's used as samsara. That's the conditional realm. All right. Well let's just take a look here then at this idea of impermanence. I think most of us know intellectually that nothing lasts. What lasts? We know everybody dies. I think it's old. Have you ever seen a very, very old person with like really clear, smooth skin ever once? Have you ever seen anybody, very, very old person, maybe a hundred year old person, ninety year old person with a lot of vigor and strength ever? Not one. Maybe sometimes. You know, it'll make the newspaper where there's some, I remember I used to run in Santa Cruz one year. I was with a group of people who entered as a team in this triathlon. I did the swimming leg. And it was a big deal in the paper because there was these three men and they called themselves the bicentennial because when you added the three ages together, it was over two hundred years. I think they were all in their seventies. And they'd been doing this for years. So they were, in fact, they beat our team. These guys were awesome. How rare that is, they made the paper. The point being is, look, everybody gets old. Everybody gets sick. Everybody dies. We know it on a certain level. But we don't live our lives as if we know it. We don't live our lives as if we know it, right? This already is starting to point to how just reflecting on impermanence. I mean, any thoughts how that might be useful? Anybody want to say anything? I think it's pretty obvious to me, but it may not be obvious to everyone just to reflect on that. Not that we're not being morose or we don't want to bum anyone out or anything. It's just we just want to recognize that the only reason I can see for even reflecting on something like that is what use is it and how it informs how I live now. That's the use of it, of reflecting on this impermanence. The reason that the core teaching, if you look at the Four Noble Truths, is about suffering in the end of suffering. It's dukkha. It's dukkha in the end of dukkha. It's because the Buddha is focusing in this conditional realm. He's not talking about the uncondition. And he says, First Noble Truth is saying that there is this dukkha, which we'll get to later. That's the second characteristic is suffering this unsatisfactoriness. The cause of it, what's the cause of it? It's clinging. And there is a freedom from clinging. This word clinging, there's a lot in there. It's not just saying, boy, I really want that new car. Oh, okay. I guess if I don't get it, that's one level, but there's a lot of other levels to it. The freedom from dukkha is in the clinging, is the end of the clinging. That's the, and in the Fourth Noble Truth is the Eightfold Path. So this core, basic cornerstone teaching of Buddhism of the Four Noble Truth is just talking about clinging in the end of clinging. We start to get at that a little bit when we start to look at this first characteristic of impermanence. We suffer not, things are going to change and we suffer because we don't want it to change and we hold on to it. We see impermanence everywhere. Just go out into the woods and take a walk. It's a great thing to do. Walk around. You'll see animals. Maybe little baby birds, maybe, or squirrels or insects, and you'll see healthy adults and maybe you'll see some dead animals or birds or insects lying around. Look at the trees. Little sprouts coming up, strong, healthy trees. Then some of them not looking so good. They're diseased. They're bent over. Some are halfway falling over. Some are already down there, rotting logs. We see it everywhere. Leaves. I recently, a few months ago, I came back from having a long retreat. I was there long enough for almost a year, 11 months, and so I was able to see that the seasons change. I remember I would go out and there's just one bush that I like to look at. Especially as the spring came in and going through all through the winter, you just watch it change. These little buds start to come. It was amazing. Day by day, you could see them grow and they flower. In the fall, it all falls away and dies. You get to see these cycles. The Earth itself, it's not going to last forever. The Earth itself, the solar system, the galaxy, the universe is not going to last. It's not a bad thing. It's just the way things are. When we get sick, and look, I do this too. I don't like it. I'm getting ready to turn 52, which some of you look like you're a little older, some younger, but you know, it's not. Well, seeing my body slow down, I've always been a very active person involved in a lot of sports. I can really relate to what Ajahn Chas said. He said when he was young, his legs used to carry him. Now he has to carry, he's dead now, but he said, so he doesn't have that problem, but he said, now he has to carry them. Sometimes you look in the mirror and you just went, where did my youth go? What happened? I've had times, not so much these days in my life, but there's definitely been times in my life of some level of suffering around that. I don't want to get old. Even already, it's like, I'm starting to get back trouble. I never used to have back trouble. We think something's going wrong, but it's nothing going wrong. It's just the natural way. When it's our time to die, it's really not anything going wrong. So can we learn to kind of make peace a little bit with the way things are on this one level of impermanence? Now that's one level that I call the macro level. In a minute, I also want to talk about the micro level, which is a whole other level, but first I just want to stop for a second and just see how to, if anybody feels like saying how you feel, because I'm kind of just sitting here going on and on about, we're going to die, nothing's going to last. I keep saying, it's okay, it's okay. Well, you might not think it's okay. I remember, I'll just say this just one moment. I do remember once I did this weekend seminar once, years and years ago, and it was one of these kind of get it down into your personal stuff and they take it to all these processes. We got to a point where they just got you in touch with a lot of very heavy, difficult things. Really, everything felt heavy. I remember the facilitator said, it was the end of the Saturday, it was just a weekend, so the Saturday night had ended. We were all going to go home and come back Sunday morning. He said, whatever you do, don't leave and not come back now. We have to take you down, but we're going to fly back up. I don't know, maybe it's not a bummer for people talking like this, but I just want to check in a little bit. What I'm going to propose is that it's actually good news. It's not only not so bad, but there's actually some good news contained in that. I just wanted to touch in first. You wanted to say something. I think what you're pointing to, and I want you to correct me if I'm not right on target with what you're saying, is your point is something that we were actually coming to at some of the points, which is it is about honoring not just our pets and everything, but honoring our experiences, honoring our feelings. We can say, well, you're just suffering because you still have attachment or something, but we all, that's just part of being human. I was recently reading, there was a very famous Thai monk who was considered, in a way, the father of the modern Thai forest tradition. His name was Ajahn Munn. He was very respected and famous. He died, I think, in the 1940s, 49 or something like that. The people around him, actually, Mahabua, who was still alive but is pretty old, is considered, I don't know what enlightenment is necessarily, but he's considered to be fully enlightened. He had spent, I think, 10 years with Ajahn Munn. He was there when he died. He was talking in his autobiography about these monks who were considered to be so advanced in their meditation. He was talking about these incredible meditative states. When Ajahn Munn was dying, they were bereft. They were crying. They were just, after he died, even though the whole teaching had been getting into the world, it was about not clinging and getting a deeper level of freedom. They spent days just moping around. Some of them just thought they were lost. What do I do now? When the Buddha's chief disciples died, Sariputta and Moggallana, the Buddha said it was like the sun and the moon had gone out. I think it is important to recognize that as part of being a human being, if your pet dies or a beloved one or we have difficulties in ourselves, it's like it is painful. This teaching is not saying that that stops happening, that the process of being human stops. What happens is that we can try to start to have less of an adversarial relationship with ourselves and our experience. What I mean by that is, I think that that is true. When I say for many of us, the relationship we have with who we are or think we are or the experience we have is really sad. We don't want to feel that pain because it hurts. We don't want to feel the difficulties. One level of coming to Dharma kind of practices is that often people think, well, I'm not going to suffer because I'm going to be more calm and peaceful and serene and less stressed out and then I won't have so much suffering. I won't feel all these difficult feelings. That is true. That's a whole level on which Dharma practice does work. That's on the conditional level. There's also an unconditional level. We don't have to be fully enlightened to start tasting it. It's the title of John Kabat-Zinn's book, Full Catastrophe Living. We just let it rip, the full expression of who and what we are. We're not standing in its way. When there's grief, we have grief, but can we allow ourselves to have the grief and not add on another layer of suffering because we can't, which I'm not suggesting that you're doing, but this is the point. The famous simile that the Buddha used, which is called the simile of the two darts or the two arrows, where someone asked the Buddha, what is the difference between an ordinary person and a fully enlightened person? The Buddha said both the ordinary and the fully enlightened person experience their human beings. The Buddha, he got an argument with his relatives. He had a bad back. Sometimes he would say, oh, my back hurts. I got to go rest. Ananda, you go give the Dharma talk. He had to lie down. He was a human being. That's one level of dukkha that we all experience. The ordinary, that's like being shot once with an arrow. You feel the pain of it. We feel the pleasure too. We get both. The ordinary person, in addition to feeling that suffering, adds a second layer of suffering. It's like shooting themselves a second time with a second arrow because they get in reaction, aversion to the unpleasant. We can't allow that to be there. Does that make any sense? Does that make any sense? You're looking at me funny. It doesn't necessarily make it go away. Look. I'm not just talking to you. I'm just going off with it. I just happened to look over. Maybe you weren't looking at me funny. I don't know. Sorry. My father died last year and he had been sick for many years. To the point where he had what I consider to be really no quality of life at all. And there was a lot going on in our family where some people wanted to keep him alive. He was on these feeding tubes and all this stuff keeping him alive. And I was thinking, let the man go. So we had different differences in the family. And after many years like this, which I just thought was horrible, and he died. Actually, I'm feeling emotion coming up right now thinking about it. This is my dad. Even though it was a great blessing for him, you know, I was happy that he wasn't in that suffering anymore because he had no prospect of getting better. But, you know, this is my dad. So I had that mix of feelings and things. That's just being a human being. So I think that that's a normal level of feeling loss and pain. And when that happens, we need to find a way to be present with our experience, which means the reactivity part. Somehow we have to find a way. And this practice is a practice. The positive practice is one of learning to be more and more present with our experience. And so we don't start with the hardest thing. We start, sit down and just try to be with the breath. And then slowly as the practice deepens, and that's actually if any of you were planning to come this Saturday to this Anapanasati Sutta class that is really going through the whole progression in breath meditation, we're able to be present with more and more. But we need to start looking so we don't want to be surprised about impermanence. That's all. We just need to come to it terms beyond the intellectual level because what starts to happen is the, and it happens just naturally in the practice. As you start to see more, you start to see the nature of change more and more things that used to hold a fascination for us start to fall away more. And a perfect example I'm finding in myself is just, I was talking earlier about aging, and I know for some of you who maybe are older, you're not thinking 52 is much to be complaining about. My mother doesn't give me any sympathy. But it's a good example of a place that you can start to work and to come into more peace at it around it. I'm not saying I'm in perfect peace around it, but it's an area that I think I have come to out of the Dharma practice. So it's a perfect example of dealing with impermanence. I do need to throw one more bit in on impermanence because it's actually even, turns out to be even a little worse than, I shouldn't say worse. Well, it's not that things are here for a while, but they aren't going to stick around. There's another level of direct meditative insight that sees that everything is, there's only constant change going on all the time, actually. Modern physics knows, even if you look at the atomic level, this seems solid, right? I'm holding this bell up here. But even modern atomic theory will tell us that if you look down and there's the electrons, the neutrons, and the protons, and then it goes off into, I'm not even trying to get into the subatomic. And please forgive me any physicists out here. I'm kind of going to screw this up. We know that there's some model, say like if the nucleus is maybe the size of, I don't know, you know, a baseball or a grapefruit, then the electrons, which I don't know, maybe the size of a pea, something like that, are going around the nucleus at, I forgot, I think it's a few hundred yards or half a mile, I don't know, far away revolving around. And the atom itself is mostly all this empty space, right? It's not solid. If this is all really an illusion, it's a real good illusion. There's no doubt about it. Right now, you know, this seems solid to me. But there's even another level that we can start to get to where the mind settles enough, if we put enough into the practice, where we see directly that changing nature. As a matter of fact, there's even a level where, you know, so if you're working with any experience in your meditation and you see maybe the breath, so you put your awareness on the breath, and most of us, I think, would feel the sensations of the breath, and if you made a point, you could notice, to look at it, you could notice the fact that it's changing. But you probably mostly just notice the sensations. There's actually a level where it flips completely around, and what pops out is change itself. And then if you make an effort, you can maybe see the sensations, but it's actually the change. It's not a whole other level that may or may not be of interest, you know, if you take your meditation at that point. But the point of it is not to go around thinking everything's an illusion, but just to help break our grip on trying to hold things to be some fixed way. The only reason I think any of this is useful, at least for myself, is because if we start to just let go a little bit, and this is where I think the good news is, rather than doing what most of us do most of the time if we're honest, which is we're trying to hold on, we're trying to set our lives up to be a certain way, right? Who's not doing that? We may have whatever idea, it may be very crisp and in focus, or it may be kind of vague, but some sense of what a good life would be for us. So hopefully we're doing whatever we're doing to try and move life in that way. We want a better job maybe, or a good education, good relationship, nice place to live, whatever we do in our lives, right? Nothing wrong with that. I don't think we're going to stop doing that. We shouldn't stop doing that. It's okay to take care of ourselves. But the problem is, while we're in the process of creating life to be what we want it to be, moment by moment we get what we get. So the question is, what are we going to do with you get what you get? Once we realize that things change and we start just to loosen our cleaning, our attachment, our grip, just in that letting go, there is a sense of inner freedom that comes up more. We're just more, you know, it's kind of like the cliche of we're just kind of going with the flow of things better. It's really very simple stuff we're talking about. The more we practice and we're able to do it, the more we're able to carry it even through more challenging situations. That's all. That's the whole thing. I remember a time on this long meditation retreat I was talking about where I had been, I think I'd been meditating for however many months and I had a number of months to go. So you know, sometimes it felt like a lot. And it was, you know, so when difficulties would come up, I remember times when maybe, along with all the really incredible meditative states and all that, there's also times of depression or loneliness or despair or difficulties that just come up. You know, it would be hard because there's no distraction. You can't, there's nothing to do, but just be there with those feelings. It was very hard. Once I really started to see deeper into impermanence, it shifted everything because you start to see that all these things come and go. And I didn't take it so seriously, like if loneliness came, yeah, it's unpleasant. I didn't care for it. But you know what? It got to be less of a big deal because you know these things come and go. Sure enough, it's stuck around for a while and then it's gone. So it enabled me just to ride through much more with a much more steady equanimity, not getting so caught when the difficulties come and also not getting so over exuberant when the good stuff came. I appreciated it when the mind was clear and sharp and the body was just at ease and you're really deep in and you know, all these meditative states, it's great. And they don't last. It used to be that when they'd go away, I thought my meditation is screwing up, you know. A good meditation would be, you know, peaceful, clear, concentrated, blissful, whatever that is for each person. You know, a bad meditation is whatever, sleepy, restless, body hurts. And you learn just to ride through all that stuff. We don't get such a reaction because it's nothing going wrong when the meditation shifts. It's just changed. It's nothing going wrong when changes happen in our lives. That's what happens. And so can we find a way in which our happiness is not so dependent, I don't know if you totally get free, but not so dependent on having to have life be some certain way and having it definitely not be some other way. And it's more about what's the relationship we're having with whatever experience there is in the moment. We can shift our relationship to present moment experience. That's the whole thing. That's the place of this reflection on Anicca impermanence. We don't have to go to this cave and meditate, you know, 12 hours a day and see that everything's dissolving away. You know, that's not it. As we start plugging in to whatever level in our lives, the more we let go, it says, Ajahn Chah said, and I think I'll just end with this. He said. He said, do everything with the mind that lets go. Do not expect any praise or reward. If you let go a little, you will have a little peace. If you let go a lot, you will have a lot of peace. If you let go completely, you will know complete peace and freedom. Your struggles with the world will have come to an end. So this insight into working with Anicca impermanence is just a tool really in the service of learning how to let go more. Well, so you may have different meanings to that word, but when I hear it, it's a little bit different. Not caring, you mean like indifference or yeah, yeah. Yes, that's not what's being talked about at all. As a matter of fact, and I'm really actually thank you for bringing that up because I think that's important. And it touches into a lot of things like, well, if I've completely let go, why would I do anything or why would I, you know, but think about it. There is something even people who have, I don't know why, but actually the more I found this for myself to the deeper levels I've been able to touch in about non-cleaning and other people find that this is true too. It just seems to be the way that life is set up. Actually a deeper level of compassion and caring naturally arises. I don't know why that's true. There is a near enemy. Sometimes we talk about near and far enemies. The near enemy is something that masks. So for example, indifference can mask as having let go and on cleaning, but it's not the same thing. What non-cleaning does, because the indifference actually has some aversion contained within it. It's the place that has to cut off something because I don't want to, it's like it cuts it off. Non-cleaning is the opposite. It completely opens to everything. We actually can experience life, ourselves, everything even more deeply. We're actually more connected and more engaged than ever because the reactivity is gone. Because when we take away the reactivity we're able to actually be more fully present. I think many people in their own practices here I'm sure know that and if not as you practice you will see for yourself. I think it's just a continuing opening to deeper levels of being able to just really deeply open to ourselves and our lives. I don't know why that is, but and that's, you know, compassion is talked about a lot in Buddhism. Also when that illusion of solidity starts to break down and we start to see more that those separate boundaries really aren't so separate. And you know it's kind of in early Buddhism they didn't talk about the term interconnectedness, the original, a lot of the Western Dharma teachers you hear them talk about, you know, we're all interconnected. The Buddha didn't, there's no interconnectedness there. But there is an experience like that that happens when we're not so contracted into some rigid little separate self that we think we are and as that starts to relax open we really do start to be more connected than ever. So you're still feeling things but it's not like you're reacting. Right it's the reactivity that's gone. The ability to feel should grow. Not only that but the ability to be with more and more. One of the things that happens in the meditation and for people who are new you should know this, people who've been doing it already know this is that as we quiet down and that's what that takes a while in the meditation just to learn to quiet down some. It's like you take the lid off, a lot of things that had been masked and unseen are going to come roaring up to the surface. So you're going to see things about yourself that really probably didn't want to even know was in there. And it might not be easy but it's things that are there we're able to see more and feel and be present with it more without judging and reacting. And so then how we act in the world actually hopefully is more effective than ever because rather than being in reaction we can just be more present and then act out of a, not out of reaction but just out of what's appropriate. Can you take that one more step further? What if you are feeling that in the water, expressing the feelings that you're having and it's okay to have these feelings that you're having, you're just expressing it to them, the outward world and how they react to you might not be so great. But that's just a question of what's, so there's two different things here. One is how you or any of us are with our experience and with our feelings. And by the way there's no should here. We're not saying you should be able to be present with your experience. We all have a level where it's too much for us. We're not to the point yet where it's either physical pain or something emotional where you know what, that's crossed the line of where I'm able to be fully present and conscious. So we need to recognize that and if we have crossed that line that's where we need to be kind to ourselves and kind of back off a little bit. So that's one thing but to the ever deepening degrees we can be present with more and more with ourselves. Now how we express that, you know maybe there's, you know, I think you know that there's some situations where you may want to express and maybe there's people are receptive and there's other situations where you know it may not be the most skillful thing to do if people don't want to hear it. And then you, I guess hopefully if you are in a place of being more mindful and awake rather than reactive then you can have more choice on whether you would express it or not is the best thing I know to say about it. Does that make any sense? I mean. That's what I see. I mean myself that's where I see it. I mean how to express it but I want to express it in some situations I can say it's not appropriate or you know that person isn't able to accept it the way that you want. You would hope they would accept it. You might get defensive and take it personally or you might get defensive. I'm just bringing it up just because it's something that I think about and sometimes it's kind of hard to go with that line. Yeah I mean I don't know the answer on that and I think we've all had times where we've expressed things that. I could tell you a few stories myself where it wasn't so good and then there's a consequence there. So I don't know. Well okay. So we don't have much time left tonight. Well so anyway that's I guess what I wanted to say. I kind of want to see if any more thoughts or yeah. Well I well none of us have totally gotten it. I mean really on the you know there's levels where we're reactive we're get caught it's just a habitual conditioning has not been all worked out yet. That's why this is a you know it's just a path we're on in a process. I was going to just let me just offer up a few thoughts on if you wanted to work with it this week on what you might do and if anybody chooses to do it and if you're here next week maybe we'll start off with seeing if there's any discussion around how that was for people. So the first thing is I've already talked about through the meditation practice as the level of concentration and the mindfulness was really more than the concentration is that deepens. We naturally without even trying you just naturally are more aware of impermanence and we naturally see the pain of trying to hold on to things that can't be held on to and so there's a natural letting go that tends to happen and that's just an ongoing process that's one level and in that way we could say that the ability to be free and happy and at ease and at peace in the midst of our lives is a fruit of the practice but in addition to being a fruit of the practice we can it can take it on as the practice to that the non clinging and working with impermanence can be a practice. So this week there's several ways you might look at it. One I have two things in mind one is it's just when you remember and you'll forget many times but as much as you can remember just noticing change that's one thing you can just walk in around noticing you know car things are just in change and moving things aren't staying still noticing the body you wake up when I wake up in the morning I usually don't I don't know why I just don't feel that good then once I get up for half an hour I feel better it just changes noticing the changes whatever mentally physically another way that I think that I have found very helpful about noticing change is if something comes up that you're really gripped in and I'll focus on difficulties although this could go for things that are very pleasant also if you really have anger difficulty loneliness despair depression anything notice it connect with it to the amount that you're able and that you want to be with it in the moment if you can remember that this is going to change see if not cutting off not saying this is going to change and I'm going to hold on till this bad thing goes away and it makes you more good but just to be as present as you can and to know just reflect okay I'm in it doesn't feel good this sucks you know I want this to go away try to relax no no it's going to change and just see if that reflection which it may or may not just let you hold it a little more lightly in the moment even before it changes so that we're able to actually be present with it a little better just reflect and see and the last thing I'll just mention I got this from Joseph Goldstein at you may have heard him say this when we were at on retreat last year and I used it a lot it was very helpful he was talking about when he had been on long retreats and had a lot of loneliness and difficulties and worrying about his practice and everything and he said he reflected he told himself Joseph in a month you're not even going to remember this and I think back for myself so many days when I was worrying about the practice or I was just lonely and oh man I got six months to go and I want to go home and can't go home because I told everybody I'm gonna go for you know a year and what am I gonna do and all of that and I would just say you know in a month and it's true I tell a vague record it's just in that time it was so big so to see if in the moment just helps reflecting on impermanence that way you know and we can talk and see if it does and we'll also hopefully move into Dukka next week anyway we we have to stop well look it's three minutes after nine I'm going to do a one minute little meta to end if you need to get up and leave please do and I apologize for going over and I'll try next time to end on time so but for those who are going to stay you know please I just invite you that if you have not been connected in with your your body or your breathing or your experience just to connect back in and just to notice whatever is present in your experience now whether it's in the body or feelings emotions thoughts and just also to notice your relationship with that experience if it's if you're restless or if it's real unpleasant are you able to be just to sit with it and be with it or if not just to notice that it's hard to be with it and then see if if you can open to it that sense of loving kindness to yourself which is a great really a self-acceptance for whatever is real and true for you for who you are for what you are for what your experience is and just allowing yourself to hold it's almost like holding yourself with just great love and tenderness and caring and just deep acceptance that alone could be a practice that one could do for a long time but also let's just take a few moments for those who would like to then take that same sense of caring and acceptance and then actually radiating out that meta which is this loving kindness to everyone else here in this room and then to just let it radiate out also really into the community and really just to the whole world and not leaving out any any people any beings at all and if you don't feel loving kindness that's all right it could just be a thought or an intention or a wish or a prayer may all beings everywhere be happy and be free from suffering and then finally i'll just end with this short prayer from the metasuta these are words of the buddha on loving kindness let none deceive another or despise any being in any state let none through anger or ill will wish harm upon another even as a mother protects with her life her child her only child so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings
