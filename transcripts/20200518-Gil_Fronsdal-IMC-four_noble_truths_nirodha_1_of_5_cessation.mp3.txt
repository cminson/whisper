So here we are beginning the first of five talks on the 
third noble truth. In a sense, we're halfway through the 
Four Noble Truths. And we're beginning the second 
half. We're beginning now with what can be considered 
the good news of Buddhism. A nd even though the third 
noble truth involves the cessation of suffering, that 
cessation is the good news. It's good to know that it's 
not necessary to suffer all the time, that suffering could 
come to an end. But also the cessation of suffering, 
allows fo r new possibilities, and new expressions of 
ourselves in that freedom that comes with the ending, 
the cessation of certain things.

The word nirodha  is what we translate usually as 
cessation. I find it very interesting that the root of the 
word is rodha , which means obstacle. And the ni means 
something like no obstacle, or without obstacle. The 
English word cessation implies the end of something, 
and therefore some people might feel like, "That can't 
be that inspiring or such good news. Just the ending of 
things is kind of depressing." But the idea of the 
absence of obstacles can seem much more inspiring or 
meaningful, because that implies a certain freedom to 
move ahead to do what we want to do. So th is 
combination  – the really deep ending of something and  
then the possibility of freedom – is the good news of 
Buddhism.  
 
There are a lot of endings, cessations, in Buddhist 
practice, and it's useful to recognize them as they come 
along, because endings can give birth to a lot of 
inspiration, joy, and encouragement in the practice. The 
cessation, the ending of things – when we really see 
them, we see the opening that  comes there – almost 
like they're the guide or the door that opens into going 
deeper and deeper into the Dharma.  
 
Just to mention some of these endings, which  really can 
be dharmic endings – endings that are the end of being 
lost can be a relief. Endings that end  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 3 - misunderstandings can be enlightening. Endings that 
begin the path to freedom can be a refuge. Endings that 
end suffering are liberating. These are all endings that 
characterize Dhar ma practice. Learning to recognize 
these endings can engender tremendous faith in the 
practice.  
 
So, the simplest formulation of the third noble truth is 
“the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. ” As I've 
been saying these previous weeks, there are a number 
of different interpretations of what this means. The one 
that's usually held up as the primary reference point for 
this is the is the Buddha's teaching in what's called his 
first sermon, the "Turning the Wheel of the Dharma" 
discourse. And I want to read you that passage, and 
how it's discussed there. The reason to read it to you, 
one of the primary reasons, is so you can hear how 
thoroughgoing this sensation is as an ending. It's an 
absence of something.  
Now, this b hikkhus is the noble truth of t he 
cessation of suffering. It is the remainderless fading 
away and cessation  of that same craving, the giving 
up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, 
nonreliance on it.  
 
These are very strong words: remainderless, fading 
away, cessation, giving up, re linquishing, freedom from  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 4 - it, and nonreliance on it. This is how Bhikkhu Bodhi 
translates it. 1 
 
In particular, it's the cessation, the relinquishing, the 
giving up, the freedom from: craving. This passage is 
part of the source of what we're giving up in t he third 
noble truth, and this is the cessation of suffering. To 
end suffering is to give up craving . That craving is the 
cause of suffering  is one of the most common modern 
interpretations. However, there's a preposition here. It 
says, "that same craving." It's here in this text, it's really 
concerned with a particular kind of cessation, the 
cessation of someone who's fully enlightened, who's 
already experienced degrees of enlightenment. And to 
become fully enlightened when it can no longer is 
reborn. Here, they're talking about what it takes to no 
longer be reborn. It's the craving for rebirth, for re -
becoming. And it's that craving that is totall y let go of.  
 
We talked about that a little bit last week, and I'll talk 
more about this particular idea. It's one particular 
elaboration, amplification, of a much deeper experience 
of cessation – a more thoroughgoing, foundational 
experience of cessation  – which these ancient texts 
repeat over and over again.  
 
But now, I want to say how thoroughgoing this ending 
is, this cessation that we find in early Buddhism – a lot  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 5 - of emphasis on not attaining something , like some thing  
– but rather, releasing someth ing, letting go of 
something. The freedom of being without, the freedom 
of not being caught, of not being attached. The freedom 
of not building up and creating a sense of self.  
 
Over and over again, the discussion of the goal of 
practice is described most ly in negative terms, mostly in 
what's absent. And because of that  – and part of the 
delight of this, and the benefit of this – is that the 
absence is not something we can cling to very well. We 
can't hold on to it or make a self out of it. There's 
nothing  there.  
 
If I open my fist, and I love the absence of the fist, but if 
I want to be attached to it, then I close down around it, 
because I want to hold on to it. I mean, I'm attached to 
the openness. I can't really grab on to it because then, 
as soon as t here's something that we think is the goal, 
which is a thing, people can so easily get attached to it, 
or live in expectation of it, or want it. But it's the 
absence.  
 
Like the metaphor of a path, which we'll talk about next 
week, is that the path is a cle aring where it's easy to 
walk, like a clearing in the woods or the jungle. 
Everything's clear and open , so you can pass through. 
As soon as there's an obstacle or it's overgrown, it's no  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 6 - longer a path. So it's this idea of what's absent that 
opens up for u s the world, opens up a sense of 
newness, possibility. Freedom is part of this.  
 
The idea that things cease and end. Their inconstancy 
and change is celebrated in a particular poem in the 
ancient world, which is called the saying of the 
arahants, the full y enlightened ones. Some of you I'm 
sure know this. It's often chanted in Pali:  
Aniccā vata sa ṅkhārā.  
Uppāda vaya dhammino.  
Uppajjitvā nirujjhanti.  
Tesam vūpasamo sukho .2 
 
Impermanent are all mental formations. Their nature is 
to arise and vanish. Having arisen, they cease. Their 
stilling is blissful, is happy, sukho . 
 
So this insight into the nirodha , the cessation, cessation 
of suffering, is built on a deep insight into in constancy, 
the arising and passing, the appearing and 
disappearing of things. This cessation brings 
happiness, the happiness of the arahats, the happiness 
of practice.  
 
So, this is what we'll be looking at this week: this 
nirodha , cessation  – the freedom from obstacles. We'll 
go through it in a number of different ways. And Friday  
 
Transcribed from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 7 - we'll culminate in looking a bit more at the happiness of 
arhats, the happiness at the end of the path of 
cessation, the full cessation.  
 
So, thank you , and I look forward to ou r time tomorrow.
