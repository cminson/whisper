One of the worthwhile things to consider when you sit to 
meditate is who are you sitting with . Who is it  that is part 
of your circle of concern, care  or love  that you’re 
including as part of your sitting here?  When you sit, it’s 
easy to think that your circle of concern is just yourself . 
In our tradition , we usually sit with the eyes closed , and 
it can be just me, myself and mine. It’s easy to have all 
kinds of thoughts and concerns that are very particular 
to us or our relationship to them. You’re going to work 
through your issues , or try to settle and get calmer . So, 
in one way or another, if the focus is on yourself  in 
either  healthy or unhealthy ways , then  it’s easy to fall 
into the idea tha t the circle of concern or  the people 
involved here is just you.  
 
But, the circle of concern can be wider. It can be the 
peop le in the hall who are sitting together. Or the  circle 
of concern can be wider  still. It can be the people in 
Redwood City , who you’re going to e ncounter on the 
roads  and communities as you leave here. It can be 
your neighbors , or your friends , or family. It can be 
wider and wi der circles.  
 One of the interesting ways of thinking about meditation 
is that perhaps we do it not just for ourselves , but even 
more so for the whole world – for all living beings. Even  
though we sit her e and close our eyes, it ’s like we’re 
sitting down to become the caretaker s of this whole 
world. What  would it be like if you were to sit  here 
meditat ing – with your breathing  and your body, staying 
present, and letting  the mind get quiet  – and as you do 
that, there ’s a sense that you’re kind  of holdin g the 
whole world in your heart?  If you could  imagine all 
beings, the whole globe, everything , here in your sitting, 
how would you sit? H ow would you, your heart , or your 
mind be if you were t he caretaker of the whole world?   
 
If it were  not just for yourself , would  it put you more in 
the present moment? Or would  it put you more in your 
thoughts , and you wander off in thought more? What 
could  you do to hold in your lap, in your palms or in your 
heart the care, and maybe even love , for all  beings ? 
Would that support you ? So that when you settle  down, 
get focused, and really enter the moment here , you are 
in really here and now, and not there and then , with 
your mind. In some silent way, you’ve  brought with you 
the whole world , so that you’re not sitting here alone. 
You’re not doing it for yourself. You’re  being here  for the 
whole world more  than for yourself . 
 
If you’re inclined , it might be nice today while you’re 
doing your walking and sitting meditation to see whether this idea that you’re doing this to be present for all 
beings is supportive of your efforts to really be present. 
You’re  doing it as a way of caring for everyone  in this 
world . How would  you carry you rself?  How would yo u 
be? How would you sit in the present moment  if tha t 
were  your opportunity ? 
 
I hope you enjoy the day.
