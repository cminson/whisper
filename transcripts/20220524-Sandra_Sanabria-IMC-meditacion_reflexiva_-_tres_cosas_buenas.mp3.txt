The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

We are going to start with a reflexive meditation related to what I suggested last week,
that every day you can think of three things that you feel grateful for.
This meditation is about three good things.
First of all, let's start with a little movement.
Raise your arms, open your heart.
Put the ideas next to you, your thoughts, your work, all the echoes of the activity of the day,
the plans, we always sit next to you.
You will not go anywhere, we will find you.
I invite you to find a posture that allows you to be alert and also with the soft, relaxed body.
A posture that is comfortable.
First of all, I invite you to look around.
What is there in this space where you find yourself.
Surely you feel there many times on the road or several days a week.
And suddenly you will find something that you did not notice for a long time, that you did not pay attention to this.
Special.
Notice the quality of the light, the temperature, the sounds.
I feel the body in this space, inviting the mind to be in the body as if the body is in the chair.
I feel the contact of the feet with the floor, the contact with the chair.
Inviting the body to gently let go.
Closing your eyes with a soft look.
I invite you to take a couple of deep, intentional breaths.
Nulling through the nose, filling the lungs, taking the air out of the stomach.
Nulling through the mouth.
And breathing normally, taking advantage of each exhalation to release a little.
And if we release, relax the body a little, we relax the mind a little.
And expanding the attention to the whole body.
Feeling the whole body.
With curiosity and without judging or filtering.
Notice how you feel at this moment.
Suddenly you could name it with one or two words that would be how you feel in one or two words.
And now I invite you to make a memory of your day from the morning.
And if it is very early, if it is the morning for you, think about the day that has already passed.
And returning to the beginning of the day. Where did you wake up?
What did you do when you woke up?
And traveling the day?
What did you do? Where did you go?
I invite you to think about something you saw.
And that brought you a feeling of gratitude, of gratitude.
A landscape, a person, a movie, a photograph.
And take a moment to appreciate what you saw.
Reviving that moment. And remember how you felt.
And how you feel at this moment. Remember what you said.
I invite you to think about the causes and conditions that made it possible for you to see what you saw.
What had to happen so that you have seen this, that made you feel, that makes you feel the attitude.
And it is possible that the recognition of gratitude and gratitude comes to light here at this moment.
And again returning to your day.
I invite you now to remember something you heard. A song. The birds, the sound of the water.
Something that surprised you or made you laugh or smile.
Maybe someone told you something that made you feel good.
And take a moment to transport you to that moment. And remember how you felt.
And how you feel at this moment.
And again you could think about what had to happen so that you could hear that sound as soon as possible.
And again we return to the day.
I invite you to think about one of the best things that could have happened today.
Reviving that moment. What were you seeing, what were you listening to?
Maybe there was someone with you.
And remember how you felt.
And how you feel at this moment.
And what had to happen so that this event would happen.
So that you would have this experience.
And remember how you felt.
And your attention. Maybe the sensations of the breathing.
Contact with the chair or the floor.
And remember how you felt.
And let the attention be what is most alive for you at this moment.
And remember how you felt.
With an attention that knows that it is present.
And remember how you felt.
And remember how you felt.
And remember how you felt.
And listen to some questions. And observe what arises.
In the deepest part of my heart.
That I really breathe.
That I am looking for in my life.
That I hope to find.
Without finding a particular answer.
Without feeling better with the body.
How you feel in those aspirations with the body.
How you feel in those aspirations with the body.
How you feel in those aspirations.
Taking a couple of deep breaths.
And opening your eyes when the same moment.
