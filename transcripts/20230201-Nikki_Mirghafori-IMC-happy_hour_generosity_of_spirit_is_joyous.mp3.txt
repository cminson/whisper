 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Anyone who wants to listen later, here we go. Great. So hello and welcome to Happy Hour, everyone. Lovely to be with you. Hear your hello, see your faces. What a great way to start our practice together. Ah, so I'm landing, I'm arriving myself, so nice to arrive together. So what I've been exploring the past couple of weeks, as you notice, is instead of giving a dharma at the beginning, is to just land into our practice together and let the guidance come through. And maybe I say a few words at the end. So let's do that. I'm liking that different, that shift right now. So let's explore together. So let's begin. Let's land in our bodies. Ready for meditating together. Whether you're sitting in a chair, on a bench, cross-legged, on the floor or lying down, standing, and inhale the postures. All okay. And bringing awareness into this body seated as always we land with the body, arrive with the breath, with the sensations. The precursor to any session of metta, loving kindness, etc. Connecting with the breath, sensations of the breath in the abdomen. Receiving the sensations of abdomen expanding, contracting. Our feet chaining here, how lovely the bottom of the feet are your legs, your sit bones. Feel the connection points. So if you are sitting in a warm bath, let go into the sensations. Receive them. It's hard to just empty the mind. So instead, you keep the mind, the heart, something wholesome to ground itself with the sensations, the breath. As an anchor. To fill itself with, to fill our mind and heart with the sensations, the goodness of the breath in this body. No need to be yanked, the future, the past, right here. Cozy with the breath. No need to be yanked, the future, the past, the future. No need to be yanked, the future, the future, the future. If your thoughts, past, future, entertaining, upsetting, it's okay. Smile at them all. Thank you. Can you come back later, please? Giving my whole heart to this practice right now. Let go, let go, release. Such a delight to let go. So much ease, the body and the heart. You don't have to figure it out right now. Let go in this moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, let us consider. Let us consider this reflection that the Buddha taught to everyone, especially lay folks. First, he taught generosity, generosity of spirit, then ethics, and then cultivation of mind and heart through meditation. So with this reflection, as we bring this in, we're going to work with it in our meditation, sense of generosity of spirit. Ah, so you're breathing in a sense of generosity, kindness, generosity for yourself or others, giving the benefit of the doubt, benefit of doubt, a sense of generosity of spirit, where the mind, the heart is in tight, but spacious, kind, as goodwill releases, lets go, is gracious. Let sense of generosity, of spirit, let yourself breathe, breathe it in and out, not as a concept, but just as a concept, let's say it goes all around in the air, in the atmosphere, on this earth, and you're just breathing it in. It impacted you just because you're a human being breathing. Let it infuse you, even if you don't even know what that means. Let's expect the unexpected, especially if there are challenges right now in your mind and your heart, that there be an attitude, this infusing of generosity of spirit, of being breathed to your body, to every cell, and start here. Don't try to figure it out. Breathing in generosity, breathing out generosity. Let yourself be surprised, release, be generous with this idea, sort of tight, trying to figure it out. Let generosity breathe you. And if judgments arise in the mind, I don't know what this means. What's going on? It's all right. Let there be generosity towards these thoughts, these judgmental thoughts. Let them be infused with generosity of spirit. Let them be infused with generosity. Breathe in, breathe out. Do what's often, see what happens. you you you Be generous with your Spaciousness your forgiveness your kindness Let there be space, sense of generosity, space, spaciousness, sort of contraction in your heart, in your mind Generosity also entails letting go, releasing and attaching with a tight fist Release, generous with your thoughts, with your own heart you you There is anxiety, tightness, fear, sadness, can you be generous with these emotions? You Make a generous friend, try to shoo them away but give them space, spaciousness, it's okay and now you wish you can stay here or if you want Is there someone in your life right now? Some interaction that has already happened or might happen where you can be generous too Spirit of generosity, goodwill Seeing the best in them You You may know the benefit of that You Can you be generous to yourself not to chastise yourself? You You can be generous with this being in your life as a practice for being generous with yourself and with everyone else How can I be generous, show generosity of spirit? Imagine yourself in your speech, being generous with them, in your actions, in your mind, with your goodwill being generous, giving them space You You You Notice how good it feels, feel generous even if it's in your imagination It's a joyful, joy making act You You You You You You You Imagining yourself being generous with your words, actions, sentiment, perspective With others You You Notice if your mind, if your heart, even if it's infused with a little bit of spirit of generosity, if it feels happier, more spacious, calmer, more still More collected in your meditation, sort of scattered Notice generosity, glad and start, and calms the mind May all of us, may all beings everywhere, realize that we each have so much to give, we have so much to give Not just possessions and resources, but our goodness, our benefit of doubt, our goodwill, our perspective, generosity of spirit So much to give, so much to share May we all truly know our goodness and share it With ourselves, with all beings everywhere May all beings be happy, may all beings be free, including ourselves Thanks everyone, thank you for your practice Ah, this practice was, as I mentioned, the Buddha taught, especially to lay folks, generosity, ethics, and then mental cultivation, meditation So really generosity, and as a preparation for everything, and then ethical, the sense of uprightness, the sense of integrity, again, as a basis for stilling the mind, for mental cultivation, for meditation Which is what we do, so it's important to bring attention to these two, and in this meditation, really an invitation for us to feel a sense of generosity of spirit It's not just about giving things and material, but this attitude of generosity to have towards ourselves and towards others, towards our thoughts, towards everything internal Especially something challenging internal, as well as external And generosity is happy-making, generosity brings joy as a precondition for joy So I hope you did experience that, that feeling of just joyfulness And I certainly felt it for me, it was just sense of happiness, imagining myself being generous to folks, and just a spillard of generosity Ah, happy-making, happy-making, happy-making Bill says, Love, this meditation seems like generosity of spirit is closely connected to patients and having fewer expectations of how things should be Yes, indeed, yeah, thanks for that reflection Bill, beautiful Beautiful, yeah, so, I'd like to invite us now with that, having patience and fewer expectations of how things should be for us to take that sense of generosity into Our small groups of interacting with two other human beings with a sense of spaciousness opening And doesn't have to go any particular way, we don't have to show up any particular way or sound smart or accomplished or anything And then the reflections, the questions that I'd like to invite you, two questions, one is, what blocks generosity of spirit? So you'll go around, just one, each person will say, will share one thing, or you can also say past What blocks generosity of spirit for you? Is it lack of time, being in a hurry, whatever it might be, what blocks it? You go around once And then the other, the second question, the round two, is what supports generosity of spirit? What supports it? Maybe mindfulness, maybe awareness, maybe remembering, maybe some, you know, for each person might be something different that you bring in So you go around and round a few times, so I will make big groups and as always, be kind to yourself, be kind to others Really, breakout groups or breakthrough groups is where a lot of breakthroughs happen in terms of our practice is where the rubber meets the road So, yeah, just offer one thing, not asking questions, directing the conversation, dominating and make sure you leave space for everyone As a part of your act of generosity, show up generously, show up with generosity, can I show up with generosity and interact with two other human beings here And let's go reverse alphabetical, alphabetical order Okay, alright, here we go, take care of yourselves, take care of each other Everybody's back, welcome back, and you have time for maybe one or two quick reflections What did you notice? Either with the meditation or the small groups, what came up? Any aha moments you'd like to share? Especially if you haven't been speaking lately, Jesse Yeah, thank you, Nikki, for this practice Near the beginning, when you talked about infusing the body with generosity, I had the sense of forgiveness And forgiveness is not something I hear very much in Buddhist meditation, like Sanghas, but I hear about Dhanā and generosity all the time So I'm wondering if you could talk about the relationship between generosity and forgiveness Yeah, they're so, as you've mentioned, as you've noticed, actually, they're so tightly connected And it is a generosity of spirit, right? Of course, a generosity of spirit is the precursor, it's so related to forgiveness And there are specific practices for forgiveness, and then there's more specific teachings in different traditions that Buddhism has borrowed from So we do teach on forgiveness, but there isn't so much of it traditionally about forgiveness So yeah, I think it's kind of distributed in other teachings, including generosity Dhanā isn't just giving money, it's really infusing the heart and spirit It's a huge teaching, so thank you for bringing that in, that intuition Thank you, Nikki Thank you, and Amy, make it quick, here we go, whoops, here I go, there Yeah, very quick, so one thing that came up for me that makes it challenging is capacity And so what came up on the other end was boundaries So when I have, it sounds counterintuitive, but when I have really great boundaries, I actually have way more capacity to be generous So that was really neat, that feeling of insight there Nice, thank you for sharing that insight, beautiful, yeah, that sense of having, it's generosity to yourself So that you know what your limits and what your capacity is, not to overextend And then knowing that generosity to yourself, then you can be generous instead of, oh, beautiful, yay Thank you for sharing that insight for everyone's benefit, love it, love it Thank you all, thank you for your practice, thank you for coming to happy or cultivating yourself or yourself and others May all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves Thank you beautiful people, see you on Friday, now I'm going to stop the recording
