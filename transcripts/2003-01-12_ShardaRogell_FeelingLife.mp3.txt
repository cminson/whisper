 It's so nice to be here with you this morning. I see so many people come to sit together and hear the Dharma. Coming together in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha as a way of really helping ourselves remember. I feel that coming together in a group like this is a remembering, a remembering of what's important, both in our world, in our nearby environments and also within our own beings, within our own hearts. So today my intention is to talk for about 20 or 25 minutes or so because I would really like to have some interaction with you as well. And it's such a short period of time, the 45 minutes, that I don't, last time I was here I hardly got any time to hear from you. And that's one of the things I like best is to hear from your experience and to address that somewhat. So to make this time really relevant for us, very real for us, not abstract or esoteric. How does the Dharma, how do these teachings really affect us in our lives right now, today? So that they really are a living reality for us. And that's really what the beauty of these teachings are. They're so immediate and so practical and so real. And I think that's why so many people are attracted to these teachings because it does help us find some ground under our feet as we find our way in this very, very difficult life that we live in. And today I want to turn the theme towards feeling, just feeling. To feel, to be moved, what it means to let ourselves be touched, let ourselves feel. And this theme is partly inspired by the upcoming march against the war this Saturday that's happening in San Francisco. There's a lot of energy right now in protest for those of us who care in this way. And this impending war, all this rattling and shaking that's going on from the Bush administration. And also that I'm teaching a day-long at Spirit Rock on that Saturday, this coming Saturday. So myself, I won't be able to attend the march. But I wanted to somehow, in my day-long as well, and this morning, partly inspired this morning, to now bring in the whole question of how do we let ourselves be moved, how do we feel, how do we let ourselves respond to the conditions that are present in our life right now. And of course, this impending war is only one of the conditions, the whole change in our economy because of last year's events, the whole real shift of atmosphere, of environment in our country, in our lives. And then that's only one part too. We all have our own immediate situations that we're dealing with, whether it's our relationships, our work, our health, or the situations of our loved ones, our families. And it's not anything new, it's not anything different. What we're talking about is life, is life. And when we read the old text, the teachings of the Buddha, the situation was not any different during that time. And the teachings of the Buddha address the very same kinds of situations that we're dealing with right now. How do we find ground, how do we find some ground underneath our feet, underneath our being, so that we can move in life, we can find a way of being in a very difficult life situation, but still be in touch with something within ourselves that is not agitated, is not in fear. We find something within ourselves that is at peace, is at rest, is steady, is strong. And so one of the ways that I am investigating and exploring and have been over a number of years is the importance of feeling, of really feeling at an emotional level. When I talk about feelings, I'm talking about emotions, which is the, the Buddha actually addressed this as well. It's in the third foundation of mindfulness, which is the basis of the teachings that we practice in Vipassana, the four foundations of mindfulness. The four foundations being mindfulness of body, mindfulness of our, the feeling, the word is translated as feeling, but it's feeling as pleasant, unpleasant and neutral feeling tone of an experience. It's not emotion. So the second foundation is just the feeling, the texture of an experience. The third foundation, the Buddha addresses the emotional life, the feeling life, being mindful of that, being mindful of the activity in the mind, being mindful of the movement, of the feeling, of the emotion in the body. And the fourth foundation is really the, being mindful of really the bigger picture of how all these teachings fit together and how we can actually walk a path to spiritual freedom. And the fourth foundation is attention to that, mindfulness of those factors. So when we're talking about mindfulness of our feelings, mindfulness of our emotions, this is a very integral part of our attention, of our practice, of our mindfulness. And I think that there's a whole art, there's a whole skill that we actually need to learn when we start to open more fully to our emotional life, because they are so difficult. Once we do start opening to them, they have such a force, such a power in the mind that we can easily be pulled away and controlled by the emotions themselves and lose this place of steadiness or ground within our own being. And so there's a very delicate art to beginning to open more fully to our emotional life, to our feeling life, so that we don't fall into that river of emotions and get carried away and act out in ways that we act out when the emotions are strong. So the whole art to this is why I wanted to bring it up, I wanted to address this a little bit today. And again, it's just a little short window of time that we opened to this this morning, just to see what we can discover in this period of time. Maybe one reason that this is interesting to me now is because in my 20s, during the Vietnam War, I had no capacity or understanding about feeling or about opening. I wasn't in the Dharma at that time. It was before I started my meditation, before I started understanding more of what this life and this existence is about. And I am not necessarily proud to say, but I was able to find a way to go through that period of time during Vietnam War without even really knowing much at all that that war was going on. I had a way of pretty much closing off and somewhat consciously at times, closing off to the information, the terrible information that was coming through and really avoiding it almost completely, almost entirely. And I was much more interested in my 20s, in my work and in my relationships and having a good time and partying and trying to somehow keep my life in a happy and secure way. And I felt that the opening in any way whatsoever to the truth of what was going on was some way like it would steal away my happiness. I really felt that it was threatening to me, that if I let myself feel or let myself be touched, let myself be moved in some way, that it was going to maybe even destroy me. And so I held on for dear life, doing everything I possibly could to keep it out, to shut it out. And I was very successful. And when I think back on it and reflect back on it, it really shows me the power of the mind, the power of a thought, the thought in a way that I needed to hold on to my security. I needed to hold on to this, what I felt was such fragile happiness, a quantity of happiness that something could steal it away and I would have no happiness left. I would be destroyed. So it's taken me through my practice, through my listening to the teachings, opening to the Dharma, doing meditation. It's pointed the way towards how to start letting life in, really. How to let life in. Not just my idea of what I think life should be or how I think life should look or how I should feel in my life or how I should experience myself in my life. But life as it is, life in its reality, life in its truth, how do I open to that and let it in without being destroyed, without being overwhelmed by it? And it's not necessarily something that we can easily know how to do. Because we are so identified with our minds, we're so identified with our emotions and our moods and our mind states when they arise, that they so easily take over. They become the powerful aspect within us. And we can easily lose connection with something within us that is much more intelligent, that is much stronger, that is much more grounded than the waves, the momentum, the pulling of these momentary and very insubstantial emotions and mind states. And our thoughts, our stories about all of this. So the meditation, the meditation practice really helps us find, I think one of the basic things that the meditation practice does, it helps us find a ground. And when I talk about a ground, it's not necessarily something solid, which is why it's not so easy to find, but it's some place within our self that we return back to where we feel a sense of steadiness or a sense of strength. And each time we bring our attention back, each time we bring our attention back to our breath or to our body or to some sense of present moment, we are returning back to this ground. We are finding some place where we can come to a place of rest. And we use the breath often in the beginning, even though there's some movement, it's still moving in time of in and out, in and out. It gives us a sense of some peace and some restfulness in ourselves where we're not so caught up in the thinking, in our stories, in our past and our future ideas about things, but we have a place to settle into that is more present, that is not so bound up in all of our fears and our worries and our regrets and our plans and our life. As we hold it, so we get a break from that, we rest back into ourselves a break from that. So we need some ground there as we start to work with these emotions, as we start to let ourselves feel and be touched by life. If we don't know that ground, if we don't have some sense of where to connect back to, return back to, some, some, I call it a refuge as well. Some kind of inner refuge in our being, then we will get pulled all around like somebody grabbing our tail and just whirling us around and throwing us any which way, any which direction. And we often, sometimes we get caught in that and we just feel the pain and the agitation and the unsatisfactory nature of being caught up in all of that. So our practice, our practice brings us back, brings us back, brings us back and what it does over time is it helps loosen these identifications with our past, with our fears, with our worries, our regrets. It begins to loosen the screws of that structure, of that framework, of how we think things are, how we take things to be. And as those screws begin to loosen, that whole structure begins to loosen, we start to experience a little bit more space. We start to experience like we can move a little bit more, like the screws aren't so, screwed so tight and we don't feel so rigid. We start to feel a little bit more flexibility and a more ease in ourselves and which then influences the way we move in our life. We feel a little bit more open, able to feel, able to be touched a bit more by life's impact because we're not, we don't get so identified and so caught by the way things are. We have some, some refuge, some place of, that we can access space and space is a metaphor for that sense of freedom, feeling more freedom in ourselves. Yesterday I had a, I had a beautiful conversation with my sister on the telephone and she called me in the morning because she has had a cat for 18 years who is in its last months. And she called because she took it to the vet and the vet told her that the red blood count is so low that it could die like in a day or two. And so she called me to tell me this because she's really attached to her cat. And she wanted to talk about it, talk about the possibility that it's going to die. And you know when I think about her cat right now, I was there a few months ago, it's actually this, if you look at this cat, it's very small, very thin. It looks like a very sick little animal that you probably wouldn't, it's just a cat. You know you probably wouldn't think, you don't have to really give so much attention or so much, you know, it's just a cat, it's going to die, you know, no big deal. It's just, you know, cats, they're born, they're died, dogs are born, they're die. And it's, it could be easy to kind of get into that frame of mind in relationship to this animal. But this animal is like her child. She's had this cat for 18 years and it's been with her every, nearly every moment when she's home. She doesn't have any of her own children and she's invested a very deep emotional relationship with this cat. And it means so much to her and the death of this cat is almost like the death of a child. And she has so much feeling and emotion about this impending death. And so we talked for quite a while on the phone about how to hold the dying of this cat and what to do when it dies and the burial and where she's going to bury it and how she's going to have a service for it and the altar she's going to create for it. And her whole, her whole relationship to it and she even said to me, she said, you know, I really want to stay with Rolex, the name is Rolex. I really want to stay with Rolex a while after he dies. I just want to sit there with him after he dies and just spend time with him. And we talked about that and she was so open and so willing to go through her feelings about what was going on for her. And we even cried a little bit together. We went through the whole thing together. Eighteen years ago, she's had this cat for 18 years. Eighteen years ago, she was a raging alcoholic. She couldn't even function very well in her life. She had to completely numb herself because her whole idea of life was only about having a good time and only about partying. And anything that was going to take that away from her was a tremendous threat. So she wasn't feeling anything. She even says that about 10 years of her life, she doesn't even remember, let alone feel. So here we are 18 years later, 17 years later, having this really beautiful, sensitive talk on the phone about how to feel and to really sit together. And to let it in and to cry and to feel and to talk about it and plan about what's real and what's going on. And I was so touched by that. I was so touched by the possibility of transformation over time when we say, okay, it's time. It's time. I'm going to start to see what's really going on there in my heart, in my being. I'm going to let myself be touched by information. I'm going to let things in. And I'm just going to see. I'm going to do it as an investigation. I'm going to do it as an inquiry. I don't know what's going to happen to me as I start to let myself feel more. But I want to find out. I want to see what my patterns are. What happens to me? Where do I go? How do I respond? How do I react? What's my whole understanding as I open to this investigation into this third factor of mindfulness that the Buddha talked about? When I reflected on different ways that we can work with our feelings when we reflect on this together, I came up with four strategies, two strategies that seem unskillful and two strategies that seem skillful. The first one is the two unskillful ones, where we let in information. We let in what's going on. We really let ourselves feel what's happening. And then we become completely overwhelmed by it. We get totally caught up in our story. We get into our reactivity. And we are caught. And depending on how long that goes on for, it could go on for a long time. It could go on for a lifetime about particular issues. And we can act out. We can act out in those cases. That's often one situation that happens. Another is the opposite, which is not letting it in. Having something come towards us and then blocking it. I don't want that. Closing off, shutting down. And just totally avoiding, which is a strategy I know very well. This also gets quite reinforced by the Buddhist practice, where there are a lot of images of the Buddha being totally still and not reacting. And there can be kind of an image of Buddhism of this more of this shutting down and not being affected by anything. Kind of a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of this particular teaching. The third one is the skillful way of letting in. That we let in. We let in information. We let ourselves be touched. We let ourselves be moved. And we have enough resources to know how to be steady with what's happening within us. And at the same time, still letting ourselves be feeling. That means that we are present. We are able to stay present with what is in our whole, in our mind, in our body, in our whole experience. And let it move and shift with compassion. We understand what it means not to get identified and caught with the story itself. But that we can still be in our body and feel what's moving in our body as it's happening. We understand, we understand through the teachings and through the practices, the power of the mind. And how easily we can get caught by the story. And we have resources to know how to unhitch, unhook ourselves from those stories and let ourselves really feel. And then the fourth strategy is something that we don't often talk about or know about. Which is the actual skillful way of blocking. The skillful way of not letting in. Which is when we understand that something that is going to, that we're hearing about or feeling at the moment is going to be too overwhelming. Or we don't have the strength of the resources at that time to really let it in. That we consciously say, no, not now. And we find some way to skillfully distract ourselves or to move away, to shut it out. This is also mentioned in the text by the Buddha in one of his five ways of working skillfully with distracting thought. And he calls this particular technique forgetting or not giving attention to as a skillful way of regulating and monitoring what's moving within us. So I mentioned these four just to give you some kind of overview of all the ways that we may respond or relate to the emotional life as it moves. But I think what it really points to is that this really is an art in itself. And I say this now sort of as a way to remind you that it's not something that you necessarily should already know how to deal with. Because sometimes when we find ourselves getting so caught and identified with something that's going on, and oftentimes difficult things that are going on, we can also judge ourselves or get down on ourselves because, well, I've been practicing for ten years or I've been practicing for five years or I've been doing this for a year and look how caught I am and look how stuck I get. And we can really have high expectations for how steady we should be in our practice. But I really want to remind you to let go of that thought pretty quickly because this whole practice that we're learning is truly an art. It's an art of living. It's how to live this life in a wholehearted, full way with consciousness and wisdom in a way that we really are in touch with the truth of things, with the truth of our being to come into a true place of freedom and recognition of what this existence is about. This is really quite an awesome path. I've had so much more respect now as I continue on as the years go by now for really how difficult this path is. So I just wanted to open this up and I do want to hear from you. We have about 15 minutes or so. And I want to hear your own reflections and your own responses. What gets stirred for you as you reflect on this theme today? What arises for you? Yes, please. Well, as you were speaking, I was thinking of a poem by Yates. And I always used to interpret this on a societal theme. But as you were speaking, I began thinking of it more in terms of a very personal theme. And he uses the metaphor of a falcon that's circling in an ever wider gyrations and loses track of the falcon of his voice. And if I can remember the poem, I'll share it with you. It goes turning and turning in wide-winged gyres. The falcon cannot hear the falconer. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed. The blood doomed, tide is loosed, and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. The best lack all confidence, and the worst are filled with passionate intensity. And I was thinking about that phrase as you were speaking of the ceremony of innocence. And how it seems to me like that's what gets lost when I get upset either by what's going on in a community level, family level, a societal level, a world level. And I was thinking, well, keeping that ceremony of innocence, keeping, and that's what keeps my center, that's what keeps the small self seated on the big side. And for me, I think it's really, it's about bowing, and it's about bowing to life. Just bowing in awe of all of life. Yes, yes, and it sounds, and again you're pointing to having a center from which to bow. It's like, so you bow to life from the center of innocence. And so important again and again not to lose the center. We have to know the center. We have to know the center. So the practice brings us to the center, and then it's easier to bow to life. And it's a beautiful metaphor that the center of innocence. Thank you. Yes. I'm wondering how do you deal with trauma in this respect because the trauma is not mine, it's stored in the body. And so basically trauma puts your heart as a center. Yes. So how would you then have to bring people back to the center? Yes. And also in that context, I have a personal question, because the fifth method of the Buddha was to not be reminded on that story of what happens. Did I understand that? You know that you were just screaming out, could you be reminded on that what originally had happened? I'm not sure what the fifth one. Let's see if you can answer my question about trauma. Yeah, yeah. Right, right, right. Well, I'm not a psychotherapist, and I haven't studied how to work with trauma, particularly from that dynamic, from the psychodynamic theory. But I know from my own experience that most of us are dealing with trauma. I would think that most, a very large percentage of the human beings are working with inner trauma in some way. And it's the trauma that actually makes it so difficult to open to, as you say, we lose the sense of our center, we lose the sense of that spacious center that we are, because the trauma seems so solid, so thick, so much who we are in those times. When it arises, that seems to be what the reality is. So two things. One is our meditation practice can help us, because the times that we do go into our bodies, into our experience, we are starting to touch different aspects within our being with mindfulness and learning resources how to stay steady with that. So the path is actually in itself teaching us how to do that as we start to touch more into the different aspects of holding and tightness within ourselves. I also think that for many of us we need outside support for that. When we really touch strong places of trauma, I mean, in my experience as a Dharma teacher, I've been with a lot of people who have touched those places on retreats, and they need somebody there. They can't be there by themselves. And so it's really important if one is aware that they have strong issues in that way to get support for that. People who really know how to sit there and guide them, it's very difficult to stay present, to stay steady by yourself. That's been my experience. Yes? I appreciate what you said about how the war stuff seems to add another layer to your life, for me it does any way of stress or fear at this time. And I guess I'm struggling with how to, the peace march coming up, with how to be peaceful despite all the anger and frustration and fear that comes from that. I'm going to act from a peaceful place, even though I'm feeling all this anger. And it reminded me of a, in 91 I guess it was, when Kuwait was going on, and I was in college at the time, and I was scared of getting drafted. And there was a peace rally walking down the street down my school, and people were saying, we want peace, we want peace. And I drove my car next to another car, it was in the rally, and he looked down at me, and he was like, can't you see what we're trying to do here, man? And I got, what are you trying to do here, passing me? And I looked at him and said, I thought you wanted peace. Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, it's good. And just to see how easy it was for anybody to get caught by energy and frustration, even when you're yelling for peace. That's the struggle. Yeah, yeah. I think the first thing is to let go of the idea of being peaceful. Because being peaceful is another concept that we can overlay on top of the experience, and then it actually can interfere with a lot of energy that needs to be expressed and be present in that situation. I think the idea of peacefulness needs to be thrown out. The anger that you're talking about can actually be transmuted into very powerful energy that can be effective for change. So I would, what's more important is really looking at the energy of anger, and seeing that it has a destructive side, but it also has a very constructive side. Anger, anger, the word anger brings up connotation that it can be really harmful and destructive and we need to get rid of it. And the fact there's a big, you know, the Buddhist ideology around it is like you get rid of anger. But I think that that also is a potential confusion in the teachings. Because we really want, again, this is around the feeling, we really want to get in touch with what's there. So like what I would encourage you is like to feel all that you're feeling and all the emotions that are there. Feel that. And then with your wisdom, notice what aspect of the energy is creating more destruction and suffering, and what aspect of the energy, what part of the energy can you actually direct in some kind of wholesome and useful way. So it's not black and white, it's energy. In the Diamond Heart, in the Ridwan work, it's called red energy. It's not anger, it's red energy. And how do we use that red, you know, how do we use it to bring strength and power in our lives and make a difference on this planet? So even as I talk about it, you know, as I talk about it, I can start to feel it. You know, it's like, you know, I start to feel more strength and power in my body. It's like, yes, that red energy. You know, how can we use it? So not to be afraid of it, and to be watchful of the Buddhist, kind of the Buddhist ideals that can form around how we're supposed to be in the face of this kind of situation. Yes? Do you have any guidance on how to discern between skillful and unskillful ways of fending things off? Of fending things off, like for example, you mentioned two skillful and two skillful ways of letting things in or fending things off. So how to defend, or how to discriminate, really? Between skillful and unskillful. So discriminating between letting it in in a skillful way and pushing it out in a skillful way. Is that right? Yeah. Usually, I think there's not really a recipe for that necessarily. One of my considerations is really looking at my own capacity for dealing with something. And that changes all the time. You know, maybe I just got a call from my mother, and she's really sick, and I have a whole lot of work to do that day, and I have six phone calls to make, and I have to see two clients who are having very difficult situations in their life. And then I get a call with somebody telling me something else, and I just can't – I have to look at my own capacity. I can't do that right now. But I don't do that. I don't say no or shut it out with more kind of fear and anxiety about having to do that. I say, it's more of a question of examining my present situation. What do I have the capacity for right now? And making some kind of discernment from there. If I'm on retreat and I have a whole day, something arises in my mind that's very difficult, and I'm just sitting and walking that day, I may have more capacity to deal with that. And then I can let it in, and I can do some inquiry, and I can really work with it. So I think it's a lot around capacity. That might be one aspect of the answer there. Yeah. And then I think this might be the last one. And then maybe one more. I just wanted to add something when you were talking about the war and the terror and the war, because I think what you brought up is an issue that many of us deal with that are involved in some way or planning to go on Saturday. One of the things that we've done that I find is really helpful is that we go and sit. So we go to this big peace rally, and the Buddhist Peace Fellowship actually sits and meditates as a group at the rallies. And it allows you to both process your own stuff that comes up, which is, I don't know, for me it was huge because having gone back to the 60s when we used to protest, and I was more angry and acting out on that. But also, there's a difference to me between what you really are feeling and how you're acting out. And I think what my intention has been and what has really helped me is to put attention on not acting out in an angry manner, but dealing with the anger that I feel about the fact that we are on the verge of possible war. And separating out those two is really key, I think, if you're going to be involved at all in the peace movement. So you're pointing out to really know the difference between what you're feeling and what you're acting out. And by doing that, by really knowing the feeling more fully, it sounds like then you can be more discerning in how you're going to act out. Because my sense is you're not saying you don't do any action. I mean, the action's necessary. The action at the peace rally is to basically sit, and then to walk or whatever, and then sit again. But the other thing that happens is, that happened to me the first time I did this as an adult, or right now, recently, was that I kept individuating out. I kept looking around and saying, well, that's not me. Well, I don't feel that. Well, I don't agree with that. And I ended up contracting instead of opening my heart to all these people that were there. And so it's really helpful then to be able to actually sit with what's coming up and start investigating those feelings of practice is incredible for dealing with that. Right. Right. And then you're pointing out the beauty of maybe not acting at all, just sitting with the feelings and watching what happens when that arises. And then at some point, perhaps some action taking place, but just really honoring the feelings that are arising. Yeah, beautiful. Thank you. Maybe we'll take, there was one more, and then I think we'll have to end today. I like what you said a lot about not blocking out what's going on in the world, but keeping a peaceful center for which to observe it. Because I hear constantly from people, and I have for years, and I'm sure you all have too, I think we were talking about this a couple weeks ago, that people constantly say, I don't read the newspaper. I read all this stuff, it is so dreadful. I like the work, which started to get a lot of energy around it. So many of these things, you really cannot do anything about it. And I have even read mental health articles telling people to take what they call newscasts, where you don't read any of this and you don't listen to any of this. And it's a really interesting issue. You have so much information now, whereas maybe 500 years ago, people had only an idea of what was going on in their own small world. So that's just a comment, but I found what you said very helpful. Because I didn't read all this stuff, and I think, why do I do this? Because I feel like I should. Because I'm a citizen of the world, and yet at the same time, I can't do anything about a lot of it. But I want to not know. Right, you don't want to not know. And at the same time, have you known what you call a buffer exactly, but a center? I like that. Yes, that's the key. The key is the center. And knowing that center, and knowing it really well, that is the ground. That's the foundation under our feet, where we can stand steady. And that's what makes the difference in our practice. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's a joy to sit with you for a short time. And I think I'll be back in February, beginning of February for a Monday evening. So I'll see you again. Thank you. And thank you too for any donations that you leave in the basket. It helps me continue to be able to do this teaching that I love so much.
