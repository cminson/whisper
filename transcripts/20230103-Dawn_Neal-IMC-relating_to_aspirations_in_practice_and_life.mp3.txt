 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Balancing relaxation and alertness. Settling in. Invitation is to soften your eyes. They're not already closed and it feels comfortable to do so closing them. In tuning in to however this body is, this heart and mind are today, this moment. Inviting awareness to be at the forefront of attention. And perhaps generating or recalling whatever aspiration brings you here, brings you to the practice, brings you to the practice this morning. Noticing the feeling of that in your heart, in your body. Perhaps drawing nourishment from it. And then letting that go when it feels right. It's staying with that feeling, if it's nourishing feeling. And noticing any effect that just that little moment has had on the practice. That recollection of aspiration. Inviting the body to relax. May this body relax. If it's helpful, sweeping through the head and face, their control does. Inviting the settling. Inviting softening in the chest, upper back, torso and middle back. And resting, resting in your seat or your spot. Feeling the support beneath you, the grounding. Allowing the arms and legs to rest. And stillness. And feeling the contact of the hands. Whatever they're touching. The contact of the feet. Grounded. And now your awareness. Just diffuse more deeply through this whole body. Body as a whole. More of the senses. Skin. The integrity of the posture. And allowing awareness to suffuse, pervade and fill the heart and mind. Taking in whatever is there. Allowing, receiving experience. Maybe asking, what is the quality of awareness in this moment right now? It's helpful to anchor on a particular experience of the body or breath to start. Please feel free to do so. And either now or when it feels right. The invitation over the next 20-25 minutes is to open up to the flow of experience. Arising and passing away from time to time, refreshing awareness. The light touch. Everywhere. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. From time to time, checking in. Are you aware? That's obvious. That's the relationship to what is arising. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice. Before we transition to the Dharma talk, the invitation is to just take a moment and silently send a pulse of kindness, goodwill, mitta, to the your co-practitioners in this Zoom room and maybe people who are often here who aren't here today or other practitioners in your life. Sending that sense of goodwill to the little tiles, whether they be video or icons or photos. What does you do knowing that you're receiving that goodwill? That goodwill. Today I'd like to talk about why is relationship to aspiration mostly in our practice but also in our lives, what we're practicing for in a way. And to start off, just invite a visualization. You're welcome to keep your eyes open or close them. To imagine that you're in a boat, be a sailboat, out on the calm sea at night. And just like in ancient times, this boat is being steered, guided by the stars, in particular the North Star, the compass point. From time to time, a captain, whether that be you or someone else, is looking up, looking high for the direction of where the boat is headed. And from time to time, of course, looking down ahead, verifying that there are no obstacles or smells in the waves, staying attuned to what is happening on the boat. And feeling that sense of sure but gentle motion, turning, flowing through the sea. So with that is the visualization very simple this morning. We'll speak about the role of the North Star, the aspiration in our practice. Aspirations, of course, can take many forms. They can be in New Year's resolutions, for example. But in practice more often, there's a lot of aspiration or aspirational language in the Buddha's teachings. There is talk of the paramese or the perfections that Marialine and I and others talked about over the past couple of months. All the nation of beautiful qualities of the heart and the mind. There's the aspirations of the brahma baharas, the beautiful heart qualities. And of course, the most important, the biggest aspiration in Buddhist practice, freedom, liberation itself. So it's clear from the teachings and probably from your own experience, certainly from mine, that aspirations can be really helpful. They can bring up energy, they can be inspiring. And this talk is going to cover a little bit of that name, some key aspirations or unpack the ones that I named just a little bit. And talk about ways to relate to aspirations in practice, to sort of increase the way that they can support us, inspire us, and to name the pitfalls. And hopefully by naming them, exploring them, reduce any potential pitfalls of practicing using aspiration. I'll talk about this over the arc of our practice and a little bit touch on in the moment. And while I'll be talking mostly about formal meditation practice, as you all know, all of this applies to daily life too. So that's where we're going. So as I mentioned, the core aspiration of Buddhist practice is freedom, liberation. And freedom from what though, right? There are different ways this is talked about in the early Buddhist teachings, but the most consistent message the Buddha gave was freedom, enduring freedom from greed, hatred, and delusion. It's also a freedom to, and this is core to Buddhist practice too, a freedom to relate to whatever is coming up in experience to life itself in a way that is healthy, also nourishing, free, not stuck. Reduction of dukkha, suffering. So the aspiration for freedom, aspiration for insight is one sort of subset of this. And this could be the growth of wisdom itself in all its various forms. Or it could be formal insights, the insight into a nature and permanence and not selflessness or not self. And of course, into the nature of dukkha, dis-ease, suffering. These kinds of doorways into deep understanding of the way that experiential reality happens for us. That can bring up joy, equanimity, freedom, a term that Tinnis Rinpaku translates as renunciation joy, the joy of clear seeing, of not being stuck to reality. So I think of it not having too much of a fixed agenda or a fixed view about what needs to happen. I spoke about renunciation joy and sort of more detail and more details about practicing with it back in October. I think it might have been October 18th, so I can unpack that a little bit more if you didn't hear that talk. I'll miss them later. But meanwhile, I also want to talk about other direct experiences of beautiful aspirational states. The paramees, which are including mindfulness itself, renunciation itself, wisdom, and also overlap with the brahma bhahras or the immeasurable qualities of metta, loving kindness and goodwill, compassion, joy itself, empathetic altruistic joy for others' well-being, and equanimity, joy of non-clinging. So when they arise, even the tiniest glimpses of these can nourish your whole day or maybe a long period of practice. It can fuel, inspire whatever is best in us on the cushion and off. And this is much truer if I don't identify with them, if they're not about sort of making a project of me or making a project of causing them to happen again. Identification is one way that these qualities can be obstacles, as well as instead of nourishment kind of practice. So this kind of gets us towards the pitfalls of aspiration or of recreating experience. So how many of you have experienced a great sit or a great mind or heart state or even a great breath and just like longed for its return, really wanted it back? How does that work for you? I can speak for me. It does not work very well in some recipe or just satisfaction, dukkah, irritation, even sometimes like a sense of failure or identification, whatnot. I have a story about this actually. So early in my practice, I ended up going to Asia for a long period of time, many months. And towards the end, I landed up in a monastery kind of by accident. I ended up in this monastery. It was a gorgeous place. It was on this giant limestone karst on this teeny little island in the Bay of Thailand. I spent the period of time between Christmas and New Year's Day there. So about seven days. And my practice was just unfolding really beautifully. I've been alternating between volunteering, pilgrimage, retreat, and just general travel for months and was also super motivated. So there are all these beneficial conditions. The motivation was happening from not knowing if a cancer biopsy done Christmas Eve Day was going to come back positive or negative. So the mind was just focused. All right. This moment, this practice, what is going on? And in this beautiful place, in these very austere conditions, insight arose. And at that point in my practice, it was the clearest, deepest kind of shift of consciousness I'd ever experienced in my life. And it was beautiful. And it really, really inspired the practice. And oh, for the first number of months, I just experienced it. It's kind of like an act of grace or a gift from the universe, a gift of the practice. And didn't think a lot about it. Just kind of lived with the results. And then I was exposed to more kinds of skill oriented teachings, if you will, in American Picassina. And I can't blame it on the teachers, but the way my mind interpreted it was to go back and try to recreate this experience based on techniques. And let me tell you, it didn't work. It didn't work at all. And that identification itself became a real obstacle to maturing my practice for quite some time, a humbling amount of time. So the aspiration to recreate, the aspiration to get somewhere or get back somewhere, not so useful often. Definitely not one held as a project that I can do, make happen in a certain way. I'm not the only one many practitioners find the way we relate to insight, whether wanting it or having had it or wanting it back, can be a problematic obstacle to spiritual maturity, actual true spiritual maturity. The desire to return to any particular state in Stuka, identifying with a particular experience or outcome can also be Dukkha. Even wanting to fulfill an aspiration in a certain way that it has to look a certain way can be a recipe for Dukkha, the second hero. So there's that piece. And now there's another piece I'm going to talk about, which is how aspirations in the practice are framed, how they're understood. So one beautiful way of framing them is as naturally emerging byproducts of meditative practice itself, spiritual practice itself. And that can be really beautiful. That itself can sometimes lead people, I don't know exactly how to say this, but not to be inspired enough, even perhaps it depends on the personality type and the phase of practice, but ignoring the possibility of aspiration, ignoring the north star can also lead us to just kind of drift around in the ocean for a long time for certain personality types or whatnot. On the other hand, framing the process of awakening is a series of attainment. So I'm using air quotes here for a reason. Attainment. That can be a pitfall to the concept of attainment sort of reifies something it concretizes it makes it into a thing. And while that can inspire a lot of energy and practice and can be really beautiful for all. Not saying never to use them as an idea. It can also lead to the strong tendency for a problematic view of or focus on the self. As I'm the one doing this in a way that builds me up or tears me down if it doesn't get done. Right. So overly identifying with practice, overly identifying with aspiration, attainment needs to look a certain way. That can condition huffing and puffing, striving, working too hard. Right. And it can also condition shame. Shame about sort of the natural process of being human and of refining spiritual life, refining the heart, refining the mind. That tends to happen through a combination of these beautiful states. The paramese or metta, passion, equanimity and having them as reference points for these really just sort of coming standard install this human beings things like greed, hatred, delusion, selfishness, pettiness, distraction, whatnot. Like name every hindrance you've ever thought of. They all come standard with the package. Right. It's not something to be down on ourselves about when it starts to get seen. Jennifer Goldstein has this quote that self knowledge is rarely good news. It's great news. It's great news because you're seeing it. If I'm not seeing it, I'm being led around by it. I'm controlled by it. Seeing is a sense of this identification from it. And the beautiful thing about the cultivation of sati and lucid awareness mindfulness is that eventually itself corrects because all of you have seen this in one way or another we start to see over time. These unhelpful results of ill will for example, I just got home from a retreat, a day and a half ago. And one of the things that really came up for me on the retreat was just how painful it was to have ill will towards another person. Even like it's bad or shameful or wrong. It just didn't feel good. Pure and simple and the results in the mind were not good results. So the mind just dropped it. It's that kind of process that with all the bits of unwholesomeness or unsavoriness or greed hatred delusion, and all of their henchmen or playground buddies, all of them have these unhelpful results and if we tune into those, naturally drop away. Over time, it's a self correcting process. On the other hand, not being able to tolerate seeing them. And this is something that grows over time with mindfulness with wisdom right this ability to see them without having guilt shame of feeling of sort of the negative form of conceit of being less than if we're able to see them, not make excuses for them, have remorse perhaps for an action. Right. We're even remorse for an experience. Remorse is about the action. Right. Guilt, shame are about us. And I'm seeing all this I'm spending a couple of moments on it because lack of tolerance for seeing this can lead to repression and spiritual bypassing. So it relates to aspiration because if, for example, I did a lot of mental practice, I use a lot of mental practice in Burma. And I came back and I could watch when anything that wasn't met came up. And this is a great practice, right, to watch anything that's not whatever the aspiration is or whatever is wholesome in the mind, flooding through. However, it's very easy. It's a tiny, tiny step from that to if there's a reaction, squishing it down, repressing it, locking it away, cordoning it off. And that's human too, and it's correctable too. But it can lead to spiritual bypassing and that slows down the spiritual maternity process. Or it can be really annoying to the other people in your life. Really annoying. Right. Right. If I'm unable to see that I am, I'm just picking a random example here, overbearing in conversation. What is the impact on my relationships? Not great. However, if I hold it lightly and can catch myself in the act of, gosh, being overbearing and just even name it with a laugh, that builds intimacy. Right. Or whatever it is, you know, pick your pick your flavor of obnoxious human habit. Right. To hold it lightly, our choices matter a lot. They matter a lot. And to notice that it doesn't make sense to push away, to squish that which we don't like about ourselves. It doesn't make sense to buy into it or feel totally crappy about it either. It's can the process self correct? Can I hold it lightly? And this is a process and it takes time. And most of us start in a self-blame realm or a justification realm and gradually soften into broader and broader and broader acceptance of our own foibles. And that leads to broader and broader acceptance of others foibles to understanding compassion. Another thing about relating to aspiration without seeing all of the not so great stuff is it can lead to taking a little bit too much credit for how practice unfolds. So yes, it's it's great to feel good about like, okay, I sat five days out of seven this week or I sat every morning or, you know, and to notice and appreciate, really appreciate and soak in our wholesome actions and wholesome qualities that arise in our heart to minds. Appreciating them helps them increase. So I'm not saying we shouldn't be doing that. But at the most mature levels of practice, it's possible to kind of get a big head or to get puffed up about some of the more beautiful things that unfold. And that doesn't help either. This path has been around for more than 2600 years and a lot of these beautiful qualities are laid out in great detail in the various texts that hold the Buddhist teachings through the millennia. And it's a beautiful thing to recognize one's own goodness and the maturity of the practice and have this healthy respect for yourself in whatever has unfolded while balancing that with a healthy humility that wow, these are the conditions that form the path of practice. They're not personal to me or to you or to anyone. We do these things, eventually these things, this practice does us and unfolds through us. And that's really beautiful too. But to hold aspiration as something in practice that only I do. That misses some of the point. It's kind of like, it's really healthy to aspire to something let's just say, aspire to get healthier to not drink to lose weight like whatever pick your typical New Year's resolution. It's great to feel good about progress, we make on that. That's really healthy. It's great. And to recognize that there are all these conditions in our lives, both supporting and countervailing forces that can support us, or make it a lot harder. You know someone with a genetic history of addiction is going to have a much harder time of drudgy anyway than someone who doesn't just those are the conditions. So, it's a little bit like unpacking privilege actually white privilege or other kinds of privilege that overly focusing on my role and fulfilling an aspiration ignores all of the beneficial tailwinds that I'm getting or overly focusing on my lack of ability to achieve a certain thing might be ignoring the big systemic headwinds. That support over the arc of practice of aspiration. Again, it's like that North Star. We, we need the aspiration, the bigger picture, looking high, the more we're gazing high. And it's really helpful to notice if the winds of change direction, if the conditions of the sea have gotten not so great. There's an obstacle rock. Those are maybe the external conditions right. And it's really helpful to notice the internal conditions. I think that Han has this great simile, but he used. He was alive. It was about what was an actual story, but it was also a simile. He talked about how refugees would be on a boat escaping the war torn region. Where he was. And if one person on the boat stayed calm, they would make it to safety. But if everybody watched it, they were doomed. Right. So that's a truism relation. And it's also true about internal collection of forces. And if you're a calm person in the boat inside, that could be mindfulness, right. awareness. So it's helpful to notice if the denizens, the occupants of the boat are freaking out a little bit of my greed or my anger or my desire is sort of kicking up, because that can throw me off course. It isn't necessarily helpful to get more involved in internal conflict about it, but to see it and acknowledge it. To stay calm. To stay aware. Love of inspiration from aspiration or ideals. It's a really healthy reference point and kind of ballast in the moment when it's balanced with this mindfulness, this humility. Really offer powerful motivation to say that a really helpful approach for me has been to hold any expectations lightly. There's this beautiful quote from the current Dalai Lama. You suggested different timeframes in different versions of this I've heard or seen but he says to really helpful to look back at one's practice, or we could say one's progress and aspiration, regularly, every five to seven years. Too often. And, we can also assess a little bit, maybe at the end of a set. End of a day or a week or a year. But again, lightly, lightly, slow. So, I'm going to talk more about this next time I'm here. But overall, I just want to really encourage you to find a way to draw nourishment from whatever aspirations you have, whatever they are. And to use the alternative to over identification, which is to notice all of these different conditions internally and externally, with a healthy respect. The path unfolds through conditions, conditions, conditions. And that doesn't mean we don't have any control. We've used the analogy before here of a kayaker in white water. She doesn't have control over the shape of the rapids that day how much waters in the river. She doesn't have control over the flow of the river itself or its depth. She can navigate the conditions that are there wisely. So there's this much, maybe, but that's everything. Nudging the conditions that we can control. Steering that boat, whether it's a kayak or a sea ship. So, next time, two weeks from now, I'll talk a little bit more about how this overall aspiration relates to the little impulses in the moment that we have. Because those can help or hinder. Staying with aspiration. Staying with our goals, whatever they are, practice or in daily life or the combination of the two. But for now, I just want to invite you to get nourished from your aspirations. Thank you. So friends, we have about 10 minutes. If you have any general Q&A, any general questions, comments, points of confusion or contention. And it can be about the talk or it can be more generally about your practice or is open. You can also put questions in the chat if it's easier. If you don't have a question for me, I have a question for you, which is, what is one aspiration you have for your practice in this coming year? It's helpful to name it. Anybody? Yes, three. And then Carrie. I think what I when you were when you were giving the talk, I was reminded of what the very helpful advice I got from Ajahn Amaro. And he said that. Do not practice with the idea of me doing something, because when you think that I have to do it, it is reinforcing a wrong view. And he said instead, let awareness inform you. Awareness and wisdom guide you, guide the practice. And I found it very helpful because I found that every time I feel like I need to correct something, I feel a lot of tension. So in that moment, I remember what he said. And I just say, OK, I'm just going to sit here and wait and wait for awareness to come and guide me. And it is so much easier that way. And it makes the practice much more enjoyable. So, yeah. Thank you. Beautiful tweet. Thank you for passing on Ajahn Amaro's wisdom. Did you still want to share something? Yes, it's in the same vein in a way when you say that you're waiting for something, sometimes with being judgmental of my practice or of some of the normal tendencies that come up. That second arrow that is so automatic in judging. Can you say more about that second arrow or that judgment? I hear the comment, but I'm trying to tease out if there's a question here. There is in terms of being more accepting and just being with some of that that comes up. And I find that I struggle with when you said, be calm, just sit, just be, all of that. Sometimes that second arrow comes up with criticism towards not just being. But I think that's the kind of spirit sort of addressing that was where the Joseph, Joseph Goldstein, this clip that self knowledge is really good news. Right. It's so common for each of us to see things we don't like or experience things we don't like. Judgment about our practice is a really common one. I'll say the first piece is that it tends to be something that softens over time as the practice develops. And yes, there are absolutely things that can be done to help soften it in the moment. The first is when the judgment comes up to notice the tone of voice in the mind, to notice the attitude of the mind that is conferring the judgment. There's usually a sense of hostility or frustration or anger and underneath that what's there. One really helpful piece of advice Andrea fella gave I think it was on the experience students retreat to a group of us was that a kind of judgment or self will will even that can be embedded in it in the harshness. It's a misunderstanding of a part of the mind that's actually really trying to. It's really trying to help us and to kind of look underneath that harshness and experience the the attitude of the wanting to help can soften because often if there's a judgment, then there's a I shouldn't be having this judgment or a resistance of the judgment or collapse from the judgment, but instead recognize, oh, this is just a misunderstanding. This judgmental mind is trying to help me. And it's just not helping me very well and that can bring in a sense of kindness or compassion for the whole heart, the whole mind. And it's that kindness and compassion that ends up softening the judgment and resolving it into discernment. So, does that address your question. Yes, it does. Thank you very much. Keep with it. Thank you. So I'm going to stop the recording to honor time that I will stay around for a little bit more Q&A there's one in the chat and I think I saw another hand. Meanwhile, just want to wish all of you the best in your practice and to briefly dedicate them right before I turn off the recording. Let our practice be of benefit to ourselves and our lives and all of the lives we touch and all of the lives they touch. Be all beings. Be happy, be healthy, be peaceful, and be free. In your practice.
