Dharmette: Intention  and Ease

Intention is the topic for today. I think there are 
layers and layers of exploration around this  
topic. If you have a desire for something,  ask 
yourself , “Why you want t hat? What is the 
motivation or the intention behind the desire? ” 
 
For example, y ou could say that you have a 
desire to buy a nice shirt. What is the intention of 
buying a nice shirt? The intention is to impress 
everyone. Why? Because I want to show how 
great I am, and the shirt is how to do it. But then 
you could ask further what the intention is 
behind that desire to impress everyone. You go 
deeper. Maybe you see that you feel insecur e, 
and you want to assuage your insecurity. What 
is behind the insecurity? Maybe it’s anxiety.  
 
There are layers behind the desires. If you ask 
about the intention of why you do something , 
don’t settle for the first answer. Keep dropping  
down. What's going on underneath that? Why am I doing this? In vipassana  practice,  asking 
these questions is good. But the way to look for 
the answers is not intellectually or cognitively. 
Instead, feel your way into the answers. What is 
the intention? What does it feel like to want to 
impress people with your clothes? What parts of 
your body get activated? Where is the energy in 
your body? What's going on for you?  
 
If the intention is to impress people, w hat does it 
feel like to try to settle the insecurity?  Where in 
the body does it feel insecure? Refer back to the 
body. When you feel it in your body, you have 
access to two general areas of information : what 
it feels like physically  and emotionally. A real ly 
good way to know what is going on emotionally 
is to feel it in your body  – not to think about what 
we’re emoting, but to actually feel it. So the 
question of “What's the intention  of why you’re  
doing something ?” is a very useful question to 
ask, but d on’t settle for the first answer. Keep 
asking. And when you have an answer, then  ask 
again : “Why am I doing that?”  
 
The Buddhist tradition  divide s intention into 
those that are skillful and  those  that are 
unskillful. In common English we might  say 
intentions that are helpful or unhelpful, intentions that are healthy or unhealthy. You can look at an  
intention and see whether it is accompanied by 
tension , or rather by a sense of aspiration , open -
heartedness , open -mindedness, or “open -
bodiedness .” How do  you feel when you have 
that intention?  
 
Chances are that , if it is an unskillful intention 
and you are sensitive to your body, you will feel 
that something is  off in the body. If the intention 
is skillful, then you will feel in your body that it is 
right. It will feel good or appropriate. The body 
can be a reference point for whether something 
is skillful or not. Any intention that feels yucky is 
probably not good to have.  
 
It could be that my intention is to save the world. 
That is a good intention, right? You should be 
inspired that I have this intention. But when I feel 
into that intention to save the world, I might feel 
there’s tension around it. There  might be fear , 
anxiety , ambition, or some kind of self -concept 
involved. Maybe I want to save the world to 
impress all of you , so you will like me . That’s 
where I’ll get behind this messianic theme. But if 
I feel into it, it feels tense, tight, heavy, and off. 
 At other time s, wanting to do something 
generous for the world , you can feel into it , and 
you feel that the intentio n doesn’t feel bad. 
Actually you feel lighter because of it. Internally, 
there’s a “Yes! This is right.” You can feel your 
way into that , and f eel the diffe rence. The 
evaluation of whether something is skillful or 
unskillful for you doesn’t have to be about cost-
benefit calculations. But rather , “How does it feel  
to have this desire, to be motivated in this way ?” 
Some of the best motivations you can have may 
look good on the surface , but deeper down are 
not healthy because they don’t really speak for 
who you are or for what is right for you. Maybe 
something unhealthy or unskillful is prompti ng 
the motivation. K eep asking about the motivation 
and what the body sensations and emotions 
underneath reveal. And this helps us to 
understand whether it makes sense to follow 
through  or not.  
 
A number of people feel they live with an 
obligation to do things right, or in a cer tain way. 
We are obligated to want to save the world, 
aren’t we? Are there obligations behind the 
desires? Sometimes, because of our training, 
obligation seems like second nature . But I would 
suggest that Buddhist spirituality come s from a different point of view. It doesn’t come from any 
kind of obligation  at all . Rather, o ur healthy 
responses to the world can come in a relaxed, 
easy way. If they do not come in this way, 
maybe we have to look more carefully.  
 
Some people may say that if they are just 
relaxed and easy, they won’t do anything 
because of laziness. But if you look more 
carefully  at the laziness, chances are that 
laziness is an activity with its own ecology. If you 
see it more deep ly, you may see tension there. 
And if you look at that, you may find it releases. 
It is possible to respond to the world and take 
care of yourself in a very effective way while 
staying relaxed. In Buddhism , skillful motivation 
has a quality of ease , relaxation , non -tension, or 
non-clinging . 
 
Again , the evaluation of whether an intention is 
skillful or unskillful doesn’t have to come from  
some moral standard against  which you 
measure yourself . There is no moral Buddhist 
book that tells you how to be. The book is in 
your heart. It isn’t a complicated  evaluation , but 
rather it has a lot to do with the ease we feel. If 
there is no  ease in the motivation, then you  need 
to take a second look, and a third look. Maybe you are acting on assumptions that are not  
useful for you. Those assumptions perpetuate 
suffering in some way. The challenge Buddhism 
offers you is trusting a heart that is at ease. See 
what comes from that.  
 
So, why do you do what you do? Why do you 
have the desires you do? What are the 
motivations and intentions? What are the 
feelings and th e emotions? Are the choices you 
make skillful or unskillful? The way to evaluate is 
to refer back to the body. What happens there in 
the present moment? Does it feel good? Or do 
you feel tense or off in some way? Let that be a 
guide for finding your way.
