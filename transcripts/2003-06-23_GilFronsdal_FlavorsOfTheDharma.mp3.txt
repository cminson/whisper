 So I kind of moved to say that coming down here today, I felt really happy about coming down here. And what made me happy was the idea of somehow discussing a Dharma together with everyone. And I think it's a really beautiful thing to discuss the Dharma. But first I have some announcements to make. This Wednesday, there's a half-day sitting from 9.30 to 12.15 and they're lovely half-day sittings and I'm available for about six interviews, 15 minute interviews. People come and at the beginning sign up. And then we have a teen program this Friday from 7.30 to 9.30. And then I'm not going to be here for the next two Mondays. Next Monday, Alan Sonocki is going to come. He was the director of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship for many years and now is kind of still very central to that organization. And he's also a very senior Zen priest at the Berkley Zen Center. Very interesting man. And the following Monday, Ajahn Sundara is going to be here. Ajahn Sundara is a...she was here last year for about a week or ten days. And she is the senior, one of the most senior nuns in the monastic community of Ajahn Samero in England. And she's a French woman who was ordained in England in a Thai forest tradition. A French English Thai Buddhist. That's great. And here living in America. And these days. And she's a wonderful woman. She embodies the spirit of that tradition very well, the way she presents the Dharma and how she is. It's quite a lovely person to spend time with. And she's kind of going to be our resident teacher for the kind of the week she's here. And she's going to do a whole bunch of activities more than...during the week she's here, more than we usually do. And including a three-day non-residential retreat. But I think you can just drop in. Just probably schedule. Just come and join as you wish. And there's this kind of flyer on the table out there, I believe, with her schedule of things she's doing here while she's here. One of the things she's doing is on July 1st, Tuesday evening, a traditional puja, it's called in Sanskrit and Pali, worship service with chanting and meditation, probably some bowing. And there's a long tradition in Buddhism of including a lot more integrally part of Buddhist practice than just meditation. And the bowing and the chanting and all that is often considered quite integral to it all. We don't do much of that here in our tradition, at least we haven't. And so here she brings this flavor in. If you want to explore a different side of the Dharma, how it's expressed, that's a way to get it. And that's a little bit has to do with my theme of what I would like to raise for some discussion today, is all the different flavors of all the different ways in which the Dharma, Buddhism, Buddhist practice, gets expressed. And all the different ways that it manifests in different people's lives, in different countries, in different cultures, in different groups, all the different ways. And I'm a little bit inspired by this because we've had a series of meetings. We had this meeting with the architect on Sunday and all this idea of what should this building be like? These are all kind of just very, in some ways, very basic, very kind of root kind of issues. What does a building look like? What's a space like? What's sacred space look like? And how do we make it look into what we want? Most people come in here and probably recognize that this was a church once. And because it has that, you know, and what would Buddhist flavor be? What would Buddhist flavor be in America? And do we make it like a Thai temple or Burmese temple flavor? Do we make Japanese or Tibetan or Indian or, you know, or do we make it American? And what's American? Do we make it Mission style, kind of Spanish style? I mean, it seems like... That seems like it makes sense. Or do we, you know... What is it? And in considering this issue, I'm very aware that one of the central junctures of Buddhist practice is the meeting of the Dharma. The Dharma meaning both the practice, the practice principles, the practices and the teachings. The meeting of the Dharma and yourself and you, who you are as an individual. And that's a very special place, that meeting place of you as an individual and the Dharma. And it can't be replicated. It's very unique and needs to be respected very much. I like the fact that the word respect in English, you know, the root meaning of it, I guess in Latin, but means to look again, to respect, it means to look again. And that speaks very well for what the Vipassana practice is, the clear seeing that we're trying to develop. You look carefully, look again, what's really going on here? And what happens in that interface between you and the Dharma? And, you know, we think about all the people here and there's so many different streams of backgrounds that come into this room here. And each of those is very unique. You go back to your ancestors, and I think probably all of you, probably, my guests, your ancestors didn't, you know, came to this continent sometime in the last, within the last five centuries. I came to this continent in this generation. I'm an immigrant to this country. And experienced some of what it means to be an immigrant, not much, but a little bit, being an outsider and fitting in and being ridiculous. We're not being able to speak properly. And, you know, the stream of our cultural backgrounds, our family backgrounds, and we all carried it, carried with us, all these things. I'm thinking of, I recently went back to where I was born, I went back to Norway, where I'm from. And with my five year old son, it was kind of special to kind of show him, you know, where we came from and, you know, the country. And we actually went back to the farm, where I'd never seen, my father's never seen, my grandfather's never seen. But the farm, where my grandfather's grandfather came from, you actually come to a little sign on the road that says, Franzdal, one kilometer that way. So it's like, you know, the place our name comes from. It was kind of nice, right? And it was kind of a nice fun time with him. And I realized, you know, how he's different than me, because that's only half of him. And the other half of him, how are we going to introduce him to that other half, in his mother's side of the family? His mother's side of the family, they're Dutch Jews. We take him to Bergen-Belsen, where his grandparents were. And what age do we tell him that? We take him back to Amsterdam, and say, well, this is where they lived. You know, what age do we tell him about that side of his background? So he carries that with him. That's something that's still a bit different than what I carry with me. So when I went to Nepal, many years ago, 20 years ago, I went to a temple called Swayanbu Temple. And it's a Buddhist temple in Kathmandu. And I came at a time of a Buddhist festival. And I was kind of walking around. And I came to this little corner of the temple. And there's kind of like a platform built into the temple wall or something. And there were these musicians rocking out. With, you know, with Sitar and Tabla, and playing this, you know, what I recognize as being Hindu devotional music. That style, I don't know if you know this kind of style, very lively and very devotional. You know, they were like really wailing away at the drums and the Sitar. And they were singing, Buddha, Saranam, Gachami, Dhamma, Saranam, Gachami. I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma. And I'm aware of the Japanese tradition where you chant very kind of plainly straightforward. You know, you don't put a lot of emotion into it. I'm aware of the Thai tradition where also you don't do a lot of emotions. Kind of dignified, you know. It works very well for certain Protestant types. But these guys were rocking out. And my first thought was, oh, that's Buddhism influenced by Indian culture. The kinds of you dismiss it, you know. The next thought was, oh, wait a minute. The Buddha was Indian. And then I've gone, I've studied a little bit, you know, the history of Buddhism and stuff. And there's these ancient, I think, called friezes, these ancient sculptures that just show kind of pictures. Over 2,000 years ago, Buddhist holy sites in India, Sanchis and Sarana and different places. And they have all these pictures of what Buddhist life, at least idealized form of Buddhist life, was like. At these different sacred holy sites, the stupas, the temples, the monasteries. And from what they have evidence of these pictures, it was really lively. There was musicians rocking out with the same musical instruments as they were in Nepal, you know, 2,000 years later. They were dancing. And apparently wildly, because one of my favorite little depictions of this guy, in the middle of these musicians, you can tell he's dancing. I think you can dance. Because it looks like he's swirling around very fast. Because back then, the guys wore skirts. And something like that, Togo's, I don't know what. And so his skirt is thrown out to one side, like this. So you see his naked butt. And I think that only makes sense, you know, if you're spinning around, you know. And then there's this guy up in this tree with his hands and his two fingers, four fingers in his mouth. Usually you do that when you're whistling really loudly. And the impression is really lively, devotional. And so this little, what I saw in India, in Nepal, was maybe not an aberration. It was actually the expression of how Buddhism was celebrated in India for many centuries. There's other evidence, you know, the ancient India, that Buddhism was quite lively. A lot of music and celebrations. And a different flavor than what you get, what I got in Japan, or what I got in Thailand, or Burma. A different flavor than what I got in American Buddhist circles I was in. I like to think of the Dharma as being like water. And water can take the shape of any container it goes into, freely. And it goes into many different containers, depending on the need. Depending on what's available, depending on what's going on. Depending on how things are adapted, what's necessary in different cultural settings. And what is it for us here in America to adapt or invite or interact with that interface between ourselves and Buddhism? What happens here? The oldest form of Buddhism in America is a Japanese Pure Land tradition. They came to America, I think, somewhere around 1880, maybe. And they had huge issues of being Japanese Americans, of assimilating or fitting in, or figuring out how to be Buddhists in this country. And because there was a lot of discrimination against them, I suppose, what they tried to do was assimilate the best they can. And so they created the Buddhist churches of America. They used the word church. And in fact, they started, something that never existed in Japan, they started Sunday worship, Sunday services. They got the organs. They got pews. They got Sunday school for their kids. And they adopted all these things that they saw around them from Christian churches. And they didn't lose their Buddhist roots, but they used the forms around them as a way of expressing their Buddhism. And then the generation that I was involved in, coming out of the 60s in the counterculture, was very much kind of in reaction against much of the status quo conventions of Western society, Western culture. And the last thing we wanted to do was be known as a church, you know? That was the last word we wanted to associate with our Buddhism, Buddhism not a church, you know? And so there's a whole different flavor, that generation of mostly white Buddhists were involved in bringing Buddhism back to this country here. And Buddhism, Dharma is like water. And sometimes people bring the containers with them. So, for example, some groups, Asian groups, so to Asian teachers, have brought the whole Asian, their particular Asian cultural tradition with them here to this country. And so you go into that temple, you feel like you're in Japan. You feel like you're in Burma or something. You eat this Burmese food or Japanese food or all these things. And other groups of teachers have decided to try to get rid of as many of the containers as they can and bring just the water. And our tradition, the insight meditation tradition, was more that style, where the teachers intentionally, Jack Hornfield, Joseph Goldstein, pared away, stripped away as much of the containers as they could to get down to the simplicity of the water. And the purpose of doing that was to make the water as accessible to as many people as possible. They weren't even sure they wanted to have a Buddha figure, because even a Buddha figure is part of the container part, it's not part of the water. And people would be turned off by seeing a Buddha. And so they wanted to make the practice as accessible to as wide range of people as possible. But then what's happened in the 30 years that this insight meditation tradition has been here in this country, it has slowly grown. And we have now a center here, other places are getting centers, and we're kind of like beginning to kind of put different elements into it. We're putting containers into it around the water. And sometimes we don't even know we're doing containers. We come in and we think, oh, Buddhism has always been this way, hasn't it? We think, oh, this is pure Buddhism and it's pristine purity. You know, the fact that there are Sunday potlucks, or whatever. And, or particular ways of teaching, particular emphasis, particular things that are talked about. Some teachers will talk a lot about rebirth, some will never talk about it. Some teachers will talk a lot about supernatural realms, and some teachers will never talk about it. Some teachers talk mostly about, you know, more psychological or psychological strata, how they talk about the Dharma. Other teachers will never talk, Ajahn Samedho, who's a Californian, Thai forest tradition monk, teaching in England. It's all mixed up. He said once, he teaches in Thailand, which he's a highly revered teacher in Thailand. It's very different when he teaches in the West. In the West, he feels like he has to teach in a much more psychological note. And he would never do that in Thailand. People would scratch their heads and wonder, what's he talking about? So, you know, what we talk about is very much tailored to what interests us, what our needs are, what particular people are, all kinds of things. But each individual person is different. And it's a personal interface between yourself and the Dharma, which is really where the juice is, where the real emphasis of practice, where the transformation can happen. And sometimes we lose sight of that because perhaps the Dharma Center or the teachings or other place has a particular flavor that isn't particular, is our flavor. And so he says, well, where do I fit in here? Or what's going on with me? What do I want? What's right for me? And then, but if you make it too much like yourself, if it becomes just like yourself, then what's the point? You know, then you're not going to be helped. But, you know, where's the interface? Where's that balance? Where's attention? What's going on there? How do we respect that meeting place? Cho Giyam Trungpa, who was a famous teacher, Tibetan teacher who came to this country, after living in America for a while, he decided that what was needed here was all his disciples, or some of them at least, in order to really be proper Buddhists, to show respect for Buddhism, respect for the practice. They had to wear suits and ties, at least the men did. That's the way they had to wear the equivalent. And suddenly you had all these hippies, you know, ex-hippies, you know, cutting their hair and putting on, you know, these nice suits and walking around, you know. And that was their way of doing it. There was one person who came to Vipassana retreat and said, oh, this Vipassana is great. When it comes to my community, we've got to sing. You know, imagine going to Spirit Rock and singing. But they do. James Bures plays the guitar sometimes. And so now I've set the stage. Now I've set the, I hope, been provocative and brought something up. Because this Dharma talk today requires something from hopefully each of you, but though each of you doesn't have to be on the spot, there's a way out. That's short of walking out the door. And that is, what I'd like to ask of you all is to form little groups of five or six people. I think it's best if we can do five so we can kind of keep, so everybody has a chance to speak. If you don't want to speak, it's okay. Partly what I want from this is a chance for you to listen to other people and learn from other people what their reflection is on this topic. But it'd be great if you speak too, because no one spoke then. And we don't feel like you have to. And what I'd like you to reflect on is, and you might not know much about Buddhism. This might be your first night here. Maybe you don't want to talk then, you just kind of listen to what people have to say. Or maybe you know a little bit, or you can imagine. It's really fine to say whatever you'd like to say. And what I'd like you to talk about, or think, reflect on, is given who you are as a unique individual with your own background, cultural, ethnic, everything, what are the expressions of Dharma practice that would be most meaningful for you? What would speak to you? What would be the forms that are helpful for you? And why is it helpful? What is it speaking to for your background? Some people, ritual is really important. Ritual can be very profound. It goes very deeply into a person's psyche. It's very transformative. And it's the ritual coming together with the community that's created by having ritual and repetition of it, and having ritual go deep, and the rhythm of it that's very powerful and significant. And this is what Ajahn Sundra is going to offer here in a traditional way, a little bit. For some people, it's all kinds of things. Some people, it's silence. That's what they value the most. You get the point, I'm just trying to say? And the spirit of this is the word respect. To see more deeply, see oneself. So I hope to play your game. And what we'll do is, and I have to ask each of the groups, each of the groups of five or so, that as you talk, try to talk a little bit quietly. Be sure you can hear each other, but be aware there's a lot of different groups talking at once here. So we don't sound like a cocktail party. And find out, be very careful as a group, as individuals, that everybody in your group gets a chance to speak. And what I'd like to ask each group to do is to talk for about 15 minutes. And then in 15 minutes, I'm going to ring a bell. And then we'll regather and we'll have a little bit further discussion based on those. Any questions? So please keep behind the time so everybody has a chance to speak who wants to speak. And if it feels like the energy is kind of feeling complete, I'll ring the bell a little bit earlier. But probably 15 minutes is a good amount of time to talk. Okay. Thank you. One of the cultural containers of Buddhism is that when the bell rings, you stop talking. So that was lovely to sit and just be kind of witness at the discussions. I thought that we would take about a minute or so to close your eyes if you'd like and sit and be quiet. So what was it like for some of you to listen to your companions in your circle about what they had to say about the interface between themselves and the Dharma and the kind of expressions that are meaningful for them? What came up in your discussion? Someone like to share a little bit? The Dharma are an incredible perspective because there was someone who had been coming only three months and sitting for three months and there was maybe it was maybe as long as I could remember. And there was a Catholic nun and someone from the unity church. It just sounded like it would be amazing. So whatever container we have, it had better be great. Ellen? I was actually struck by the diversity and commonality in our experiences. It seemed like a member of us came from a religious background. So the ritual aspect of this was very beautiful. But because as you were talking about, this very block of lineage just distilled things to make it very accessible. It seemed to me that flexibility and the clarity of the teachings was a very appealing to a lot of us. But we really could apply without just feeling like we were doing something that was just odd. So that was really kind of nice. And then a lot of us talked about chanting and how, I think we were working with it, but it was something that we were becoming, especially with the refuge class of two or three people, talking about how that, it seemed like it was a next step perhaps. Because it was a way to relate to the teachings that weren't so verbal, you know, much more energetic in nature. And for myself as well, I do chant and put in to the people of the group. And I've also found that it's sort of a nice compliment to the psychological aspects of the teachings. Great. Thank you. It was interesting that the, I wasn't going to say tension, but there wasn't really any tension, but the interplay between ritual and form and openness and microphone. A lot of people in our group have experienced with Zen and chanting in the forms of much more strict, much more formal. And there was a lot of pull in that direction, and we should not pull here because we're all here obviously. But it's interesting, the pull is there, you know, for the other, more formal, ritualistic. I heard Jack Kornfield once say that, oh no, we do have a form in this Vipassana circles. The form is simplicity and no form. And it's much more difficult this way. Yes. The thing that struck me about our group first was just the sincerity that people bring to practice. This isn't a place that people come just to kind of network in social, they're going to be there sincerity in practice. And also a desire both to challenge, be challenged. This isn't something that comes through, because it's kind of an easy, convenient, comfortable, spiritual path. Great. Smita. A lot of people in my group here, that's something that I noticed when I mentioned, I'm going to go ahead and mention it, even though it was just me who mentioned it in the group, is that what I love about this group, and maybe it's true, the best decoration in general, is the sense of humor. Is if you record our meetings, is how many times people split up and just laugh, it might seem like a different sort of a meeting. And Ajahn Junyan, who came here three weeks ago, and I had the fortune to be here that day, and he's even further way farther away, on the Uberscale. And it seems right in some very, very true sense, the sense, very true sense, that the more we advance on the path, the more light and easy it all becomes. And it becomes so fun, and it's important to keep it fun and easy and not dogmatic, and not just as why I say so. And I know that Jacque Comteau once said that if you seek a group in which there is no laughter, get out of it as soon as possible. That's exactly why I like to stay here. It's for that sense of humor. Was anybody surprised by what they said themselves? And it makes us think, does anybody? Or was it kind of an old hat for you, that reflected this before? I was surprised that I do get something out of chanting, because one of the things that attracted me to here in the first place was lack of ritual. And I find that in some circumstances it's very steadying, very supportive. Speaking of forms, forming up into groups of five or six is itself a form, and I found it surprisingly pleasant to listen to other people, their impressions and ideas. Thank you. Great. I was surprised that I do a sanctuary prayer meditation in a Catholic church, and I think the Buddhist meditation is so similar. The church is so close, but it is surprising, because there's a lot of similarities. Yes, definitely. Thank you. I was excited, and I heard you mention a few things that you've been talking about. And a couple of people in our room talked about how the supplement came in here, which was about the kind of holding space and have that support and silence in present. But that would go other places to get the sign of the touring, the auditory, and the sonic dance and the chanting of the Spirit. You don't have to go in the alley and do it. Yes. I, the inner inner vibrator, sort of said the reason I came here was for the discipline, and that was my original reason for coming here. And listening to everyone talk, I am somewhat shy, and I have hardly talked to anybody here except people that I have seen. Oh, I know you from someplace else. And it's really interesting. I think you heard everybody talk, hear their voices, hear how they think about these. Well, thank you. That was lovely. And I hope it was meaningful for all of you. I think it's very important for us periodically to have this kind of way of connecting and talking at this level. It's sometimes rare. Many people don't have that chance in their life to have kind of conversation, these kind of topics with other people. So I hope it was nice and useful. I hope that all of you realize that Buddhism in the West is probably everywhere, but certainly here, and obviously here, so in the West, that it's very much being created as we do it, as we live it. And that each of you in your involvement is helping to create it. And what you bring is what's unique to yourself, and your background, and needs, and interests, and your suffering. And hopefully that you'll find in Buddhism a place where you feel comfortable and feel met for who you are, but not too comfortable. So if it's just a source of comfort, then it's not going to have its transformative value. So thank you very much, and I'll be back in a few weeks.
