 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good evening those of you here in the west coast and hello to everyone else, wherever you are. And happy to be here, have a chance to be here Monday evening. And, you know, for a good part of the last 30 years I've come down to teach these Monday evening talks. And so they're quite close to my heart to be here. And so I appreciate this opportunity. And for the meditation this evening, I would like to suggest an idea that you're welcome to ignore, if it doesn't work for you, but the idea is that you would sit, practice mindfulness during this next 30 minutes or so, to do it with courage, at any indication that there's fear, sit with courage. And you might be surprised by the layers of fear that we go through as the mind relaxes. It's like going through the layers of the mind, layers of the heart. And not uncommonly there's places of fear, certain layers or certain corners. And to not see it as a mistake, to not see it as indication that something's wrong with you or wrong with anything, but rather see it as something for this period of time, something to sit with, but to sit with courage. The courage that maybe also allows you to do it with the heart, and French, the word courage comes from heart. The kind of courage that keeps your heart open, keeps you present and aware and willing to experience what's here for you. So this is not the courage of bracing yourself or stealing yourself through something, but rather the courage to be present for whatever is, but to be present kindly, but with a kindness that's strong, to sit with courage. So to begin by assuming a meditation posture that has some qualities, characteristics of courage, that evoke some courage for you. If you're sitting, maybe sitting a little bit more upright than confident, adjusting your neck so that your neck also somehow has space at the back of the neck for there to be a kind of strength and courage. Maybe the chest is a little bit expanded, not proudly, not effortless, effortfully, but just as you sit up straight to allow the chest to expand in a confident way, in a way that perhaps brings your heart to the forefront. The sensitivity, emotional sensitivity that is there in your heart is awakened. And then gently close your eyes and taking some long, slow, deep breaths. But see if it's possible to do so with a sense of courage or strength. Perhaps even to use a dangerous concept, maybe even with some sense of power, the power of presence, the power of showing up and being present here and now. And as you exhale to relax without giving up the strength and the courage, but relaxing whatever tension is unnecessary, soften, relax. And letting your breathing return to normal. And if it's available, maybe you'll feel a gentleness in the breathing. Some parts of the breathing might feel, the cycle of breathing might feel gentle, soft, peaceful. And courage and strength can coexist with this tenderness, softness, gentleness of the breathing. Gently relaxing on the exhale. Relaxing the mind. Relaxing and quieting your thinking. So there's more room and awareness to show up and be present here in this body. With courage and strength. And with peacefulness and gentleness. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. Breathing in and breathing out. And as we come to the end of the sitting, can you tap into a place of quiet courage, strength? A courage not to assert yourself on the world, but a courage to show up fully, be present for yourself, all of who you are, and be present for others, for all of who they are. When there is some courage, perhaps it's easier also to have respect for oneself, and to have respect for others. May we, as we come out of this meditation, aspire to be present for others and for ourselves with a steady presence, with attentiveness and listening and curiosity. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Amen.
