 Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Maybe, rather than extracting something from the moment, we offer ourselves up to it. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Given to us. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Maybe, as Suzuki Roshi said, just to be alive is enough. Sense of acquisitiveness, of gaining something, getting somewhere, introduces a certain kind of fracture into our being. We do get somewhere, but that happens, unfolds a certain kind of grace as we relinquish the need to go anywhere. If I told you to stop being aware, you couldn't do it. Whatever you cannot stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. If you don't stop, rest there. Just put down the notion of my life. Just put down the notion of my life. Just put down the notion of my life. Just put down the notion of my life. We've been forever toiling in the ragged bone shop of our heart. We put it down. Just put down your life. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. The hindrances are every bit as innocent as everything else. Just they can't work out. And so we become disenchanted. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. We keep reiterating the self. It's like her body keeps its balance, its orientation, proprioception. There's a kind of proprioception of self. The reference points that we ping to. My life. Past, present, future. My preferences. My body. Out of all this referentiality, all these reference points. Sense of self emerges holographically. Like light converging. But there's nothing really there. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Whatever it doesn't depend on you, rest there. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Between everything means everything and nothing means anything. We find ourselves. Rest. Rest. Rest. None of this is possible or bearable without tremendous love. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. Rest. It's good to get to practice with you. It's good to be with you. Sometimes, sometimes not. In our formal practice, we're not trying to arrive at the kind of final description of the world or something. We're exploring with ways of perceiving and specifically ways of perceiving that bring freedom. And so we don't need to pick up practices, some algorithm or some can't just march to the beat of one drummer, one instruction. We find our way, develop fluidity. What's skillful now? What opens some sense of space now? It'll be different throughout the day. We can't kind of invoke the same little Dharma pep talk in each moment. It actually needs to be tailored. Tailored for your heart in that moment. There's this through line of sincerity. Good.
