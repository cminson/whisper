So finding a posture that feels comfortable, alert, and we'll begin with relaxing. 
Relaxing the body, at the beginning of a period of practice or start of a day long, it can be helpful to take some time with this relaxation. 
And periodically, throughout a practice period, if you find there is some tension, a kind of over-arching field of tension, it can be useful to come back to this just relaxing as a place to set the conditions for the more more ease-ful, receptive mindfulness. 
So we'll relax the body, we'll do this with the scanning through the body, relaxing the head and face, around the eyes, the jaw, softening the muscles of the neck and shoulder, shoulders, across the collarbone, around the shoulder blades, relaxing the arms and hands, the chest and upper back. 
All those muscles around the rib cage and sometimes a deeper breath can support that relaxation of those muscles, taking a deeper breath and noticing how those muscles stretch on the in-breath and then can relax, soften on the out-breath. 
Another deeper breath and letting the breathing return to normal, softening the muscles across the stomach and abdomen, maybe even letting that area hang forward a little bit, sometimes we're kind of subconsciously holding it in. 
And it's not actually necessary to hold this upright, we can relax that area. 
Relaxing the middle and lower back, the hips, the pelvis, relaxing the legs, the feet. 
And then sometimes it's also possible it's available to not only relax kind of the musculature of the body, but the visceral area, the interior of the body. 
So maybe just as I name each area, you'll notice there can be a softening. 
Maybe not, this is not always available, but maybe the inside of the throat can relax. 
Maybe the heart and the area around the heart can relax. 
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. 
And then having consciously scanned through and relaxed the body as much as is available consciously, sometimes our system knows how to relax a little bit more if we just ask it to. 
So sometimes just dropping in a phrase into the mind, not trying to do it, but just kind of requesting, you know, may the body relax, drop that into the mind and see if there's an effect, a subtle release or relaxation of something that you might not have even known was tense or tight. 
May the body relax. 
Just relaxing the doing side and just kind of asking, may the body relax. 
And then maybe to the mind can relax. 
One way we might have some conscious access to this is through an analogy or an image that Gil often or offers sometimes. 
Just imagining as if your brain were a muscle, maybe the brain can relax. 
Maybe this points a little bit to what relaxation of mind means. 
May the body relax. 
And as the body and mind relax, just checking in, are you aware? This awareness here, not trying to really figure it out, but just acknowledging, if you're hearing me ask this question, ask it yourself, am I aware? Yes, you're aware. 
And what is obvious? What is most obvious in your experience? Maybe a body sensation, pressure, contact points of hands or hips, feet. 
Maybe a broader sense of the body sitting. 
Maybe some sensations in the body like coolness or heat or vibration, pulsing. 
Maybe sound, settling back and letting go of being in charge and receiving. 
Let experience come to you. 
Relax. 
What's obvious? Might be moods or emotions are obvious. 
And then sound again. 
Might be a sense of letting experience come to you. 
Or it could be a sense of following the attention. 
Now for this moment, vibration and then sound. 
Again, contact, breathing, pulsing, hearing. 
Maybe tension or ease, maybe some mood. 
Relax, receive. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? Gently reminding yourself to be aware. 
And the mind will wander, will get lost in thought, and it will return. 
In that moment that mindfulness has returned, recognizing the awareness is back. 
Aware again. 
Is there tension or relaxation? Maybe relax again. 
Take a few moments to relax. 
Maybe drop in one of those requests. 
May the body relax. 
See what happens. 
And then what's obvious? Again, just connecting to what is being received, what is already here in this moment. 
What is already known. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? The mind feels thrashing in that moment. 
You could notice a kind of spinning happening, but you can also just pick something easy to connect with in this moment. 
Contact of the hips, sensations of hands. 
Let yourself kind of remember, this is what it's like to be aware and know what I'm aware of. 
And then as the attention shifts to something else, recognizing, following the attention or recognizing something new is arising and being received. 
Relax. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? We are just cultivating an awareness that receives our life, receives this experience of being in a body with senses, feeling, hearing, sensing, recognizing emotions, thoughts. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? Every now and then it can be useful to check in, how am I with this experience? What's the relationship? What's the attitude? Or sometimes it can be just an even simpler question. 
What else is happening right now? To help the mind recognize something that might be hidden, particularly in how we are attending to experience. 
So what's the attitude? Do you want something to happen, to keep happening, to stop happening? Is there confusion or a belief that's affecting how you're paying attention? Disconnection? Or maybe okayness? No problem. 
It's okay to be knowing this sound, this body sensation. 
No particular agenda, just here and aware. 
Okay.

Are you aware? What is obvious? Okay.
