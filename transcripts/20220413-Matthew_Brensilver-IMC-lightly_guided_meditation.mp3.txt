 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome. Welcome to you all. That's very sweet to see the YouTube Sangha in the chat. Okay. You know how this goes. Please settle in. So sometimes we practice just stopping all at once. Sometimes we ease our way in and sometimes we stop all at once. We just open to everything now. Thank you. And of course, there's this kind of gravitational pull to nursing this wound or planning that pleasure, mapping out these contingencies. So there's a certain kind of courage, maybe even faith, just in stopping. Meditation requires that we tolerate all the loose ends of the human condition. We don't need to tie them up. We just stop. And we treat all phenomena like a gust of wind blowing through awareness. We're neither braced against that gust, nor are we trying to bottle it up. And hold on to it. And it's often skillful to have a line of definition around what is in the focus space and what is out of it. So maybe we draw a line around the sensations of the breathing, the nostrils, the belly. Or maybe the line includes all of the soundscape, all excluding everything else. Maybe the line includes all of the body sensations, and leaves the rest of the world behind. Or maybe the anchor is everything. The five sense gates, the mind. But just know what's inside the circle and what's outside it. Rest with a kind of balanced energy. Either bracing against nor holding onto the wind. When we relinquish the agenda to direct our life, or when we just sit here, all phenomena become a kind of gateway to wisdom and love. It is not the case that only the preferred gusts of wind are the gateway. Everything is a door. We just keep walking through. We just keep walking through. We just keep walking through. We just keep walking through. We just keep walking through. We just keep walking through. We just keep walking through. We just keep walking through. We just keep walking through. When we actually open to our life, in this way, when we put down some of the impulse to engineer it, just open, a kind of love for ourselves becomes almost self-evident. This love is not based on our characteristics, the pros and cons of me, but is an appreciation of the condition of being sentient, of feeling pleasure and pain, of longing to be safe, longing for peace amidst the intensity of samsara. And that kind of love dawns on us. It's a love that can't really be contested by our self-harshness and judgment. Let me rest in that. This takes us more deeply into the present. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
