 interests me to talk about today which maybe is not the same thing interests some of you I've heard rumors is is the factor of investigation which is an important element of mindfulness practice and this morning at breakfast I my wife asked me what I was going to speak about today and I said investigation she said oh it's good thing you're giving the talk at the end of the day because because the subject of investigation it lends itself to becoming excessively thoughtful about the experience kind of thinking about it and exploring it and it's more this investigation is an active side of mindfulness practice and and and a lot of people that's the part of that's a side of practice they have the most trouble with anyway they're overly active and the more the more quiet receptive side or the calming side tranquilizing side of practice is a side which for many people is the side that needs to be encouraged or strengthened or discovered but in any case it's what I want to talk about I hope it works interesting for you the factor of investigation is one of the seven factors belonging to a list in Buddhism called the seven factors of awakening seven factors of enlightenment but I like the word awakening because I suspect many of us when we use the word especially we use it as synonymous with enlightenment we take it to be a noun awakening is being a thing but awakening can also be seen as an activity as a verb and that and I think that's more the spirit of Buddhist idea of awakening it's not a done deal it's not like this final one particular kind of experience you can aim for then get and then hang on to or refer back to all the time if this is I had I had this at one point and this is really great but it's an ongoing activity an ongoing action of awakening of awakening oneself of being awakened ning awakened constantly one of the terms in Buddhism there's different kinds of awakening in Buddhism but one of the kinds is called non abiding awakening awakening which doesn't abide anywhere which doesn't rest anywhere doesn't get established anywhere doesn't say oh this is it now now I got it or doesn't incline itself towards a particular place as being this is the place that this is what awakening is like any any description of awakening any thing that can be experienced that might be a kind of like an awakening becomes a fixed thing if we abide in it and the point of freedom is not to abide anywhere but have the freedom to move freely to new experiences to new appropriate responses to activities and from this point of view I think of mindfulness practice I think of Buddhist practice awakening practice as being a practice that discovers flexibility and that flexibility is a very important quality to have a mind a heart a body a way of responding and living in the world that is flexible to all the changing conditions and pre-mutations and if we if you look at the point of Buddhist practice or point of mindfulness practice to be to be flexibility I think we end up with a lot safer spiritual practice than if we say that the point of the practice is to is X or the point is B or the point is to have certain kind of state or some kind of experience or certain kind of wisdom understanding as soon as it's reified soon as it becomes a thing it becomes fragile actually the only thing which is not fragile is flexibility the only thing which is not rigid is flexibility so the point is in sense to stay flexible and and that means in all different ways and but a lot has to do with understanding appropriateness appropriate responses in given situations if we come with preconceived ideas about what our response should be then we don't have flexibility to be adapt adaptable to appropriate situation and you see that a lot in mindfulness practice where people have some fixed idea of what it is and I'm a classic case of this when I came back you know I did eight month long retreat in Burma and when you do a long be posturing retreats the tendency is to do things really slowly and so you don't you simply pick up you know a striker you know you're aware of the desire of the intention to pick up the striker and then you're aware of the signal kind of to let your hand go out and reach for it and you're aware of actually the fingers uncurling and the arm going forward the tightening that happens and the loosening happens and then the contact and maybe the temperature of the striker and the intention desire to kind of actually put your hands around it and then the intention to kind of lift it and pulling and the tightening that happens and it takes a long time now and you might wonder what's the point of this you know it's kind of like but in any case you do things very very slowly to do things very mindfully and it's actually quite a wonderful practice because it develops and familiarity intimacy acute concentration that is very hard to develop any other way so I did that for eight months which is you know so when I came back to America I thought that was the way you supposed to be mindful you know you have to do everything kind of intending to reach for the doorknob touching the doorknob twisting the doorknob opening the doorknob you know and the people behind me waiting to get to the door you know and so it took me a little few weeks of after coming back to America to realize that mindfulness in the context of our normal normal life you know here in the West it wasn't like being on retreat all the time and I had to kind of relax and because I wasn't actually so relaxed anymore I was relaxed on the retreat in Burma relaxed enough doing all this stuff but trying to maintain this way of being mindful on daily life was not what was called for it was not the way to be mindful and here mindfulness was more of a generic kind of general wider sense of being present for the wider kind of activity and not that minute details of what was going on so it was an example of the me not being so flexible or knowing how to be flexible with seeing the discovering what was appropriate what was my appropriate response was given the condition the situation I was in so to be flexible do we have a flexibility to move back and forth to sometimes I'd be very precisely detailed with mindful and sometimes be very spacious in general do we have the the appropriateness to know when to investigate the situation carefully versus when to kind of surrender to the situation and surrender to the activity and kind of almost in a sense maybe even lose a kind of reflective ability to certain situations you know you've got the basketball court play basketball and if you're too reflective you're kind of like intending to throw if you're too reflective you know what you're doing it's not really the place and time to do that and there's a way of just kind of you did play basketball well you have to know the kind of basic idea of the game and and have a little bit of skill and then abandon yourself to it and that's what's appropriate in that situation so knowing what's appropriate in different situations is part of them being flexible enough to flow back and forth there's a lot of what we're learning I think in Buddhism is the flexibility not a particular state of being so in Buddhism this is called a non abiding awakening awakening which doesn't abide doesn't settle anywhere and now I got it if you soon as you say now I got it that moment you've lost it so it's very tricky the there is a thing and thing in now in in biology where maybe it's changed now but it used to be that when they were going to dissect a cell as soon as you cut into the cell the cell would die so you can never be you can never actually go into a cell with a microscope whatever and see what a living cell was like because as soon as you cut it you'd kill it and and it's something like that but sometimes with our own life as soon as you say now I got it you've lost it and so there's there's some kind of reflectivity which actually gets in the way even though mindfulness is a kind of reflectivity I call it what gets in the way is retroactive reflectivity there is a place in life for that also let's be flexible and allow that also but retroactive reflectivity we're thinking back in time what what just happened you know that moment we're settled on one thing and the non-abiding awakening which is really the continuing allowing yourself to continue flow with the changes of the present moment so I was wondering why I even wrote notes for a talk see if I used my notes then I'd be stuck right and rather flowing non-abiding Dharma talk some of you might be wishing that I stayed with my notes closer so so so awakening these seven factors of awakening this verb the verb the activity of awakening there are seven factors to this and and these types of factors are mindfulness is the the most important one and then in either side of mindfulness the next six are divided into two categories and you don't have to memorize memorize all six but you should know the two general categories and on one side there's those which are called the calming or tranquilizing factors and the other side of those factors which are called energizing factors and you need to have a balance of both and these have to be balanced now it now in the calming category there are such things as equanimity as concentration and calm itself on the and the energizing or engaging factors there are investigation rapture and energy or effort or engagement itself so as a person practices one of the things that we can become aware of and we will at some point maybe not you know now but as much as practice matures it becomes natural sooner or later to be naturally become aware not you're looking for it because you think you know awakenings where's that so you better find the factors of awakening and but rather naturally kind of arises is these seven factors and they start having an important role in a person's meditation experience most most of the time we're dealing with hindrances the five hindrances but as the five hindrances abate and become not such an important part of our daily experience or normal experience then the seven factors of awakening become increasingly important and you will start seeing how these play joy has a role and it's you can't really become awakened without there being some joy there awakening and joy are not synonymous necessarily but and you can't really have concentration or calm without some sense well you can't really have concentration without some sense of calm or some sense of ease you can get concentrated anxiously but it's not really the kind of concentration we're looking for so all these factors begin to coming into play and one of them that's very important in is investigation and the investigation is particularly useful if you find yourself being lethargic or complacent or dull in your mindfulness practice one way to get a little bit more enlivening in your practice is to investigate more thoroughly because investigation is one of the energizing factors of practice however what we don't want to do is be is tinker a lot and maybe that's why my wife said you should give us talk you know it's good to giving this talk at the end of the day the practice practices it's so easy for many of us to be tinkering with our practice and try to manipulate our practice our experience and try to make it different than what it is so when I was when I was sitting in Burma my teacher Upandita he never tinkered with anything he was very he was a purist as far as mindfulness was and all mindfulness practice was was recognizing what was happening in the moment and in the next moment in the next moment and that's what it was like and you stood you you just recognize you didn't try to adjust anything or fix anything or use antidotes you know if you're angry you didn't try to use loving kindness to feel better you just simply stayed mindful of what's happening in the present moment kind of uncompromisingly this is what you were doing and that was great and I did I kind of thrived under his guidance there but then I went to practice at Barry with some of the famous teachers there at IMS and I noticed that when they went to interviews with them they step they kept wanting to give me little pieces of advice why don't you try this why don't you try this do this Upandita would never tell they would tell me anything to do he just listen and you know occasionally he would ask me to kind of report a little bit more accurately what happened so you weren't accurate enough reporting what went on or you know or sometimes he would say good yeah that's you're doing well you know or carry mostly he never said that maybe never when he was pleased with you he'd say he would say carry on then you knew you're on the right track and so but the teachers at Barry they you know I'd report what was happening with me and they'd say okay now try doing this little thing here try this little thing and after a few interviews of this kind of you know interference my practice I told them you look at any minute stop tinkering with me and I'm just here to pay attention to be mindful and you're kind of telling me to do this and that so they backed off until at some point during the retreat these seven factors of awakening became very strong for me and they became the main thing that I was kind of paying attention to and and you can feel sometimes how something you know the balance between them you can feel you know that kind of maybe the image is like you know your stereo set you have these seven where are they called the balancers or any kind of equalizers and you can kind of you can have snob you can kind of play with it again different sounds and you know and you can get him really you know and my stereo sets you can hit different buttons and there's a the jazz version and there's the rock version is a classical kind of option and it kind of changes the way those little lights you know that I don't know what it does to sound but it changes well so it's like that you have seven of these and you can feel how they're you know equal so you I'm starting to equalize them so they're all of them are equal you know equal strength and so I started you know playing with them you know and I need a little more energy here more investigation and I do more calm now or you know whatever and I was kind of like just trying to get them just right and I would go and report and tell my teachers and after a few interviews of this they would they told me gail stop tinkering so so it's very important you know not to tinker too much so the the instructions and investigation is not so much to tinker or not so much to try to change your experience or adjust your meditation be more successful at it but really an invitation to or an effort to try to understand a little bit better what's actually happening in the present moment so the basic idea as I said this morning with mindfulness is it's to allow our experience to be as it is to allow our experience to be as it is while we're being consciously aware consciously attentive consciously conscious of what that experience is so the allowing part is this is this great spacious field great spaciousness of letting things be as they are and again it's allowing things to be as they are it belongs to this this part of practice of flexibility is part of the side of not abiding in any place but allowing things to you know change and move as they wish so it means also in a sense being a little bit at ease some modicum some sense of ease with what's happening even when you feel anxious and upset and terrible and traumatized or you know that happens when we sit sometimes we are whole life comes to us when we sit but to have some ease about even being anxious by you being afraid or even being whatever it might be and then with that sense of ease then there can be sometimes investigation of our experience but if we don't have some modicum of ease some modicum of allowance then the investigation can just feed into our attempts to try to control and manipulate or tinker or change or resist whatever is going on so to investigate one one one of the definitions or descriptions of investigation is a radiance of mind and that doesn't seem like a very useful maybe that's nice for poetry you might say but I like it because it's kind of like you turn on a light in a dark room and then you look around see what's there it's not like you're looking for something or probing or digging when you investigate it's more like well what's going on here you kind of look around and this is particularly important when you find yourself in your meditation practice becoming calm and some people identify calm with being they got it or this is it or this is the you know I finally deserve it or this is really great now just I'll hold everything in place please no one sneeze or you know or the you know the teachers are sitting up there please don't say anything in the middle of the sitting because that would really you know I'm calm now and don't disturb me and then he says okay follow your breath back to your breath oh that guy how could he you know who's disturbing you then who's disturbing you so so when you do find yourself calm or one of the ways to use that in a sense in meditation practice is not to rest there not to abide there but rather to use that calm place to start to look at look around the room what is to calm like what is going on here while I'm calm being careful that the investigation doesn't agitate you that you know you're not thinking about it or figuring things out but rather just simply calmly kind of looking around what's going on here to get to know that space better to get to know something about it better so you're calm and what what is it breath like when you're calm and get to know that really well kind of look at that more carefully or whatever the experience might be um I think I should look at my notes let's see if I have anything oh so investigation is kind of like asking the question what's going on now and repeatedly kind of with with a sense or the inner sense or the inner question what's going on now without expecting an answer I think that's the spirit of it something might appear and you might realize oh this is what's going on but you have this alertness of the mind this curiosity of mind what is happening here right now not even not even expecting an answer to that so this alertness of mind what's going on here and I believe that when we get more deeply sensitively touch with ourselves that that inquiry inquiring into what's going on has more integrity to it more integrity in terms of our inner life then a state of calm or state of peace any particular state of being because inquiry is not a state so for example if you're sitting here and you are calm and someone sneezes or the door opens and you get kind of you get kind of rattled for a moment say oh you know how could someone walk in you know the middle of a sitting or how could someone sneeze you know or now you feel kind of you know whatever and you're kind of agitated and so you try to come back I've been distracted I'm going to try to get back to this calm state I had I don't think that's a movement of flexibility I don't think that's a movement of freedom of awakening I think a movement of awakening would be simply to allow that to happen this is what's happening next to have a flexibility not to hold on to any one thing even your own calm but to recognize oh the door opened I'm now a little bit more agitated and then to be mindful of that from the point of view an investigation when that's appropriate is to investigate what is actually going on here now that the door opened what's going on within me am I afraid am I anxious am I angry because I've lost my state of calm do I have an expectation that comms where it's at you kind of look around what is this state like and my suggestion to you is that it has more integrity for inner life to do that investigation than it is to hurry back to some state of calm that actually to hurry back to some state that seems ideal to you I actually I don't think it doesn't really represent our our innermost integrity our inner innermost wholeness our innermost movement to freedom because freedom is non-abiding and I think investigation belongs to this area of not this this aspect of non-abiding one of the definitions or one of the descriptions of investigation as a factor of awakening is to investigate and to understand what is and what is not the path this is the technical description what is and what isn't the path the path to freedom that path to awakening as a verb to have some sense of what activity interactivity moves us towards flexibility to freedom and what interactivity moves us towards being increasingly preoccupied or in bondage or stuck or attached or fixated in the simplest description that's the division that's the fork in the road between knowing what is the path and what is not that fixation or attachment doesn't bring us is not the path the path is the movement towards the ability to be flexible the movement towards not holding on not being attached to anything so investigation well part of what investigation is is to begin seeing moment to moment that divide that division that choice that arises each moment between abiding someplace fixating on something perhaps and being free and one place that's very fascinating to investigate this is with a mind that wonders away now if we just if if the mind wonders away in distraction or in preoccupation and it takes you five minutes or ten minutes to realize that you've been distracted the last ten minutes then the practice is simply to recognize where you're at when you wake up and then maybe come back to the breath but sometimes when you're somewhat settled and calm in your practice you can pay careful attention to just what it's like just as you begin to wonder away in some kind of distraction because there's a qualitative difference inside of us between when we're not wandering away and when we are because when we're wondering away a part of us maybe it's a very small part of us has gotten hooked onto something has gotten preoccupied or fixated on something and when it's gotten hooked on something or fixated on something then that part of you is not free it's not flexible and if the path is to stay flexible this path is to stay open and not be attached to anything you can walk you can see that happening right there in the moment when you're in the present moment and when you start leaving it when you start leaving into some preoccupation and if you can catch it right there and stay flexible stay in the present moment not allow yourself to wander down a trail of preoccupation of being attached to some concern you start finding yourself the mind becoming much more flexible and free and open so this has happened to me I mean no one wanted to talk to me during the last walking period very few so so I was sitting here and nothing to do and so I thought well everybody's walking so I guess I'll go out and walk so I was doing walking meditation out there and and you know giving a Dharma talk giving a talk you know isn't something which I'm completely non-abiding about so I was out there thinking about this talk you know and and I kept noticing my mind kept going into this into the into one thinking about this talk and and and I could feel a certain kind of tightness a certain kind of little bit it wasn't so dramatic maybe a little bit of anxiety about the talk but I was doing the walking practice trying to be as attentive as I can in the present moment noticing when it was my mind would go off into these you know thinking about the talk and when I did that I would try to catch it when it first arrived and just being aware of it there and then I come back and then what happened again not come back and after a while doing the walking out there I started feeling this kind of flexibility arose within me that the mind stopped wanting to want away so much and the mind started feeling more spacious and more calm more open because I wasn't giving in I wasn't allowing myself to I don't know if this is the right way of talking about it but I wasn't I was attentive enough to catch myself to notice when I was caught by a preoccupation so it wasn't that I was trying to stop my fellow self from being preoccupied it wasn't like I was I was aversive to it however I was trying to notice the moment or as early as I could when it was that I was caught by something and because I was relatively settled the noticing itself freed me up and it was easy then to come back or it wasn't so strong my preoccupation just simply coming back was easy enough to do this making sense time to describe my inner life so investigation is not thinking or analyzing or contemplating anything is letting the light of awareness shine on our experience with an inquiring impulse inquiring sense there's a poem in that they recite at the San Francisco Zen Center several several mornings a week and the poem one line the poem says goes it and it is supposed to be in this poem is is dustness is ultimate reality as it is things as they are the participatory reality we always live in it responds to the inquiring impulse so reality responds to the inquiring impulse so the the movement to an inquiry to investigate is a movement not to be stuck it's a movement to allow ourselves to open up and that something happens the world responds to that inquiry and now how it responds I don't know maybe it's better not to say but but the world that we live is actually a participatory world and investigation is not a passive activity but actually it changes the whole participatory game that we're in the sense of the name of the temple name of the San Francisco Zen Center is beginner's mind temple and most of you know the famous book Zen mind beginner's mind it was a expression a Suzuki rush she liked beginner's mind and I think a part of the reason this is a kirashi like the name the word is that in a beginner's mind there's a lot of possibilities when you when someone who's an expert had said you know might some this doesn't you know don't don't push this analogy too far you'll find it doesn't always work but now as someone who kind of is an expert has these preconceived ideas perhaps and so doesn't see doesn't have doesn't see all the very varieties of ways that we could possibly respond to a situation like waiting until the silent goes by so I guess the beginner's mind is a mind which doesn't have preconceived ideas but has an infinite amount perhaps or many different options to respond doesn't have any fixed way of responding and in that sense mindfulness practice is a practice of trying to have a beginner's mind to have a mind which doesn't know what's supposed to be happening doesn't know what's doesn't have some fixed category that it's trying to put the practice in or a fixed direction is trying to get in but rather is open to all possibilities any possibility and this and the idea that I have is that it's the openness to possibility which is the point not the possibilities you feel that openness with and you might feel it different ways at different times but it's the openness to possibilities which is really the non-inviting nirvana of of the Buddha's and the last thing I'll say along this line and one of the reasons why I think investigation is important and why I think also it's a natural impulse of the mind that's free that's settled on itself is that my understanding is that is that life is an open system and that any kind of system any kind of belief system any kind of I fixed ideas we have about how things are any kind of fixed experience we have we think this is the this is it there's always something beyond that fixed system it's always something outside of that particular belief system that particular explanation or that particular analysis and as long as there's something outside of it there's a natural tendency I believe to be curious what's out there or to want to go beyond that or not be limited by this particular limitations that we have this particular belief system and so investigation is what carries us into this greater possibility of the unknown because what's outside any kind of belief system any kind of system of understanding is unknown and so mindfulness in a sense moves us carries us into an unknown and which isn't always so comfortable because we'd rather have a spiritual life that told us you know where it was where it's where it's at wouldn't be great if you knew where it was at then you can go tell your friends where it's at and then you know they would think you're really hot because you knew where was that but rather you're doing the spiritual practice it doesn't tell you where it's at at all you don't know where it's at and so you can't tell anyone you know where it's at and so the same poem that says it responds to the inquiring impulse I think it's the same poem it's another poem they chant and ends by saying practice like a fool like an idiot well gee that's not what I got involved with this stuff for I wanted to be someone special you know there's gonna be pasta that's kind of in fashion you know you can do the right thing it's fashionable these days feel like a fool like an idiot well gee but to but to so the inquire to look to look around what's going on here to know what is going on here not to settle in anything my proposed my suggestion for you to think about is that whenever you feel bummed out in any way whenever you feel like whenever because sometimes it's you know chemical factors playing out within us but many times when we feel angry about something or depressed about something whatever that what's happened is that we are abiding in something maybe some evaluation some kind of resistance some kind of judgment some kind of idea of what's what what's right and that to begin exploring the non-inviting nature of the mind is actually to begin finding that it's very difficult to stay angry or depressed or whatever because it's difficult then to hang on to that one particular evaluation which is really the core of it at the root of it now that is a big you know I don't know maybe I shouldn't have dropped that as a bombshell at the very end that's it you know that's something for you just to explore and investigate with the beginners mind if it's true for yourself it's really fascinating and really beautiful when mindfulness begins picking up speed by itself mindfulness is simply the act of noticing what's happening in the present moment allowing things to be as they are noticing what they're happening and as our ability to notice becomes quicker and more precise you know you know just noticing what's happening it's very hard quicker it becomes the more it's there moment by moment the harder it is to abide any place and the harder is to abide any place the freer the beginner mind becomes and the more paradoxically calmer and more equinanimous the mind becomes the mind which is noticing and has the energy to notice moment by moment actually becomes more at ease initially it might feel like it's kind of as you're learning how to do mindfulness it might seem like this noticing is kind of like effortful and you know trying and kind of exhausting to do but actually it as you learn to do it it becomes more and more useful thing to do because what isn't useful is to be preoccupied right initially being preoccupied might be more useful than making the effort to be mindful but as the mindfulness begin becomes stronger and built up speed you usually change or moves into a more useful way of being and so as the flexibility as the openness to possibility becomes stronger a tremendous amount of equanimity develops equanimity is not the point so what is the point so what do you think now it's your turn yes it could be it's possible I mean some sometimes it is you know people mind wonders away and you're wondering about this conversation you had earlier in the day what did that person really mean when they said that but you know underlying underlying perhaps in that kind of situation might be anxiety but what the person really meant and so it plays to the person stuck that kind of investigation it where we're abiding is in the anxiety so I don't know I'm not going to tell you and you know what's what but but my pen my pen is used to believe is that when it's preoccupied wondering away that there's usually some place where abiding and and so what becomes interesting in mindfulness well first of all mindfulness is we want to allow for that the most important thing in my first to allow for what you experience allow for whatever allow for yourself being distracted allow for yourself being wondering a lot to allow yourself to be as you are don't have a spiritual practice which says I can't be where I am right now you know I have to get more I have to be more free I have to be more enlightened I have to be more calm I have to be more mindful forget about that start with it with the allowing and then without that allowing then what we do is we add the mindfulness to that that makes sense and then we start discovering what's actually going on here and mindfulness is simply just recognizing what's going on investigation is to do that with a little bit more ump little bit more energy little more questioning you know looking a little bit probe not probing but looking more closely getting closer to what's going on so your knee hurts you know it's hurts that's being mindful investigation is to really go in there and find out what is pain in the knee really like and if you as many of you know if you look really carefully you find that the word pain is just as near a kind of rough label and you get in there and it's a it's a universe of different sensations there's you know sensations of heat and sparking and pulling and twisting and tightening and stabbing and searing and you know all kinds of things and so the investigation is going to find out what it's what it's what's actually going on there yeah yeah it's not that it's just looking more usually just just looking more you know look just kind of in the present moment to what's actually happening can I can I can I can I look more carefully what's happening can I take a closer look at this often in the body depends on what's appropriate but often in the body so if there's what was it with fear you said so if there's fear is not not reflectively think back you know why am I afraid or what's going on here but rather look more carefully what is the experience of fear life for you so you know you're afraid now you ask what is the experience of fear like for me oh I feel it as these kinds of sensations in my body oh sensation the body so now you're mindful of these sensations you can hang out with that now what are these sensations really like if I look really carefully at them well actually they're mostly on the surface of my chest not deep down and actually it isn't that just it isn't just to kind of a general sense of tightness all over but if you look carefully I find that actually it's a tight band across the center of my chest and if I look even more closely I find out where the strongest is that it's right in the center so okay so I'm gonna hang out there you know I it doesn't really make sense to me to look more closely at the tightness but I'm gonna hang out in that little spot for a while and see what happens and part of the investigation is to notice what happens as you stay attentive oh if I stay attentive and watch this I find out it actually as tightness gets stronger and more unpleasant isn't that interesting so you stay with that you you stay with that and then you find that it moves and the tightness moves down to kind of into your pit of your stomach that's interesting it's moved now now mostly I'm feeling this real tight ball in center of my stomach and then you know what's this about not you know what's under this and what's the cause of that but what's this really like oh it comes with a lot of feel as part of this is feeling of rage Wow I didn't know I had all this rage Wow it's rage you know and then you allow the rage to be there Wow and you don't have to do any investigation because there's lots of energy and and and then you kind of look carefully at you know so you're there and after a while it kind of settles or changes and you kind of look carefully in the what else is going on here so rather than rather than asking what's the cause of this what else is going on here you know I've looked at the rage for a while what else is going on here I've looked at this particular experience for a while what else is going on here and then you might see in the corners of it the cracks of it you might see something else you might see that in the corner of anger maybe you'll see find vulnerability and and so that's interesting so let me allow and explore the vulnerability investigate that little bit what is that like what do I feel that in the body what happens if I open to it and then you might find a tenderness and then you found and then the tenderness might open to feeling of calm and all you know it all started with fear and you weren't looking for something but you kind of all follow this you know kind of kind of investigating what actually is here what else is going on here is that helpful or well you in that situation you might you might avoid looking at it in the body and you might just not look in the body but hang out with it for a while as a as a as a non embodied parts of it and so she get to know it better just what is it like to be angry outside the body well you know you want if this is a common common phenomena for you that certain kind of emotion like fear comes up and it's relatively easy if you'd let go of it because you can look at it the body just be pay attention to it and for whatever reason it kind of wanders away quickly and it keeps reoccurring over and over again then maybe what you want to do is play with the stories and you might you might want to investigate the stories a little bit and and you know it might be something you know might be by by how it's called you know might by it's like analysis they call this hovering awareness of it hovering you might hover with the story a little bit maybe in the interface if you can between letting go of it and staying with it kind of oscillating but right there seeing if you can get a different perspective on it and see what you know investigate from different point of view and what else might be going on investigate tell you all the stories you want and then investigate the tone of this of the voice which is telling the story but if but if you know if you go if you go to use the ATM machine and there's some fellow you know with a semi-automatic rifle kind of hanging out nearby you know you might want to kind of consider a little bit before you know what's going on here and you know semi-automatic rifle I'm getting my ATM I want my money and what's going on is this really you know this right time to get my money and then you notice that actually you know the ATM machine is right next to a police station and this is just a police guy he's got kind of is loading his you know he just you know you know he's supposed to have you know that's his job is to have the semi-automatic rifle and you know he's not you know he's a safe guy he's a nice guy and he's you know talking to his boss after all and he's not you know it's probably safe to go use the ATM machine so I agree with you and part of what mindfulness is is to know when it's appropriate to do different things and however it's be fixated on something be attached and preoccupied is different than thinking carefully about what needs to be done and there are times when thinking is very important I like to go for a walk and go running and that's a time where I like to think a lot and I need to think about something in my life that's a great time to do that and when my cushion I don't try to do that kind of thinking however I know that when I'm preoccupied and stuck by something I might not even have the wherewithal to even know when I need to think about something appropriately so if I'm completely preoccupied by something I show up at the ATM machine I might not even notice my environment around me so am I responding to your concern so I think your concern if I can summarize it perhaps arises out of the out of the idea or that mindfulness the way we talk about mindfulness is to have a kind of non discursive awareness that doesn't really consider things thoughtfully there's a place for that kind of awareness that's not the point of mindfulness the point of mindfulness again is the flexibility that comes when we're not stuck on any particular place if you're not stuck then you can know when it's appropriate to think about something and when it's appropriate to not to and if the situation is the child's and the street's about to be run over if you're not preoccupied and stuck I think that you know hopefully you'll just respond like that one of the beautiful things we saw this was when I used to live in San Francisco Zen Center the meditation hall is in the basement of the building and its borders streets on one side and an alley on the other side and we would get up and sit five o'clock in the morning and it was right near it was kind of like the ghettos of San Francisco from near the projects there's a lot of drugs and prostitution and muggings and killings and robings and drive-by shootings and you name it you know it happened that neighborhood and so we'd be sitting there in the morning and you always always you know interesting sounds up in the street and your cars we've broken into crashing the glass breaking and fire trucks and muggings and you know fights and prostitutes doing a business and the other side of the wall and you know all the stuff going on you sitting there mostly you know you know you sit there meditating you know it's like a little sounds but when it was something that required action like someone's being mugged it was really dramatic to see these end students it was like it was no hesitation they would just leave just it bleeped bounded out of their seats and they're out the door and out down the alley after after the situation take care of it and it was somehow you sense you had was that was that they were sitting there and they were so present in the present moment that they were ready to respond for whatever the situation required of them in that situation in that moment and if someone was suddenly yelling for help there was no hesitation they just off they went sometimes it was foolish I remember once a whole bunch of you ran out because he never knew you know what was out there there's a beautiful they were going to go out but I remember what Russian we're dashing out the door and and I was in the far end of meditation also I was one of the last people out so everybody else was running down Page Street and I asked her some you know person who had taken the purse and and I guess the woman who lost her purse was on the top of Page Street saying he was that away so everybody running down the street so I was coming out late I was one of the last people to come out and so I was didn't feel it was too much point to kind of run after this big crowd of people so so I kind of was walking in I kind of notice something told me about something something told me it's to go and look in what was happening in those bushes there and there's these big bushes halfway down the street and I was a Zen monk you know priest and I had a shaved head and all these black robes and and I you know to someone who's uninitiated probably look like Kung Fu and so and so I kind of was sort of walking over you know to this you know I'm completely meek you know I don't know anything about fighting or anything you know and I'm kind of a weak guy and so here and this guy jumps out of the bushes and puts his hand up against the wall of garage you know I didn't do it or whatever you're holding his purse I didn't do it oh whatever he said you know don't you know don't do it you know just and he was completely terrified on me and so so and so there were some other people who were coming and so they kind of we kind of got around him and circled him you know and and and no he tricked us and got away anyway but but what he did oh he didn't he didn't have the purse what happened was he said I'm gonna take you I'll show you where the purse is he's actually where the purse is don't call the police I'll take you with the purses and so he went around the corner there was a little park next to this by the Zen Center Hospice if you know and so and so it was a park next to it little park and he was in the park there and so we had this half circle around him and he was against the wall he's kind of walking along and what happens with a half circle and you come to a corner the person's not surrounded anymore and he took off and he's took off he picked up the purse and and ran down the street and disappeared and he was faster than all of us and later I realized you know that the guy could have had a gun and here I was walking up to this person you know how smart was it to walk up to these bushes like that so maybe I should have done some reflective thinking I was too caught up with my adrenaline and all maybe too so so I hope that the mindfulness makes us more responsive in all the ways we need to be responsive and if the act if if if action is what's required I hope that what mindfulness has taught us is how not to be stuck in our inhibitions which we have enough if we are if we are inhibited to act or afraid to act that we have enough mindfulness and presence to see that to not be cut caught by those so we're prevented from acting properly so this woman some years ago who was asked you know what's the more or less she said what's she was going to be a teacher of the pasa none she was asked you know what do you what do you have to teach what's the most important thing you have to teach and she said empowerment if I had one word would be the word empowerment and I thought that was kind of weird because my word was acceptance you know how do you put these two together and I thought about it for a while and I realized that the two sides of the same coin and that if you allow properly and and that it also empowers you because then you can act within from within as is appropriate more freely if the child's up in the street you'll act so I hope that mindfulness practice makes us people who are not only more allowing but also more responsive and engaged with the world around us long answer for your simple question and I said we would sit it's already 430 so if you don't mind so I can follow through on what I said when we sit for 30 seconds it's a nice way of ending is to be too concerned about doing it right and another part of the allowing aspect of practice is to be tremendously compassionate about yourself and not to be idealistic about your spiritual practice be compassionate and allowing for who you are so may whatever benefits merit we've had from this day of have practiced together. May it be shared with the people we meet today and tomorrow and may it travel out and touch others so that all beings may be happy. May all beings everywhere be happy. Thank you all. I want to remind you about the two Dhanana baskets. The reason I want to remind you is that I'm going to share some of my Dhanana with Teri who did the yoga this morning. I think it's a nice thing to do to support her and she was part of the retreat teaching it. So it's nice for you all to know that. If you want to make a donation to Teri that I'm going to pass it on to her. And if you didn't leave a donation for the rent, the rent donation is optional but it's less optional. A little bit less optional because it's helpful if we all help pay for our expenses of putting this day on. So the smaller the boxes there is for the five dollars for a rent Dhanana. And then the next day we do a one day sitting is May 10th and it's 8.30 to 5 and it's one of the ones that I don't talk at all throughout the day. It's just for experienced people there's no instruction given and it's a wonderful day of quiet. And then for some people there's a sign up sheet and if you want to have a short interview with me, a 15 minute interview, you can put your name on the sheet and I'm available for interviews on those days. So thank you all and good night.
