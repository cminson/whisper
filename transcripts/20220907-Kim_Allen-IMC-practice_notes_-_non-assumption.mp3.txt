 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So I'd like to say a few words that might help guide the practice this morning. They are useful in both sitting and in walking, which we'll do next. Many of the issues that we run into in meditation, challenges of sleepiness or restlessness or wanting or not wanting, doubt, the common hindrances of the mind, so many of them relate to assumptions that we are making about what we think we know about experience. So we assume that that twinge in our back is just going to get worse and worse. Or we assume that this vague irritation that we're feeling is something that we already know all about. We know the story that goes with it, which we could rehearse a few times. We know that it's the same as what we've encountered before. Or we're just bored. How many times do you have to feel the breath? I know the breath. I've been doing it my whole life. Another assumption. So the invitation for practice this morning is to look a little bit more closely and to look for a little bit longer. So every time we have a sense, been there, done that, not sure what I should be looking at, that's a little clue that we could sharpen up the mindfulness a little bit more carefully. Maybe it's not exactly the same as what it was last time. Maybe I don't really know what my breath is like. Maybe if I look for a little bit more than 30 seconds at a time, I'll see a pattern. I'll see a pattern that I couldn't see when looking over a shorter time period. So there's so much. Experience is so rich. Physical experience, mental experience, if we're present for it. So the invitation is to not assume and to look, just look a little bit more closely. See if you could see one different thing. So thank you.
