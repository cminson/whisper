Aware.
We are fortunate that our system has been created in this way, that we can
be aware of ourselves.
Unfortunate because that awareness
supports our learning, understanding.
Especially when we are aware in a way that is curious about the experience of
the present moment in a simple way. Just how is this being in this moment? What
is the physical experience without judging ourselves or reacting to it, but
just aware, this is what it's like right now.
So, how is the body arriving curious about body sensations?
The breath, the experience of breathing?
Curious about the experience of hearing?
Settling back and just being curious about what it's like as a human being to
have hearing happen.
There may be obvious sounds in your environment, including the sound of my
voice, or distant sounds, quiet sounds. Sometimes this receptive quality of
awareness can be easy to connect with in the field of hearing because it's
sometimes kind of clear that our ear is a receiver. Experiencing sound quite
naturally. We don't make sound happen. Our ear is contacted by sound waves and
it hears. And so, receiving sounds, body sensations.
I'm curious not only about that, what are the sensations,
but aware also of how we are as we receive experience, our relationship to
what is happening. Some body sensations happen and we like them. They're pleasant.
We want more of them. Some body sensations are unpleasant. We don't like them. We
want them to go away. Likewise with sound. What is the relationship to experience?
This doesn't have to be a big project to look for this, but just occasionally from
time to time, as you are resting with yourself, curious about experience, from
time to time, being curious about how you are with what is happening. Sometimes we
might notice a push or a pull, a greed, or an aversion, or maybe a confusion.
Don't know, confused about what's happening, or maybe a boredom, a sense of this
isn't worth watching, a belief of you. When we can recognize how we are with
experience, the Buddha's instructions encourage us then to become curious about
that too. There's that unpleasant sensation, and I don't like it. Not liking is
happening. Awareness can know that. Receive that. Receive unpleasant and not
liking. Kind of creates a bigger container in which we can know both the
unpleasant and the not liking, and begin to be okay that that is what is
happening. Have some balance with that.
Sometimes as we occasionally check in for how we are in relationship to
experience, we might not see much of a relationship. You might feel like, well, I
don't know. If that's the case, you could try on something like, well, is there
calm? Is the mind okay with what's happening? Because sometimes that
okayness with what's happening is so quiet that we don't really see it. We
don't recognize it. But recognizing that there is an okayness with what's
happening, strengthens that capacity to be okay with what's happening.
And so this checking of how we are with what's happening can both reveal that
push and pull, those ideas, those views about what's happening, and can also
reveal the okayness, a balance of mind, a simple acceptance, this is what's
happening, an equanimity. Being aware of these, beautiful thing about
mindfulness is that when we are aware of these beautiful states of mind, of calm,
of okayness, of acceptance, of balance, of patience, it strengthens them, creates
the conditions for them to grow, to appear more often in our experience.
And so we start with just receiving what's here, or some it may be simpler to
receive just the breath, or just body sensation, or maybe just hearing, and
from time to time have some curiosity, not just about what is happening, but
how you are with what's happening.
