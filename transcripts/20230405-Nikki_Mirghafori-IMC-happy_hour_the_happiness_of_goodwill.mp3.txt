There.
So, hello everyone.
Hello and welcome to Happy Hour.
It's lovely to be with you in this moment in time, wherever you are in the world.
And I am going to invite us to start practicing together.
And I will reveal the theme as we are sitting together, as we practice together.
So, let's just begin with settling in and arriving.
Ah, arriving this moment in time, in this body.
Turning awareness to greet, to greet this moment.
It's never been like this before.
Greeting this body.
Greeting the touch points, the contact points of the body.
With the earth, with the floor, the cushion, the chair, your hands on your lap.
Feeling embodied.
Connecting with the breath.
Connecting with the sensations of the breath and the body in this moment in time.
Letting go of anything else that comes up.
Letting go of everything else that comes up.
Taking refuge, the breath and the body in this moment.
It's okay to say no, it's okay to say no, not now, but lovingly, kindly.
No, not now, thank you, thank you so much.
The worries, fears, distractions, thank you for trying to warn me, distract me, entertain me.
Thank you.
And not now.
And smilingly, wholeheartedly, giving your heart the peace of this moment.
The joy of this moment.
Of just simply being.
Being and being breathed.
Not now, thank you, not now.
Just this, the nourishment of awareness.
Awareness intertwined with kindness.
Where's ourselves?
Intertwined with the breath.
Reading the breath with a smile, out breath with a smile, the in breath with a smile.
Thank you.
Imagine you're receiving the breath.
Like a good friend.
With a smile.
With a smile.
With a smile.
With a smile.
With a smile.
Now if you like, if you wish.
As you continue to feel embodied, feeling your feet on the earth, your bottom on the cushion or the chair,
your hands on your lap, the breath in your abdomen, your whole body.
Bring to mind someone who's been kind to you, recently or in the past.
Could be a person, could be a pet.
It doesn't have to be a huge act of kindness, but that is fine too.
A simple act of kindness.
But also be a benefactor of someone who's been kind to you consistently. Whatever is easy, whoever is easy.
Overcomes to mind.
Your heart makes you feel safe.
Maybe a smile shows up when you think of this being.
Bring them to your heart, to your mind's eye.
See if they were with you.
Feeling either with your eyes, feeling into the felt sense of being with this person.
What they look like, what they feel like.
Best if you're new to this practice to someone who's alive.
So it doesn't get complicated with potential grief and sadness.
But if your experience is okay, bring this person close, this being close to your heart.
Just sitting with them in appreciation.
Sense of gratitude that they are in your life or have been in your life.
Just relishing this gladness, gratitude, happiness.
It's your good fortune.
The care, the love you feel for this being.
Let it be happy making.
Thank you.
Let it be nourishing and if the mind wonders, goes into a story or memory, come back.
Come back and be with this being, with this dear being.
Time is short.
Remind yourself this is so lovely and nourishing to your heart, to your mind.
Be here with this being.
Have fun. This is not a grim duty.
You get to be with one of your favorite people, favorite beings.
It's a part of your practice and nourish your heart with its goodness, with the kindness, gratitude, happiness.
You yourself have fun with this practice.
Enjoy it.
How delightful.
I get to sit and do this right now.
In my heart, in my mind, hang out with this being.
Thank you.
Thank you for my practice.
Smiling helps. It really helps to connect with this practice and spending time with this dear being.
Even if you don't feel like smiling, do it anyway.
Wear the half smile of the Buddha.
If, per chance, any challenging perspectives, aspects of your relationship come up, it's okay.
Have kindness towards yourself.
Have kindness towards this dear being.
You're doing your best. You're doing their best.
Be kind. Be kind.
As you're hanging out in your heart and your mind with this dear being, if you like, you can add the phrases of metta.
Just stay with the feeling, the images, with the felt sense.
Now repeat the phrases.
If you might have your own, she's fine.
These are the more traditional phrases. Variations are fine.
Keep connected to their image, their felt sense.
Bring them close.
May you be safe, dear one, or say their name. May you be safe, dear so-and-so.
May you be safe from inner and outer harm.
Knowing that absolute safety is not guaranteed in the world, but we offer this as a wish, as a gift of kindness.
May you be, may you be safe. I wish you safety.
Wish you safety, dear one.
Second phrase, may you be happy. I wish you happiness. May you have joy in your heart.
Maybe imagine them happy.
Third phrase, may you be healthy, dear one, as much as possible. I wish you health.
I wish you strength in your body.
Maybe see them strong, healthy, maybe walking, exercising, whatever works in your mind's eye.
Have fun with it.
And the fourth phrase, having to do with ease. May you have ease, dear one. May you take care of yourself happily.
May your life unfold with ease.
May you be safe, connecting with safety, connecting with the person, with the being.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you have ease.
Let yourself have fun, sharing good wishes, good will for this being in your heart. Bring them close.
It's your metta playtime with this being.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
If you like including yourself now, may both of us, seeing both of you together, sitting, walking, dancing, whatever it might be.
You and your dear person, your easy person, you or have done, may both of us, may both of us be safe.
Happy.
See, both of you happy perhaps, in the tableau, in your mind.
Smiling.
Fake it till you become it. May we both be happy, wish us both happiness.
May we both be healthy, healthy and strong.
See both of you healthy, in some activity together.
May we both have ease.
Again, we offer these wishes not with attachment to outcome, but as a way to incline our hearts to good will, good will, kindness, generosity of spirit towards ourselves, towards others.
So give these wishes generously, freely, to both of you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And maybe turning to yourself now, wishing well for yourself, may I be safe.
I wish myself safety, happiness, health and ease.
Imagining yourself in these conditions of well being.
Have fun with it.
Maybe drawing a tableau from a time that you are truly happy, doing an activity you love, feeling strong, sense of ease, feeling in your body.
Invite the feeling into your heart, see if you could breathe it in right now.
Living taller, with more ease, happiness, well being.
Thank you.
Spreading this light of goodness, happiness, well being, shining it outward.
May all beings everywhere be safe.
May all beings everywhere be happy.
May they be healthy, may they have ease.
Wishing your kindness generously, a wish of well being for everyone, including myself, may all beings everywhere be truly well.
No well being.
May all beings everywhere, including myself, be free.
Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice.
I feel happier and calmer, I have a smile that doesn't want to leave my face after having done metta practice for an easy person, dear being and then turning it to both of us and then turning it to ourselves and then sharing it with all beings everywhere.
Ah, metta is happy making, it's generosity, the simple act of generosity of the heart.
So we have time, actually now we're going to turn, yes, we have time for groups, that's right, we're going to turn with a sense of well being, with a sense of good will, the sense of good will.
For ourselves, for one another, we are going to turn to each other, to small groups, we're going to practice in small groups.
And the invitation, always in the small groups, is if you wanted to share something from your own practice, something from your practice, maybe an aha moment, or a challenge, or anything, or anything at all, or I was distracted the whole time, fell asleep, that's okay too, you're welcome to share.
You can also just show up and share kindness, just say pass right now, I'm just going to be silent and if you're going to say something, maybe limit it to a minute or less so that other people have the chance to say something and they'll come back to you.
Well being groups are about seven minutes or so. So, and be kind to yourself, be kind to each other, no questions, no interrogation of one another, just share whatever you wish and hold witness to each other really, this is a sandbox to practice kindness, to practice kindness in small community, and be inspired.
So, I'm going to create the breakout rooms, and again, confidentiality is always important, whatever you say here, stays here, please, and I've created the rooms, let's go alphabetically, first name, okay, the rooms are created, and I'm going to open them now.
There we go.
Okay, welcome back everyone, welcome back. I see many smiles, which is always nice to see smiles coming back from the rooms, from the breakout groups, and we have time for any reflections you'd like to share for the benefit of yourself.
And I say yourself in the way of being witnessed, sometimes actually when we share an aha or a question, it supports us, and also for the benefit of the community, because if some question has come up for you or an aha moment actually can help others.
So, and you can type it in chat, either privately to me, have an observation reflection, or to everyone, and you can raise your zoom hand, especially if you haven't shared in the community for a while, would love to invite you to pull forward.
We'll have to hear from you.
Yaman, am I saying your name right?
Yes, it's Yaman.
Yaman, great.
Thank you for the practice. I felt very present and calm. I had a question for you. You mentioned attachment, and I was just thinking about how you can practice kindness and compassion, and not be too attached.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So the practice, basically I'll start with what I meant in the guided meditation when I was suggesting these wishes that we share, may you be well, may you be happy, may you be healthy, and may I be all these wishes.
So I'm like, okay, I've been wishing you well. Are you well yet? Like you're calling your friend. Okay, I've been sending you Metta. Are you happy now? Like they're saying, oh, I have the power, or I'm wishing myself well, I really want to be happy.
I really am so unhappy. I want to be just like, ouch, it's not really a generous way of offering kindness. It's offering kindness with conditions, or sometimes also with other people.
You may be well if you're going to be nice to me. You're wishing someone well is conditional kindness, right?
So without attachment to outcome, it's just a generosity of heart. It's a sense of generosity of, I wish you well. You might be suffering right now. I know that.
Yet I wish you well. I wish you well. It's about my heart. It's not so much about the conditions of the world. And it's not that I want to control it. And you wish yourself well with it, like really, really clinging around it.
Again, it's a difference between expectation and aspiration. Expectation is when you say you are kind with an expectation of outcome, expectation for return, expect.
Whereas there's an aspiration, there's a sense of uplift that you're sharing generosity of spirit. Does that make sense?
Yes, yes. Thank you.
You're welcome. Thank you for the question. Yaman, now I'm saying your name right.
Thanks for that question. Great one. Anyone else? Any other questions or reflections? What came up for you?
My practice report is that I was having a great time. I was having a really fun time wishing well for my dear being and for both of us and just very joyous. It's nice to have fun with this practice and be very happy making. Hence, happy hour.
Do you feel happier now than before you joined? Yes? Can I see a nod or no? Shake or nod? Yes, yes. I see more nods. I haven't seen any shakes yet.
But then again, I only see very few of you. Any other reflections you'd like to share before we close?
Neil.
So sometimes I find it difficult to give method to people who I think are like really well off.
They don't need this. I guess it seems silly to me because of course they do. And second, it's really more about me than them.
That said, this has been like a consistent sort of feeling.
What advice do you have for me? Yeah, I love it. I love the question. I love the curveball, Neil. It's awesome because the curvy part of it is your own wisdom.
I'm like, yeah, I know they need it. And it's for the benefit of my heart and yet and yet. So let's explore that. So let's explore. They don't need it.
The wisdom comes back and says, well, they really do. So can you share a little more about how that is, you know, maybe it's up in the head, not in the heart?
Flash that out for me a little bit if it's okay to be on the spot for a moment with this exploration.
Because it's really that. Because that's the crux of it. Go ahead.
Well, you know, people, you know, I have a friend he seems pretty happy pretty much all the time, like wishing him happy, you know, right?
You know, I'm friends with him for decades. I'm not sure what would be different. Occasionally he's stressed, right? I, you know, then I understand, you know, maybe you not be stressed.
That's it. But that's it. But that's it. Stress is dukkha. Everybody has dukkha. Dukkha is translated as stress. It's not just these huge sufferings and calamities are realized by stress, daily stress, but just the daily stress of the body aging and having aches and pains.
You have to take care of it and all of this is stress. You have to wake up in the morning. Make sure you go to sleep. Like, these are time. These are stresses of life that all of us have.
So, so he had and then but then you're sharing that he actually has some stressful times and yet really for so for this friend, he was always happy.
It then it's clearly for your own heart. If you if you wish happiness for someone who's already happy, then it becomes muddita practice, then it becomes a joy. You're happy that they're happy.
And your happiness increases.
That's an interesting way to look at it.
Basically, this is your perfect muddita practice person, what you're describing.
When you wish happiness for a person who's already happy, it becomes happiness for their happiness. And then you're practicing muddita for a curious joy, happiness for the happiness of others.
And guess who gets really happy doing that practice? You, Neil.
Okay, okay. I'll give it a try.
Perfect words. I'll give it a try. That's it. That's the spirit. We're all giving everything a try, right? We're just trying, you know, like, oh, yeah, that works.
Well, that's interesting. Awesome.
I'm so glad you brought this up, Neil. This was fun to explore together in real time.
Thank you.
Ah, well, my heart feels joyous having explored this practice with you.
And thank you all. Thank you for your practice. Thank you for your cultivation. Thank you for supporting yourselves, supporting each other, supporting others with your practice.
May all beings be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thanks all. Take care.
