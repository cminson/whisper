 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Welcome. It's lovely to see all the names and the warm greetings popping up on the chat. All of your locations. California, Oregon, Washington, Calgary, Chicago, Bainbridge. It's really lovely to see people from all over. Warm welcome to you. Just as you're greeting each other, maybe if you don't already do it, take a moment to scroll through the chat and just appreciate all of the warmth and friendliness in this online sangha that has been cultivated over these years now. Of every weekday meeting 7am Pacific time. It's really quite something. Warmest my heart inspires me. So we're about to get started. Those of you who haven't seen me yet or we haven't met yet. My name is Dawn meal. I am covering for Gil this week, and the topic. The topic we are covering is inner and outer harmony of mind. So just a refresher on that. The invitation as you start to settle in, make your greetings meet your greetings to tune into your heart. Notice how it feels to see everyone greeting each other maybe participate in it. I receive my welcome, my appreciation, and just really feel it here. Tune into it for a minute. And then settling. Settling and taking a couple of intentional breaths maybe with your hand on your heart just like I have it right now. Breathing in as if you could breathe in directly into your heart. Breathing out. And with that appreciation, sense of community. Since it being linked all over the world to people practicing now or at other times. All that to sort of enter your body, your mind. All that allowing you gaze to be internal. Perhaps closing your eyes. From the sensations of having arrived here. The feelings of the greetings. And realizing all of the sensations in your body. And welcoming those to. And welcoming your heart and mind as well exactly as they are. And if it feels right setting the intention of this meditation. To greet all experience that arises with metta kindness, friendliness. Doesn't mean condoning subject matter of thoughts necessarily. Liking everything but just greeting it. Reading whatever arises. This too, welcome. Welcome. And then attuning to your surroundings as well, the soundscape. There would be birdsong or far off cityscape noises, something else. Breathing your internal atmosphere. Settling in. Toning into the breathing. To the goodness of the moment. Wherever it is in the moment. Falling the mind, the heart to rest. Rest in the gentle rising and falling of the belly or chest. Or simply rest in the gentle flux. Whatever is arising in now, this moment. Settling. And appreciating any pleasant sensations, any feelings of warmth, connection. Acknowledging all that's there. Just this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. From time to time, reattuning to the moment. And seeing how kindly, graciously invite to reconnection with awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Perhaps re-engaging with loving interest. In the felt sensations, known experience of now. And stay immersed in the object of attention, breath, or sound. Where if the awareness feels steady, opening up to all that is arising and flowing through. Appreciating, allowing, being with. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Final moments of this meditation. The invitation is to gather up, soak in, find any little glimpses of goodness, well-being, kindness, ease, any goodness, and savor it, appreciate it. Allow it to make an impression from the heart, mind, and body. And then when you're ready to begin to turn that internal gaze of your heart, your mind outwards to all of those your life touches. Casting your internal vision far and wide, and perhaps setting the intention that others may also benefit from your practice. That others be peaceful, that they be well. Notice how this well-wishing feels in your heart. The wishing feels in your heart. Thank you. Thank you for the sincerity of your practice. Thank you.
