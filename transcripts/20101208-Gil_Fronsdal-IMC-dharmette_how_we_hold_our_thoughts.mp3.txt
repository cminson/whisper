Dharmette: How We Hold Our Thoughts  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

Our thinking – whether in words or images – is a huge ly 
impact ful part of our life . We can have good thoughts, 
useful thoughts . We can have inappropriate thoughts, 
unhelpful thoughts, wrong thoughts . We can be wrong 
in how we perceive things and how we understand 
things.  
 
In terms of the practice, i n some ways , how we hold 
thoughts – how we relate to them – is more important 
than the kin d of thoughts we have . In a bigger sense,  
the way we are attached, cling, and resist things  – the 
way we are pushed around or troubled by things – has a 
lot to do with how we hold our thoughts , and ideas we 
have of what ’s going on and who we are . If we can learn 
to hold the world of thinking very lightly, then it’s easier 
to have the experience of being porous , as oppose d to 
having a wall, or something solid that the world hits 
when it encounters us . Someone says or does 
something , and it hits us  if we’r e holding tight to some 
idea, concept, story, opinion, or world of thinking . That 
tightness, that holding, is often the thing that the 
experience in the world encounters and strikes . 
Sometimes it meets with hard resistance . Sometimes we get knocked over .  
 
Sometimes, if the holding is tenuous, we can feel 
vulnerable because we’re kind of holding  and we’re kind 
of not . We’re kind of open ; we’re kind of no t. We’re not 
quite ready to let go, but we’re not quite holding on 
either  – so it feels tenuous. It’s nice to consider that 
there’s an option of how hold both so lightly that you’re 
porous . Then when  someone says something , it’s 
almost as if it goes right through you . It doesn’t stick 
anywhere . It doesn’t hit anything . It doesn’t  get stopped 
by anything . Or in the common expression of a hook , 
there  are no hooks inside  that grab onto things. There 
are no buttons inside us that get pushed.  
 
With t he idea of being porous , we just let things come, 
move through , and move out. They can  still have an 
impact . We can still be emotionally moved by things . It 
doesn’t have to be completely neutral . Even emotional 
responses can also just move through freely  and openly 
if we don’t hold onto them.  
 
I don’t think we so much hold onto to emotiona l 
responses or the pain or joy we might feel . Rather, I 
think  that often what  we’re really holding onto  is the idea  
– the thoughts, concepts, stories, interpretations, and 
meaning that we assign to the feelings we have.  
 
So this points back to how important and useful it is to look at how you’re holding your thoughts . Are you riding 
them really close? Are you giving them a lot of 
authority? Do you believe that your thoughts  are who 
you really are? Do you believe every thought should be 
believed? Are you judging your thoughts a lot? “This is a 
good thought ; this is a bad thought .”  
 
How do you relate to your thoughts? Can you loosen 
the grip of thoughts, the grip in the mind? “Oh I’m 
thinking. ” Thoughts can be . They can floa t; they can 
arise ; they can come and go . They can be good 
thoughts ; they can be bad thoughts . But if we hold them 
lightly , then it’s easier to be much more relaxed about 
what happens around us  and with us  – and let it be 
porous,  and move through us.  
 
Some of what  can set up the hooks or the buttons are 
things like expectations  and shoulds . Maybe we’re 
attached to how things should be . We can be attached 
to how we want them to be or how we don’t want them 
to be . It’s reasonable to have wants or things we don’t 
want . But it depends how we hold them . If we hold them 
lightly, then when  things don’t end up the way we want 
them to be, we can ask : “What would it be like to be 
porous to this?” – just to let it be , and not have it stick 
anywhere  – not affect or impact anything.  
 
It’s quite interesting to notice  the contrasting ways in 
which we hold things . You can feel that you resist it, or grab onto it, or pick it up in some way  – versus having 
the same kind of thing happen , and it has no impact at 
all. You feel it just washes through like a wave . Or 
you’re porous to it . You realize you don’t have to  pick 
somethin g up. It’s not required to tighten up ; it’s not 
required to react to something . It can just move through.  
 
In that space of being porous, or non -reactive , chances 
are that we’ll be able to consider, determine, or 
understand more wisely what is a good way o f 
responding . But when we have our buttons pushed, or 
we have reactions going on , then we tend not to think 
as clearly, or fully, or appropriately . We don’t 
understand the fuller picture.  
 
I would encourage you to look for some opportunity in 
your daily life  to experiment with what would it be like to 
be porous in that situation. U sually it’s good to cho ose a 
situation that  is not comfortable, but not something too 
monumental . For example, y ou pull into the gas station , 
and some person pushes their car in front of yours  
although yo u were next in line . Or someone is honking 
at you  as you’re filling up . They’re  impatient and upset 
that you’re filling up your car so slowly . It’s not a big 
deal. In a week , you’re not going to think about this 
person agai n. So, experiment . See what it’s like  if you 
can shift yourself in some way . Feel what is it like to be 
porous in that situation . What’s it like to be equanimous, 
or open , and just let it flow and move through you?   
What does it feel like to be with  somet hing 
uncomfortable? It’s really interesting to look for 
opportunities to do this . Begin stretching with small 
things . And then someday , there might be a big thing . 
Some people have big things to be equanimous about 
during the holidays . It’s very common for the holidays  to 
stir up things for people – so that might be too big to 
experiment with . But maybe the gas station  is a good 
place to begin developing that capacity to be 
transparent or porous.  
 
That’s what’s on my mind.
