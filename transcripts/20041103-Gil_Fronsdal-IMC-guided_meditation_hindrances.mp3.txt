The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

As you take this meditation posture, be a little bit attentive to the quality and maybe take your spine.
Especially when you're attentive to your spine, have your spine be more energized or alert.
An energized spine makes it possible to relax the shoulders and the muscles around the spine
in the most optimal way.
So taking an upright alert posture and then softly closing the eyes.
And then beginning by taking a few long, slow, deep breaths.
Relaxed breaths, but really full breaths so you feel your chest, your rib cage expand, your belly expand.
Like you're stretching or massaging yourself from the inside.
And then as you exhale, maybe exhaling a little bit slower and fuller than usual.
But as you do so, relaxing, letting go.
Breathing in deeply.
And then exhaling while you exhale, relax.
And then letting your breath slowly return to normal.
And when your breath is more or less normal, then notice what's happening in your body.
Letting your attention move through your body freely, perhaps a global awareness of the body.
And if there's any places in your body that's easy to relax or muscles you can soften,
you might take this time to loosen up a little bit those muscles.
If they don't relax, maybe kind of a softening around the tension.
Especially as you exhale, a little softening around the holding.
Feeling your body here, this time, at this place.
And in a sense what we're trying to do in meditation is to harmonize the body and the mind.
So the body and the mind are in the same place at the same time.
If you're thinking about what happened earlier today or planning for tomorrow or fantasizing,
then your mind in a sense is elsewhere.
Other times, other places.
And if you're going to harmonize the body and mind, you need to bring the mind into the place where your body is.
Into the living experience of being here in a body.
It might feel quite wonderful to feel your body or to be present here.
It might feel quite mundane and ordinary, or it might feel uncomfortable.
It doesn't matter how it is. See if you can be patient and tolerant of how it is.
And just begin bringing your mind into your body.
Feeling the breathing within your body.
Feeling exploring your breathing, getting familiar with what it's like for the body to breathe.
As if you've never noticed your breathing before, like in some new phenomena.
And one of the reasons we focus on breathing in meditation is that breathing has a rhythmic quality.
It has an alternation, there's change, there's movement.
The experience of breathing in is different than the experience of breathing out.
There's variation.
But the variation is almost predictable, more or less the same.
And it's easier for the mind to stay focused if it's being focused on something which is, in a very easy way, is changing or alternating.
If something is really fixed.
See if you can kind of hang in there with the changing experience of breathing in and out.
Relaxing with your breathing.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
When the mind wanders away from the breathing.
Then without any commentary or judgments about that, very simply begin again with the breathing.
Feeling the breath.
Letting the experience of breathing, the sensations of breathing, move into your awareness.
Feeling your awareness. Moving in and out through the awareness. Massaging your attention.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Letting go of thoughts.
Engaging yourself with the breathing.
Experience of breathing may be pleasant or comforting.
It may be mundane or ordinary or dull.
It may be uncomfortable.
It doesn't matter.
What matters is that you trustingly stay present for your breathing.
Stay with it.
Being present for it may be in the same way you'd be present for a friend when you're really going to be present.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
Breathing in and out.
And then continuing to be with your breathing, tracking your breath, feeling the breathing.
When the mind gets taken away from the breath and you lose track of the breath,
don't immediately go back to the breath.
But rather notice what it is that took you away.
Notice what the concern was.
Notice maybe the emotional quality.
Was it a movement towards something?
Because there was desire for something?
Was there a movement of aversion or not wanting something?
Notice what it is that took you away from the breath.
And then after a while you can come back to the breathing.
But then next time you leave the breath or lose the breath, notice what it is that caused after what happened.
Notice what it is that makes it difficult for you to be present that takes you away from presence.
Notice what it is that takes you away from the breath.
Notice what it is that makes it difficult for you to be present that takes you away from presence.
Notice what it is that makes it difficult for you to be present that takes you away from presence.
Notice what it is that makes it difficult for you to be present that takes you away from presence.
Notice what it is that makes it difficult for you to be present that takes you away from presence.
Notice what it is that makes it difficult for you to be present that takes you away from presence.
