to a welcome.
Sometimes when we have this idea about a meta retreat, we think, we might think,
this is going to be lovely, just basking in warmth and tenderness.
And instead, we're finding all kinds of things that aren't warmth and aren't tenderness.
I know of a practitioner who, on a meta retreat, during walking practice,
just found herself kind of slipping into this rhythm of, I hate meta. I hate meta.
So, kind of like this opposite, you know, coming up.
Nikki talked about how there's these committees purification cycles. So,
this sometimes arises, these difficulties, these
different experiences. Those of you who have done a lot of retreats, whether they're meta
retreats or mindfulness retreats or concentration retreats, whatever. You know this, right? That
often we have this idea about how a retreat might unfold and maybe how it actually unfolds.
Turns out to be different. But that's okay. We're allowing ourselves to be surprised.
I think this expression that Jack Cornfield has, he has that this expression, the unfinished
business of the heart. So, sometimes when we pay attention to our hearts and give them space
some attention, then this unfinished business might arise.
This might be sadness or grief. Maybe this anger or hatred.
Or maybe there's other types of difficulties that arise, just bodily experiences,
discomfort of sitting. Maybe just the discomfort of having a human body that ages and gets sick.
So, if you found yourself not just dwelling in this lovely, beautiful meta field all the time
today, and I just expect this is true for everybody, right? We can't expect to have just one experience.
And I'd like to talk a little bit about some ways in which we might be with this,
work with this, or just to include it into our practice.
So, an encouragement to, is there a way in which we can keep the meta practice going,
even if there are difficulties or pain? And to be sure that's not the only response. I'll talk
about some other responses. But what is it like to include meta with difficulties, or maybe I
should say include difficulties and with our loving kindness practice?
For example, saying the phrases and also including the sadness that might come into the heart.
Or having a real sense of loving kindness, and then that openness, this softness,
maybe then bleeds into some anxiety or some agitation.
Can we still be with loving kindness? Maybe we'll continue to say the phrases.
Or maybe there's just this incredible sense of boredom, really?
Is this what that practice is? Surely there's got to be something a little more interesting
happening here. So, the invitation here, right now, this portion of the talk, as I said,
I'll talk about some alternatives. But I want to start with, can we let this practice be inclusive?
Instead of falling into this is okay, that's not okay, and I have to fix this. Is there a
make that everything go away? Is there a way in which we can relax and soften all the ways
that we divide things up and just be inclusive? So, that this practice becomes not only about
befriending others, befriending ourselves, but also befriending one moment after another.
Can I meet this moment with kindness?
There's this poem that I, this poet, I should say that I, she's a Buddhist practitioner,
and part of her practice, she's also a poet, is to write a poem every day. And I find so many of her
poems express what it's like to be a practitioner, but she never uses that language. She uses more
poetry, right, some more imaginative language.
And this is a short little poem that for me kind of like feels like what it can be like when you're
doing meta practice. And things are just really uncomfortable and you want to just abandon and
either go to mindfulness practice. And again, I want to talk about sometimes that is the
wise thing to do. But sometimes we just want to abandon everything and not come back.
And she wrote a poem in my interpretation of it is about what is it like when we can come back.
So here's this poem. It's called Hope and it's by Rosemary Traumer.
Nugged by hope, the heart rises from exhaustion.
It's like the great blue heron I saw this morning flying up from a wasteland on broad
gray wings with strong slow beats. For a moment, charged with grace. Before, did you see this heart?
It chose to land again, bringing all its beauty to the desolate place.
So I did this beautiful, you know, blue herons are these big giant birds and they,
they have this majesty about them. There's always like a delight when you see them and
this bird to take flight thinking I'm going to leave.
And I like it has this word grace in here. And yesterday, Nikki used the word grace to
describe loving kindness. And then it chose to land again, bringing all its beauty to the desolate place.
So maybe in this way transforming the place where it's, so it's no longer desolate. Now there's
this beautiful majestic bird there. So in this way, as best we can to keep coming back to the practice
and in this way, increasing our capacity for Medta. Instead of thinking, okay, you know,
of course we always start where it's easy, but we're moving towards a
immeasurability, boundlessness. We're moving towards unconditionality. So we want to like
expand our capacity. And one way to do that is to just be inclusive with whatever the difficulties
are as best we can. And maybe part of this way of expanding our capacity is to redefine
Medta. Of course it has this warmth and this spaciousness and this beauty to it.
But sometimes Medta just shows up, it feels of just not dwelling in aversion.
It doesn't have this grand expression or experience. It's just not dwelling in aversion.
Holding the space, being with the space. So it's really important to, as part of this practice,
all practices, or I would say maybe necessary, important for life,
to see how much we've been listening to an inner critic.
And one of the reasons why Medta practice can be so powerful, can be so transformative,
it can replace this negative diatribe of the inner critic with kind, positive, affirming,
benevolent wishes. That can slowly, but it just works. I'm not saying it's faster,
quicker, nobody's promising quick fixes here, but it can alter the neural pathways of the brain.
We know this, our scientists tell us this. Nikki mentioned this, whatever a person frequently
ponders upon, that becomes the inclination of the mind. So part of allowing this great,
beautiful blue hair and other bird, this, I think of them as majestic, as landing again.
There's a way if we find ourselves saying to ourselves something like,
you can't meditate. May I be happy, but you're such a loser. May I be healthy.
You're hopeless. May I live with ease. So to bring that Medta practice in, and to be sure,
sometimes this is mechanical and contrived and a little bit forced, but part of the way it works
is to undermine this inner critic, take some of the authority away, interrupt the habit,
interrupt this progression of thoughts that often happen, if we just allow the inner critic to be there.
And I'll talk a little bit more about this later. But first, I do want to address this idea of
saying the phrases. This doesn't work for everybody. As we said, there's like these three elements of
Medta practice, the sense of embodiment in a spacious, easy way. There's the visualization of
the person to whom, or sharing, extending, Medta, and the phrases. And some people, there's like
one of those three that really resonate, or there's one of those three that really doesn't resonate.
I don't want to say a little bit about the phrases, or is that it's okay if it feels mechanical at
times? Sometimes it feels dry. It feels like this, I'm using this word contrived, forced.
And I appreciated that Nikki said that Sharon Salzburg said, it was this incredibly boring
week, which she had practiced. Right, Sharon Salzburg, right? We know her as, you know, such a
kind of that, I don't know, this barrier of loving kindness. And so it's okay. It's okay if it feels
like it's mechanical and nothing in particular is happening or arising. You're still putting the mind
to good use. Because we have many thought patterns that just habitually, mechanically run.
What's the problem with Medta being a bit mechanical at times? Because with that, we're feeding
something that's wholesome. We're feeding the beneficial. We're planting the seeds. We're moving
in the right direction. So just in the same way that inner critic can be, we just, because it's
familiar and has been running for so long, we may not notice or think of it as a habitual
mechanical. In the same way, loving kindness, let's introduce some other thought patterns
that can run. So it takes a little bit of effort
to be repeating the phrases. So I just want to say it's really fine if at times it feels dry,
mechanical. And at times, we do want to find ways to reconnect to the practice.
So there's an invitation maybe to be playful, be responsive. I mean, by be responsive is
perhaps when you drop in a phrase and to just sense, how does it feel in the body?
Maybe there's one phrase that really feels, has a really nice hum to it or the body and the mind
sing in some kind of way. Maybe some of them feel a little bit dry. So maybe you play around with
them, say that one phrase repeatedly for a little bit with this spacious, relaxed way.
Or maybe you find that walking meditation and noticing the flowers or the plants or beauty
or trees or something if you're outside that feels beautiful, allowing yourself to be nourished with
that. So allowing yourself to explore and enjoy and to take care of yourself.
Taking care of yourself might mean, we've been talking about keeping the camera on,
but maybe it might mean turning the camera off. You feel like you need some privacy or maybe
there's emotions coming up or maybe there's a sense that you just want to be with your own
experience. That's physically fine. Maybe you feel like the body is a little bit uncomfortable and
you need to do longer walking meditation or to do lying down meditation and
especially the camera off. That's perfectly fine. So take good care of yourself as well as
taking care of the community that if you are feeling really agitated and find that you just can't
sit still. Maybe you can turn your camera off and allow your fidgety self to be fidgety
and just have that space to do that without concern of everybody else
seeing the big movements and getting a little bit distracted.
So the invitation is maybe as best you can or in a way that feels healing and supportive to
bring metta to the difficulties or allow the difficulties to just be in the metta practice.
And then maybe there's some creative way in which can be a support for you and for the unfolding.
There are times in which the wise thing, the helpful thing to do is to put down the metta
practice and to turn towards the difficulties. And we can discern or have some wisdom about this
is just asking ourselves if my turning towards this difficult emotion,
physical experience, is this healing and helpful right now?
Or am I just digging the hole deeper? Or am I finding myself getting really tight and constricted?
And if you find that you're getting lost in the experience more and or getting really tight,
see if you can bring some metta to that. So those are some guidelines that
to go forward spacious and what feels supportive and what also feels healing and helpful.
So to be sure with all meditation practices, your metta meditation is not any different.
And there are these five perennial ways in which our clarity, our intention for
loving kindness gets obscured. There's these forces of destruction or agitation that arise.
Many of you are familiar with these, the five hindrances.
And just as we see these with mindfulness practice, concentration practice,
there are show up in metta practice as well. They show up in daily life, right? These are
just what it means to be a human. Buddha described them thousands of years ago,
how many people have, you know, had these experiences just like us. So these five hindrances,
central desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and doubt.
It's just a natural part of being a human. They are not personal feelings. Does it mean anything
about you as a person? It doesn't mean anything about this practice. And we might even say they're
perfectly natural, right? From a natural selection point of view, it makes sense to have desire for
pleasant things such as food and sex. It makes perfect sense to have aversion to some things
that might harm us. It makes sense that sometimes there's lots of energy and sometimes less energy.
That's just a human experience. So I just want to reiterate that when these arise,
it's just something that we kind of include in our practice.
Again, it's not a personal failing, but keeping in mind that Buddha spoke about these thousands
of years ago. For me, this is very meaningful. I often somehow find this reassuring that countless
people have had these experiences. And not only that, but somehow, for me and the invitation,
if this is helpful for you, to feel connected, like just like all these other people right now.
I'm feeling all this restlessness. How many other people have felt restless?
For me, it's a connection with others. So how many other people have felt sloth and torpor?
I felt this drowsiness. So I'll say a little bit more about some of these hindrances.
The first one is about desire. And I'll just say, with loving-kindness practice,
with meta-practice, sexual feelings might arise. Of course, sexual expression is a beautiful,
natural way that humans express their love and connection. And when the heart opens,
there's other dimensions of the being open to.
So can we tune into what is basically a lovely life energy moving?
Can we tune into it, allow it to be there without getting lost in fantasy,
without repressing anything, but opening to it? And that opening allows it to move.
Maybe like this energy to move, and maybe feel the body, and then to shade into meta.
With this, we can, there's a way in which we might reinterpret these energies in a way that
can be this loving feeling without having to act it out, without having to get completely lost in
fantasies or to repress it. There might also be some restlessness that arises,
and there's a way that we can use this practice to soothe the nervous system.
Can be helpful just like the simple rhythm of the phrases. It's a little bit like a rocking,
sometimes I can't help but I find my body rocking when I'm doing loving kindness practice.
So is there a way in which there can be, you can allow this certain soothing,
maybe even saying something like it's okay. It's okay.
And in this spacious way, and allowing the restlessness to be there, maybe it feels like
a lot of energy, and is there a way with the mind and the heart that we can just allow it to be there?
And sometimes it is helpful to have that expression, it's okay. I know that
recently I was at somebody's house and they had a dog that was barking a lot, and I appreciated
this so much that one of the members of the household said to the dog, you're okay. You're
okay. And the dog just kind of calmed down, and I thought, oh, that's so great. It's just this kind
of this reassurance, it's okay. So maybe that's helpful.
And then sometimes I find that the opposite, we're not restless, we just cannot stay awake and
invitation ears to open the eyes, or maybe to stand up, or there's something like this to
help the energy come back up, or you can maybe, if you're saying the phrases, maybe
say them with a little bit more energy to them.
And then doubt. This idea like, what am I doing here?
Sometimes that can arise right on retreats. And so the invitation is, can you just trust
that we're planting seeds that will blossom, that will bring fruit, that will sprout?
And I've seen this more so in loving kindness practice than anywhere else that often the seeds
don't show up immediately. It's sometimes later. To be sure, sometimes there are seeds right then,
but it's really astounding how sometimes later the seeds are there. So as best we can just to
trust that we're planting the seeds. And I didn't mention aversion. A little bit about aversion
is sometimes when the boredom, sometimes boredom shows up.
Best you can maybe stay with the practice, but also the opposite of loving kindness shows up.
And then use your wisdom. Is there a way that you can have metta and this ill will
that recognizing some ill will and saying, and maybe happy to wherever it's easiest if you're
finding ill will towards one person, chances that you are that you can't have loving kindness
for that same person, but maybe to do loving kindness for wherever it's easy, whatever is
accessible, to take some of the energy and the power and the momentum away from the ill will.
It doesn't always work sometimes that ill will just comes up and it's really strong and I'll
talk in a moment like what to do with things are really strong with some of the difficult
things that might arise. I'll say that I had surprised myself with loving kindness practice.
Wow, how much anger came up this out of me that I just was so surprised by like,
where did that come from? And I didn't I couldn't even tell you exactly where it was directed,
but man was I mad. And, you know, I found myself doing a lot of walking meditation just to kind
of like, move the energy and just let's not all I could do, you know, instead of just running away
screaming or something like this. So maybe you might find that that's helpful, like, okay,
I cannot sit still with us, but I'm just going to do some walking here and and as best you can
to do some walking with allowing the body to move freely, to bring some softness and ease
of the body. So at a pace that feels supportive, maybe at first, if there's a lot of anger and
or hatred, maybe at first, it's a little bit of stomping, but then just allow the body to
move it away that feels supportive.
So something else, if there's some difficult emotions, whether it's the
hatred, or what's this is a little bit easier with grief, or fear, is way to can we hold or
cradle the difficult emotion. Sometimes we see Nikki and sometimes me, that we just naturally
like, oh, it's okay. So there's this putting this hand in the chest. I don't know why there's something
about this physical gesture, this gesture, or maybe even like this gesture, kind of like holding
or maybe even like this, like cradling. And there can be even a sense of it's okay. It's okay.
So cupping, cupping the emotion, cradling the emotion and maybe using the term of
it. Endearment, sweetie. Maybe you have a nickname that was used when you were younger and
sometimes I hear myself saying to myself, it's okay Diana, banana.
This was nickname when I was young, right. And it's, it just somehow right, just how I did
here I kind of left. It's just a way to, I don't know. It's like a term of endearment. So maybe
you have a term of endearment for yourself that others have given you or maybe there's a
gesture. So for these difficult emotions, can we hold them with kindness and with care
and with respect and honoring kind of this is what's happening. We don't have to make it go away.
We don't have to make it be different. But can we bring our kindness to this?
Sometimes it's helpful to say this is suffering. This is suffering.
And sometimes just saying it like it is helps us to gain just a little bit of space.
Otherwise we can like collapse into it, our attention, our awareness gets consumed or
maybe it collapses around the difficulties and saying, oh, this is suffering brings a little bit
more space in. And of course, that's the first number of truth, right. This is like it's such
a core thing in the Buddhist teachings. And for me, it's quite meaningful to say this is
what has been pointed to
in the Buddha by all these teachings by so many practitioners. This is suffering. And
there's so there's teachings around it, but there's this core fundamental truth that this is what it
means to have a human life. People suffer. We suffer. There's difficulties.
And I'm using this word suffering, and you might have another word that you prefer. So
if this doesn't resonate with you or you feel like, oh, that's too dramatic. Maybe there's
another something else that does resonate for you. But sometimes it's helpful just to call
a spade a spade and to bring to mind also that other humans have this experience. Maybe it's not
the exact same experience of yours that you're having. But again, this idea of connecting
can be a support. So often when we have difficulties, we tend to not only does our attention collapse,
but the kind of an isolation goes with that. And we start to feel like we're the only ones. And
it's we can get stuck in there. So this, maybe bring it to mind the recognition that other people
have difficulties too. And just like I wish my suffering would lessen, may their suffering lessen.
Something else that we can do if difficulties arise is to soften the body.
If we find ourselves sitting, you know, with some tightness, maybe do a little bit more walking
meditation or maybe even doing some lying down meditation. We all know that the mind and body
are connected. And sometimes when there's difficulties, the mind and the heart get contracted.
And so is there a way to bring some softness with the body this might mean going for a stroll and
kind of letting go of meditation practice, but going for a stroll and just noticing
what is pleasing, what is attractive to the eye or what is uplifting to the heart.
So spending time in nature, if it's available for you can be tremendous support
when some of these difficulties arise.
And then I want to get back to talk about this inner critic,
especially when we're doing loving kindness practice for ourselves. Sometimes it might feel
like this inner critic is really loud and persuasive and persistent.
It can feel almost like there's a subpersonality inside of us that's
constantly putting us down. And sometimes these are just flickering thoughts or soft
thoughts that maybe they're just so familiar that we don't even recognize them or we think like,
okay, that's just who I am. But it's more, it's just a constellation. It's a
causes and conditions that have come together. There's nothing concrete about them. This inner
critic, even though we tend to think that there is or tends to feel like it is, I'll say a little
bit more about this, but one way that it shows up, maybe I'll describe it as constantly putting us
down. You don't deserve metta, like, ouch, or belittling us. You should be giving metta to
others, not focusing on yourself. Oh, ouch, right? Or this voice of negativity that sometimes shows
up. Whatever you're doing, it's not going to work. Or you're not doing it right.
It's unfortunate that so many of us, not everybody, but so many of us have this
inner diatribe, this habitual way of thought pattern that arises nagging at us and having
this pervasive sense of shame and this harshness. And when this inner critic is up and running,
there's often this feeling of inadequacy of not being enough or somehow feeling like who I am
or how I am is not enough. And there's so much pain that can be caught up in this structure.
And some people feel like it's just them, like they're the only ones that have this
inner critic that everybody else is doing fine. But I think it can be helpful to recognize
that it's important to know that this is not uncommon. And I've heard from a number of other
people who have said during practice discussions, one thing that happens when we have group practice
discussions, is they hear other people talking about their inner critic using necessarily that
language. But we say, oh, that person seemed like they had it all together. And then they
hear that they have an inner critic. And we start to realize, oh, I have it. And this other person
did. Maybe it's not so rare. So it's understandable that people have this. We learned it from school,
from society, from family, it's this cultural phenomenon. And it's important not to blame
oneself for having this inner dynamic. But instead of choosing one event, one memory, one
particular perception, and clinging to it and giving it meaning and giving it significance
and creating a whole self around it. Instead of choosing the one thing that time that we maybe
made a mistake or didn't do things that's absolute best way it could be done or something like that.
Instead, can we respect ourselves aren't coming to this retreat, our intention to grow and develop
our meditation practice, our goodness that we all have. We're not creating anything new here
with this practice. We all have this warmth, this goodness, this beauty inside of us. We all express
it. We're just creating the conditions in which we can make it be boundless.
So can we respect ourselves for this coming to this retreat? It's a beautiful thing to do.
We respect ourselves for our care with our ethics. We sometimes people are dismissive,
yeah, well, of course, I'm not stealing things and lying and harming others. But
can you imagine what the world will be like if we didn't do this? Like, oh, like it's unimaginable,
right? So I want to kind of respect ourselves for behaving ethically,
appreciating our goodness and connecting to our deepest aspirations,
our aspirations to
find freedom, find peace, support others, support ourselves, whatever your aspiration might be
to have loving kindness that is boundless, unconditional, which allows a different kind
of life to unfold. So to work with the inner critic with some loving kindness,
I want to say that when the machinery of the inner critic is up and running with all of its power
and locomotion, this momentum, it may feel like doing loving kindness practice may seem silly.
This idea of spitting into the ocean or something. But that is just that perception at that moment.
It's the perceptions of the inner critic, it's the thoughts of the inner critic,
and they feel like they are real and convincing. But this inner critic is just a tight habitual
orbit of thoughts. That's all. It's just a tight habitual orbit of thoughts.
Thoughts are ephemeral. They don't have any substance. They have another one.
So loving kindness practice helps us set up different habits of thinking. The different habits
of showing up with some kindness and some spaciousness and some well-wishing.
And with this loving kindness, establishing this habit, that habit of the inner critic just
starts to lose its power. And of course, this takes time, it takes patience, and it takes some
confidence or some faith that we are planting the seeds. We might not see the fruits right then,
but even just to undermine the momentum of this inner critic, we shouldn't underestimate how powerful
that is. So maybe I'll say just a few more things about if difficulties arise.
And just recognizing that we don't have to make them be a problem.
Is there a way that we can shift our perspective or shift our attention so that
we can include them into our meditation practice? Instead of like, oh, this is a problem. It has
to go away or it can't be here or some ways in which we can work with things or see our experiences
in a way that allows the problem to kind of like drain out of them. Like, okay, yeah, this is what's
happening. This is suffering. But without necessarily having to make it be a problem or
something that has to be fixed. And so one way in which we might approach this or help with this
kind of like shift in perspective is to if we discover that we're having this persistent
difficulty, I'm using this word, I wish I had a better word,
something that's this persistent pattern that shows up. And maybe this is the last thing I'll
offer is all these different ways of which to work with them is maybe there's a gentle inquiry.
What is asking for acceptance? What is asking for some warmth? What is asking for some kindness?
What is asking for some meta?
Because often repeated patterns show up because there's some level of resistance,
there's an aversion or there's some fear or judgment that are locked up inside or somehow.
So is there a way that we can have acceptance that we can allow? We can have warmth, we can have
kindness for the fear, the aversion and the judgment also. So sometimes just that not that we have to
find the answer, but it's the asking of the question. What's needing some attention?
What's needing some warmth, some of this loving kindness, some of this care?
And it's the asking with the intention of offering care.
It's the way that we work with this rather than just trying to get to the bottom of it so that we
can fix it. So when we're doing loving kindness practice, some difficulties, some hindrances that
arise, can we be inclusive and include them in with our practice? That might mean that we're
doing a loving kindness for ourselves and it feels like we're just behind stuck and can't
bring the warmth to the difficulty. Maybe it's helpful to go to the lovable being, the easy being
and allow ourselves to be nourished there and then to come back to a lovable being or
be with the lovable being and allowing the difficulty to be there while we're also with
the lovable being, the easy being. And then if it feels like, okay, this difficulty is just too much
and feels like it would be helpful to turn towards it. So maybe to shift to some mindfulness
practice and to be with the hindrances specifically or to do this practice of
what is asking for acceptance, saying it's okay, saying this is suffering, connecting with other
people that might have some difficulties. Maybe you have, you know, meditation practice and you
already have a different number of different ways in which you can work with difficulties.
So there's a way with this practice that we're doing mindful, sorry, we're doing meta
until it feels like the meta is just not available and we can turn towards the difficulty,
work with it with an warm hearted way and then come back to the meta. The invitation here in
a meta retreat is to see, can you just be inclusive and maybe dwelling in non aversion
or just befriending each moment, maybe stretching our definition or interpretation of meta
help us to be with the difficulties, the hindrances that come up. Maybe I'll stop there.
I want to say I'm just feeling into this feels like already a lot. So
let's just sit together for a little bit.
Thank you for your practice and your kind attention.
