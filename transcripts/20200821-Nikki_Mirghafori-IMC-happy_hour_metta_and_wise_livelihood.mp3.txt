The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
The preliminary. All right. A warm welcome.
A warm welcome to all of you, wherever you are in this moment.
May you be safe and happy and well.
And for happy hour today,
we are going to continue with the theme we have been exploring
the past few meetings.
So we started to explore the relationship between
Mehta, cultivating kindness,
goodwill, friendliness for ourselves and others
with relation to the factors
of the Eightfold Path. And today
we have made it to the fifth factor
which is wise livelihood.
Another very important one
just to quickly review the
triad which this is the third one of wise
speech, wise action, wise livelihood. They're very external.
Of course, wise action could be considered actions of the mind
but this triad in the Eightfold Path is very external
how we show up in the world with our speech, with our actions
with our livelihood, how we earn our living,
support ourselves, support others.
So this is a very important
factor for
all laypeople. Whether you work or you're retired
this is still relevant. So if you're not working right now
if you're retired, please don't tune out. There are aspects of this
aspects of how you share
your gifts, your resources,
your energy in the world
which is still relevant. So please still consider the
ways in which you show up in the world. So if you have volunteer work
or the way you spend your time to still be a way that
you are spending your precious resource which is your time
your energy, your resource.
So I'll say a couple of words about this relationship
and then we'll get into the guided meditation which will be 30 minutes
and as you know there will be some time for reflections
and speaking in groups afterwards.
Wise
livelihood. There are
basically, there's so much I can say but I'll keep it really
pith and brief, the Buddha basically
says there are five livelihoods that are not wise
and those are dealing in weapons
dealing in human beings, meat,
intoxicants, poisons and
anything that's not those by definition can be considered
wise livelihood. And this is
an ancient teaching 2600 years ago and people didn't have so much
choice of course in their
livelihood, in their families, in their cast, etc.
But now we can actually have a higher bar if we wanted to
with this teaching. So I'd like to invite you to consider
any way, any wholesome way that is not harmful
any wholesome way that is not harming you
and it's not harming others and is helping
you support yourself, feed yourself, have a
roof over your head
and to support others who depend on you, whom you support to consider
that to be wise livelihood. It's right livelihood
to support yourself, to take care of yourself, this dear being
as long as you're not harming in those ways that I mentioned
poisons and this and that. So perhaps we can also take the same
definition really in this way. There's more
to be said about it but let's just take this as
a one approach to wise
livelihood. Now with respect to METTA, METTA
can be expressed, METTA as we've explored as an expression
of goodwill, care, friendliness for yourself
and for others is part of the fabric
of making a livelihood in the world
supporting yourself and others and by expressing
your care, your friendliness in the
world through your work or actually through
working, through taking care of yourself and others you are expressing your
care, your friendliness and METTA for yourself, you're taking care of this being.
So on some very very basic level
we can see the relationship between the two and we'll explore
it more in the guided meditation. We'll see what comes up
in this territory. So
I will speak no more and instead I would like to
invite you right now to transition to whatever
posture is most supportive for you in
your meditation right now.
Whether you need to transition to
lie down, if you need to transition to sit up
straighter, more sense of integrity in your
chair, your cushion, whether you need
to relax and soften.
And let us begin by greeting
by greeting ourselves
by greeting this being
whom we're the steward of
greeting ourselves with kindness
hello
not taking this being for granted at all
not taking our life for granted
the fact that we're alive for granted
the fact that we have
some level of health while being
in this moment
not taking any of this for granted
and greeting this being, this dear being
whom we are the guardian of
as if we were giving ourselves
a warm hello
we've been perhaps busy all day
or we might be busy all day if you're starting your day
but in this moment
not forsaking this dear being
and giving yourself a mental hug or actually if you move to it
let's make it physical, a physical greeting
holding yourself
oh wow, this human being here breathing
living
struggling, feeling joy
hello
acknowledging yourself
ah and landing
deeply landing in your being
landing
landing in your bones
feeling
feeling
feeling
your skeleton, your bones
the hardness
the sense of structure within the body
ah
sitting, landing, connecting
the tissue, letting the soft tissue relax, soften
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
the body to receive the breath
offering up any thoughts, any thinking in this moment
not that there's anything wrong with thinking
but in this moment giving it up
for the benefit of just receiving the breath
the moment of presence and silence
just landing
being breathed for a few minutes
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
letting yourself enjoy, appreciate, relish
the simplicity of just sitting
just sitting
and breathing
ah
ah
there to go, nothing to do in this moment
ah
to just be here
ah
fully present
ah
your own humanity
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
now I would like to invite you
if you wish
to bring to mind
an image of yourself
as a young child
that might be an image you have in mind
from a favorite photograph
from a younger age
conjuring up
this image is feeling
felt sense of yourself
and bringing
your younger self close
as if she, he, they
were right next to you
were with you
either standing next to you, sitting next to you
or if it feels right for you
maybe they're sitting on your lap
this younger version
see what it feels
whatever feels good in this moment
ah
ah
and inviting, if you will
the sense of seeing this younger version
of yourself
needs to be taken care of
you as the older adult
you're much more capable
this younger version
needs to be taken care of
to be fed
to be loved
to be appreciated
to be maybe even cuddled
whatever feels appropriate for you
basically to be cared for
ah
it's a very young child
that you brought up in your mind
maybe a toddler
almost helpless
can't take care of themselves
at all or even an older child
really needs protection and safety
so seeing this
see if there can be a sense of care
in your heart wanting to care for this child
maybe also when you are at that age
maybe there are challenges
maybe you want to take care of this child
loving, supporting
being a good loving parent
to this younger version of yourself
maybe even re-parenting
providing, providing which
could not have been provided perhaps
even with the best of intentions
maybe there were some things that couldn't be provided
now as a more capable adult
can care for, hold
and see the goodness
the tenderness
the sensitivity
in this young child
and holding this young version with care
with meta, with friendliness
hi sweetie
hello dear one
I love you
I'll take care of you
let me hold you
maybe without any words
just comforting and supporting
maybe rocking
a child on your lap
just supporting
unverbaly whatever feels right for you
this precious little child
now feel free to be creative
let's see what works for you
this does a way to explore
to express care for this child
maybe
maybe what works is to hold their hand
go for a little walk in nature
in your mind's eye
show them the sky and the leaves
maybe
what works for you
is your expression of care
to sit and feed them
maybe cook for them as an expression of your care
if you love to cook
or just hold them
whatever is your way to express your care
or maybe play with them
maybe that's how you express your affection
engaging in play
maybe you're jumping up and down
on the trampoline
with a younger version of yourself
and you're both giggling
whatever works for you
to feel this connection, sense of care
what did you love doing when you were growing up?
maybe you loved to draw and paint
maybe you see yourself doing that
and your older version
encouraging you
sharing words of comfort
just sitting with you
with appreciation
see what works for you
spending a few moments with an expression
of connection and care, meta
for your younger self
taking delight
as much as it's available
opening to delight
and the connection and the care
for your younger self
and now I'd like to invite you
to feel the connection
between your livelihood
and your care
you're taking care of this young child
this younger version of yourself
seeing one aspect
or many aspects
seeing one aspect of your livelihood
your wise livelihood in the world
be an expression of meta and care
taking care of wanting to take care of
wanting to care for
to have a roof over their head
to feed them
support them to be healthy
happy, safe
have ease
in their lives this younger version
that is you
that your work, your livelihood
is connected to this meta, this care
it's wholesome, it's beautiful
it's wholesome
and now I'd like to invite you
to bow to this little child
for showing up
for being a part of your practice tonight
and now
opening up
to bringing in others
the child can still be here
of course they can be sitting with you
and now inviting other beings
perhaps first other beings
who might be dependent on you
and you support
you care for and you're welcome to see them
at this age now
or maybe when they were younger
and see the connection between your
your livelihood
and your care for these beings
and maybe you don't directly support them
perhaps maybe there are beings
who feel supported
by you showing up in the world
the way you do
can bring them in
and perhaps
opening
the invitation further to
all those
who get directly or indirectly impacted
by what you do in the world
your livelihood
the way you show up for your friends
again if you're retired
or not working right now
you can expand it
it's not just your work
your living but how you show up
the impact of your actions
feel free to expand this
to work for you
and if you are working
making a living right now
feel free to bring in
all those who are impacted
directly or indirectly
and also
if you were working at some point
perhaps you will be
in the future
let's take the long-term view
inviting all those people
hundreds, thousands, maybe more
who are impacted directly or indirectly
through time and space
and seeing your livelihood, your wise livelihood
as an expression of friendliness
an expression of goodwill
that is expressed
that's offered
to others
your service
time your attention
seeing the service
that you provide
for other beings
as an expression of the goodwill
that you bring to the world
you
you
you
you
and seeing your engagement with the world
as a gift
as your sacred offering
to yourself and others
with friendliness and metta
may our engagement with the world
be of service
and bring goodness to ourselves
and all beings everywhere
thank you for your practice everyone
so I'd like to invite you if you wish to share
what came up for you
what same significant reflections, questions
and I'll start
and you're welcome to type them in chat
or unmute yourself
and I'll start
by sharing that
I really enjoyed, appreciated tonight
exploring this relationship between metta
and voice likelihood
and especially with the first part
as I was guiding all of us
to feel this connection of care
for this being that is yourself
and imagining a younger version
for me tonight
that was quite alive
I was just really connecting
jumping on a trampoline
drawing with a younger version of myself
there's just such a sense of connection and care
that felt very supportive
in exploring the rest
so thank you
for practicing with me
creating that condition
so anybody else please
can unmute yourself or chat
I can say something
please Megan
I got home like three minutes before
happy hour started
because I was at work super late
and I was like eating my dinner
during the first 10 minutes
but I heard you like
say the theme and I was like
that's perfect for me
because it was a long day at work
and the reason was
partly because we had two
like very very difficult conversations
that came up in sort of the late
afternoon and evening
that
literally were life and death situations
and I think
thinking about wise livelihood
it's so interesting to
watch the mind and emotions
when it's like okay this is the time
normally I would leave
but there's this situation
that's extremely important
and just watching
that sort of tug
knowing that I need to do the thing
right
and stay and it was so interesting
because I stayed and
we talked to these two patients
and like families and
I was like on my way out
and the staff physician
I was working with was like you know
we saw a lot of people today
it was really busy but like
the most meaningful thing was
taking the time to talk to these
two patients
and like do what hadn't been done
taking the time to do that
so yeah
I think it was
there's the thing that you do for your work
and then there's
how you do it and how like
these varying
like
things tug at you
but like I think I could just like feel the practice
there a lot
so that was
thank you
thank you Megan
thank you so much for bringing
this in
so
the intimacy of
your wise livelihood
a matter of life and death
working at the ICU and
the extra
doing the extra taking the extra
showing up with compassion
really with care
with wisdom for those who really
needed it
thank you for bringing that in
and doing the work you do
in the world
hmmm
any other reflections please
hi
I actually need some suggestion
I feel like
I cannot focus
so
it's just
very chumpy my mind
and also over here actually it's very
noisy so
even right now my kid is about to
party
so I don't know
if you have any recommendation
what to do before so that I can
at least get my mind a little bit
concentrated
yeah I appreciate
your question Maria
and your interest
in wanting to be
more still so what I
would suggest is
before you come and sit if you have
the time and the space if it's possible
for you to sit
to do some walking
meditation some movement
meditation to become more
embodied that way
your mind can settle more
and you know about walking
meditation right you can walk back
great
do 10 15 minutes of walking meditation
as a preparation
and then I trust
that when you come and sit down to meditate
you'll notice your mind being more
more stable more settled
okay thank you
you're very welcome great
yeah
um
yeah this is great
so
in yuka says I remember my childhood
freedom there is a smile
that is safe and overflows
from the inside practice
practicing to stay
connected beautiful
oh thank you yuka that is
just lovely
that is just lovely
yeah and
and joe oh joe your comment is about
the suggestion is about
removing spotlight actually there's a
reason why I only have
spotlight on myself is to
protect the privacy
of everyone who shows up on zoom
so that only I'm the one
who's on youtube
and nobody else's name
and information is on zoom so there's
a reason for that joe yeah thank you
yeah
um great
so any other reflections you like
to share please
about the practice
why is
livelihood what came up for you
comments questions
I
have a question niki sure
um
is eating meat forbidden in buddhist
you know
religion yeah
in buddhist buddhist philosophy
well there's buddhist philosophy it's
practice as a religion it's
not forbidden um
so and
it's a part of a long
conversation but very briefly to say
um
as the um
you're not supposed to kill
anything or anyone
and yet to consider that
the monks were all mendicants
so they were dependent
whatever was offered to them
they ate so if
if they went to a family and the family
gave them meat they
gratefully they ate whatever was offered
to them so the buddha did not make it
because maybe that's all they got
today
but what about
you know someone who say practicing
the religion and it's not a mendicant
yeah it's similarly
there you're invited
to consider what
to use your wisdom
so if it is possible for you to not
eat meat then
then don't but there are
people who have physical
limitations and physical
conditions and various things so
there is no
it's basically buddhism invites you to
really make decisions for yourself
it doesn't say don't do this
it's like consider the harm
the impact and all of that the environmental
so
you're invited but there is
yeah there is no
you don't have to be a vegetarian
I mean I am a vegetarian
but I was just
sure yeah yeah that comes up and
it could be a longer conversation also
but yeah appreciate the questions
so
and
yeah
also thank you for let's see a couple more
reflections
from Holly I saw my young self liked
to play with others at the moment
I'm looking at career pathways
at this insight
and this insight clarifies
what came up last night in counseling
which is that
working in a team is the most
important thing in choosing a career
ah thanks for sharing that Holly
that's wonderful to hear
and Rich please
awesome now is that
childhood
visualization
part of like a classic buddhist
guided meditation
I've never
I mean I'm new to buddhism but I've never heard
that before but to be honest
as I was thinking about that
I don't have any kids and all of a
sudden I had a kid
and I could relate to a parent because
I knew what I was thinking because
you know I was both people
that was really really fun
for me great great
fantastic I am so
glad that came up
it worked and really wow this
it came alive for you so
so the practice
of metta is basically
we call it skillful means
so there are a lot of different
skillful means so this
invitation that I shared with you
is basically to conjure
up to bring up
the sense of connection related
this love which we all have but if I
just tell you oh love yourself you're like
what you know
so these are the ways
to tap into and there are a lot
there are some teachings but it's basically
cultivating it's
skillful means that I use
from my own practice as a teacher
knowing what works
to invite you to tap into what
you already have
and to build on it to cultivate
more more friendliness
and care for yourself
so no you won't see
you won't find this guided meditation
any suttas
but it's
but it is considered skillful means
and creativity is always welcome
great so wow
time flies talked a lot tonight
so let's
transition please
to our
time together which
let's see I think we can still do it
let's do it so the invitation is now
will be in groups of
three and showing up
with a sense of care that you had for this
little child that was you and seeing
the little children and everyone
that you're in the group with
to show up
with the same level of care and friendliness
and goodwill for all the
children all three of you
in this group and the prompt is
how was the guided meditation
and you can say my mind was all over the place
didn't like it loved it
doesn't matter what you say but how you show up
with care for
yourself and
friendliness for others
and again if
this moment is not appropriate for you to
engage it's perfectly
fine to bow out
no judgment of yourself
or anyone else
but I hope you stay and connect with others
it's always fine
to connect with other practitioners
so I will
create the rooms
and
here we go
opening the rooms
maybe not hold on
the number keeps changing as I try to open
the rooms
people drop off hold on
okay let's see
alright
so you can practice
more meta while I
do these last minute
changes
okay I think
I think whoops
alright here we go
I'm opening the rooms here we go
okay
great welcome back everyone
back everyone
there
so
we have
just a few minutes
for any reflections
either from the first part or the second part
of your practice and
community and
especially if you haven't spoken yet today
please
you can unmute yourself or type in chat
don't be shy
hi Nikki
hi everyone
I had a
like through realization
that
meta is about sort of like
locating the happiness
in yourself
and then like using that to like
grow
like I think that when I thought
about this practice before
I think I could maybe kind of skip that part
and I was just like
alright who else
am I sending my love themes to
but
it made me realize how
really
helpful it is to like take care of yourself
first like
taking a lot of time with that
so I loved this so much
it was so wonderful
yay to a breakthrough
Katie yay
to a breakthrough I celebrated
with you with much
with much vicarious joy for you
it's so important
to get that to grok
that how much self-care
and self-love is just really the basis
and how important that is Katie
yay you just made me very happy
thank you
for sharing that it's lovely
yeah
any other reflections please
I mean yeah go ahead
oh hi yeah
I was just sharing with the group that
I had some really great ideas and inspiration
during meditation but I had something
told me that it's okay to let them go to
not to really grasp on
to any ideas and just to
it almost gave me more empowerment over
just thoughts
just not to avoid bad thoughts
but also not to cling on to good thoughts
nice
nice
I'm loving hearing
the way you're describing that
that actually gave you empowerment
yeah great thought
I don't have to grab on
to it right now think about it
if it's important enough it will come back later
and right now I can just be here
there's a sense of empowerment
and stability you don't have to be
you're not on the leash and be pulled here
and there by a thought just because
it has a reason you have to
sniff it and follow it
that is fantastic thank you for sharing
that
yeah that's a great
that's a great realization beautiful
yeah
well
hi Nikki
hi Patricia
