 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So warm welcome again to Happy Hour. Happy to be here with you tonight. And just for some opening remarks before we start meditating together, I'd like to talk about a topic that is big in the field of caregiving, professional caregiving, which is self-care. And something we hear a lot about at the hospital I work at some days a week. And I was reflecting yesterday and today that META, loving kindness practice, is really a form of self-care. Whether we direct it to ourselves or not, it's kind of like we, it kind of goes through us, right? It's emerging from our hearts, our minds, and suffuses our bodies, and our habits, and our conditioning. And it can be really supportive. It's interesting to kind of think, and many of you probably know this, that in ancient India, self-love was assumed. That was the starting point. And there's this kind of famous little vignette that is from the Udana, the inspired utterances of the Buddha, that book of the Pali Canon, where this king and queen are kind of standing on a deck or a parapet of the castle. The king had married this woman. She was actually quite poor and had elevated her to the status of queen. And it was early in their marriage and it was kind of a tender, romantic moment. And he turns to her and he asks, My love, who to you is most dear? And she pauses, checks in with herself when imagined. And very honestly, she says, my king, my love, I am to myself the most dear. I can imagine the king might have been a little surprised by this. But he went to the Buddha, because they were both students of the Buddha's, and he asked him, What do you think of this? And the Buddha affirmed Queen Malika's wisdom. He said, if you search the world all over with your mind, you will find no one dearer to you than yourself. And then pauses and he said, And if you really reflect on it, others too, each to them, their life is the most dear. And recognizing that no one should ever harm another person. Just kind of beautiful, right? Just like me. Everyone else wants to live, to be free of suffering, to be happy. And you don't need me to tell you that in our culture, it's not always so easy. Most of us don't find or haven't found, many, many people haven't found self care or self love to be natural. So for many of us, and this is where the self care comes in, and sort of teachings in my professional community, you could almost flip it around. That many of us find it easier to love or to care for others than we do for ourselves. And the art of cultivating self care or self love can have to do with recognizing that my own capacity, your own capacity, to be present for others, to show up for others, to care for others, to love, enjoy others in any kind of sustainable way, rests on the capacity for self love and self care. It's not that we can get away with it for a while, we can give, give, give for a while, maybe even years. But at some point, got to build a well, right? The Buddha talks about in another teaching how a wise person wishes, acts, thinks for the benefit of themselves, for the benefit of others and for the benefit of the world. And it's that kind of balance, you know, not a self aggrandizement, but not a self denying either. That can be, that is so powerful in finding that balance. So they said right at the start, the good news is that in cultivating loving kindness, the benefits touch us first. So you don't necessarily have to go out of your way. No matter who it's to, some of the love is moving through and tonight I'm going to invite us to balance it by including ourselves and the kindness and the care very intentionally, as much as you're comfortable with. So that is my beginning remarks. Invitation now is find a comfortable posture if you haven't already, balance, relaxation and alertness. Comfort is definitely encouraged in this practice. Can feel free to turn away from the video screen or turn your video off during the meditation if that feels better for you. And turn off anything that might disturb you. So perhaps starting by settling into your posture. I like to rock back and forth over my hip points forward and back a little and just find a place of balance almost like the body is a pendulum. Letting your neck relax, your shoulders under your skull, skull aligned with the spine. Throwing strength from whatever you're seated or lying or standing on. Being aligned and tuning in, tuning into the body. Noticing whatever energy is present. Maybe vibration or tingling. Bubbliness from the energy it took to get here, wherever here it is. Taking some slower, more intentional breaths deeper if it's comfortable for you. Exhaling any unnecessary tension on the out breath. And then setting the intention for the time of this meditation to be as gentle and kind and present with your experience as possible. Allowing the breathing to be natural and tuning in to the sensations of the breath in the body. The sensations of the body's aliveness. The felt experience of your senses. Resting the attention in this breath, this moment. Resting the attention and settling. And the sensations of breathing or soothing for you. Allowing them to come to the forefront. Appreciating your life's breath. Appreciating whatever other sensory experience is most comfortable to anchor your attention in. Grounding in the details. All the little sensations. Breathing in and breathing out. Exhaling kindness. Noticing and softening. Perhaps breathing with and through many areas of tension or holding in the body. This body. This lifelong companion, friend. If the mind wanders. Feeling into how gently, graciously, kindly, you can invite attention to the presence of this moment. Here. The chin breath. Appreciating, drawing nourishment in to this body. Exhaling and appreciating any aliveness, energy. Offering kindness through every organ, every muscle. Out into the room. Now, calling to mind. Perhaps the image or felt sense of someone for whom it's easy to feel care, appreciation, kindness. A person or another being can be an animal. A mythic figure. Religious icon. A child, some kind of benefactor. Focusing. Happens in your heart and mind. As they become the focus of your attention for a moment. Just gathering the attention in the center of your chest, around your heart. Noticing the sensations, feelings, emotions. And sending them good wishes. Perhaps offering them like a gesture, or on the out breath. Noticing how that feels. In the in breath. Imagine soft light, diffusing through your heart towards them. Or perhaps intentions flowing outwards. Like fog, or breeze. Or some other way, that nation welcome. Imagining, if it makes sense, this other one receiving these good wishes. Probably expression. Something. If it's helpful. Use words, or short phrases, to clarify these intentions of kindness, care, appreciation. I'll offer a few classic ones. Please feel free to use them or not use them at all. Modify them in your own language and words. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you know peace and joy. Flowing anywhere to choose. Perform a rhythm. Perhaps with the breath or not. Can be helpful to build concentration, stability by shortening phrases to just a word or two. Happy. Safe. Healthy. Peaceful. Free. Finding your own rhythm. Thank you. Time to time, tuning in to your own heart, sensations in your chat. Feeling how this practice is resonating. Feeling whatever it is. Feeling whatever it is. Feeling whatever it is. This other one. Expanding the field. Perhaps imagining them wishing you well in the same way. Whatever way feels natural. Making a loop even. Receiving beneficent intentions on the in breath. And metta on the out breath. And it feels right allowing now. And even if you wish them well. And perhaps feels right. May we be happy. Healthy. Peaceful. Joyful. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Focusing in. Good wishes. Sending out good wishes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now allowing the circle to expand a little bit more. Offering collectively and individually. Loving kindness, care, good wishes. And perhaps almost neutral one. Every part of the body and the merge like rays of the sun star. Receiving that word. Be safe. Happy. Healthy. Peaceful. Joyful. Great. Thank you. Thank you. And allowing now the expansion kindness, care. To flow as far out as it wants to go. Through every corner, every quarter of the heart and mind. Radiating out. Warming like sun and nourishing like rain. Everything in its path. Be safe. Happy. Healthy. Peaceful. Joyful. Happy. Happy. Happy. And allowing now the full of any images of others or intention of radiating outwards. And turning in to the feeling of metta in this body, this heart, this moment. Drinking it in these good intentions. Soaking in them. Massaging them with the breath. Or simply feeling this intention, this beautiful intention for the whole body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for the sincerity of your practice. Before we transition to the more common question-oriented part, the invitation is, if you're comfortable having video on, if you can have video on to do it, but video on or not, to wish well, send metta specifically to the other members of our Zoom Sangha tonight. Present or not present. To each of their tiles or their memories if they couldn't make it tonight. And as you're flipping through the screen to do that, knowing that you are receiving metta. Each of the people here in the Zoom room and perhaps asynchronously from people listening later. Be sure to include them in your metta too. And any of the later listeners. And then when you're ready, you can come back into contact. We do have a few moments for sharing. Any reflections that you would like to share any observations. Can you raise your Zoom hand or put it in the chat if you prefer. And if you chat me directly I will also read it and share anonymously if you prefer that. So I'll offer just a brief reflection, which is. Just like us, just like each of us. Everyone benefits from feelings of generosity, kindness, compassion, care. So in addition to offering your generosity, kindness and care, which is a very beautiful thing to do. There's also something generous about letting others show up for you. And allowing that, allowing the opportunity to be kind and generous. So any questions, comments about the meditation before we transition to a smaller format conversation. So we are moving into the portion of the evening for many people is their favorite. If it's not your favorite. You're welcome to stay in the main room. This is an optional participation. Welcome to stay in the main room and be quiet. We're going to create breakout rooms and invitation is to talk about how this practice or just practice in general has been a form of benefit or self care for you. And how you've noticed them impact your life, your practice life. That makes sense. Good. So we just clicking on options. I will see most of you in a little while. Thank you. Welcome back everybody. Welcome back in the room. How was it for you. Any reflections. Well, yes. Okay. Yeah, today was a really good coincidence coincidental time to join happy hour which I've done not very much recently. But I am very happy to be here recognizing how important it is for me to get more of a grasp of what kind of self discipline makes me feel like the day has been fulfilling. I feel like that for the first time in a long long time. And, yeah, it's just so true I feel crippled when I myself am not able to take care of myself. So that I've had a basically satisfying day. So, thank you, John. Thank you, Michelle for the kind words about the meditation. Neil, please. I really liked, you know, the reminder that everybody, you know, including the people who really great on my nerves, you know, have feelings and are important to themselves and presumably other people even if that's hard for me to imagine at times, you know, and, and in reality if not, then, then they need my care even more. So, yeah, I found. Yeah, I just found it very touching. Thank you, Neil. Yeah, it is hard to imagine you're very welcome and thank you as far to imagine. We've all got, or have had people we find difficult in our lives, right, either directly or indirectly in some way or another and. Yeah, it's hard to imagine and most of us, most of us are inextricably in webs of relationships. So, yeah, extending that care can only benefit you and declare it doesn't have to be, as you know, doesn't mean you have to do anything different. So we have been different showing up differently. And it might ripple out into actions, there are stories, yeah, she's transforming this way. I mean, I don't know that I'm going to have a transformative relationship with, with this person I was thinking about now but, but maybe I could be a little gentler when dealing with them. I'm going to set the bar low and go for it. Great. Yeah, set the bar where it needs to go. And, and from a perspective of this practice just notice the impact on your heart, even just the intention, right. Anybody else, comments, questions? Yes, Diana, please. At the end, when you were guiding us for the first time I really appreciated or understood and felt the offering meta to our group, to our Sangha, we've done this before and also individually, and they're like us and we all benefit and so forth. And you talked about allowing others to show up for us. That has been a concept the last few weeks it came up before in, in one of the meta groups as well, allowing others, and it just has so gotten to me because that's something I hardly, I just I'm closed up I don't think to do, I mean I wouldn't. I'm not racing around over achieving and isn't about that but opening the heart and allowing someone to, to, to offer to do something I could give four or five example that's happened in the last week or so, where I really needed it, and it relates to my opening up to another. And so there's, there's something going on. And, and so tonight we were offering met up to others. The idea that someone's offering method to me, I'm all that that's something new for me to digest. Thank you. And I'm so happy to hear that this is something that's emerging in your practice and you're emerging is a good word. Yes. Beautiful thing to be able to receive and it really is a gift to other people, especially other people who care about you. So we are at the top of the hour it's not great up on me. So, just warm thanks to each of you it's really a delight to be here and just to experience the sincerity of your practice and your meta. Know that you have been here. Some of you for a long long time. Now, practicing with each other, just, just my heart. So may all beings benefit from the goodness of our practice here together. May the big benefits ripple outwards through our lives and others lives until they go outwards and outwards on and on. May all beings be safe. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free. Take good care everyone. Thanks everyone. Bye.
