Practice Note: Confidence  as a 
Support for Practice

The practice of mindfulness in meditation is 
supported by confidence. Some people  use the 
word faith or trust. It  is supported by confidence 
because the mind’s attention will go where it has 
the most confidence.  
 
There is a way in which you can analyze or 
figure out what you have confidence in by 
noticing where your mind tends to go. Some 
people have a lot of confidence in planning 
because they spend a lot of time planning. 
Some people have a lot of confidence in fantasy 
because they seem to spend a lot of time 
fantasizing. Some people have a lot of 
confidence in reviewing conversation s from the 
past, trying to figure out a better past. Some 
people have a lot of confidence in discursive 
thinking. They are always thinking, thinking, 
thinking. Some people have a lot of confidence 
in their emotions because their mind just kind of zeroes in  to their emotional life. Every little 
emotional twitch is of tremendous significan ce, 
so there is a lot of confidence in the value of 
emotions.  
 
Where you place your  confidence is an 
interesting question. What do you have 
confidence in? In what way can you have 
greate r confidence in mindfulness, in 
attentiveness, i n being present for your present 
moment experience? Without some confidence 
in the value of being present for your life as it ’s 
being lived, it is hard for the mind to want  to be 
here in the li ved experience of the moment.  
 
As you go through the day today, practicing here  
this morning , you might ask yourself what you 
have confidence in. Can you evoke or awaken a 
healthy confidence in being present for your 
lived experience? As you do walking me ditation, 
as you are sitting, or whatever you are doing, 
what would give you confidence so that the mind 
can rest here  in this experience , not in 
yesterday, not in somewhere else, not in 
tomorrow?  
 
Maybe the idea of confidence can be a support 
for you as you practice here.
