 If it's all right with you all or with enough of you, I would like, I'm interested in spending the evening having a more open format to have either questions and answers or to have some discussion about some topic that seems interesting for you instead of the regular kind of more normal Dharma talk. So that's what I had in mind. You could change that, I can give a talk, but I think it's good for us to periodically kind of just get a sense of the concerns we have as a community or issues you might have about your own practice and discuss those. Yes. Well, following on the theme of this harvest dinner that we're having, which is sort of a pre-Thanksgiving opportunity for this. I'm wondering whether in the Buddhist tradition there are typical events related to thankfulness or particular practices around gratitude. I don't know really well a lot of the customs in Buddhist countries in Asia. I mean, they have a lot of the customs that we have in their own way, in Buddhist garb, in Buddhist ways. What I do know is that a lot of them are Buddhist holidays and they're very much tied for most people. Let's see. So there are Buddhist holidays. There's a celebration of Buddhist enlightenment, his birthday's enlightenment day. There's different days, kind of very sacred for holy or special for Buddhists in Southeast Asia, Theravada Buddhists. And there's various things that happen in these days. Sometimes there is big festival days and there'll be just huge festivals in the city streets. If you go to Thailand on the wrong day or the right day, depending on what you think, chances are you'll get wet. The people will douse you with water or throw water balloons at you or something. It's part of this big festival. But what I'm most familiar with is that a lot of these days and a lot of the ways in which more devout lay Buddhists celebrate them is they go to a Buddhist temple. They go to a Buddhist monastery. This often will spend the whole day there doing meditation or doing festivals or doing Dharma talks or various things they might do. And in terms of gratitude, there's a couple of things that come to mind. One is just last weekend, Tanisir Abhikkur, Tanjaf, at his what's called Katin, Katina ceremony, which around the same time, they're also having an Abhiyagiri. Every year at the monastics, the monks and nuns spend three months on retreat or three months set a put in their own monastery. They're not supposed to go traveling around, just to be in one place. And at the end of that three month period, there was a time where they have this festival with different ways in different places. And part of that festival is kind of the monastics, the monks and nuns asking for forgiveness for any ways in which they've transgressed during those three months that they've supposed to been put. And so it's kind of usually ritual form. They don't actually confess particular deeds, but they're kind of in a kind of ritual way. They say, you know, for all the ways in which I might have transgressed, I want to ask for forgiveness from the lay supporters who supported us during this time. And during this Katina ceremony, so it's also in addition to the forgiveness is this extension of gratitude that goes back and forth between the monastics and the lay people. And often the lay people will come then bearing gifts to the monastery. And often they'll give the monastery gets an abundant supply of toothpaste and soaps and the traditional gift to give is cloth so they can make ropes from, but also then given money and many things. But it's partly a ceremony. It's that expresses the gratitude all around or how people feel, you know, in relationship to like a harvest thing, the most Asian Buddhists and traditionally in Asia Buddhism has very much tied into whatever the local spirit worship might be. Most forms of most countries in Asia will have some more or less indigenous belief about the local spirits. And in India they had that and they have it in Thailand and Burma. They have it to some degree in China. They have in Japan. And so Buddhism just assimilates rather than rejects. So Buddhism stays long enough in America. It'll just probably just assimilate Christianity and, you know, but it doesn't, it doesn't, it tends not to, but it tends not to want to reject, exclude things, but rather find some ways to include things. And so far this in that indigenous culture has a spirit worship, which is about the spirit, the land, spirits of the trees, spirits of the mountains. Then at various times, the Buddhist will often in part of the monastic life will somehow express respect or gratitude or forgiveness, asking for forgiveness to the spirits. So when I was in the Zen monastery in Japan, Zen in the West is characterized as being very, I don't know if I'll say the right word, but kind of, it's Buddhism kind of pared down. And it's like, you know, it's, you know, it's a little extra. It's just, you know, you go into this very clear, clean, almost empty room and you practice and everything is just perfluous from life, you know, from religious life just dropped because Zen just gets right to the point, right? And there's nothing extra. And just right now, just as it is. Well, if you go to Japanese temples, Zen temples in Japan, there's a lot of extra. It's just abundant with it. In Zen temples in Japan, they celebrate, they have this, I went there, you know, we would do this monthly rituals, making offerings to the Hindu goddess for the Ganges River. What are we doing in this Japanese Zen temple honoring the Hindu goddess of the Ganges? Well, it's all incorporated and there's in built into, if you go to San Francisco Zen Center, for example, it's not explicit. But if you look in the corners of what they do there, there's all this complicated, you know, esoteric and exoteric Buddhist and non-Buddhist kind of strands of teachings and practices that go on there. You can spend years there and not know that it's part of it. But when I was in the monastery in Japan, at the beginning of a three-month training period, there was an explicit honoring and expression of gratitude to the spirits of the land upon which the monastery was built. Because you were kind of just, you kind of to kind of disturb them in order to kind of be there. And so you want to spend some time acknowledging that. Some people who would like to demythologize things will say, this is just, you know, we'll find some other, so this is a kind of mythological way of talking about our connection to nature and the wider life. And there's important ways in which to honor it. So that was a very long answer that didn't really get to the point that well. Yes? The issue of forgiveness is something sort of rattling around my mind. If somebody has done something which has offended you, how does one sort of forgive you at the same time, not walk them back with a naivety that would make you vulnerable to the same thing happening again? So forgiving, yet not forgetting, or managing that sort of difficult boundary of allowing someone back in, so sort of letting go of the call of resentment or unforgiveness, you know, at the same time being more weary. It's something I'm struggling with at the moment. Well, rather than being weary, you answered it yourself earlier when you said, forgiving but not forgetting. You're supposed to keep your goods common sense, you know, and your memory. And if someone has burned you a few times, and perhaps it's appropriate to forgive them, but not to forget, you know, and, you know, if it's like Charlie Brown writes, every fall, Lucy says, you know, you know, come on, I'll spot the football for you. And he never remembers. You know, he should say, well, he always believes that she's going to hold it there. And every year, she pulls the football up, and he goes landing on his back. So I think somehow remembering, and I think it's, you know, forgiveness is not meant to be a, certainly not meant to be a, it's not a pardoning or it's not a saying, or what you did didn't really happen, or what you did, you know, it's not excusing what the person has done. Forgiveness only works if there's a real, clear acknowledgement that there has been a transgression, has been a problem here. And if you don't clearly see that, then you're not going to learn the lessons of how to take care of yourself in the future. If it's a kind of just forgiving and forgetting. Yeah, please. Who's been telling you you're supposed to forgive? I mean, why do you think, why do you think that you should be interested in forgiving? Bingo. So forgiveness is not, forgiveness is only makes sense in my understanding of it. If you, oh, forgiveness only makes sense in my understanding of it. And I'm not an expert on forgiveness, but it only makes sense if you're feeling resentful. If there's some holding inside of you, there's that resentment inside of you, then forgiveness is the releasing of that resentment. And you do it as much for yourself as you do for the other person, the release of that resentment. So forgiveness is not excusing someone, it's not saying it was okay what you did, but it's kind of saying, I'm no longer going to keep my heart closed because of what you did. And so there's certain things that need to happen that makes it easier to make it easier for forgiveness. One of them is to know that the transgressions, the abuse has stopped. And there's been beautiful examples of people who have seemingly forgiven the unforgivable. Just probably if some of you saw in the Chronicle in Sunday, the story of, I don't know how to pronounce their last name, Beal, Buhl, Annie Buhl, Beal, Annie Beal. She was, I think she was a Stanford student. She was a Stanford student who some six years ago was murdered in South Africa. And she was down there trying to help during the time when the white supremacist government was running a place. And she was working with the local black communities. And there was a lot of anger towards whites and some of the local blacks didn't realize who she was and that she was there to help them. And so they killed her and they ended up in jail. And then her parents ended up going to South Africa and eventually forgiving and eventually hiring and becoming very close to her, their daughter's killers. And there's a lot of examples, phenomenal examples where people have actually gone out of their way to heal the anger, the hurt that they've had, and then extended themselves to help someone else in places like El Salvador and Guatemala. Phenomenal stories of forgiveness, of people, atrocious things that were happening. I think the process has a lot to do, it helps a lot. If you rather than focusing on the other person so much, you focus on what's going on inside of you and to find out where you're closed. And if you can understand that well, then I think forgiveness is probably easier. Yeah. I'm wondering if there are any practices or rituals for when you're ill and dying. Maybe just to kind of finish the talk about forgiveness. Maybe other people have questions in a while, but I was thinking of inviting this guy Fred Luskin to come and talk to us. You like that? He's going to give a talk Wednesday. You know him? I work with him. Oh. And he has a book coming out very soon. Yeah. So he wants to go around. He wants to go around. He's kind of available these days to go around. He's actually speaking Wednesday morning in Potohoa Valley from 10 to the press, the Presbyterian church at 10 to 12. So are there rituals and practices for death and dying? There's lots of them because that's one of the functions of at least Buddhist spirituality often is to be present and available at times of death and these important transitions. So much so that in Asia, sometimes Buddhism is associated with death and dying. In Japan, for example, Buddhism is often associated with Shintoism associated with birth, Christianity with weddings and Buddhism with funerals. It's true. I mean, you tell someone, you know, I was a Zen priest in Japan and I would tell someone that, you know, I'm a Zen priest and they thought that was really weird. I mean, that was, you know, it's like, I don't know what it'd be like because like someone coming to America and you ask them, what are you? And they would say, I don't know. What? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if they just came to mind. I don't know if it's all right, but it's like someone comes to America and say, what are you? And I'm an Amish. I decided to become an Amish and come to America study Amish. You know, the Amish religion, you know, it's like, I guess it's probably a great thing to do. Probably more of us should do it. But it would kind of be a, but anyway, so the question is death and dying. It's understood that one of the most important things you can do is practice mindfulness. So for the people who have a strong mindfulness practice, it's the most beneficial thing you could do. And one of the reasons to practice mindfulness and develop it as a real skill that you have under your belt is in preparation for when you're going to die. It's people who have very strong mindfulness practice. Nothing else is needed in terms of ritual or preparation. In some Buddhist countries, the more developed a person is in their spirituality, the less ritual they do for them as they're dying or once they're dead. If someone is, for example, a monk, if a monk in some countries like Korea, if it's an ordinary person, you might do a lot of ceremony, I've been told. If it's an ordinary monk, you do some ceremony. If it's, you know, a monk has been around for a long time, you do a bit less. And if someone is recognized as being kind of enlightened abbot, you're supposed to do almost nothing at all because they don't need it. One of the things that happens during dying besides mindfulness is a recollection of your own good deeds and good qualities. To remember and think about the good deeds and good qualities of your life is supposed to be very beneficial for that process of dying, in part because traditionally in Buddhism, what you think about, what's on your mind when you die, is one of the major conditioning factors for how you're going to get reborn. And so you want to be very careful what you do with your mind during those last period. And so often Buddhist teachers, monks and nuns will come to your bedside and ask you to remember the good deeds of your life or your good qualities or to remember things that kind of inspire the mind. So it's often a time when Buddhists will chant, the sacred chants in ways to inspire their mind, put it in a good frame of mind. They'll recollect the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, do various recollection practices. And some Buddhist, customs for some Buddhists is to, is at the foot of your bed, kind of like on the wall, you put a big painting of some sacred Buddhist. Image like the Buddha, for example. So you can be looking at that and that can kind of make for a more happier or more enlightened state of mind as you're dying. The idea of merit making is very important in Buddhism, so that making offerings is supposed to be very beneficial for this process of creating good conditions for your mind. But I was curious why you asked that question. I listened to a lecture yesterday at Greencloughs and they were talking about Sukhyarashim when he died. And I guess he said to somebody that he didn't want to die. And I was just thinking about it. And I just was thinking about my feelings of self and not self and trying to figure out, just trying to figure out things, you know, like my sense of self. And just trying to figure out that maybe it is attributed, it's more like my breath than the sense of real self. And thinking those questions about not having a self, but all these things that define us, that we define, the use to define ourselves, why it can all be broken down. So I was just wondering if you're lying there in bed, you know, dying, what do you do? Die. I think it's a good question. What do you do as you're lying dying? What do you do when you're lying there living? It's very much the same, I think. I mean, I haven't died that I remember. And some people have died, right? You died, right? I mean, you heard your heart stopped. Oh, yeah, several times. Sometimes your heart stopped. I guess you wasn't quite clinically dead, but sorry, I assume you shouldn't bring it up. I'll always speak on it. Sorry. That's for forgiveness. I guess, I guess the, you know, I think there's an altered state that one finds or goes through. And I think that what Gil said is true about the mindfulness and being prepares you maybe for that to be aware and not be frightened by what you see or go towards something you might notice, but just to be ever so present. And I do think that the positive states, the qualities of mind are really, really important as you make that transition. So I haven't, you know, I haven't that I remember and they've gone, you know, been aware of my own dying. But the, it's my faith that the, what happens in deep meditation is probably very comparable, very similar, maybe the same as what happens when you're dying. And in terms of having to let go, dying is partly letting go. You know, and so if you have the time to die slowly, there's kind of often kind of a slow letting go of many, much of our identity, many things we hold on to. And there are things that we'll hold on to very, very tightly when we have a lot of time to live, but they're easy to let go of when we're close to death. And then there's some things which are hard to let go of even close to death. And the same thing with a deep meditation is very hard to let go of some things which we really feel we need for security, for identity. And so if a person really does the meditation path really thoroughly, I think that they won't be afraid of dying because if, or when dying happens, they'll be familiar with the process. If dying happens slowly enough, if they're lucky and they can kind of be awake while they're dying. And one of the very common practices in Buddhism is a whole series of different kinds of practices having to do with contemplating death. So rather than just waiting for death to happen, a person will reflect on death in various ways. And not to be morbid about death, but partly to understand where we're attached today and to help us to free us up from these things. I believe that now that I'm starting to get a little bit older, it occurred to me that one of the reasons why the elders in our society as we get older, why we traditionally think they have a lot of wisdom, I used to think that it was because they lived a lot and it's been seen a lot and had a lot of experiences to call upon for their wisdom. So I think that's part of it. But I'm beginning to suspect that it has also something to do with the proximity to their own death as we get older. And there's a whole different perspective we have on what's really important in life when we reflect on life in contrast to death, to our death, the death around us. So it isn't just simply to wait until you die to do those kinds of practices. But really it's a matter of hopefully dealing and facing these things while we're still quite healthy. Yes. You mentioned what people do for somebody who's died ceremony or something in this country, and it seems like the ceremonies are more for the living that are in the pain of mourning. But what is it that per se a person who isn't that spiritually advanced, whatever the people would have more of a ceremony for them? Are they trying to, how are they trying to help the person or what is it they're trying to help them do in terms of moving on? Traditionally, there's a few different things that are done. One is that the transition can be very frightening for people. And there's a lot of places where as a consciousness leaves this life and somehow moves on, that there's a kind of transition period where things can be kind of rocky before you've kind of taken up birth someplace else. And the old habits of fear or greed might still be operating. And so to help a person with that transition so that they're attached to, maybe they can encourage them to let go of it. And what they're afraid of, encourage them not to be afraid, tell them it's okay. And so some of what happens during that transition, both before a person dies, as a person is going into death, you know, Buddhism, since Buddhism traditionally doesn't have this idea of, traditionally Buddhism has idea of rebirth, there isn't some definitive end because it's just a continuity of sorts. And so the process of taking care of the person as they're dying continues beyond when we think they're clinically dead here in the West. And it's encouraging them not to be afraid, encouraging them not to be attached, encouraging them to remember that which is most beautiful or most important. And for someone who's well practiced, you might encourage them to remember the light of enlightenment, the light of awakening, the freedom, the peace. For someone who hasn't had much experience with practice, you might encourage them to reflect more on qualities of generosity, of love, and things like that. Also, there's a tradition of sharing merit with the deceased. And this is a little bit controversial whether the Buddhist teachings really allow for this or not, whether the Buddha really taught this or not. But most Buddhists couldn't care less about the controversy, they just do it. So what this involves is a sharing of your merits. So those people who are still alive will do something meritorious, do something that's good. So the most common thing to do is to make an offering, to do Dhanana. And so often for a funeral ceremony, the family will invite monastics to the ceremony. And part of the reason the monastics are there is to be the recipients of donations because it's considered very meritorious to give to monastics. And then after you make a donation, then, so if you've survived and someone you know has died, you make the donation, you then have received good merit. And then you turn around and dedicate that merit to the person who has died. So most Buddhists don't think, most lay Buddhists kind of in the village level or something, don't think much more about how that works. It's just like, you know, of course it works, you know, and then there's other people who try to explain how this might work. And one of the ways they think it works is it isn't so much something you have that you give to the deceased, but in that you are rejoicing, you're happy and having done something good. The deceased somehow tunes into your happiness and that makes them happy and more relaxed and settles them a little bit. So those are the two things that I know about. Dick. I'm sorry, but I didn't want to be able to hear all the announcement of this man who's speaking in Portola Valley on Wednesday and couldn't catch his name and couldn't hear a lot of conversation. It's been carried out. Am I speaking too softly today? I wasn't so much yours as some of the other conversation would get a kind of I see when you hear that soft and directed towards markets. Can you go from the end on that? What's your name? Fred Luskin. Fred Luskin. And he's a researcher at Stanford who studies forgiveness. And he does a lot of interesting work teaching people forgiveness. And he's now written a book which is about to come out and he's giving a talk Wednesday morning in Portola Valley. I think it's $20 to hear him speak at the Presbyterian Church where we usually have our sitting Sunday morning, 10 to 12 o'clock. And it occurred to me to invite him to come and speak in our group one day. So maybe we will. Probably L U S K I N. Gil, since we're on the subject of forgiveness again and said some of the discussion might not have been heard in the book discussion group, we're reading Chance Allspers, Loving Finest. And it's just an incredibly relevant quote that I can read. Yeah. So the quote is, forgiveness does not mean condoning a harmful action or denying injustice or suffering. It should never be confused with being passive toward violation or abuse. Forgiveness is an inner relinquishment of guilt or resentment, both of which are devastating to us in the end. So that's kind of the discussion we had. Yes. In the summertime, a couple of Dharma talks you mentioned that one of the most important things to have was a goal. I did. I hope you chose a good one then. Yes. No, I was just I sort of struggled with that. You come up with a good one. Did you come up with a good one? Did you come up with a good goal? Yeah, it's sort of generic, but it was sort of artificial. I sort of felt lost really in a way, whenever you said that both times. What was the context for saying that? Or maybe someone else remembers. It's important to have an intention is very important. Intention, I guess, is closely connected to go. Buddhist spirituality puts a tremendous emphasis on intention that our intent, one of the ways to discern whether our acts or actions are to... One of the ways to make decisions in Buddhism is to look at what is our intention behind what we want to do. Is it motivated by intentions of greed or is it motivated by intentions of generosity, for example? And to be very careful about the intention that is coming into play and to reflect on our intention. I also often talk about how important it is to look at our deepest intention. What's the deepest intention for our lives? And what's the operating intention? Because it's one thing to have a deep intention and it's another thing to actually live by it. And like you can imagine anthropologists from Mars, a Martian comes to the earth and studies you and kind of follows you around and sees every... And it doesn't speak your language or anything, but just kind of sees all the things you do and they go back and report, oh, Ken, you know what? It seems like his whole life is based on... I don't know what you do, but watching videos and going to McDonald's. Whereas they see you and they come down from the earth on a different day and they see, his whole life is based on being kind and helping his neighbors and friends. But we can have an intention to be kind, we can have an intention to be better people, we can have an intention to become more compassionate, loving, we can have the intention to become freer, or we cannot. And to find out what our intention is that we base our life on is very important. There's always something we base our life on. And if we don't reflect very deeply about this, then it's often very surface motivation that runs our lives, kind of gratification in the moment, or the messages from society kind of infiltrate into us and we kind of become other people's intention rather than our own. So I might have said that rather than goal, maybe goal and intention are closely linked. They are, I suppose. Do you want to come back with more? Do you want to say, yeah, because it probably wasn't necessary. No, I understand what you mean. No, I didn't say what you meant, but I thought, no, I was supposed to have some type of goal in my practice or anything. So this makes much more sense. The issue of goal and practice is an important one. You find different Buddhist teachers taking different positions about the role of a goal in Buddhist practice. My early Buddhist practice was in Zen Buddhism in the Suzuki Roshi lineage, and it was very clear there, the message that there should be no goal when you practice. And to go this practice, as soon as you have a goal for your practice, then your practice was off. And if you really want to wake up and be free, you can't have any goal. It's fully being present for how things are right now as they are. To have a goal means you're somehow concerned with what's in the future, and then you miss the present because of that. Other teachers put a tremendous emphasis on goal. It's inconceivable for them that practice is about having no goal at all. In fact, this is all about a goal, the goal of nirvana, full awakening. When I was in Burma, my teacher would end these interviews with me and said, Gil, strive for nirvana. That's kind of like really having a goal. Suzuki Roshi never would have said strive for nirvana. He would have said nirvana is right here or something. So then the question is, are these very radically different messages or are they different perspectives about the same thing? And one of the ways to reconcile this is that I find very helpful, is that it can be very appropriate to have certain goals in our lives. How we hold those goals is very important. You can be filled with attachment towards the goal. That goal could be tied into all kinds of neurotic senses of self-identity. If I get this goal, if I'm the first one I'm the first one I block to get enlightened, then I'll be popular at parties. People recognize that I'm really cool. There's all kinds of reasons that are extra around why a person might have a goal. So you have to be careful about how we hold the goal, what our relationship is to it. But there are different levels to our activity in a sense. If you think of ourselves as being concentric circles. So if say, for example, you want to, it's really important for you to get enlightened, to really have that freedom that's possible with the nirvana. And so that's what gets you to come to meditation retreat, what gets you on the cushion. However, once you're on the cushion, you have to forget about your goal because then the goal is going to get in the way. But the goal got you to the cushion. So there's kind of like in the widest circle of how we organize our life, certain goals can be very useful. But when we get down to actually doing the practice moment by moment, it's very important to know that then you have to let go of any notion of a goal. So that heals that division a little bit. It allows for both, you know, in different contexts, it allows, you know, for both having a goal and having no goal. But you have to be very careful with goals. Intention is a little bit safer. They overlap. So yes. So if your intentions are in conflict with the situation, so, you know, and your intention would be, you know, for the better benefit of this person or this situation, you know, of all things that are involved in it. But suppose, I don't know, suppose the way that you choose to carry that out is not mean, it's friends in the conflict or it's not exactly what they want. Yeah, I don't know how to answer that. It's very, you know, of course, it's very dangerous to have ideas of what other people should be like or have. I think that maybe one way of looking at this is to scratch underneath the surface of that intention, see if you can get deeper into the intention and see not what the intention is in terms of what the result you want in terms of some world, some change in the world, but rather what is the motivation within you for wanting that to be that way? Are you being motivated? So maybe you want the person to be happier in some ways, but what's motivating you to want that intention for that person? Is it because you're afraid for that person? Are you afraid of yourself? Is it for self-identity? Is it because you're uncomfortable yourself in some aversion to the unpleasant situation? So the exercise in mindfulness is always try to come back as deeply and personally as you can. What is it as motivating you in the situation rather than what you want for the situation? Can you see the difference between that? And the situation is, you know, that's complex. Well, I hope this was very nice for me to hear from you, to hear the kind of concerns you have and questions you have. And I hope that it was interesting enough for all the rest of you instead of having a regular talk. And we did this yesterday also in Putala Valley, we did questions and answers. And part of my, it was a little bit more on my mind yesterday than it was today, but part of my idea of doing this is just kind of being open to whatever might come up out of discussion, is I'm actually still quite concerned about how individuals here and we as a community are handling the whole thing of war and terrorism and the economy and job losses. And as I've said maybe last week, that there's more anxiety now. I feel more anxiety in our community, in our particular meditation community than I've ever felt in the 11 years I've been teaching. And people come here partly as a resource and during time of stress and difficulty. And so maybe I should have made it more explicit at the beginning that there were that was one possibilities from that direction. But if any of you feel like you have like our community or like somewhat within our community for us to have some kind of meeting or gathering or maybe outside of Monday or Sunday or Thursday, maybe in one of these normal sittings to look at this, these issues and our feelings and practicing with it, let me know. And then we can see about maybe organizing something at some point. Yes. I just went to a meeting yesterday where people were really focused on terrorism. What I found was we were so happy to go back to again because we talked about it a lot when it first happened and then after it was in that person and then took a break and going back to again felt really deep. I still really crying and I just there's a lot of feeling there. Yeah. Maybe to try to keep coming back to it. I think it's very, I think I hear exactly you spoke very well. And one of my concerns kind of is the person who's kind of trying to main person trying to figure out how to do our Mondays and Sundays and stuff is I'm aware with large group like this, there's a lot of very varied needs that people have. And some people very much want to come to a community like this and come to process what's going on. And some people, this is the last place they want to process because this is the refuge of just being quiet and being silent and so there's a kind of desperate needs in a community like us. So that always clear to me which is most useful for us to how to what's most useful to address.
