 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So today I'm traveling over the yesterday and today, and I stayed overnight at a friend's house, which is where I am this morning, and they have a completely beautiful home. They've lived here for a long time, and it's grown to be a space with a lot of love and care in it, and it seems like everywhere the eye falls, there's some beautiful thing that they've brought from somewhere and used to decorate the place. So I think it's the perfect setting for our topic this week of desire and letting go. Yesterday we talked about sense pleasure and sense desire, and I find it intriguing how people hear the Buddha's teachings about this, how they hear it compared to what the teachings actually say. And what the teachings say is that these things, simply that these things are not ultimately satisfying and that they're not the deepest form of human happiness. Whereas what people tend to hear is they hear judgment or right and wrong or some directive to stop enjoying things or to get rid of things. That's an interesting reaction to explore in your mind. So being here in this beautiful place is the perfect setting to talk about renunciation, which is today's topic. So yesterday we talked about how not only the Buddha's teachings, but also our practice enables us to see that sense desire and sensual pleasures are not all that they're cracked up to be. You know, they're not ultimately satisfying. And the word, as we said, for this whole sense domain that we humans find so enticing is kama, the long A, kama. So the Buddha also talked about a term called makama, and that is the word that's usually translated as renunciation. But please hold on to your associations with that word. It's going to be a little bit different. So it's an interesting word, nakama. Nakama can be resolved into its linguistic roots in two different ways. One of them is near plus kama, the negation of kama, essentially. So that would mean something like restraint of sensual desire, doing so out of wisdom. We'll talk about that in a moment. And then another way to resolve it is nis plus kama-ti, which is a verb, and the verbal form would be nikama-ti, which means something like walk away from. And the related noun, nakama, would mean leaving a life of pursuing sensual pleasures or more abstractly turning away from greed, hatred and delusion. And it may be that there's a play on words, and both of those meanings are intended in the word nakama. So it's interesting, right, because the first meaning of opposing sense pleasure tends to invite our common association of renunciation with grim austerity. And then the second meaning of about letting go of greed, hatred and delusion, well, that's the aim of the Buddhist path. That's very inspiring, and it's what peace and the deepest happiness are. So there seems to be something of a contrast, maybe in our associations. So we see that we're going to have to maybe release our English, our associations with the English word renunciation. So let's see more carefully where this word nakama is used in the Buddhist teachings and how the Buddha meant that word. So we're talking today about two triads, two sets of three of qualities that are contrasting each other. They're almost opposing each other. And one of them is an unskillful triad or unwholesome, and the other is a skillful triad of qualities. So in the unskillful one, kama is put together with ill will and cruelty. So we have sense, desire, ill will and cruelty linked together on one side. So as we saw yesterday, sense, desire and pleasure don't come off too well. Buddhist teachings, they're linked to ill will and cruelty. And then the skillful one is the opposite. It's nakama or renunciation and non ill will and non cruelty. So we see that renunciation, which we could also call letting go, is connected with qualities of care and kindness, the absence of ill will and cruelty. So this is where we have to suspend our common Western associations with renunciation. It's different in Buddhism. I don't think that there's a single, maybe a better single word to translate the word nakama. If I had to translate it as one single word, okay, probably renunciation is good. But the range of meaning is different in the dharma than it is in our common associations. So these two triads in the teachings, these two sets of three are connected to some important activities of our mind is connected to intentions, thoughts and perceptions. So that's when those are important movements of mind. So, for example, in the eightfold path, the second step is wise intention or right intention or appropriate intention. And the definition, the very definition of wise intention is the intention of renunciation, the intention of non ill will and the intention of non cruelty. That's the definition. So it's the second step of the eightfold path. And then there's also a suta where the Buddha talks about this is before his awakening. He talks about how he looked at his own thoughts. So we're now looking at thoughts rather than intentions. And I want to read a section from that suta. He says, as I abide in this diligent, ardent and resolute, a thought of sensual desire and the word is common there arose in me. I understood this thought of sensual desire has arisen in me. This leads to my own affliction to others affliction into the affliction of both. It obstructs wisdom causes difficulty and leads away from the banner. And then he says a thought of renunciation has arisen in me, me, comma, this does not lead to my own affliction or to others affliction or to the affliction of both. It aids wisdom does not cause difficulties and leads to me, Bono. And then there are other suits suit us that mention that sensual thoughts have a kind of a blinding or obscuring qualities to them. Whereas renunciation thoughts remove blindness and produce vision and have sort of openness and clarity to them. And sometimes, as I said, that triad applies to perceptions, Sonia, instead of thoughts. So. So it's interesting. We'll have to check for ourselves if that's really true. But it does seem to me that when my thoughts are very much caught up in things that I want or even things that I enjoy, there's a little bit of narrowing a little bit of. Yeah, of obstruction in some way. Whereas when I even if I'm in the presence of things that are beautiful, I am here in this house. If it's not a sense of grasping onto it, then there's just a feeling of openness and clarity. I can see those things. And in my mind is still wise. So the the suit that I just read about thought also includes a famous line that some of you may have heard it's even quoted out of context in other traditions. It says, whatever a person frequently thinks and ponders upon, that becomes the inclination of their mind. So that suggests that renunciation, this word nikama can become a beneficial predisposition of the mind, if you will. So I like to name nikama as an attitude. That's a word I'm trying to choose to capture intentions, thoughts and perceptions, is that we could have an attitude of nikama. And what does that mean practically? Maybe what it would mean is that we would walk around the world with the view or the idea that situations are opportunities to release the binding of unhelpful desires. So just to be to give a concrete example, suppose we find ourselves struggling in some way. We are irritated by somebody or we're frustrated that we can't get something to work or we're impatient, we're waiting for something to happen and it's not coming. So we're struggling in some way. And if we have mindfulness at that moment and we realize, I'm struggling right now, maybe the thought would occur. What would I have to let go of to make this easier? So that would be the attitude of renunciation. What would I have to let go of to make this easier? This is vastly different from the approach of most people or in most situations. So instead of wishing for that thing that I'm trying to get or that result that I'm trying to create, we would realize that our desire for ease or for peace or for not struggling is more important in that moment. Maybe we realize that we'd rather figure out how to help someone then try to get them to be the way we want them to be. So this attitude of renunciation helps redirect our mind in helpful ways. If we were to live by this attitude of letting go of things that are not helpful, letting go of unbeneficial desires, the effect of that is to gradually elevate our desires. Remember when we talked about the diversity of desires, there were five and the fourth and fifth kinds I named were kind of the elevated human desires, the desire to help others, the desire to be ethical, and eventually the desire to be free. These are the helpful desires that support the spiritual path. So renunciation, the attitude of letting go, moves the mind toward the more beneficial kinds of desire. If we can't let go of sense desire and sense pleasure and sort of ordinary wishes that the mind comes up with, I would suggest that we're not going to be able to fully realize the better forms of happiness that are available for humans. We have to let go of one to get the one that's better. So in the texts, in the Buddhist teachings, the affective or emotional quality that's associated with nikama is described in terms that are clearly positive. So the words for it are things like delight, happiness, even bliss. I want to read just a couple of examples. So here's one. There are these two kinds of happiness. What two? Sensual happiness and the happiness of renunciation. Of these two kinds of happiness, the happiness of renunciation is the foremost. So that's a fairly just a straightforward kind of prose description of it. And then there's also I want to offer also a verse. It says, even the gods envy the awakened ones, the mindful ones, the wise ones who are intent on meditation and delight in peace of renunciation. How about that? Even the gods envy those who know how to delight in the peace of renunciation. So this word renunciation, I hope what we're doing is reshaping our ideas about it, how it's used in the Buddhist teachings may not be what your gut reaction to it is. And to see that there's there are choices about which pleasures we go for. And the ones in the sense domain are real enough. We have them. We may be surrounded by them. And there are options that are better and we can incline the mind toward them by having this willingness to let go this willingness to be open, which is also associated, of course, with non ill will and non cruelty. So good things, good ways for the mind to be directed. So thank you. And we'll continue our exploration tomorrow.
