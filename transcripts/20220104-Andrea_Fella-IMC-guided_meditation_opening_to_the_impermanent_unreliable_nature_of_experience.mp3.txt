Just what's happening in this moment. 
Just allowing yourself to arrive with yourself in a gentle way. 
Remembering experience in the present moment. 
Remembering, connecting with the experience of body in the present moment. 
Physical sensation in the body. 
Touch sensation. 
Sound. 
Perhaps sight. 
Maybe smell or taste. 
Just aware, connecting with the body. 
Receiving the body as it is showing up in this moment. 
Letting the body show itself to you. 
What wants to show up, what wants to be seen, be known. 
Maybe physical sensation of touch for a few moments and then sound. 
Sound. 
In a receptive mode, like a mirror, mindfulness can just simply reflect whatever is showing up. 
We don't have to choose or direct or aim the attention anywhere. 
Just receiving, allowing, being with. 
Or may also be mental experience, moods, thoughts, emotions. 
Perhaps at times these become what the attention knows, receives, what awareness receives. 
At times, for some of us, it can feel simpler and more easeful to stay connected in the present moment. 
If we do choose some area or field of experience to settle the attention with, such as the experience of breathing, or the experience of hearing, or maybe more broadly, the experience of the whole body. 
And yet even in that field, there will be dynamic, changing experience. 
The breath comes in and out, sensations change. 
And so receiving how that experience is showing up. 
In the field of hearing, we never know what the next sound will be. 
And so receiving, receiving the changing dynamic quality of this human experience. 
Whether in a broader field of the full range of human experience or a narrower one, such as the experience of breathing, the experience changes. 
Sometimes it is experienced as a flow of change, smooth shifting, sometimes as a jumpy experience. 
One thing and then suddenly another one pops in. 
Things might feel like they last for a little while and then shift, or the change may feel pretty rapid. 
How is it for you? Just curious about your own experience. 
All that is happening in a moment is these processes of our body and mind coming into being and falling apart, shifting and changing. 
Can we know this human experience, this impermanent human experience, shifting and changing human experience without judging it, without criticizing it, without wanting it to be otherwise? And if there is some wanting it to be otherwise happening, that too is just an arising. 
Oh, wanting it to be otherwise is happening, that too can be known, understood as an impermanent phenomenon. 
Receiving just this moment's experience. 
Body experience. 
Experience of the mind. 
Open to the changing nature of experience. 
All experience, all conditioned phenomena are impermanent. 
Because they are impermanent, they are unreliable as a place to find lasting happiness. 
We so want to find something reliable, that very searching for reliable. 
It's not possible to find the reliable, and so that project is doomed. 
And yet the Buddha understood that it was the ending of that searching for reliability, where the deepest happiness can be found. 
And yet it's a very deep craving inside of us to find that reliability, and so that too, wanting something reliable as a happening, as an arising, that too can be known, just understood. 
As an also impermanent phenomenon. 
When that craving ends, sometimes we can feel it in the moment. 
When that craving ends, and we get a taste of a deeper kind of ease and peace that's possible, and we aren't fighting with this truth, that experience is impermanent and unreliable. 
Just meeting experience. 
This moment, noticing it's changing nature, and noticing our relationship to that changing nature. 
Are we at ease with it? Do we want it to be otherwise? Recognizing that too as just a phenomenon. 
Ease is arising. 
Wanting it to be otherwise is arising. 
Just receiving each moment, moment after moment. 
Ease is arising. 
Wanting it to be otherwise is arising. 
Wanting it to be otherwise.
