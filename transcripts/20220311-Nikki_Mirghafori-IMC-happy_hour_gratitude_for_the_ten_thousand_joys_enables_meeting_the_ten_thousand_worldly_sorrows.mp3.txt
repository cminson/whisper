The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Here we go. Okay, so hello and welcome everyone to Happy Hour. Lovely to be with
you. So for today's practice, I'd like to invite us to hold both the sorrows and
the joys of the world. It is said that there are 10,000 joys and 10,000
sorrows. And at times when it seems like the political landscape or the world
landscape of the geopolitical landscape is so dire, our minds turn to what is
pained for, what is difficult, all the suffering in the world and the people.
Yes, there is a lot of suffering in the world right now that we hold with care,
with compassion, we turn towards, we don't turn away. And in order to support
being able to turn more towards difficulty, sadness, with compassion, it is helpful to
resource ourselves, our hearts with gratitude for what is good in the world, in
our lives, for the people we care about and love, in order to resource ourselves so
that challenges, pain, difficulties, sorrow, grief, it is not the measure of all
our waking hours. It can be so difficult and draining and not helpful, not helpful
for anyone if we are not resourced to be able to hold and hold witness and support
and do what we can in the world. So if we are unsettled, if we are toppled over,
it doesn't help anyone, it doesn't help us, it doesn't help our loved ones and anyone
in the world. So it is helpful to have that sense of balance. And this past week, we
practiced with equanimity, we practiced with equanimity and compassion, we practiced
with stability and compassion, just different ways to bring stability to our
practice of compassion. And tonight, I'd like to extend that and actually invite
us to dare to have the courage to practice gratitude and joy in order to
balance, in order to support the compassion, the pain, the difficulty in the
world. It's not about turning away, it's not about, I'm just going to be happy and
poliana, that's not the idea, you know this, I know you know this, but I'll
still like to say it, that it's not about turning away, it's skillfully using
skillful means to be balanced, to be resourced, to be filled with stability,
gladness, joy so that we can contain, so that we're available for more
compassion in the world, so that we don't have what's called empathy fatigue or
empathy distress, empathetic distress. So that's the invitation to engage with
gratitude, with joy tonight and not feel guilty or bad that there are people
suffering in the world, yes, and there's also joy in the world and it's okay, it's
okay to honor both, it's okay in our humanity to embrace both, to honor
both. So not turning away from either honoring both, appreciating both,
really shifting the perspective, the perspective, really an awakened
perspective that allows both joy and sorrows, all of that to be just as it is,
just as it is without toppling over. So in this practice tonight, it's an
invitation to shift, to shift our perspective in that way. So let's enter
our meditation posture practice together and whatever you need, I'll share with
you in the guided meditation. So if you need to sit, shift, lie down, even
stand, see what your body needs in this moment. And perhaps, if you feel comfortable
closing your eyes in this moment, turning your gaze inward, letting go,
releasing, releasing, releasing, what's not helpful in this moment, thoughts,
worries, preoccupations, and giving our heart, giving our heart, our awareness,
fully, heartfully, to the inner world for a moment, just settle, just to settle
and arrive. Feeling our feet on the floor, stable, grounded, the bottom of
our feet, like a well-rooted tree, releasing into our legs, the upper
legs, lower legs and feet, let them be grounded, let them be heavy, enjoying
the sensations of the legs of the feet, not a privilege to be taken for granted.
Feeling the sensations of the sit bones, your bottom on the cushion or the chair,
contact points, releasing, releasing the weight of your upper body into your sit
bones. If there's any tension in the upper body,
neck, shoulders, your forehead, jaw, chest, abdomen, let them be released,
smilingly released, going the breath to move freely through the body, it's the
life-giving breath, like a lullaby, like a lullaby, calming soothing, each and
every breath, every out-breath, there, there, there, there, there, there, there,
There, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there,
And as thoughts arise, as they will arise, it's okay, simply noticing when a thought
has arisen and smilingly thanking, thank you, and not now, please come back later.
Now I'm giving myself, my heart, wholeheartedly to this practice, taking refuge in this moment.
No need for criticism or judgment, just releasing smilingly, and letting there be a
sense of appreciation for this breath, this in-breath, this out-breath, releasing, relaxing the body.
Maybe there is an area of the body that feels good, content, peaceful, warm,
stable, relaxed, any of those qualities, let yourself enjoy.
Maybe there is an area that feels like a warm, sunny day, maybe your hands,
maybe your cheeks, your feet, or your breath in the abdomen.
The simple blessing of the warm, sunny day, the sun,
filled in your body,
maybe in your heart, heart center.
Let there be enjoyment, let yourself relish.
Let your heart be full of this goodness, open up to it.
If any hesitation or fear arises, say thank you.
Thank you, dear protective qualities, emotions, not needed right now.
This is safe, it's trustworthy, in this moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You
feel your body be nourished in your heart. I appreciate the goodness, the simplicity
of just sitting and being breathed, the sensations of this body, the stillness, the groundedness,
the spaciousness within, the heart center as if your breath is expanding inside.
Do not shy away from tasting how delicious it might be to just sit and
be breathed.
If you have ever seen a butterfly in the sun,
opening, closing its wing rhythmically, warming itself, the grace, the beauty,
the colorfulness of the wings, the motion, your breath too is beautiful, rhythmic,
warming of your wings in the sun, of your beautiful wings in the sun,
wings of awareness,
riding on the breath.
That there be this inner nourishment with the breath,
enjoying what's comfortable, what's beautiful inside.
And it's the joy of the mind being quiet and still, deliciously for a few breaths,
taking refuge in silence and peace.
Simple gratitude for this breath.
Now for this breath, and then again for this breath, see what happens if you
keep being grateful for each breath, each new breath, see what happens when it builds up.
Now for this breath, see what happens when it builds up.
Can there be gratitude, appreciation for knowing, for awareness, for knowing, for awareness,
for knowing, for awareness, this amazing, indescribable ability to know, to be aware of sensations,
of thoughts, of the breath, of sounds, this amazing miracle, miracle that we all have or
privy to have the privilege of, which we can't turn off, can't turn on, it just is.
Can there be sense of appreciation or awe, gratitude for the gift of knowing,
indescribable in being human,
feeling, the gift of feeling, sensing, knowing.
Can there be a sense of appreciation?
Can there be a sense of appreciation for the Sangha supporting you,
practicing together with others, the goodness, the goodness of this web, invisible web of humanity,
supporting us,
the people we know, the people we don't, coming together.
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for others' support and participation,
letting the goodness of that in.
Is there something that you're grateful for today, maybe in this moment or today or this past week?
Be your heart open and appreciate deeply relish as if you're polishing a sacred stone.
Stay with it, stay with this appreciation.
Let it bring a smile to your face and ease to your heart, gladness, joy to your heart.
Let your heart feel expansive and gratitude and joy for this blessing.
This blessing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can you be glad for your own gladness, for your own good fortune?
Can you be glad for your own gladness?
Can you be glad for this blessing in your life, for yourself, as if you're stepping out of yourself?
Feel free to bring to mind another blessing, maybe someone in your life, maybe a friendship,
or family member, or a gift of some kind, another one if you wish, or you can stay with this one.
Whatever expands your heart, enjoy in gladness.
Thank you.
Staying embodied, feeling your body, the breath, the groundedness of the feet, the hands,
while allowing your heart to feel expansive and relishing goodness, gratitude, and blessings.
For the last minutes of this practice period, letting our hearts be expansive.
As we can contain more joy, we have more space to meet with compassion, sorrow, and grief in the world.
So offering the gift of our joy to ourselves, to the world as a blessing, as an empowerment,
to support us, to serve others, deeply bowing in our hearts with gratitude for the blessings,
for the joys, and allowing there to be alignment to serve.
The best way we can serve others in their joy and their sorrows.
May all beings everywhere be safe, happy, healthy, at ease.
May all beings everywhere have joy, including ourselves.
May they be free.
Thank you for your practice everyone.
I hope there are at least a few mind moments of joy, of gladness, of expansiveness, of stability,
or maybe even a smile or two showed up on your face, I hope.
So I'd like to open the space for any reflections you'd like to share as a gift to others, maybe in a ha moment,
something that opened up or something that was challenging, it's okay too, of course.
Especially if you haven't spoken for a while or shared, please feel free to raise your zoom hand.
If it's your physical hand, I won't see you.
Raise your zoom hand, you can type in chat, it's typed to everyone.
I will read your name, if it's typed just to me, privately, it's only your reflection.
Charles, please.
Oh, thank you.
Hi everybody.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Okay, great, great.
Yeah, just the phrase being breathed really opened things up for me.
And I don't have words for it, but it just felt so caring and so like it was being held, I don't know, held by the air, held by the atmosphere.
Just really beautiful, so thank you.
Thank you, Charlie.
So moved by your sharing, by your report.
Yeah, the way you felt held and carried is really permeating, resonating through the peace of your words, of the space you're in.
And that carries me into it more deeply, so thank you for that.
Beautiful, thank you for your practice, Charlie.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
Ah, Phazelle says, thank you very much, it was perfect after a long stressful day, a reset to a mindset of gratitude.
Ah, thank you.
Phazelle, thank you for those words.
And Larry says, you led me into my clenched heart and allowed me to play around in there.
Ah, thank you, Larry, for being led into your clenched heart and playing around there, like a butterfly spreading your wings.
Thank you all for your practice, so beautiful, and your sharing too.
Any other reflections, questions, comments, complaints?
Before we turn into holding each other.
Deborah says, thank you for helping me notice all the many wonderful people and moments in the day.
Ah, thank you, Deborah.
I am touched with that reflection, all the wonderful people and moments, so many of them.
It's amazing being human.
Even if there are sufferings, challenges, pain, difficulties still, there's just this blessing, this blessing.
There's so much blessing, even in the midst of challenges.
So thank you for your practice, everyone.
If there are no more reflections, I'd like to invite us to share in small groups and sharing our joy, sharing our gratitude.
It's actually such a beautiful practice.
The invitation tonight is after about 15 seconds of silent metta for ourselves, for others, is to go around, go around, round and round and round.
So the first person shares something they're grateful for, something in their life.
Maybe in the moment, maybe it's just as simple as, ah, I had a moment to sit and be breathed tonight.
And then the next person shares a nugget, something they're grateful for.
And then the next person shares a nugget.
So this way, we go around, round, round, round robin.
So the one person sharing a monologue, it's more of sharing a nugget.
This format is called the spiral because we keep going around and increasing joy.
And it's so nourishing to hold each other people's joy, just hearing what they're grateful for.
It brings us joy.
Notice that the medita, the vicarious joy that can come up.
It's so nourishing.
It can be so lovely.
So, so I'm creating the rooms and, um, yeah, take care of yourselves.
Take care of, take care of each other.
And, um, yeah, let's, I'm going to open the rooms.
Take care. Here we go.
You
You
You
You
The rooms are closed.
Everybody is back.
Welcome back, everyone.
I see folks smiling.
This is sweet.
So, um, we have a couple of minutes for any reflection.
So what happened?
What did you notice?
Especially those who are smiling.
We'd love to hear from you.
Yes, person who's on the phone, please.
Michael, is that Michael?
Uh, you're there.
Now you're unmuted.
Okay.
Now I'm unmuted.
Pardon me.
I am so grateful for the prompt and the teaching this evening.
I think this was really rich.
And I'd love to be able to do it like once a week.
The problem of going, uh, and around Robin for things that, uh,
we're grateful for bring us joy.
What was that like for you tonight in the round Robin?
Michael.
Uplifting.
Yeah.
Watered my happiness seeds.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Watered my happiness seeds.
I love that.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Thank you for that, Michael.
Love it.
Watered my happiness seeds.
Oh, may your happiness seeds always be watered.
This is so great.
I love it.
Maybe since you requested, maybe I will bring in more joy.
Maybe once a week.
Maybe we will do joy for a while.
That's kind of fun.
Right.
Can't have enough joy and gratitude.
Thanks for that request, Michael.
Fuzzle says we laughed a lot.
Oh, that's great.
That's very sweet.
That makes me happy.
Any other reflections?
We want one other reflection.
Anybody wants to share?
Catherine says the things other people share prompted me to think of other
things I am grateful for.
Oh, that is great.
Isn't that awesome?
That's so fantastic.
Peggy says grateful for my little group that so reminds me of the
prevalence of good kind people in the world.
That's sweet.
Tess says my heart felt full.
Yeah, that's great.
Yeah.
So, oh, yes, and I see Neil.
Neil, you get to have the last word, my dear.
I just want to say I am just so grateful for, you know, for you,
Nicky, for Diana, these classes and the Senga.
You know, it is such a big part of my life.
And, and, and yeah.
Thank you, Neil.
And, and we feel grateful for you.
All of you.
And, and since you spoke, I'll make it personal, especially you,
because you offer so much support to the Sanga as, as a regular member.
I see people are nodding, appreciating you and, and you help
support the mailing list, not to make you blush right now.
But if you're blushing, it's okay, please take in the appreciation
and the goodness from, from me and Diane from the whole Sanga.
And so thank you, Neil.
And also for that beautiful reflection.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And thank you all.
Katrin says echoing Neil.
Yeah.
And thank you, Neil.
Exactly.
Thank you.
Thank you for your practice.
Thank you for your beautiful practice for showing up for supporting
yourselves, each other, us.
Just, it's such a mutual goodness co-created in the world.
Happy hour.
It makes me happy every time.
So thank you.
Deep gratitude to all, all of you and all the causes, conditions.
May we all be happy, joyous and free and all beings everywhere as well.
Oops.
Thank you all.
