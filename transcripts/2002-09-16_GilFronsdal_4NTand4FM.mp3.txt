 So what I'd like to do this evening is to relate two very important practices or teachings of the Buddha. And so on one hand we have the teaching of the Four Noble Truths, and then on the other hand we have the teaching of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And the Four Foundations of Mindfulness refers to a particular teaching of the Buddha from a particular discourse the Buddha gave called Discourse in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which that discourse is then the source for Vipassana. For most forms of Vipassana taught in both in Asia and in America, they trace the origins back to this particular discourse. And sometimes you can't necessarily see how they're connected, but the inspiration, the basic idea of Vipassana practice comes from this discourse. And then people have chosen different parts or chose to interpret different ways or developed in different ways. And you have all the different schools of modern Vipassana derived from this discourse. So I want to bring these two together. And in fact, the two are brought together in the discourse on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness in that the practice of understanding our life through the Four Noble Truths is offered at the very end of the discourse. And I'd like to offer you my interpretation, or at least one understanding, one perspective, and why it appears at the end of the discourse. So one of the remarkable things I believe about Buddhism, I think there's a number of remarkable things, but one is that it's a religious or spiritual tradition which presents its teachings, its practices, without requiring people to adhere to any kind of supernatural, mythological tenants, beliefs. So you don't have to believe in a god or a godhead, or there's all these kind of, some idea about ultimate realities about, there's all these ideas that different religious traditions have that are kind of articles of faith. And if you're not really brought up in a particular tradition, it's often very hard to believe in the particular articles of faith that a tradition's in. If you grew up in a tradition, it just seems completely obvious that this is the way nature was, or the world was, is. But it's still an article of faith. And the remarkable thing about the Buddhist tradition, you're welcome to argue against me that I have a wrong view here, but that in the Buddhist tradition, it offers a spiritual practice without offering any kind of real metaphysical or abstract, or articles of faith that you have to believe in, or for the rest of the system to work. And that works very well then for introducing Buddhism to a wide array of people, because Buddhism then doesn't conflict directly with other articles of faith, other beliefs people have. And in fact, from a Buddhist point of view, you're welcome to be Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, whatever. And mostly, Buddhists don't feel that there's any conflict between believing in some article of faith, some religion, and practicing Buddhism. It's just a two kind of, involved different domains of our life. But instead of offering some kind of article of faith, some supernatural or something, some theistic idea, what the Buddha offered was the Four Noble Truths. And the Four Noble Truths are not meant to be, they're called truths, but I understand them to be perspectives, frameworks that are helpful for understanding our lives. Life is so complicated, there's so many things going on, that it's very helpful if you have a framework to organize your life, to make sense of it, so you can live your life efficiently, clearly, and get to the point of it. Which for the Buddha was ending your unnecessary suffering, bringing it into suffering. Liberation, in a simple definition of liberation in Buddhism, is coming to the end of suffering. The Buddha said sometimes, I teach one thing only, and that is suffering and the end of suffering. And whether you suffer, if you're suffering, it's not really an article of faith that you suffer, you don't have to kind of like believe, you know, read a book that teaches you that you suffer and then you suffer. I mean, that happens sometimes, right? You read someone like Nietzsche, and, oh, I didn't know it was so bad. But, you know, suffering is something that's pretty direct and immediate, and you kind of basically know it or you don't know it. And so, Buddha taught one thing and one thing only, suffering and the end of suffering. And all the Buddha's teachings then is in elaboration of this, you know, teaching on suffering and the end of suffering. And you very clearly see that in the formulation of the Four Noble Truths. And there is suffering, there's a cause of suffering, there's an end of suffering, and there's a path to ending suffering. So that's a perspective, not so much a truth, it's a perspective to understanding your life, it's a framework. Very much like human beings have found it very helpful to have systems of measurement. And, you know, here in America we have what's called the English system, in Europe they have the metric system. And, you know, I don't know if you want to say that the American system of measurement of inches and feet is more true or less true than the metric system. One might be more efficient and more useful, but not more true or less true, just way, you know, reality doesn't change so much, it's just a way of dividing up reality that's helpful. So the Four Noble Truths are frameworks like that that help us hold our experience so we can be kind of efficient in measuring and seeing what really is necessary for us to study. And so you don't have to believe them in terms of like a religious truth, but rather you adopt them as a perspective, as a tool, to help you make some sense of all the complexity of your life. So you can get to the point, the Buddhist point, which is to end suffering. And it's very interesting that he based his model of the Four Noble Truths on a medical model, the way doctors analyzed illness in ancient India. So rather than using kind of a faith model or a religious model, he used actually very pragmatic, you know, the pragmatic methods of a doctor. The illness, the doctor's interest in the illness, the cause of the illness, the prognosis, the possibility of a cure, and then the cure, the medicine you have to take. And so there's suffering, there's a cause of suffering, there's a prognosis, there's a possibility of ending that suffering, and then there's the medicine you take, which is the eighth full path. So the Four Noble Truths, in their simplest versions, I think it's pretty easy to understand. Sometimes we suffer. That suffering has a cause, which the Buddha defined as thirst, tan-na, which is usually translated into English as craving, this kind of feeling of compulsion, of being driven. Sometimes we suffer, and we don't even know why we're suffering, but you feel like there's this momentum, this power, this force within us that kind of keeps us kind of to the grindstone, kind of suffering. And that force, the compulsion that keeps us there in our, whatever the suffering might be, you know, you want to let go of it, you want to somehow break out of it, you want to somehow leave it behind, and just kind of hangs on to you, it stays with you, you can't seem to leave it. It's kind of like this powerful force of sadness or grief or anger or pain or frustration, whatever it might be. And the force, the momentum, the drivenness that keeps it there, the Buddha defined as thirst, as craving, which is very interesting because craving is something usually you think of that people do, they crave. And what it implies is that our suffering arises from something that we do. So it's not some impersonal force, it's force outside of us that comes out, gets channeled through our being, and therefore we suffer because of all the terrible things in the world. The Buddha pointed to the fact that we suffer only because of something that we do. And that makes it very challenging because it's invisible to us many times our contribution to our suffering, what we do. We feel so clear that people are doing things to me and, you know, life is unfair or whatever. And so it's very easy to look outside for the cause of our suffering. And the Buddha turned, said, you know, you need to turn the attention inward if you want to study the place where you can make a real difference. Who knows about the difference you can make in the external world and how people treat you? But you can make a real difference in your suffering by turning the attention inward to see what you do. And particularly if you can notice that when you suffer, if you can kind of tease apart that suffering, look deeply into it and see where is that drivenness, where is that craving, the grasping on that provides the momentum and the force for that suffering to be there. And if you can do that well, then there's a possibility of letting go of that craving and experiencing the cessation of craving, cessation of suffering. If you do that really thoroughly, then in the Buddhist tradition you become someone who's liberated. You have experience of liberation, of ultimate freedom. And then Buddha offered this path. So this is relatively easy. There's suffering, a cause of suffering, an end of suffering and a path. It's very hard to understand this in the depths of our psyche. It's very hard to understand, if I'm attached to, if I see someone out there who wears a beautiful t-shirt that has metta across it or something, I'd like a t-shirt like that, metta would be great to walk around like that, it's green and boy. And I could see my desire and I could see maybe I'm suffering because, oh, you know, why do I have a white shirt? Probably no one likes white and I should be wearing green and probably people don't like me and how can I be such a poor choice of clothes? And pretty soon I get into this big morass, this mess of suffering. And I might be pretty lucky, I can see, I can see, oh, you know, this is my mind thinking, I don't have to pick this up, it's kind of a silly thought and I can just let go of it. But it's much harder to let go, as we know, of certain things. They're really deeply, deeply enmeshed in our psyche. And we can't even see our contribution in it. The drive for security, the drive for wanting to be liked, the drive to feel acknowledged for our work, the drive to acquire, to have, the desire to want things, the tremendous impulse within us sometimes to be aversive, to kind of feel oppressed, you know, the way sometimes some of us feel oppressed by life is too much. It's very hard to see what we're doing in the midst of it, that is where our responsibility lies. And in fact, if you don't have clarity enough to see it, you have no choice. You only have choice if you can see the place of choice. If you can't see the place of choice in what you're doing, you have no choice and then you're being led around by your desire and your grasping. And so then it feels very impersonal, it feels like other causes and conditions are causing your suffering. And I'm making sense so far? So it's very hard to apply the Four Noble Truths in the depths of our psyche. And it can actually feel very almost insulting, kind of an injury, you can add injury upon injury for someone to come along and say, you're responsible for your suffering. Because people feel so raw and so filled with pain to begin with. And then now they have this burden, they feel guilty because they go, I'm the one who's causing it. And so just then they feel even worse and so, you know, they feel more discouraged. And it's not meant that kind of way. The beauty of the Four Noble Truth is you're supposed to apply it any way you can. And if you hear, oh, you're responsible for your suffering and then you contract because of that, then you apply the Four Noble Truth to that particular contraction. Maybe you can see that and let go of that, oh, I don't have to take that on as a burden, thank you. So it's hard to get in, you know, so then also in Buddhism they talk about the deep subconscious roots of craving within us. So it's not necessarily available kind of in the conscious, that normal mind, the street mind we wonder walk around in, the deep roots of the attachment to self, for example. So the Buddha offered a path, the Eightfold Path, he offered practices to help us use the Four Noble Truths to their full potential. So like you have a knife and maybe the knife is really dull, in order to use that knife to its full potential you have to sharpen it in a sharpening stone. And then you can really use it well. You can't really cut deep down into whatever you're cutting, into the eggplant, unless it's sharp. So in the same way you want to take and sharpen the mind enough so you can use this tool of Four Noble Truth to apply deeply into your psyche. And that's one of the functions of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And one way of understanding the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is they're laying a foundation for applying the Four Noble Truths to our lives. And I think of it as a pyramid. A pyramid is a stable base, because it's so wide, and if you turned a pyramid upside down on its head it would be very difficult to keep it stable or tip over. So you want to have a very stable base. If the Four Noble Truths are like the top of the pyramid, you want to have a very stable, firm base for holding the top of the pyramid. You don't have it upside down. And this course in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness offers that foundation. And I like to think of, so there's four foundations, and I like to think of the four as being the first one being the base of the pyramid, and the second being the next layer up, and the third being the next layer up, and the fourth being the next layer up. So the first foundation is in some sense the most important, because it's the foundational one. The first foundation of mindfulness is mindfulness of the body. Being mindful of our embodied experience, what it's like to live in a body, to experience our life through our body. Many people are not connected to their body, it's very easy to lose touch with our body, but their body provides a tremendous friend, provides tremendous information about what's going on, it can help us a lot in processing our life. Often one of the best ways of processing our experience is by entering into the body's way of holding that experience. And many times we're trying to fix things with our head, with our thoughts and ideas, and sometimes it can be like an endless kind of thread mill, we're running around and around and around in our thoughts, and it can be a lot faster to drop down into the body and hold our experience right there. It's kind of like a shortcut to spiritual life, it's through the body. So in this discourse of four foundations of mindfulness, the Buddha first says a very interesting thing. The first instructions he gives is, before he's going to even describe the four foundations of mindfulness, is he says, He says, He has put away covetousness and grief for the world, covetousness and grief, desire and grief, sorrow about the world. And the operating word here is about the world. For me, it's pointing to the fact that if you're going to do the spiritual work that the Buddha is pointing towards, you have to in some way, at some point, learn to turn your attention away from the external focus that we often have to the objects of the world, not because they're bad, not to reject them, but so that we can turn inward to see where the point of choice and responsibility lies. So it's a turnaround, the attention. So we kind of lose our concern with all the things in the world, our bank account, our job, our relationship, our relationships, our recreational opportunities, all the kind of things that we kind of get lost in. So that we can get access to this deep inner world. So there has to be some conviction, some understanding of the wisdom of, at least temporarily, learning the art of taking that backward step, the inward step, and not constantly being caught in the things of the world. It's a lot easier said than done. And some people come to do mindfulness practice because they're trying to help them not be so cut up in the world. So the first instruction they're given is, well, just don't be caught up in the world. Thanks a lot. But at least theoretically, you should understand this, theoretically, the practices are turned inward and let go of the best you can, the external drive to always be thinking about future, past things in the world. Then it says, go to the foot of a tree or an empty room. And this room here qualifies as being pretty empty. And sit down cross-legged, sit up straight, and set your attention in front of you. Set your attention straight in the present moment. And then the first instruction after this is start paying attention to your breath. Notice your breath, notice qualities of your breath, notice a long breath is a long breath, a short breath is a short breath. Tune into the qualities of your breath, the experience of your breath, what your breath is like. Become intimate with your breath, get concentrated on the experience of the breathing. And the bottom layer of that pyramid is cultivating the ability to concentrate on the breath. That's one aspect of mindfulness of the body. The breath is a preeminent tool for calming and concentrating the mind. And in fact, in this discourse in Four Foundations, the Buddha says, as you get tuned into your breathing, let your breathing help you calm your body and mind. Allow the breath to calm the body and mind. Calm yourself as you stay with the breath. Calm your body, calm your mind, calm the agitation that might be there. One of the reasons for this is it's very hard to see clearly into the psyche if you're agitated. And so in order to apply the Four Noble Truths deeply, you have to somehow settle the agitated waves on the surface of the ocean of your mind. Otherwise, if you're all agitated, you can't see through the agitation. So begin cultivating calm and concentration. Not just in meditation, but see if you can live a lifestyle that's conducive for that. Because it's not easy to develop a calm mind or a calm body. Sometimes you need to look at the rest of your life and see, what can I do to change my life and live in such a way that I'm not always so agitated if you want to do the work as deeply as it can be done. Then the next instruction after meditation on the breath is to learn to start paying attention to your daily activities. So include your daily activities as part of your meditation practice. When you're standing, be mindful that you're standing. When you're sitting, be mindful when you're sitting. When you're lying down, mindful when you're lying down. And when you're walking, be mindful when you're walking. When you reach out to pick something up, be mindful of the fact that that's what you're doing. When you're going to the bathroom, be mindful of that process of going to the bathroom. When you're putting on your clothes, be mindful of that process of putting on the clothes. So the discourse says you start paying attention to your life. Be present for it. Notice what goes on. Have some modicum of presence in the activities of your life. Partly so you can bring calm to that part of your life. Partly so you can notice what's really going on. I remember many years ago, I was at the library at UC Berkeley. I was doing my dissertation research and I really needed a book that only they had in the library. It was not on the shelves. So I went to the librarian to ask for help. And the librarians were quite unhelpful. And they were unwilling to look and see if someone had checked it out, if it was missing, or where else it might be, if someone had returned it. And I'd come all the way up from Stanford to go to Berkeley to get this book. And I had to explain to them the tremendous importance of getting this book. It was certainly very important for me. And I was really into the discussion and trying to get their attention. And they were across this big table. And then finally someone, another librarian walked by and said, oh, I'll help you. So she helped me and was able to help me. But when she offered to help me, then I relaxed. And only then did I turn my attention to what was going on with me, my body. And I found out I was leaning halfway across the table. My feet were almost off the ground. And I was like, really? And ideally I would have maybe noticed that while I was doing it. So I could maybe have been more composed and perhaps more effective in my communication. So when I was caught up in that book and getting my way, there was not much opportunity there to use the Four Noble Truths as reflection to understand my experience in the present moment. If I had been more composed and paid more attention to what was going on in my activities, the fact that I was leaning over the table, standing on the table, whatever I was doing, then I would have noticed, oh, where's the clinging here? Where's the craving here? Do I really want to be craving this way? That's one of the reflections in the Four Noble Truths. Do I really want to live this way? Do I really want to live driven or is it part of my priorities and values to lose my peace, my harmony, my sense of well-being, desperately trying to get this book? Is whatever I'm grasping, is it really worth it? And sometimes it can be like a wrestling mask. It's a fascinating kind of exploration of the mind to be asking this question, is this grasping really worth it? Why am I doing it? My heart's heart, is this really what I want my life to be about? So pay attention to your breath. Learn to use your breath as a way of calming yourself. The next instruction is to pay attention to your activities. The next instruction is to start paying attention to your body directly, your body itself. The different sensations of your body, the different aspects of your body, get really familiar with your body. Part of this foundation of mindfulness of the body is also an instruction to pay attention to what's called the impurities of the body, the impure aspects of the body, your snot, you know, and things like that, your piss and your bile and all these liquids which, you know, you don't really want someone to... those liquids of that person to kind of come all over you. So, whatever, you know, so we all kind of have this sense, right, sometimes, you know, like we don't really want that person's vomit to please... I was surprised that it was okay for me to hold my son's vomit in his hand when he was three years, two years old. That was a really surprised, I kind of... I had no idea, I had no idea that human beings went around sniffing other human beings' butts. I thought only dogs did that. In holding each other's vomit, you know, when they're barfing. It's a parent's parent thing, it's really education. But, you know, anyway, so the impurities. So, there's a reflection, there's instructions to meditate a little bit on the impurities of the body. So, and I think part of the reason for that is so you don't get... even though there's a tremendous emphasis in Buddhism on the importance of the body, being in your body, sensing body, enjoying being in your body. You also don't want to be attached to your body. And many people are attached to their body in various ways. And so, for people who are excessively attached to their body, contemplating the impure aspects of your body is meant to be a strategy, so you're not so attached to it. You know, it's really... body is really great, it's really wonderful friend we have. The Buddhist tradition says specifically, your body is your best friend. But if you get attached to it, then think about those, you know, those things. And then another instruction on mindfulness of the body is contemplating death, particularly contemplating a corpse. And either as a visualization or back in ancient India, they would go to charnel grounds where they just dump the dead bodies on top of the ground to rot and people go out there and sit and watch the process of decay. And this maybe is partly also to help with attachment to the body. And it's a very powerful practice to sit with a corpse and watch the process of decay. And I like to think of it partly that the contemplation of death, which is strongly recommended in Buddhism, is not meant as a morbid practice, but a way of getting our priorities straightened out. To really understand, kind of, you know, yes, I'm going to die and what's most important for me. If I come to my death bed, how do I want to remember my life? What was really important in my life? So these different exercises all belong to the foundation of mindfulness of the body. And laying the foundation of both the being calm enough, being present enough for experience for our body, knowing what goes on in our body. Because suffering usually has a physical embodied quality to it. And I've known people, for example, quite common to have people say, I started paying attention to myself when I was angry. And when I was angry, I noticed what a tremendous cost I had on my body. When you get caught up in the object of your anger, we're often blind to the cost in our own physical body. And I've had people come and say, oh, when I noticed the cost of being angry, I didn't feel it was worth it. I didn't want to do it. The Buddha said, if you want to do your enemy a favor, you know, be angry. Because you're causing yourself harm in a way your enemy couldn't even do him herself. So the first foundation of mindfulness helps with all these things, with our priorities a little bit, with getting ground in our body, understanding the impact of our suffering, on our choices, as on our embodied life, our lived life. It's just seeing clearly into the body. The second foundation of mindfulness is called Vedana in Pali. And I like to translate this into English as the feeling tone of our experience. And this is a very hum... can be a very humbling realization or study. The feeling tone of our experience is the idea that every experience you have, whatever it might be, whatever sense stores you have, in the rawness, the sense... the sense level of the experience. Not your experience of democracy, that's too big, but in your sense experience, in the moment experience of life as it's lived, hearing a sound, tasting, touching, thinking a thought. That that experience has... is either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. And why this is humbling is if you pay careful attention to your mind, you'll discover how often you're actually ami... you're an amoeba. And you have this amoeba-like reaction to pleasantness and unpleasantness. There's liking and disliking, holding on, going towards, not liking, pulling away, pushing away. Just based on where things are pleasant and unpleasant. We're like slaves to pleasure and discomfort. And we react so constantly to this. Running away from the unpleasant, holding on to the pleasant, wanting it, desiring it, being caught in it. And sometimes it's not really about the big picture of, you know... I mean sometimes people's political philosophies, their origins arise not out of great philosophical consideration, but they arise simply because they find some experience unpleasant. And so they're reacting to that unpleasantness, the unpleasantness is propelling them to have aversion, to try to stop something. And it isn't that, you know, it's not okay to kind of feel like or preferences or dislike, but we want to have to be master of our own mind and to see how clearly the mind can be this amoeba-like reaction machine. It's impersonal, it's not like even you doing it. It's very, very helpful and instructive to start watching how the mind works and how the mind picks up craving, how the drivenness arises out of this very... originally from this very, very basic, simple thing. So I'm sitting here meditating, my knee hurts, it's an unpleasant experience. I don't just let the unpleasant experience to be there, neutrally, but there's all these reactions to it. And I have this whole philosophy that in order to have a successful human being I should be constantly dwelling in bliss. And I'm a spiritual person after all, and physical pain is a proof that I'm not very spiritual. And here in America you're not supposed to have pain because there's all these aspirins and stuff you can take, and it's a personal failing to have pain. And it's all this reactivity to it. And then you have this pain and you say, well gee, you know, this is not right. I probably got the wrong instruction, you know, in meditation, probably there's a better meditation teacher out there. And I think I'm going to find a better meditation teacher, but this is the only place I can find where I don't have to pay if I don't want to. And everyone else, I have to pay. And why do all the other people charge so much and they're so terrible? And this whole universe arises in reaction to having somehow been hooked by the unpleasantness of the knee pain. Your life would be a lot easier if you say, oh, it's unpleasant. You leave it at that. But we kind of get hooked. So studying the pleasant and unpleasant neutrality of experience teaches us something about the hookness, how we get hooked. And that's very helpful if you want to understand the Four Noble Truths. The next foundation of mindfulness is called the foundation of mindfulness of the mind. And that's, who knows what he means, the Buddha, except when he says just the foundation of the mind, except he gives a list of things that he says you should pay attention to. And that's very clear. When the mind is filled with lust, you should notice that. It's really helpful to notice when there's craving and lust in the mind. And you should also notice when that lust is gone, when it's absent of lust. Notice the difference between what it feels like to have a heart or mind filled with craving and when it's without it. Notice when there's hate. And notice what it's like to have a mind that's free of hate. These are very useful things to pay attention to notice in our experience. Notice when there's delusion. It's much harder to notice when you're deluded, but you can sometimes. Notice your delusion and then notice the absence of it. Notice when your mind is distracted, what it feels like. Get to know that really well. So rather than being judgmental and be upset the fact your mind is distracted, you're instructed to really know that, study that, get to know what that's like. Be mindful of that experience. And be mindful of the experience when the mind is not distracted, what it's like then. When the mind is agitated, know that. And when it's not agitated, know that. And then that's all the unwholesome states of mind. You should also know wholesome state of mind. When the mind is, there are always great words like exalted, when you have the supreme mind, the ultimate mind, when you have a liberated mind. You should know these wonderful minds that are filled with joy, feeling of peace, feeling of being at ease, at home in itself, feeling liberated from the craving and grasping. You should know those kinds of qualities of the mind. You should be able to distinguish between these things. And it says, knowing these things, being really expert at these qualities of the mind is very, very helpful. Because if you can see these things well, then it's a shortcut to understanding, to using the Four Noble Truths to get down into the depths of our psyche. So the first foundation is the body, the second is the feeling tone, the third is the mind. The fourth foundation is the foundation of dharmas, dharmas. And no one knows what the Buddha meant here. Again, with the title, with the category, dharmas here. There's an ancient Buddhist dictionary that gives like 56 different definitions of dharma. So it's very hard to know what it actually means here. But again, what happens is that the explanation is given in the explanation of that category, the fourth foundation. And there are five exercises, or five things to pay attention to in the fourth foundation of mindfulness. To make it simple, what you're asked to pay attention to, there's a shift here from the first three and the fourth. The first three, a little bit more, are just descriptive in the sense that just notice what's there. Don't be judgmental about it. Just notice what's present. When anger is there, notice that. When pleasure, pleasantness is there, notice that. When the body is tight, notice the body is tight. Notice the body is tight. Notice the body is loose. Notice that. Just notice how things are. Develop a non-reactive awareness, simple, direct, seeing things as they are. Which is a very basic instruction for vipassana. In the fourth foundation of mindfulness, your encouraged starts studying the processes, the ways in which the mind works. You're supposed to study the other things in and of themselves, but how they're part of a continuum, a process of change. There's a chain of cause and effect that brings things together. In particular, you want to notice, to give you a shorthand version here, you want to notice when the mind somehow or other gets entangled with experiences of life. Entangled with your thoughts, entangled with your feelings, entangled with the objects outside. Notice how that happens. Notice how you get entangled. Notice how you can prevent that entanglement from rising in the future. Notice the effect that entanglement has on your psyche. Notice what you can do to let go of that entanglement. It's not a matter of judging your success and failure in this, but it involves some study here. What is this experience? One of the examples is clinging to sensual desire, sensual pleasure. Notice what the effect is on your psyche to be clinging to sensual pleasure. You have this great foundation of the first three mindfulness practices first. You're familiar with how to pay attention to your body, how to be calm. You can notice when sensual desire is gripped your mind, the effect is it contracts the awareness. The awareness doesn't feel free. You don't feel free. You feel imprisoned or tight or constricted. You notice what it takes to be free of this. Why is it there? What's the process of liberating myself from this? There's a study of this. What can I do about this? Another example in shorthand of what's given here is any kind of attachment clinging to sense of self. Notice that. You've already cultivated the ability to be non-reactive in your experience. Use a non-reactive awareness. It doesn't judge, it doesn't criticize, it doesn't feel guilty for the attachment to self. Notice the effect that attachment to self has on yourself. Notice the cost it has. Again, you probably feel a contraction, a limitation, you'll find it heavy, it'll feel difficult and painful. Even the most sublime and wonderful sense of self and who you are, if you're attached to it, is a hindrance. And here you're asked to notice how that is hindering you. Notice the effect it has on you. Then the opposite end, you're instructed to notice those qualities of mind that arise that are helpful for the process of liberation. They're conducive for becoming liberated, becoming freer. Mindfulness, non-reactive mindfulness awareness is helpful to liberate the mind. Investigating your experience is helpful to liberate the mind. Joy is helpful. Tranquility is helpful. Making effort can be helpful. Tranquility is helpful. And equanimity is helpful. Do I need all seven? Seven factors of awakening. These states of mind arise. Notice the effect these states have. How the mind feels more expansive, more at ease, feels lighter. It's very important to notice the effect these things have, the process they're part of. And what can you do to support the arising of these things? What can you do to maintain them as they arise? We're getting closer to the top of the pyramid, almost to the top. And then the last thing you're instructed to do after doing all these different things, being familiar with all these things, having gotten these under your belt, is then the Four Noble Truths. To look at your experience very carefully, where is the subtlest form of tension, of stress, of suffering in your life? Not even the gross ones, but subtle. You have to be very subtle if you want to get down to the very deepest roots of your suffering, attachment to self. Attachment to self is so powerful, it's so good at camouflaging itself, that we don't even know it's there, and it's so good at putting up tremendous resistance to being studied and being addressed. And there can be like this biblical battle sometimes with people, and they get close to the deepest sense and attachment to the idea of self. And you have to be very subtle to pick it up, very subtle and very familiar with all the tricks of the mind, and learn how to stay grounded in your body, in order to really get down and see the depths of all this. So where is that subtle suffering? Where is that subtle attachment that gives rise to that suffering? And then can you find the release from that grasping, the freedom from it? So it can sound like a big project, all this stuff. It's not meant to be that way. But I think it's helpful to think of spiritual life as something that you're not expecting to work overnight. It's a slow, progressive thing. You're building the foundation over time. The last thing I'll say is that the Buddha said, the Dharma is good in the beginning, it's good in the middle, and good in the end. And if you use the Four Noble Truths at the beginning, middle and end, you don't have to wait until you do all these foundation stuff before you do the Four Noble Truths. If you start studying and applying the Four Noble Truths at the very beginning of your Dharma practice, then probably you won't suffer because of your Dharma practice. You'll enjoy it a lot. And whenever you notice, whenever you can notice the suffering and the craving, the clinging that's there, let go of it, or have a wiser relationship to it. So if you sit here, and you're a brand new meditator, and you sit down to meditate, and your mind feels really restless, and then you notice that your mind's saying, you klutz, you can never do anything right, and then you're supposed to be concentrated and blissed out here like everybody else who's here in this room, and you're the only one sitting here and being miserable, and boy, you're really a lousy, no-good person, probably a failure of a human being. I hope no one notices. But then, you remember, oh, but these Buddhists, they teach the Four Noble Truths. Let's apply this to this. Oh, there's all these ideas that I'm attached to doing it right. Let me let go of that attachment of doing it right, and then, oh, I'm just sitting here being distracted. And it's not so pleasant to be distracted, but now I'm not going to add a burden of all the suffering on top of it. So apply the Four Noble Truths any time you can. So I hope that makes sense. If some of you are new, it might not have made much sense, because there's a lot of teachings that were summarized very briefly. But for those of you who've heard a lot of these teachings before, it might have been helpful for you to get a sense of how the Four Foundations of Mindfulness lay a kind of a path that helps us understand the depths of the Four Noble Truths. So thank you very much, and I wish you a wonderful week.
