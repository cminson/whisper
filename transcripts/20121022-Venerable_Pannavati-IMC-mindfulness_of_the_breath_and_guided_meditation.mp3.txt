The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
I in all sentient beings until we achieve enlightenment
go for refuge to Buddha, Dharma and Sangha
by the virtues I possess, by giving and other perfections
May I become a Buddha for the benefit of all
Thank you so much for inviting me tonight. You have a beautiful facility
and all of your efforts in making a long-term meditation practice available
to people in this area is just simply marvelous.
The Buddha talked about the different levels of generosity
the first being just the giving of money
and said that was the least aspect of generosity
and so you've gone beyond, you've gone through the four levels of generosity
and just even the first one you did was so extraordinary
so there is so much merit in your practice.
We're going to do something a little bit different today.
You know when the Buddha was invited out to discourse
I mean there was no topic, there was no order of service
so when he came he spoke as he was moved by the hearts and the minds
of the people that were present and so that's kind of how I do it
and I know it perturbed some but I told, was that gill that was here tonight?
Yeah, okay, okay. Everybody knows me and I just have a short memory
so I'm sorry and so don't worry about it.
I just left the black robe wearing Zen folk
and you know how like straight line they are and that worked out okay
so I'm confident right here tonight that we'll be able to do something
in a little different way but it will definitely benefit you
and so we're going to do the meditation at the end
so that when we go into meditation we're going for a particular reason
and we hope to accomplish something specific in that practice.
You know it's not just our relaxation.
You know we're not doing this to let go for a while
but we are accomplishing something specific
and it takes the arousal of energy to do that
and it takes a right effort to do that
and so tonight I wanted to talk some about that
because you're coming up against a great obstacle.
First we step off to do something then after we get into it
you know we have to take it to completion
so there are going to be many obstacles that will come your way
in the fulfillment of your dream
so I want to make sure that you have a firm foundation
in your meditation practice so that it accomplishes
it gets the results.
There was a great teacher who said
what king goes to war without first counting up the cost
and so we know when we go into something
that it's going to take something to come out the other end successful
and our practice for doing that is through meditation
so meditation you know has a purpose in arousing wisdom
and it has a purpose in producing the power
to bring into manifestation the things in the phenomenal world
that should come into being through the hearts and minds
of those who have a bodhi mind or the enlightened mind
and so I want to talk about using meditation
and going into meditation in this kind of way
and this is really a departure from what I've been doing
since I've come here to the west coast
but I feel impressed to do it this way tonight
so if you're bad with me when I'm giving a 30 minute talk
you know I used to be a Pentecostal preacher
and do you know where my glasses are?
I think I did.
Oh no I didn't they're right here
and so I was a Pentecostal preacher
so if it was all night it was alright
but they already told me that in nine o'clock
people will be walking out
so I'm going to get right to this
so that I hope I leave you with something
that's going to benefit you
and this is on the mindfulness of breathing
I mean this is like just taking it right to the first level
of where we start in our meditation practice
and I want to share with you something from the Vasude Maga
that's the path of purification
and it is a manual that we use as monastics
to really penetrate the instructions
for how to get the most out of the meditation practice
it's like probably like too much information
for you more than you want when you have to deal
with the daily vicissitudes of life
and you have 10,000 other things to do
we're supposed to be sitting at a root of a tree
so we have plenty of time to get into this
but I'm going to give you a short version tonight
because I think that the Buddha said he taught with an open hand
meaning that he held nothing back
it didn't matter to him whether it was male or female monastics
male or female lay followers
he gave all without discrimination
and so I feel somewhat saddened today
that so much of the information that is available
is not disseminated in the lay community
so whenever I have an opportunity to talk
I like to share some things on a little deeper level
and I think it will enhance your practice
so mindfulness of breathing
now comes the description of the development of mindfulness
of breathing as a meditation object
it has been recommended by the Blessed One thus
and because this concentration through mindfulness of breathing
when developed and practiced much
is both peaceful and sublime
it is an unadulterated blissful abiding
and it vanishes at once
and stills evil unprofitable thoughts
as soon as they arise
so now if we're talking about the mindfulness of breathing
and it says that when you really have it right
it stills and vanishes unprofitable thoughts
as soon as they arise
and it said there is something that is required
an enlightenment factor
what is it? It's effort
what is effort?
the body and the mind of one who is energetic
becomes wieldy
this is effort
what is the task?
imperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic
and his applied thoughts are stilled
this is the task
what is the effect?
fetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic
and his inherent tendencies come to be done away with
this is the effect
so now there is a task
and there is an effect
the task is that the thoughts should be stilled
the effect is that our fetters
and our habitual tendencies cease
that's the effect
and so when we look and we've been practicing
for 10 years and 15 years and 20 years
and we're wondering if we still have reached any level of attainment
he said you don't have to wonder you can just go by this
you know so the question is
are your thoughts stilled?
do you have control over your thoughts?
can you still them?
right in the moment
right in the very act of the arising of an unwholesome state of mind
can you put that away?
if you can't
he says then you should know exactly where you are
and you have not perfected
cannot come to the completeness
of the preliminary practice
of mindfulness
of breathing
the first thing we start with is breathing
before we get into all these other things
before we start studying
John before we start studying vipassana
all of that
right there mindfulness of breathing
so I want to take us all the way back
to that starting point
a building can only
you can build it very tall
but how stable it is
depends on its foundation
and so that's why I want to go back to a foundational teaching tonight
and then we can go ahead and put our other stories back on top of it
it says
when
effort
what is the effort again?
hmm
hahaha
says effort is
when the body and mind have become
energetic
energetic
arousing energy
and this is the main point I want to bring about
you know
we are not sleeping in meditation
we're not like just
drifting away into a relaxation
actually moving into a hyper
state of awareness
even though externally
there is a stilling of the body
internally
there is a sharpening
of the mental acuity
and the vision
so that we can
move in and penetrate
our ignorance
and so that is the object
that is the primary
aspect of meditation
we're not meditating if we're not doing that
we're doing, we're resting and we're doing something
but we're not meditating
but he says what is the effect of this
and this is the purpose for that
the effect is
to abandon
the fetters
and the habitual
and inherent tendencies
these become
done away with
and how is this done?
if we arouse the energy
and we follow the technique
that was laid out for us
it's like
advancing into a stream
if we stay on the side
our feet get stuck in the mud
but if we advance
and move on into the middle of the stream
there there is the current
and the current takes you on downstream
this is how your meditation should be for you
there should not be a struggle
as we just step right off
and wade towards the
middle of the stream
then the current will pick us up
and it will take us
where we're trying to go
then meditation becomes so enjoyable
five hours is like five minutes
and it is accompanied by
not only great insight
but it's accompanied by great
great joy
and bliss
so he says
although any meditation subject
no matter what is successful
only in one who is mindful and fully aware
he said there's something a little bit different
in mindfulness of breathing
because in anything else we focus on
it becomes clearer and clearer
more profound, larger
more concrete
but he said in mindfulness of breathing
it becomes more and more subtle
that means that the breath
becomes finer and finer and finer
until it appears to almost cease
completely
he says it appears to cease
due to our ignorance
of its composition
it appears that way
so there is a settling down
the more we enter into the focus
on the breath until it becomes more
and more and more and more
subtle
said the mindfulness of breathing
is difficult
difficult to develop a field in which only the minds
of buddhas, pachika buddhas
and the buddhas' sons are at home
with
it is no trivial matter
nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons
in America
we just came right here and bang
we started with this meditation thing
but meditation was way down the road
in the buddhas' gradual training
he didn't start with meditation
he started with the cultivation
of generosity and said
when he saw that that had been duly cultivated
and then he went on
to teach this and he taught this
and he taught this and this and way down the road
then he got to
the meditation
and when we came over here
that was what was so different
what was so profound for us
and we jumped right in to the meditation
and in this process
we maybe had not quite laid
the foundation
that we needed to lay
and that's why you know what got me
really excited about
taking up the
buddha dharma and its practices
was I read the sutra this said
yeah it's a buddha how long would this take
you know this enlightenment thing you talk about
he said well you know if you really follow
my instruction
you can accomplish it in 7 years
he said actually you can
accomplish it in 7 months
he said really it will only take you 7 days
I said this is the one for me
because I already spent 30 years
on another tradition
and my time is getting short
and so that's why I took it on
but I actually
the reason I became a monastic
you can tell I'm just not like
your ordinary
view
of a monastic
but I became a monastic because
I want to have access
to all of the teaching
and I wanted to concentrate
and focus on that so I could really penetrate it
so I could bring it out
and I could share it
with the world with an open hand
so this is what I do
sometimes I get these emails
from other monastics they say
you shouldn't be talking about all that
with them I go who is them
the buddha made no distinction
among his family
we're all sons and daughters of the buddha
so everything should be open
and available
sometimes things are not open and available
so it looks like we're so smart
but it's not that
or like we have such supernatural gifts
like we learn
how to even watch how a person moves
watch their movement
how to listen to their
conversation
how to watch how they walk
how to watch even how they sweep
and in this we can determine
what type of
a personality they have
or what their temperament is
whether it's of a hating temperament
of a greedy temperament
of a delusional temperament
that we learn so it's not that
we're like just have this
this great
a Dharma eye that is opened
and the supernatural unfoldment
it's just
going into the depth of the teaching
and working with that
until we
learn the cues and learn the signs
but not just the signs
but also the cures
and the good part about it
and so
he goes on to talk to us about
mindfulness of breathing
as this meditation subject
and it gives us a simile
so we can understand
Jesus taught in
parables
and in one place it says
so that seeing they might not see
and hearing they might not understand
but that doesn't make sense
he taught them in that way
to understand
to make it so plain
and so the Buddha like all masters
uses teaching like this
so he gives us a simile of the star
and he says that just as
your eye is
a Sawyer's eye is fixed
right there on the blade
where the blade meets the wood
and even though the blade runs
to and fro is eye never leaves
that one spot where the blade
is connected with the wood
our breath is concentrated
and our focus in that same way
so we're not breathing in
and we're running the whole breath
and breathing out and taking it down
into our lungs and all of these things
that I've heard is that
we pick one spot
I don't care where you pick it in the nose
out of the nose anyway
but you just pick one spot and you stay
and as you take that inhalation
it's like that breath running over that one spot
and your eye never leaves that one spot
and as you're exhaling
just as the breath is running over that one spot
your
concentration never leaves that one spot
and he says that in this way
concentration
is established
so he's telling us
how to tranquilize
the whole body
just from focusing
at this one spot
and he says and then
when we do that
he says
there is something that occurs
in this way a sign appears
to the meditator
it's not the same for all
some say that when it appears
it does so in certain people
by producing a light touch
like cotton
or silk cotton
so you sort of have a sensation
a feeling
of something coming over you
says but it appears to
become like a star
or like a cluster of gems
or a cluster of pearls
to others it's like a rough touch
like that of silk cotton seeds
or a peg made of hardwood
to others like a long
braid strain
or a wreath of flowers
or a puff of smoke
says to others it's like
a movement
a moving of stars
like being on a train and looking out a window
it's like a film of clouds
or a lotus flower
or a chariot wheel
or the moon's disc
or the sun's disc
and this is called the sign
so there is something that occurs
in our view
what view
in the vastness
of the emptiness
behind the closed eyelids
and that comes about
that sign
by the concentration
and focus
of the in-breath and the out-breath
just at one point
oh this is the technique
this is the technique
and he says that when we fix
our mind upon the sign
then eyelids close
concentrating
on the breath
a sign appears just
in the vastness of the emptiness
behind the closed eyelids
it says and with it
comes something
the breathing has tranquilized
our vision
opens
and as our vision opens
there is an arising
of pity
of joy
and great bliss
this is what we should be experiencing
what is available
to experience
in our meditation
and this is preliminary practice
before we even get going
you know
this is preliminary practice
and then there's places to go way beyond that
you know and so
but I wanted to stop right there because
he says as soon as the sign appears
the hindrances
are suppressed
the defilements
subsided
and subdued
the mind
is established
in mindfulness
and consciousness is concentrated
in access
concentration now I'm going to stop right there
access concentration that means we haven't even got
where there is to go yet
this access means you're approaching
something
and from there it takes us
in to the various
experiences we have known as Jhana
and the Buddha is always talking about
direct experience
and this gets to be something that's no point in even talking about you
to experience it or you don't
and you believe that there is somewhere to go
or there isn't
and so I wanted to
talk about these kinds of things
because it's just as we go about
developing and establishing
our businesses
and everything
our life in this phenomenal world
when we come in here
it is not
just a
laying everything aside
and relaxing
but it's in here that we move
from being ordinary human beings
he talked about
you know he's always talking about mundane
ordinary people
and then he was talking
about
superior
beings so those of us who
are
consider ourselves
practitioners of the Buddha Dharma
should have in mind
should be thoroughly convinced
that we can move
beyond ordinary
mundane
views
ordinary worldly views
otherwise no need to pick this up
just stay with whatever you had before
and what I had before was pretty good
it was working good for me
I just didn't understand how it worked
I said you know
I was one of those off the chart
kind of Christians
so Pentecostal and then Charismatic
and strange things would happen
and if I told somebody
some people would say well I don't believe that
I was like I don't care because it's happening
to me and I know that it's happening
but I didn't always understand
like how is this happening
how is this working
with this voice out here in my head
saying get in the car and drive down the street
stop, go knock on that door
somebody sick tell them thus and so
or what is this guidance
that I'm getting
where is this guidance coming from
I didn't understand
and when I asked
my spiritual teachers
of that tradition
they told me about a gift
if God is giving gifts
he ain't giving it to me because I'm not that good
and I was wondering
why is it that something
could happen
for me and there was another person
who's more worthy of it
or more deserving of it
they didn't get it
something didn't seem fair
something didn't seem balanced
so I knew that there was some information
that I was missing
from that tradition
they just didn't have an answer for it
it just became the gift of God
or something like that
and I needed a little bit more information
so I just went and talked to God directly
I said you know God
if I understood what you were doing
I could cooperate with you more
so you gotta give me some kind of sign
you gotta give me
I need to know
just by what means all of this is working
and
for a 15 year spin out
you know I encountered the Buddha Dharma
when I first saw it
somebody made me a Tibetan book
and you know those Tibetan pictures
it was the wheel of life
it had this animal with teeth
and you know it had all that
and I said I don't want any of that
heath and devil worship stuff
and I put it aside
so for 15 years
I rolled around
we call it the dark night of the soul
I rolled around in confusion
because I was afraid
of anything that was
beyond you know just my little
mundane understanding
and anything that was outside of
the box of the spiritual tradition
I was in
if I couldn't find it in their book it didn't exist
even if it was happening to me
if I couldn't find it in the book
it didn't exist that's what some would even tell me
oh that's not happening
like you don't know because it's not happening to you
I am 15 years down the road
and I encounter the Buddha Dharma
and I start to study this
and it starts to
articulate everything
that's happening and how it's happening
by what means it's happening
you know they would call the analyzers
you know they could like
analyze everything down to the nth
that's why I was the 2nd, the 10th, the 8th
the 16th
I mean you know he broke it
broke it, broke it, broke it down
and for those of us who are like
artsy and maybe
I was really woo-woo when I started this
but I'm a scientist now
you know
but, but, but
I'm not a human scientist
I'm not an earthly scientist
I don't verify
the Dharma by science
I verify science
by the Dharma
because I have apprehended something in the Dharma
that supersedes that
we can't rely that much on science
I mean science is good what we discover
we discover right
but we're always discovering something
that nullifies what we discovered before
like you know we were talking about the earth being flat
and then we know that it's not
you know and so we have to take our science
it's wonderful when you know
it helps us to
understand or develop more confidence
in the Dharma
but don't let the science determine for us
what parts of the Dharma is true
he said that this is a
this is a
Dharma that is
difficult to understand
he said it is sublime
and it is, and it goes
beyond
our human intellect
and that this is available to us
and for what purpose is it available
to be a light
in the world
you know in the Vajra Gata Sutta, Vajra Gata asked the Buddha
he says, anybody getting light in size
you and your camp? He said, oh yeah
you know I have
hundreds of bhikkhus
who attain
I have hundreds of bhikkhunis
who attain, I have hundreds of laymen
who attain, hundreds of laywomen
who that was last time you heard of somebody
getting enlightened in Buddha land
you know so we have
to wonder have we lowered
the bar
what is actually attainable
what is this that we have turned
our attention to
and our hearts to
and our minds to
and what is it that we can do
more purely
that will have the effect
that has been
promised
that is the basis
of our faith, now I know we don't like
to hear that word faith, we all came out of something
and we had about as much
faith as we wanted
and so teachers
we don't talk
that much about faith but I'll tell you
he said this is a Dharma
that you can have faith in
he says how do you have faith
he said it's not by blind faith
but by taking
what I have shared with you
he says in putting it into the culture
of your experience, he said by trying
it and seeing
if it does not bear
itself out, he says and the more
you try, the more things
bear themselves out, the more confidence
you develop
in the Dharma, he said but this is the good thing
about it, he said
it's not my experience
it's your experience, that's why I say
you be a lamp unto your own feet
and a light unto your own path
and bear this out
check it out inside
for yourself, he says and in
this way we find
that the Buddha nature is
resident in every one
of us
also I'm
excited about this path
I've only been on this path for 10 years
you know, I missed my 7 year mark
but and we're not even going to talk
about the 7 month mark
but the one thing I do know
is that the advancement
is steady and the advancement
is sure
and we don't have to be afraid
to include
all of the passages
and all of the instructions
thinking that's too much for people to believe
but what we attain
what we know for ourselves
is sure
and is real and is true
in fact
our feet run swiftly
towards it
so I thought
are you keeping track of time for me?
oh my goodness
I think I was
I'm supposed to talk for 25 minutes
is that right?
don't be scared
tell me if I went over the states
oh
okay
alright
so as you can tell
I really practice in meditation
at arousing
energy and putting forth the effort
and
I want to know if there were any questions
I'd love to take time for questions
and this is if there's any personal questions
about your practice
any personal questions about the Dharma
questions about anything
I invite you to speak up right now
and I'd like to try to
address those
yes ma'am?
so glad you're here today
and
my question has to do with
resources or
guidance for
phenomena
it seems like you're touching that
when you speak of signs
it's
in the
unordinary experience
I find
security in the ordinary
and when things are
quite
just there's no explanation
or anything
I get nervous
so
I
have had the experience of hearing
an omnipresent voice
and that's just
a little too much for me
to really feel comfortable with
so it can actually limit
my comfort zone
with even meditating so thankfully
finding this practice does
feel very grounding
but I would love for
you to speak more because I think
that's a topic that I really don't hear other
people talk about
because they're scared
just like me
okay thank you so much for your question
you know what
seems ordinary
to one
may not seem
ordinary to another
so we have our own
sphere of experiences
and
so
while it may seem
ordinary to you or just unbelievable
to another person it can be very ordinary
you know
to another person that's their world
that's where they
live
but this is what I want to say about that
what makes us nervous
is when our
understanding is not full about something
we don't have a fullness of understanding
that's what
creates fear for
that creates fear for us
when there is clarity of understanding
and fear is abandoned
then there is no
sense of nervous then we become
confident in the wisdom
that in the wisdom that we have
and this is a gradual thing
this is a gradual training sometimes
you know we haven't had that much teaching
in the West on
rebirth linkage you know because that's another
topic that
generally teachers don't want
don't really want to get into
westerners but if you look at the
east and what so
aroused
the interest and the desire
of those of us who went to the east
and tried to bring back their teaching
was
the
it seemed like just a deep
understanding and a deep tranquility
that the people
had and that's because
of the total
teaching that they got
you know so there was something
in them that let them
they weren't so much interested in
individual attainment in this one life
but they felt
from a very deep
space within an interconnectedness
an
unification with
others and so there was more of
an organic movement
of the whole there was a
deep compassion
an exchanging self for others
we don't we have to work at
in this country we have to work at developing it
because our culture
brings us up
in a different way you know
so although we have
an abundance of money we have
great
technological
advancement you know
highly intelligent people yet with
the most neurotic people
with the most unhappy people
with the most insecure
people with you know
with the scariest people
and so we know that
fundamentally something
is missing on a very deep level so we
try to figure out what that was
and so they sit there and they meditate
but it's not just meditation
the Buddha taught the eight fold path
and that was just one
aspect of that path and it was down at
the bottom you know so he talks
about right
understanding you know and there's
a whole teaching he gives
on right understanding to lay the ground
work for the way
we think to help
point us in a way of looking
at the phenomenal
the phenomenal world
you know he said that
if there is
the born there is
the unborn what does that mean
you know so
he's telling us that no matter what we
can grasp phenomenally
with our senses there is
something beyond that
and if we start saying
well that makes us so uncomfortable
then we stay with our senses
and he said you stay with your senses
then you stay with what the senses give
us what we get through our eyes
through the ear gate you know
through our nose a sense of smell
through taste the tongue
through our
hearing through our mind which is our thoughts
and so we start a practice of just
noting the thoughts and noting the thoughts
and noting the thoughts noting the thoughts
and noting the thoughts you know
but he said there is somewhere to go
that we can put all of that away
and we can move to another level
this is this was the invitation so
many times when someone came
and asked a Buddha or something he said oh there's
a whole lot of teachers that will tell you
about that go ask them you know because
he was moving beyond
that point for those who wanted to go to
it does take
courage
it does take
an openness
a curiosity
a belief just like he had
you know he studied with the
greatest teachers of his day
and when he
had reached the levels that they
talked about
they said that's it he said no
I believe there must be more
they said no it's no more that's it
and he said there must be more
I believe there must be more
than that and he left
and he'd go to another teacher
and finally he said
there was nobody else that could teach
that could teach him yet he felt
there was more and he sat
until he attained himself and that's how he became
a Samasambuddha that means that
nobody taught him and so
those of us who have to rely on somebody
pointing away because I never got up one day and said
I believe there must be more
it was only because I
have read something
or I encountered something
or you know I had some experience
that I couldn't make sense out of
or that I went and I asked
the teacher even kids
ask us profound questions
I mean when they're six or seven and after we tell them
shut up so many times
they stop asking those questions
when the kids are going around we call it
with their imaginary playmates
but we know that's not so we know
even when our dog
is seeing something in the room and we can't see it
you know what now science tells
because you have such a narrow bandwidth
for seeing you human beings
but the dog has a broad one
you know and so he recognizes
something's in the room but your seeing
is not fruitful so he says
if we stick to just what we
can understand
through our senses
we will remain earthbound
and we will remain ordinary
and we cannot effect
our positive
change in the world
we're living in a time
we're looking for answers
we want to make change
we want to bring peace and it seems
so elusive why is it
because we have been
complacent
with the mundane complacent
with the ordinary and think that we can
pull it out of the wisdom
the human ordinary wisdom
that we have never been able to pull it out
yet and so
he gives us this invitation
to wade out
into the
center of the stream
he even called us stream
interest in the first
level of stream entry
and he talked about it and one of the three
characteristics
was understanding
of Anata
not self you know
and so most of us
who are not even ready
to talk about not self
have not even entered the first level
of awakening
in the
Buddha's dispensation
so I just say this
to give you some encouragement
that is somewhere to go
it's more than getting
a beautiful center
and coming in and sitting for
45 minutes at a time
and getting a little settled so I can
handle the fact that
you know my
401k is gone
or so that I can
you know or that my
children are acting up
and I feel like killing them
but I know we're supposed to do all him
so we're not harmlessness so
I come and sit here and I learn how
not to hurt them
so I don't have to put
five locks on my door
or so that I
learn with my friends and
I know that I'm supposed to speak of
whatever is beneficial
or fruitful of a good report but when they
start gossiping I just can't stop
you know I mean
it's for more than that
and that's what I wanted to encourage
you tonight to
seek out the more
than that
and with
Abhiyah
which is fearlessness
and in the meditation I'm
going to take you into tonight
I'm hoping you
have an opportunity
to
rest right at the bottom
at the foundation
of your house
and that we
establish it and pour the concrete
and that you can build upon it
as you move forward from this night
and I think
we can take one more question
can we? Well it's about
45 minutes left
maybe you could
answer questions after the meditation
would that be a possibility?
Yes
Do we need to
stretch? Do we need to stand?
If we do please
go right on. You know the Buddha said
all meditation doesn't have to be done sitting
he said you should know which one is for you
did you know that?
He said for some it's sitting
for some it's standing, for some it's walking
for some it's lying down
he said the one that endures to
tranquility for you
the one that allows you
to develop
a concentrated mind
that posture is the one that you should be in
so tonight I give you permission
to sit, to stand, to lay down
or to walk
back and forth.
In the Buddha's day when the Sangha got together
they got together
and they would share experiences
they would discourse
on things and different ones
would group together according to
what they were interested in.
Some followed Sariputa and some followed
Ananda and some
followed Mogulana because
they had different experiences
in the Dharma and different
skill sets
in the Dharma
he said it was
called being in the company
of good friends and he said that
good friends were the whole
of spiritual life. Ananda said
you know it's good that we have
friendship, it's half of the
spiritual life. The Buddha said
don't say that Ananda, don't say
that it's not half of the spiritual life
it's the whole of spiritual life
so when they came together
they didn't come together to meditate
they came together to fellowship
and discuss the Dharma and their experiences
and then they went out
individually and they meditated
we got it kind of turned around here
but that's okay, this is working for us
but I just want to let you know that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Breathing in I experience the
in breath. Breathing out I
experience the out breath. Breathing in
I investigate the breath. Breathing out
I investigate the breath.
As a Sawyer fixes his gaze
at the point of contact between
the wood and the blade
so I establish one point
in which I investigate the in breath
and the out breath.
It may be at the tip of the nose
it may be at the tip of the upper lip
it could be inside the nostrils
but I establish one point
and fix my attention there
breathing in naturally
and out naturally
Investigating the breath does it feel
warm or cool when I inhale?
Is it warm or cool when I exhale?
Is the breath smooth or is it rugged?
Is the breath long or is it short?
Is the in breath and the out breath
continuous or is there a break
between the inhalation and the
exhalation? In this way
I investigate the breath
mindfulness of breathing.
Is the in breath and the out breath
of the same length and duration?
Or is the in breath short
and the out breath long?
Is the breath getting more and more subtle?
Getting more refined.
Continually note all these characteristics
of the in breath and the out breath
like training a puppy to the paper
if the mind wanders off
just gently bring it back to
observation of the characteristics
of your in breath
and the out breath.
Is the breath slowing?
Is the breath getting more and more
subtle?
Is the breath getting more and more
subtle?
Breathing in and breathing out
directing all attention
simply to the breath.
Is the breath rhythmic?
Or is it ragged?
Is it like a staccato?
Or is it smooth?
Deepening our awareness
and penetration of the characteristics
of the in breath and the out breath.
Noting when the rhythm changes.
Noting how the body becomes tranquilized
through concentration
of the breath.
Breathing in and breathing out
Breathing in and breathing out
Breathing in and breathing out
Breathing out
Noticing the accompanying lightness
behind the closed eyelids
experiencing the sensations of
peace
of mind.
Breathing in and breathing out
Breathing out
Breathing out
Breathing out
Breathing out

Relaxing any tenseness that has developed in the body
if there's a pain just move and go back
to focus on the breath.
Breathing out
Breathing out
Breathing out
Breathing out
The calmness of the unification of mind and the breath
and the confidence.

Breathing out
A mental stability.
Breathing out
And we train the mind to coordinate with the in breath
and out breath so that at any time at any moment
we can attain this state of mind.
Breathing out
Breathing out
The sign is the bliss, it is the happiness, it is the feeling of joy
so we shift our awareness to that feeling and we just hold it.
