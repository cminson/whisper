Sati (4 of 5) Observing Change  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on April 2 , 2020  
 
 
I will now continue with the five -part series on the divine 
faculty of mindfulness, sati. This is the fourth of the five -
part series. The first two days I talked first about the 
initiating phase of showing up, waking up to the 
present . The second day I talke d about how 
mindfulness can include the clear recognition of what is 
happening in the moment. Both of th ese can be 
momentary phenomena. You can return to a moment of 
mindfulness , and that is valuable. But then w e get 
pulled away , and then a little later we  come back to 
mindfulness. Recognition also can be very powerful. 
The more clearly we recognize, the more freedom is 
there in the experience. But it also can be brief or 
momentary.  
 
The third aspect of mindfulness comes along as 
mindfulness grows stronger , and the pull of the world of 
thoughts lessens. This is mindfulness as observation. 
We are able to sustain a perception in awareness of 
what is happening in the moment . This phenomenon of 
observation occurs in the present moment , but it is 
sustained throu gh time. We are beginning to develop a capacity for concentration, for steadiness , and lingering 
in the experience.  
 
It’s like observing a river going by, watching it flow, 
sustaining the attention. It can be very relaxing and 
even absorbing to just watch  the river go by. That 
sustained attention is nourishing  and settling. It can be 
very nice. As mindfulness gets stronger, it takes on a 
quality of observation. That is the Buddha’s word – 
observation – to look towards, to watch after, 
anupassati.  
 
One quality of this observation is that , as it gets 
stronger, it builds equanimity. Observation is very 
simple. Observation doesn’t interfere with phenomena. 
It doesn’t judge . It’s like watching the river flow by 
without judging it , preferring a different rive r, trying to 
stop the river , or make it flow a different way.  It is just 
allowing it to be. Of course , there are times in life when 
that kind of awareness is not appropriate , but it’s also 
very powerful as a way of building up equanimity.  
 
The more reacti ve and judgmental we are  – the more 
we’re greedy, hateful, or attached to things  – the more 
helpful it is to cultivate greater and greater equanimity. 
This is one of the functions of this observation factor of 
mindfulness. Equanimity is not just for its ow n sake, but 
it helps us see the world more  clear ly. Certainly when 
we are out in the world, we tend to be wiser if there is tranquility and equanimity as part of our engagement , 
our care and concern  for the world.  
 
In meditation practice, we are withdrawing, stepping 
back , and really settling into our experience . As we 
become more equanimous, we see experience less and 
less through the filter of our ideas , commentaries , 
judgments , and stories. The observation gets simp ler 
and simpler.  
 
Because observation is happening through time , and 
because there is less and less overlay of stories, ideas 
of me myself and mine and what it means for me, 
predictions for the future – there is a willingness to rest 
in the moment with th e flow of experience. W e start 
seeing that flow better.  
 
We start seeing things arising and passing, coming and 
going, seeing things change. That change is not only 
the change of external phenomena, but there is a 
wonderful interplay between the changing nature of 
what we notice , and the changing nature of what is 
happening.  
 
Attention doesn’t generally stay fixated on one thing. It 
moves and oscillates. If you are following the breath, for 
example, and are really attuned to the stream of the 
flow of brea thing, many different sensations come into 
play. The mind may settle on one sensation more than another – an inhalation more than an exhalation, the 
pushing of the diaphragm, the pushing of the chest.  
 
The mind gently moves around . Even though it is 
settled on the breathing , it picks up different things. 
There is inconstancy, a changing flow of what we 
notice , because of the mind gently taking in different 
things.  It’s very interesting to tune into physical pain, if 
it’s not too difficult. If you really pay attention, you might 
see the interplay between the sensations of pain like 
little pixels of discomfort or tightness , and the mind 
moving around between them. Wh en concentration is 
really strong, the mind doesn’t pick up a solid mass of 
pain.  There is a dance of sensations going on.  
 
As the observation factor of mindfulness gets deeper 
and deeper, the mind switches from the story line , or 
the concept line of thin king about things to observing 
the changing flow of phenomena. It isn’t so much that 
we are looking for change and inconstanc y. It’s more 
like we just keep settling , observing,  and being  – 
allowing the observation, the recognition to get 
stronger, and settling in and relaxing into the present 
moment.  
 
Mindfulness has a lot to do with  relaxing , opening , and 
allowing the natural function of attention to operate – 
and to observe in a simpler and simpler way. As we go 
deeper, we start to see the impermanent, changing nature of phenomena.  
 
Some people wonder , “Why do that ? Why is that 
important? ” It may be that their concerns in life are 
important and need to be addressed. I t could feel 
almost like a betrayal to step away , and do this very 
simple, rudimentary resting in the changing flow of 
sensations as they arise and pass. After a while , there 
is not even any clear sense of bod y, or time , or things in 
the world. There is only th is flow of  sensations. That 
can’t be any good !  
 
Certainly there are times when the world needs us , and 
it’s more important to be taking care of what’s going on 
around us. But as I said , this is a very common human 
process used in all kinds of secular or daily areas of life 
– in spiritual areas, in ritual . This is an integral part of 
human life. There are times of stepping away followed 
by times of stepping in  – times of withdrawal and times 
of return. Meditation is like that. It’s a time of stepping 
away from everyday life so that we can return in a 
different way. The different way to which  Buddhism 
gives most emphasis is to return with freedom  where 
we are not clinging or attached to things . We return  with 
ease, ope nness, happiness, settle dness, and a greater 
capacity for heart qualities  – a greater capacity to care 
for the world with compassion , kindness, friendliness, 
empathy, appreciation, and delight  for the goodness 
around us .   
To come back to the world in that  way, it really helps if 
we can let go of preoccupations, let go of the things we 
get caught in that stand between us and this open 
awareness , this  presence in  the world. One way 
Buddhism does that is through mindfulness meditation 
practice.  
 
Each step I have talked about involves some letting go. 
In initiating mindfulness of the moment , we are letting 
go of something in order to wake up for that moment. 
To take the time to clearly recognize what is happening 
is a different activity of the mind than just g oing along 
with business as usual  – keep ing thinking . It is letting go 
in a moment of what is ordinarily happening in order to 
step back and recognize what is happening. To settle 
back and observe, we are letting go of what pulls us 
away. To be able to stay in the flow of observation of 
the moment  requires a deeper letting go .  
 
We start seeing and being in the river of life  – in the 
flow of things appearing and disappearing, coming and 
going, and changing. A t this deeper, primary, 
fundamental layer of our experiential life, it becomes 
clearer and clearer that clinging doesn’t work. Trying to 
block and resist what is happening  doesn’t work. 
Clinging doesn’t work. It doesn’t work because it is 
suffering. When we  really feel the stress and tension in 
the wanting or the pulling away, the desiring , the conceit, the planning  – it becomes more and more 
evident  that observing the flow o f arising and passing, 
and settling back into it is a very effective way to begin 
letting go of some of our deepest places of holding.  
 
We let go deeply – I would hope – so that we can come 
back to the world with open hands , an open heart , and 
an open mind . This process of mindfulness and 
meditation is one in which we are here to benefit the 
world. I think this is a natural process, to want to benefit 
the world if we have done the deep inner work of 
freeing ourselves.  
 
We’ll have one more, final talk on mi ndfulness 
tomorrow. I’m enjoying giving these talks, and I hope 
they are supportive for you. I very much appreciate the 
chance to be with you. Thank you.
