So welcome. Good morning. Good afternoon. Evening, I believe.
It's nice to see all the names and lovely. Yeah.
Mmm.
You know, I talk a big game about letting go.
And that's honest. I try to represent my life and practice with a lot of honesty.
But the Golden State Warriors played last night.
For those who don't know, it's the local basketball team, sports ball, some people call it.
And they're at the end of a kind of dynastic run and
it was a tight game. And I was, as the kids say, a hot mess.
And I had this moment as I was being told to calm down.
I had this moment of thinking like, I am not a person who anyone should ever listen to or look to for wisdom.
And I thought of you and smiled.
But here we are.
Something about caring for things that actually don't really matter that I like.
They won. They won, by the way, Steph.
Yeah. Okay. That's the intro for our meditation.
And let us contemplate depths of human potential.
Okay. So finding a posture that's sustainable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just in this first moment, just taking stock of your heart.
The impacts and residues of the day so far, the week, this year, whatever is here in this moment, just awake to the residues of the moment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We are relaxed, willing to feel whatever residues are here.
Thank you.
Maybe we use the breathing to smooth out the energy of our body-mind.
To unify the field of the body.
Cooling the hyperintensities in livening the unconscious or numbed out zones.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There is a kind of effort we make in practicing that we want to be careful about not letting our willfulness eclipse the grace of this moment.
The way is the self-based efforting.
Obscure is something important.
So you're invited to relax that too.
Thank you.
