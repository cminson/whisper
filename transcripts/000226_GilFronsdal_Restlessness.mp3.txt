 and it said that this was a second discourse the Buddha gave after his awakening. And a few years ago I was in the bookstore and I saw the fire discourse by the Buddha in an anthology of the most famous speeches given by humankind or the greatest speeches of human history or something and there was a Buddha and his fire sermon. And maybe you've probably heard it before but this is a part of it. He says, and you have to imagine some great orator reciting this, not just me here. The eyes are burning, the ears are burning, the nose is burning, the tongue is burning, the body is burning, the mind is burning, thoughts are burning, all are burning with the fire of greed, the fire of anger, and the fire of ignorance. The whole world's on fire and and we use the metaphor of fire a lot. We're on fire with anger, fever of anger we might say, the fire of passion. There's all these fires that we might have and some of these fires are quite agitating and sometimes we're addicted to them and like the doors who're saying, you know, come on light my fire. But the idea of fire being something which represents the agitated state of being when we're filled with jealousy or rage or filled with greed or lust, filled with desire, anxiety, regret. All these things can kind of be feverish within us kind of fire. Remember when I was a first practice person who went to Thailand to practice? I was very enthusiastic to say at least about practicing about Buddhism and I was talking to a monk and he said to me that my eyes were on fire and I didn't know, I didn't understand what he meant. I didn't know context for his reference but years later I realized that he was picking up on my excessive fervor. So the restless and agitated mind is all too common and I think that there's in modern corporate, modern technological culture the agitated mind is taking a new lease on life or a whole new, takes a whole new form in that there are people who are so driven within their work context, driven to use their mind and constantly kind of a compulsive nature of their mind which is kind of goes non-stop. They get up and they start work and you know they don't really leave work at work but they bring it home or they don't even, the home is a work or work is home or whatever and there's a constancy, a constant involvement with an activity I've seen some people they work eight hours, ten hours, twelve hours hardly worth a break at all using their mind in a particular way that actually lends a kind of fever to the mind, kind of feeds the potential of their mind to be compulsive or driven and so it tends to add to the agitation of mind, agitation of body. So much so if those people come to full stop and just sit down to meditate for a day or for an hour or for five minutes, one of the first experiences is that the momentum of all that agitation, all that drivenness, all that restlessness kind of is built up in the body, all the tightness and contraction which needs to unwind. So I believe, I mean I'm wrong but there's a whole other dimension to agitation and restlessness that comes from the way many people work in our society. I think it's very common. One of the qualities of agitation, restlessness is that it often is self-propelling or self-generating. We get ourselves involved in agitated mode, in restless mode and there's a way in which it fuels itself, it kind of wants more, kind of just always desiring more or wants to be more preoccupied and maybe it works a little bit this way that to be in an agitated driven or compulsive mode of being, it tends to alienate ourselves from ourselves. We tend not to feel ourselves. It's an uncomfortable state to begin with and it's a state of open alienation from ourselves and both those things, the discomfort of the state itself and the state of not being in touch with oneself, is an unpleasant state to be in and so that unpleasantness generates a desire to fix it, to have some solution, to fill that unpleasant vacuum and so we look outside of ourselves because that's what the habit is, compulsion is to keep looking and so we're driven to kind of look outside ourselves for something more. We get involved with too many things at once and the mind gets fragmented and so we don't just settle on one thing but that very unsettled feeling keeps us driven to keep looking for more things to fill ourselves with and we get more and more fragmented. And so physically we can be always on the move. I mean we probably know a lot of people who can't sit still at all. Their hands are constantly, fingers are constantly tapping or moving or their hands or their feet are constantly kicking around or they're constantly squirming and never really sitting still because their mind is basically, their hearts are agitated and it gets expressed in the way their body's moving and it's possible. I know I've had the experience of not really knowing what my body does when I'm agitated. I just kind of, my body does the stuff and I'm just so preoccupied or so caught up or so driven that I hardly notice that my body's in this way and it's very fascinating of course to stop the fidgeting of the body and just sit still physically and see what happens to those energies of fidgeting. If you sit still and let them give them a chance to course through the bottom, through the body without giving expression to them. If we give expression to them it's often like it becomes self-perpetuating. If we stop moving rather than repressing it sometimes it gives it a chance to kind of unwind that it can't have. We just keep you know fidgeting our fingers or whatever we do. And then there's of course mental agitation and restlessness and this is quite common for meditators to experience because we discover how busy our mind can be and how our mind chases after thoughts and concerns and we try to sit down here and be somewhat still and quiet and present for our breathing or present in the moment and the mind has completely other plans. You've been planning for weeks to come here you know and your mind's not cooperating. The mind is restless. It's looking for other things and it's quite it can be quite tiring to actually sit down and watch. It's tiring anyway but to actually sit down and notice the consequences of the mind constantly chasing after thoughts and preoccupations and it really is a drain on us. And in the movement of the body and the agitation of the body, agitation of the mind, in that we're driven. They're kind of a drivenness a kind of compulsive nature to it. We often don't even notice the cost that has on us. We often don't even notice that we're agitated. We don't notice that we're restless because restless kind of carries us out of ourselves and in that out of ourselves we don't notice actually how we are. One of the fascinating things that can happen as people begin meditating and sitting on retreats for example is to discover that what they took how their mind operates in the normal life that they took for granted. This is the way all minds are aren't they? Thank you. This is the way it's supposed to be. This is the way God made us to be constantly chattering and busy and chasing after our thoughts and suddenly you come to meditate and maybe for some reason you settle below that level of surface mind is constantly chattering and you realize for the first time, wait a minute, this is not inherently being a human being to have this constant anxious chattering of my mind. It's possible to have the mind much more at ease and resting and at peace. So part of the, when our restlessness and agitation is all too common part of our lives, we can't take it for granted. We take it this is normal whereas it's actually completely unnormal. It used to be that working nine hours a day was unnormal. Now it's normal and working 10 hours is not normal or maybe it's worse than that isn't it? Some people work longer hours and you know if you work 10 hours a day at work then you're normal you know and you don't think about it because everyone else is working 13 and you feel kind of bad and guilty you're not working enough hours. So the way which it's all too easy for human beings to begin in some sense blindly accepting of the status quo even when the status quo is harmful for us. The same thing with our inner life, the agitated mind. So as I said the agitated mind can be self-generating, self-perpetuating. Desire breeds more desire and there's a number of reasons for that one is as I said earlier it's to be caught up in desire which is about the objects outside of us something we want. We don't settle on ourselves and so we alien ourselves from ourselves and so that the discomfort lends itself to wanting more. And this is not a good example but it's kind of maybe it's coming to mind right now. Some 20 years ago I had a wheat allergy and one of the characteristics of allergies sometimes wheat allergies is you crave what you allergic to and before I knew I had the allergy when I felt a little bit crummy I would eat and I worked at the bakery so I had lots of bread around me and I would get these wonderful baguettes and I would kind of comfort myself with the baguette because I felt kind of down until I eat some baguettes and I'd feel worse because I was allergic but I didn't know I was allergic I just knew I felt worse so I would want to comfort myself even more so I eat more baguettes and so there were times where I just eat myself completely silly I remember walking through San Francisco in the streets there thinking that I should be institutionalized because I couldn't think and I was thank god no one was talking to me and I just felt completely numbed out on this you know wheat poisoning the gluten poisoning and I didn't I was just stuffing myself anyway you know so desire sometimes the the excitement of desire excitement of wanting is so much better than having as um Calvin described this as the hubs getting is better than having when you get something it's new and exciting when you have something you take it for granted and it's boring but everything you get turns into something you have that's why you always need to get new things and hob says I feel like I'm in a stockholder's dream Calvin waste and want that's my motto so getting is better than having so let's get more getting is more important than just being so our restlessness can be very subtle of course I mean it's quite easy to point to the pervasive restlessness of many people in our culture our pervasive wrestlers is when it's really strong but someone who meditates and begins experiencing a little bit more calm in their life will start discovering that the restlessness is actually can be very very subtle and even the kind of conventionally calm states of being we say I'm really calm right now the mind can still be restless even in a calm state of mind even a calm state of being if the mind is even very subtly very small movements compulsively going after pleasure or going after avoiding and kind of pulling away from things that are unpleasant wanting that thought not that much more than that is not a good thing to do wanting that thought not wanting that to choose to kind of mind kind of it might not be in a kind of fast way but the mind is still kind of restless it's still kind of not settled completely even though 90 percent of us are settled the mind can still be somewhat restless it's interesting that you know in the traditional descriptions of how a person becomes liberated or awakened or enlightened person there are four stages and it's not until the fourth stage the final stage when person becomes fully awakened that restlessness has completely been uprooted so you can be somewhat very enlightened let alone unenlightened and and restlessness is going to be part of your potential part of your psyche always even when the mind gets very very quiet and tranquil there's going to be some level of restlessness still operating so it can get very very subtle so that's why it's a very interesting topic for meditators it's not just simply a matter of looking at restlessness when we're kind of conventionally restless but even as the mind gets very very still and quiet it's useful to look and notice the restlessness of the mind the restlessness of our thoughts our thinking of our body in fact the restlessness is understood to be one of the universal companions of our suffering that if there is suffering then there's some element of restlessness there as part of it and some might even say that the restlessness is the cause for a lot of our suffering i don't know if i'd go that quite that far but um restlessness really really for some people really the key element that keeps them driven in a way that keeps them suffering keeps them contracted so the mind is agitated when it's reaching for things or avoiding things or recoiling from things when it's the mind is agitated and restless when it all too easily jumps on board and holds on to a particular kind of concern that you're ruminating over thinking about and it's hard to get off that thought train there's kind of restlessness there if it weren't restless there wouldn't be the clinging and if it wouldn't be the clinging it'd be easy to step off and let go of that and just let it self liberate itself into nothing we're looking outside of ourselves we're looking inside of ourselves for some answer to be always looking for something inward outward as an answer means the mind is restless if we're looking into the future oh yes tomorrow or the end of the day i'll finally be happier the end of the day i'll finally have that great experience of calm that was always wanting to always be looking ahead or looking for someplace else for the answer the mind is restless in that moment was kind of actively pursuing something beyond itself and outside of itself so what are some of the causes of restlessness in you do you recognize agitation restlessness when it occurs and what are some of the causes within you for it what are some of the ways in which you can relate to it one of the classic causes of restlessness and anxiety agitation is regret or fear of blame shame if you've done something that you regret or you've done something that you're afraid someone's going to catch you for having done you're afraid of being blamed then the mind is often agitated this kind of restlessness of the mind that occurs and in the time of the buddha in the buddha's instructions he said that preeminent antidote to restlessness was to live a blameless life to live a life which no one could could blame you for having done something wrong you don't go around stealing or taking what's not yours or lying or doing anything that you can kind of someone someone a wise person kind of blame you for saying well that wasn't a good thing to do so to have regret for your past actions and not having having come clean with it not having maybe confessed or come clean with you know what you've done is a cause of restlessness and in a sense that's a kind of healthy restlessness if you've done something that you regret and you really harm someone else it's actually beneficial it's actually normal thing it's healthy to have some kind of agitated agitation or some sense of ill kind of being a little bit off when you've actually done something to harm someone so the buddha stressed the importance of living a clean life and if your life is not and hasn't been clean then come clean from that day on or the best you can um we all make mistakes so it's very useful to come clean to to confess remember some years ago i was working on a friend's computer and i think i did something odd but anyway the computer crashed and i remember i i was kind of pretty concerned you what's he gonna think when he comes home you know and so i just came clean right away and the computer crashed you know i was wanted and so i did and he said okay well after dinner i'll look at it and i was like oh or when my when i was a teenager i was 14 and my friend and i um crashed my father's car into a bulldozer and um so uh-oh we didn't have a driver's license even we just you know found the keys and off we went into the bulldozer and um so i called him up and he said you know explain to him what had happened and he said does it still drive and i said yes and any problems well it can't open the right hand door he said well see what you can do about it and i'll be home tonight that's the extent of it you know he i think he knew that i felt really bad and um but he didn't feel any need to get angry with me or do anything you know just like the situation itself was enough so i came clean i said i could call them i said what happened and still drive yeah see what you can do about the door and um i was never ever abandoned for driving his car without a driver's license we didn't get very far of course because we didn't know how to drive we just basically turn the turn the key on the engine on and plow it into the bulldozer which is parked right right next to us so living a life which is blameless living a life where we come clean it was really helpful to develop a um unagitated state of being now in the west of course many of us are agitated about ourselves not for anything we've done but because of some assumption we have that something is inherently wrong about us and you know we've lived an exemplary life we've done you know we've never never done anything to harm anyone our whole life we've been saints you know and you know and just impeccable and everything we do and and we just completely convinced that we're just like the most rotten person on the planet you're completely unworthy of anyone's love or love so it's a kind of western sign of anxiety about self which seems to have nothing to do with our actions and the buddha didn't really address this it wasn't maybe back to 2500 years ago that wasn't such a common phenomena but you know that's the whole and that's the whole area for psychotherapy for example is that kind of anxiety about who we are existentially which has no basis in fact it's just an assumption that we've taken on or some imbued inside of us um unfounded ideas we have about ourselves which are really deeply rooted in our emotional psyche and so it's very important then to try to heal our woundedness and that's part of what uh both practice and therapy is supposed to help us do is to help us heal us from some of this woundedness that leaves us feeling that we're somehow wrong or bad and it can for unfounded reasons so that also can make us restless another thing that makes people restless is their concept of self building and sustaining and defending a sense of self a self-concept self-adinity um and what one of the reasons why we get restless in doing that is that any concept we have about who we are is inherently unstable it's inherently incomplete none of us is fits beautifully into that category the mold this is who i am and so if we're holding on to some concept and idea of who you are whatever it might be it's always going to be a limited version of who you are and it's also going to be unstable version because concepts you know reality flows and changes much faster than concepts do and certainly who we are so so if we hold on and depend on a certain concept of self we're depending on something which is unstable and incomplete and so it's not really going to ever going to do do it for us it's not going to be it's not going to provide us with a kind of security provide us with kind of well-being they were trying to get by holding on to this concept of self or building it or defending it and so we're always going to be left a little bit agitated and a little bit restless there well let's do a better job let me defend myself a little bit better let's do something else um let me read um so at one time the buddha was staying in the town of kosambi and in this town there was one who resented him and who bribed wicked men to circulate false stories about him under these circumstances it was difficult for his disciples to get sufficient food from their begging and there was much abuse ananda said to buddha we had better not stay in a town like this there are there are other and better towns to go to we had better leave this town the buddha replied suppose the next town is like this what shall we do then then we move to another the buddha said no ananda there will be no end in that way we had better remain here and bear the abuse patiently until it seizes and then move to another place there are profit and loss slander and honor praise and blame pain and pleasure in this world the enlightened one is not controlled by these external things they will seize as quickly as they come this is the eighth world they dharmas which keep people agitated if we're concerned and chasing after these things and these things are really important for our well-being will remain agitated because they're unstable profit and loss slander and honor praise and blame pain and pleasure so somehow the buddha wasn't going to be influenced by these things he wanted to keep his inner stability perhaps another time the buddha said if outsiders speak against me or against my teaching or against the order of monastics you should not be angry for that would prevent your own self-conquest similarly if they praise us but you should find out what is false or true and acknowledge the fact and even in praise it is only a trifling matter it is only of trifling matters that an uninitiated person will praise the buddha so he's not really interested in praise people don't really understand if you're if the buddha who's so well developed spiritually someone who's not developed themselves has no understanding of the freedom of mind the heart of the buddha so he doesn't care about the praise that people give not to be concerned not to be moved and swayed by praise and blame not to be not to be swayed by people's criticism of us but rather just to simply take it oh what's the truth here what's the falsehood in here and then move on from there and i think for many people that's a very difficult place is when we get criticized we tend to get very agitated i run over one of the exercises i would recommend you it's difficult to arrange for this um i i was lucky enough to fall into it one day and that is uh when you find yourself as someone who's really angry with you um and really furious uh just sit there and uh and receive it without saying anything and i did that once and i was going to i was curious see how long the person could attack me without me saying anything and it lasted an hour i was just kind of like wow i was my mind was going wow this is amazing i was just like in awe wow wow you know and um it was a great thing you know great exercise in mindfulness and how not to take things personally and not to be agitated just kind of just like the wind going through you know it's kind of like wow amazing and um the next day the person came to me and said you know that was so helpful so useful because always before when i get angry at people they always run away and you're the first person who stayed there with me it actually helped me come to better terms in my anger anyway so i have the chance you know i don't you know don't don't don't orchestrate the occasion but to look you know look for the opportunity maybe to just to be a recipient of anger and just be amazed rather than defensive there's this interesting uh passage from this then the venerable anurhoda went to where the venerable sari putra was staying and on arrival greeted him courteously after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies he sat down on one to one side as he was sitting there he said to sari putra by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human eye i see the thousand-fold cosmos my persistence is aroused and unsluggish my mindfulness is established and unshakened my body is calm and unaroused my mind is concentrated into singleness and yet my mind is not released from my compulsions my mind is not freed from my clinging then sari putra answered my friend when the thought occurs to you by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human i see the thousand-fold cosmos that thought is related to your conceit when the thought occurs to you my persistence is aroused and unsluggish my mindfulness is established and unshakened my body is calm and unperturbed my mind is concentrated into singleness that is related to your restlessness when the thought occurs to you and yet my mind is not released from the from compulsion and not released from clinging that is related to your anxiety it would be well if abandoning these three qualities not attending to these three qualities you directed your mind to the deathless so after that venrbal anuruddha abandoning conceit restlessness and anxiety not attending to these three qualities directed his mind to the deathless dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent and resolute he in no long he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which klansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing and realizing it it's for himself in the here and now he knew birth is ended the holy life is fulfilled the task is done there's nothing further for the sake of this world and the venerable anuruddha became another one of the arhats the fully awakened ones so in terms of restlessness that was very interesting that um sorry putra says that your thoughts about my mindfulness is well established my persistence is aroused and unsluggish my mind to to to associate these qualities to a self to me myself i'm the one who's doing this i'm the i'm the agent i have these qualities that's still the mind is still operating on the level of restlessness to make that assumption and that sounds very strange to some people because it's not a completely reasonable thought to have you know that i'm sitting here with lots of energy and persistence i think when the mind is really settled and really at peace in itself to even formulate the idea this is my mind which is concentrated the mind has to be able to be restless and agitated for that to happen and now that's a bit that's a bit challenging to many people the idea that i'm not supposed to have any thoughts about myself who am i then if i'm not thinking about myself have you ever thought about that another cause of restlessness is wanting certainty and security it's almost that our desires for security leave us insecure leave us restless the mind is not settled on itself it doesn't know how to be at peace with itself maybe the mind are is too easily swayed by the eight eight worldly dharmas and so it looks outside of itself for something which can provide security something which is going to apply to for our well-being and this is a classic spiritual teaching of course you know we look outside of ourselves for happiness for security and since everything outside of ourselves has some level of instability we're putting our eggs in an unstable basket or the the famous quote in the vipassana world some woman said i forget how its quote goes so i'll drop it but but in that we look outside of ourselves the instability of what's outside of us is counterproductive works against us and actually keeps the mind a little bit agitated or quite agitated there's this beautiful letter that uh ajan cha wrote to ajan sameto maybe you guys know about it the story goes ajan cha never really wrote letters to anyone he was just a forest monk who lived in thailand and ajan sameto was his american student who many of you know and ajan sameto was living in england then the habit of a monastery there and ajan cha was shortly before he he uh he had i guess had a stroke and became uh kind of mentally incapacitated he wrote this to ajan cha due to ajan sameto whenever you have feelings of love or hate for anything whatsoever these will be your aids and partners in building the paramitas building good spiritual qualities within you that's a wonderful thing statement to make whenever you have love and hate when a traditional buddhist monk talks about love he means basically means kind of neurotic love of clinging and attachment um he says those are actually your aids almost like your friends those are those are the this material you're going to compost that's what you get that's what you're going to work with so rather than being at odds with these things when they appear you're in a kind of way of welcoming your very difficulties because this is where you're going to develop your spiritual qualities the buddha dharma the buddha teaching the buddha practice is not to be found in moving forwards nor moving backwards nor in standing still this sameto is your place of non-abiding so this is a little bit interesting not moving forward not moving backward and not standing still many of us talking about you're finding a center inside of ourselves we can rely on at least you know that balance center inside of me i had to find my center i lost my center and he's saying here basically forget about your center you don't even stand still you don't even stand on your own center but you also don't move forward you don't move back you're not agitated you find the place of non-abiding you don't abide anywhere and that's the greatest ability that's the great place of greatest peace is when you don't have to you don't have to settle any place at all rest any place at all the mind doesn't move forward into something to get something the mind doesn't avoid and move backward and it doesn't rest where it's at but rather just it's kind of like maybe like um like a you know a boat in the middle of the ocean you know a sailboat in the middle of a great storm that's big waves and stuff the essential thing to do is to take down the sails because if you keep sailing you have too much velocity and you'll fly off the big waves and slam into next one or slam down to the troughs troughs so the waves and boat will break apart but if you take down the sails and have no momentum no speed then you'll just pop up and down the waves and i've been in huge storms where you know it's completely safe because you're just kind of bopping up and down and you're not abiding anywhere you're not hanging you're not going forward not going backwards you're not anchored anywhere but you're just kind of kind of riding the waves peacefully howling wind around you the place of non-abiding one of the most uh uh pervasive causes of restlessness that's often sometimes the most subtle and and the most useful area to explore is the movement towards the pleasant and away from the unpleasant it's almost the amoeba like movements of the mind or the of our being towards pleasant away from unpleasantness keeps us agitated keeps us restless we want the pleasant we want to avoid the unpleasant and a really important part of dharma practice of sitting practice and meditation practice is learn how to be at peace with things regardless of whether they're pleasant or unpleasant not to hold on to pleasantness not to be chasing and running away from unpleasantness but simply whatever occurs whether it's pleasant or unpleasant to stay present balanced at peace unagitated unmoved by that so how do we cultivate restfulness or the unmoving mind or the non-abiding mind one of the ways is by appreciating stillness by appreciating the value of being unmoving not chasing after things not being agitated in the body not moving a lot when we're sitting now there's a wonderful meditation called the mountain meditation where you visualize yourself stable like a mountain unmoving like a mountain and no matter what happens in the mountain storms thunder lightning whatever the mountain is unmoved by just standing kind of poised and balanced so you imagine you especially if you sit cross-legged it works well because you're kind of a triangle imagine yourself balanced and poised like a mountain but it helps to develop stability and stillness of mind and heart and body if we appreciate the value of it and one of the values of it is what i talked about this morning is that there's an then as soon as you kind of start holding yourself somewhat still in a gentle unrigid way physically mentally that that what you very quickly encounter is the ways in which you're not still and a very important place of practice is in the interface between stillness and movement what happens there in that in that place between the two of them what happens to your desire to move what happens to your restlessness when you can't move because you meet your your commitment to stillness we learn about ourselves a lot and we can kind of get deeper into the roots of ourselves much more easily at that interface between the two doesn't mean you have to be hold hold yourself tight and rigid but appreciate the value of the stillness which is always there and related to this is to meet your restlessness with stillness or meet your restlessness with acceptance meet your restlessness with mindfulness to take an interest in your restlessness not to give into it by fidgeting more or being agitated more kind of chasing up those compulsions but turning the mind mindfulness into the restlessness itself and how it feels in the body how it feels in the mind is it is like you know it's one of the key things we do in mindfulness is to return into things and feel them as they are rather than letting them continue to to drive us and run us in all kinds of ways so we feel physical agitation to let the body be the container for that agitation to let rather than moving and giving expression to the agitation make your body this big container within which the agitation is like this huge ping pong ball which is kind of just bouncing around or you know just add you know 10 000 bumblebees which are kind of going crazy inside of you just kind of let the agitation just move within you and just let it kind of bounce around in there it'll it'll quiet down pretty quickly if you hold it in the bigger container and the same thing with mental agitation let it occur in a in a mind held spaciously it's interesting if you if you find yourself really agitated someday go some place where it's really peaceful really still like some big open room like come here where no one's here or something and let your agitation be felt in inside all the space of this room and you'll find probably agitation will settle pretty quickly if you make a bigger container of stillness for agitation that can often help so the awareness itself the awareness held still gentle compassionate open awareness held still be committed to staying present to the agitation to hold the agitation to cradle it is one way of letting mental agitation kind of settle itself really seeing it clearly and seeing what causes it so we can investigate it what's the cause of it am i defending a sense of self am i agitated because i'm trying to create a sense of self here am i agitated because i'm trying to have pleasure am i agitated because i want security what is the cause of it you know again this thing idea of having a finding center inside of yourself it might be a useful uh sense to have and a useful idea to have but you might experiment rather than having a still center having a still container can you be a still container for what's going on because then you're then everything's happening within you if you have a still center then maybe there's kind of a duality between you and what's outside of you the agitation which you don't like one of the interesting places to see the sense the interface between stillness and movement because the two things that happen together and the the um what we're developing in practice as a practice mindfulness develops stronger is a kind of this kind of a sense of these things they're not really separate exactly or they're i don't know i don't know it's very difficult to describe how this stuff works but it's as if um all the movement of life all the impermanence of life none of it that we resist none of it we stop none of it we judge none of it but it all happens within the larger field of stillness of calmness of peace one of the medical examples i like to describe this i don't know if it works for everyone but it works for me um is um um i've been in uh in situations driving where i've been in a very near accident and um it was obvious that it was just i just missed you know some major accident maybe would have taken my life by just the hairs and you know nothing happened but you know and as soon as you know uh you know moment or two after i realized everything's okay and um you know the the concerns i had just before the accident the preoccupations i seemed so important no longer seem so important anymore you know how to brush with death and and suddenly there's this tremendous stillness all around me like suddenly there's all this stillness and uh peacefulness that seems to be all pervasive and i'm still driving i'm still thinking a little bit and still kind of aware of the movement around me and everywhere but it's all happening in this all pervasive stillness of mind now we don't have to go be looking for you know near accidents just like we don't have to go looking for people to be angry with us but uh but it's possible the one trying to point to is a possibility of having a tremendous unmoving mind unmoving stillness unmoving unmoving movement still movement still movement maybe it's like a river that's flowing and there's no ripples it's a really clear maybe shallow river it's really clear and no ripples and and no bubbles or anything in the river and you look in the river and you don't think it's moving because it's so clear but you put your finger and you see that's moving i don't know if that's an analogy that works maybe well maybe what i'm talking about is kind of a little bit more like a mystical state so it's very hard to kind of describe but the unmoving moving the stillness and movement which hold each other one of the very powerful ways of cultivating stillness and unmoving calm and dealing with restlessness is to seriously consider who we are and what we need for our self-identity what we need for our fundamental peace to actually consider it to reflect on it and in doing this perhaps emptying of ourselves maybe shedding letting go of the kind of self-preoccupations which self-concepts which are really extra not needed so this is one exercise that's interesting to do kind of a thought exercise is think about all the ways ideas you have about yourself what you will be in the future and how people are going to see us based on what we think is going to happen in the future so think about those and let go of those and think about all the ways in which you hold some idea of yourself based on what happened in the past oh 10 years ago i once yelled at someone so you know i must have some problem with anger you know or yesterday or maybe many times you know but i must be an angry person because of all the times in the past think about all the conclusions you made about yourself because of what happened in the past they're based on memories and let go of all the memories of who you were then think about all the ways in which you consider who you are that arise out of comparative thinking you compare yourself to others who are better do it right and all that and let go of all the comparative thoughts and then think of all the ways in which other people see you other people judge you and see who you are and assume who you are those are other people's ideas so let go of all those ideas and then think of all the assumptions you have about who you are probably lots of you probably you think there's all kinds of assumptions about who you must be and let go of all the assumptions and once you empty yourself and let go of all those different categories i described who's left you probably find yourself much more at peace going through that exercise because actually we need nothing we need to be nobody for anybody in order to be at peace it's possible to be completely at peace and not have anything to defend or anything to build or anything to create the mind which is at peace doesn't require anything to find that that that peace of heart that is unswayed by praise and blame criticism success and failure to be a no one to be a nobody trying to find the great peace of not having to be anything for anybody including for yourself and finally we cultivate stillness but not looking inward not looking outward for a solution stop all your efforts are looking for something as a solution just be with how you actually are so the buddha said this is a very famous passage very important passage he said one who clings is agitated so he defines you know one of the primary causes for restless and agitation is we cling cling to things one who clings not is a very important one who clings not is not agitated one who clings not has no agitation there being no agitation one is calm there being calm no craving exists where no craving exists there is no coming or going where no coming or going exists there is no arising or passing away where neither rising or passing away is there is neither this world nor the world beyond nor a state between this just this is the very end of suffering so if there's no craving no clinging the mind does not move but as soon as it's clinging the mind is in movement but if the mind doesn't move if you discover that unmoving mind that holds all the movement that holds all the input that unmoving mind and unmoving stillness that itself is the same thing as being freed of all your suffering because in that unmoving there's no clinging so may your minds and your hearts discover that wonderful unmoving place where it's not reaching for anything to cling to or anything to resist and may you delve deep into your restlessness and come through to the other side to that which is unmoving so thank you for listening so patiently thank you for the wonderful day and we could probably use a few people to help us maybe sweep the floor here and clean the bathrooms anybody here a few people can volunteer with that
