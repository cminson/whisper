Attitudes

Something interesting to be mindful or conscious of all 
the time is your attitude. Generally when we enter into 
and act in the world, there’s some kind of attitude 
operating.  Sometimes that attitude is obvious. We know 
it, and we even warn our friends [laughs], “I’m grumpy 
today so stay out of my way.” Sometimes what’s going 
on is not obvious . Sometimes it might take years to 
discover that there is a n underlying, fundamental , 
background  attitude through which we always see the 
world, and always understand ourselves.  
 
Whether it’s obvious or not so obvious, take a few 
moments periodically, to look back at yourself and say, 
“What’s t he attitude with which I am seeing, hearing, 
smelling? What’s the attitude within which I’m thinking? 
What’s the mood? What’s the orientation? What’s the 
concern? What’s the emotional background that 
everything’s operating under?” That background mood 
or attitude can cast  a big impact on how you think, how 
you see, and how you understand things. That attitude 
can skew you so that you misunderstand , because you’re always seeing through  the filter of the attitude.  
 
One of the more common background attitudes people 
carry  is an attitud e of fear  – the world is  a frightening 
place . I always have to be on the  lookout  for where the 
dangers are , or how to make myself safe. Another 
background attitude is that I need to prove myself , so 
that I can hold myself up and be someone . Yet a nother 
is that  the more pleasure I can get , the more successful 
I’ll be . So I’m always wanting , and looking for what I can 
get. What’s here  for me?  
 
The background attitude almost always is referring 
everything back to  some idea or ima ge about who we 
are, who we think we are , or who we don’t want to be . 
This constant self-referencing is an attitude  that there’s 
something here to build up, defend, apologize for, 
protect, or hide.  
 
It might be interesting in a very simple way, without a lot 
of analysis or wondering or probing, just to periodically 
turn around, look back at yourself , and ask the question: 
What attitude is here? If it’s obvious , great ; take that into 
account.  If it’s not obviou s and nothing pops up , then go 
back to your breathing , and ask again later to see what 
comes up.
