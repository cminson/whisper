 The last week or nine days or so I was teaching retreat and there was a person in the retreat who said something to me, very simple, that somehow resonated partly or kind of stayed with me in my mind for a while and partly stayed with me because of the Dharma talk that was given on Friday evening of the retreat. And this person had known Krishnamurti for many many years and I think he had been kind of a close friend, perhaps our friend or someone who worked with Krishnamurti for many many years. So he knew the man very well and Krishnamurti was one of the great non-spiritual spiritual teachers of the 20th century, really remarkable man, remarkable teaching. And Krishnamurti in some ways opened the door for me to Buddhism because when I was about 19 maybe, 18, I picked up a book by Krishnamurti called, I believe it was called Beyond Violence and in that book he talked about anger a little bit and he talked about the practice of paying attention to the anger and that was kind of the beginning of this idea that you could pay attention, that was a useful thing. So this man, this person had known Krishnamurti for many years and he said in the course of our conversation about Krishnamurti that Krishnamurti had only said things if he was asked. If he was not asked he didn't say anything and after he died they kind of regretted they had asked them more. And this idea of only speaking when asked kind of stayed with me in a little for a while. So the Dharma talk on Friday at the retreat was about three topics that were considered, represented as being very intimately related and supportive of each other in the same way that the pyramid is kind of all elements are related and the three elements were are solitude, listening and speaking. And the idea is that solitude is the base of the pyramid and listening is kind of halfway up. The top of the pyramid, the very peak I guess would be speaking and if you have it in that proportion then you have speaking in a balanced way. But if you turn the proportions upside down I guess or you're speaking first, the pyramid upside down you try to focus on speaking first and then it's easy to topple over. So solitude, the capacity for solitude is a foundation for the capacity to listen and listening in a capacity for the capacity to speak. And I gave a little story of my early life where I had the first time that I really spent time alone for extended period of time and I was given, I was left alone on a dairy farm in Norway for a week I guess I was 21 and to take care of the farm. Well the farmer, the two farmers, the husband, wife left for vacation and I wasn't planning to be alone but it was a quite rural farm far up a valley end of a road and the only person who I saw during the course of a week was I think once I saw the mail carrier come up the road. Otherwise I didn't see anybody and I had a lovely time with what I call my five girlfriends, farmers can be polygamous, you know I had lovely five cows that I took care of and but in the course of staying alone you're not talking to anybody, not engaging in social conversation. What I noticed in the course of the week was my mind got calmer and stiller and my perception got more and more acute and I noticed externally that if I looked at things things seemed really sharp like highlighted like really clear like a sparkle in the way that I'd never kind of almost never seen before in my life, that's how clear the kind of clarity things can have. And what surprised me the most was how acutely aware I became of my own thoughts and it was like they were highlighting it felt really special kind of unique kind of that my thoughts kind of so clearly seen just like you know and I felt very in a sense intimate both with the world around me and with myself felt very satisfying very wonderful and then after a week my friends came back and very quickly that intimacy and that stillness that calmness that I had disappeared and when it disappeared it became my question and my quest for many years in my so-called spiritual life was to discover how to be alone with other people. I suppose I could have thought you know well that was great I think I'll become a hermit but it didn't occur to me because I just took for granted that I was going to be involved in society. So the question was how can I have this sense of intimacy and perception acute perception and presence sense of independence sense of you know this sense of integrity that came when I was alone how can I have it together with others where I found it so hard to do that. So that for many years then that was kind of like behind my practice and my exploration of practice and how to apply practice in daily life was how to discover that interface and be that way. And I feel very grateful to my Buddhist practice meditation practice and helping me cultivate what I hopefully call a healthy sense of solitude a capacity to abide not only independent in a certain way but independent but also deeply at home here myself in this place and you understand the value of that much more I think if you understand the way we get pulled out of that home or that kind of healthy solitude into social relationships for example. One of the ways that I was to tend to be pulled off into social relationships often have caught by it was a tremendous drive I used to have to be liked. Now it's okay to want to be liked I think it's a normal kind of thing but you can be neurotic about it and you can go through a tremendous amount of social gymnastics in order to try to make sure that people like you and I did it until I was so sick of it until I was so painful to go through this gymnastics and only when it was really painful can I see it well enough that this is crazy and then slowly I could kind of release the grip of it but that concerns me like to be concerned about how people see me is a way of being pulled out of oneself out of being in touch with this kind of solitude this kind of healthy sense of being oneself or being in oneself if we can use that language. So there's all kinds of fears that come into play when we're all socially with people there's all kinds of ambitions and desires and all kinds of ways in which we kind of are concerned about our social relationships and if you kind of go along with my vocabulary a little bit kind of give me a little bit of freedom to I think it's useful to distinguish between what can be called the social self or the relational self and maybe what we call the independent self. The relational self is that idea of who you are, that sense of self that we have that we form in relationship to other people and it's really an essential very important kind of way of being in the world is to understand how we are in relationship with other people how we affect other people how other people affect us how we project on other people or how we see them and the views we have there's a tremendous amount of thing that goes on in our social world it's a very important part of it and if some of that relational part of self selfing doesn't happen appropriately as children then children grow up kind of a little bit off difficult for them so it's a very important part of who we are but if a person thinks that all they are is the social self the relational self then the adult is in trouble because the relational self is never going to be stable it's not a fixed thing you don't kind of look for your true self and find it in a relational self who you are in relationship to the world because that's going to change and shift over a lifetime and over time and over different people I found it fascinating when I was younger just to notice how I was different with different friends you seen that notice that some of you and that is kind of fascinating to see you know it's kind of like and then some people I know like to bring friends together who come from different parts of life and it's kind of like odd and you don't know how to be anymore because you're supposed to be one way with one person and I think some of that's normal and then if some of you maybe have been to different country, spent time enough time in different countries and cultures to know how people are different in different languages and not just different culture the people but like myself I grew up some in Norway some in Italy and some in the United States and I'm different and I was different in each of those cultures to things I could speak in Italian I couldn't speak in English and ways of being that I felt I felt it's inside that I was kind of different and I've known as noticed that other people who've kind of been bicultural or something that they seem almost have a little bit different personality depending on the culture that they are speaking through at that given time so the relational self is something which is fluid and changeable and it's contingent it's conditional something comes together because of causes and conditions there's nothing that's inherently who we are in some deep fundamental way in the relational self and but there is another kind of self that the Buddhists are reluctant to call a self so we don't want to use language too strongly too firmly but the idea that there is a way of being in the world where we're deeply at rest and rainbow can you go go with him please actually maybe a mark would you please we had one incident before with him so just abused to the relational self we care about each other and so but there's a place of being at home with oneself or being at home or at rest or at peace where that peace is not dependent on what goes on around us or relationships we have with people around us and I think a lot of what Buddhist practice is pointing to a meditation practice to is that possibility of discovering a kind of a peace a kind of a well-being a kind of rest that is not contingent upon the external world being any particular way or being in relationship to anybody and now it's quite interesting when people meditate especially like on retreat and you notice this how many of our relationships we bring with us and and we're still kind of working out the relational sphere you know for two days or three days in retreat how long is the last some for some people when I went I did an eight-month retreat once and in Burma and eight months of basically in silence and after about two months on the retreat I was pretty still pretty concentrated and I noticed that I had all these thoughts still that came up and grabbed me here and there about the San Francisco Zen Center which was a community I had lived in for many years and many of us had my main teachers were from Zen Center and I worked there and I always thought I was having conversations with people and concerned about how some of the teachers saw me you know I wasn't Burma they couldn't see me and and I was interested about you know my job promotion at Zen Center if I go back there maybe I can be like get this job and that job you know and you know you can move up through the ranks kind of thing and I just couldn't believe it in here I wasn't Burma I was on retreat and how insidious these subtle subtle thoughts preoccupations of this relational self was still operating there and and so I got to see it and in my situation I made a vow that I wouldn't go back to Zen Center until I got Zen Center out of my mind because I you know that wasn't free as long as it was there so sometimes in meditation or in other situations like that we can start seeing you know how much the relational self has really gripped the mind holding holding us tightly and and part of the part of what meditation can do is begin to relax that grip and soften it and eventually maybe even let go of it entirely that concern if you let go enough to find some very deep abiding some deep peace and deep way of subtle way where what Buddhist will say you have no concern about self at all uh selfing is not going on at all so to have that kind of rest and that kind of peace to be able to rest that way then is a marvelous condition for being able to listen carefully because then you can listen without an agenda and but if you have the relational self operating big time then it's all too easy to kind of be concerned about what people are saying and thinking what you're saying and doing and projecting and looking this way and that but if you're deeply at rest I think a lot of the projections that we have in transference as that goes on in conversation tends to fall away and relax so um so we have no agenda so we can listen more carefully listen deeply to what's going on there's a beautiful quote by Rilke he says he takes it as the most important task between two people to protect each other's solitude and I think it's a great quote and um it's he says something like it's the nature of the indifference of the crowd for the for the individual to be lost to which we lost to lose our solitude so to listen deeply in such a way that we are at peace so that the other person can be themselves fully at peace that they're not having to negotiate or through your agenda that you have in the conversation then meeting someone who's you know leaving them alone so they can be who they are it's said sometimes one of the best biggest gifts you can give someone is let them be who they are so to listen so being able to not have an agenda allows listening and listening is very important listening can be to oneself can listen more deeply to yourself and you can listen to others and I think listening to others is supported by being able to listen to oneself at the same time there's an art to tracking and paying attention to what's going on here as you speak the thoughts you have the reactions you have the motivations you have and then to track those as you as you're listening so that you know where you come from when you get ready to speak reminds me of a story stories told often from the Ramayana the story of the god Rama traveling through the forest in India with companions and Rama hears a faint voice really faint voice and he listens carefully and the voice is very quietly saying Rama Rama Rama and he asks his companions if they're hearing the voice and they say no we don't hear nothing and so he kind of follows you know the voice kind of goes towards the voice and then he comes to this big boulder and that's big boulder is um if from inside the boulder comes this voice saying Rama calling him Rama calling him and so he lays his hands on top of the boulder at which point the boulder I forget how the story goes but either breaks open or dissolves or transforms and this woman emerges from inside and she thanks him and she says oh a long long long long time ago I was somehow bewitched and was stuck in this boulder until you could come along or someone could come along who could hear me calling them and offer their you know and somehow break the spell so he was able to listen but part of the value for me in that story is the name of the woman is Alaya and Alaya in Sanskrit means home like him Alaya means snow home so um you know home is calling and it's calling very faintly it's hard to hear and it's very shy it's very hard to hear that place of rest and peace inside of us it's calling us please come and it takes a lot of careful listening to be able to listen in a sense or sense your way into that place of being deeply at peace and home with oneself if you're involved in a lot of busy life if you're involved caught up in the social world too much you're not going to be able to listen and part of the reason to meditate part of the reason to spend time alone in the wilderness or you know just alone anywhere and to have kind of space sacred leisure is so you can start making space in your mind to listen deeply to the home the Alaya which perhaps is calling for you there's also listening then to others and I'm fond of the saying which is supposed to be attributed to um the curious how you say it um the ancient Greek philosopher who said who said um god gave us two ears and one mouth so we could listen twice as much as we speak and um so um to listen carefully and one of the ways of listening in conversation so you're not just passive is to ask questions you know you know be interesting what the person's saying and kind of draw them out I find it fascinating often I learn so much that way by asking questions and I notice in myself sometimes that I'm in a conversation that uh I'm listening and there's an impulse to speak and there's an impulse to speak sometimes even wanting to interrupt the person and then it's very interesting to pay attention to listen to what that impulse is about what's that sense of urgency what's the sense of what's what's the compelling feeling why is this compelling feeling do you feel like you need to say something my guess is half the time that you feel a compelling need to interrupt someone you've been caught in that relational self and that's really what's motivating uh the desire to speak so um so you spend time listening both to listen to your other person well but also as a mindfulness exercise to learn about yourself well you'll learn a lot about yourself by not speaking you also save yourself a lot of grief um here's a quote from Mahatma Gandhi my hesitancy in speech which was once an annoyance is now a pleasure takes a while to get the hang of this you know so my hesitancy in speech which was once an annoyance is now a pleasure its greatest benefit has been that it has taught me the economy of words I have naturally formed that habit of restraining my thoughts and I can now give myself the certificate that a thoughtless word hardly ever escapes my tongue or my pen I do not recollect ever having to regret anything in my speech or writing I have been spared many a mishap and a waste of time experience has taught me that silence is part of the spiritual discipline of the seeker of truth proneness to exaggerate to suppress or modify the truth wittingly or unwittingly is a natural weakness of people and silence is necessary in order to surmount it a person of few words will rarely be thoughtless in his or her speech she or he will measure every word so the top of the pyramid then is speaking and some people counsel measure your words don't speak too much and I don't know if that is necessary to be an aesthetic around speech I think it is lovely to have a coffee shop talk sometimes it is really fun to sit over a coffee table and just kind of go back and forth and get excited and talk about a topic and explore and see what happens but um mindfulness of speech being careful with our speech the buddha gave four different guidelines in different times but four I think now four guidelines for when we should speak and how to be careful with our speech and some of you might wonder why in the world should you and it's been said that most people choose their clothes more carefully in the words they speak maybe it should be reversed but there's a four criteria for when to speak the first is only speak if what you're going to say is truthful the second only if it's kind the third is only if it is useful and the fourth is only if it helps bring people together or create concord or create harmony so if what you're going to say is going to be divisive then maybe you should not say it and see if you can say what you need to say in a way that's not divisive if what you're going to say is not going to be heard no one's going to hear it then you know then don't don't don't waste your your breath sometimes you know we feel like we have some conflict with someone but the other person's not capable of hearing maybe you should just not deal with it if they're not capable of hearing what needs to be heard is it useful and then you know is it kind and kind doesn't mean kind of sugary kind or romantically kind sometimes you know there's you know there's a tough compassion or tough kindness but is it kind is it your intention in speaking one of kindness and then the first one is it truthful is it really what's you know going on if it's not one of those four things maybe you're better off not talking being silent to use to investigate and use look at your speech from those four criteria I found it myself to be phenomenally powerful to look at what motivates what I speak I believe that it's so powerful that someone really was careful with it and it's very hard to be careful it's hard for me to be careful around this but the more careful you can do this the more benefit you get but you're very careful to notice why you're saying what you're going to say not the surface reason but while you're saying what you're going to say it'll provide you one of the best windows you have into what how you tick what goes on inside the one of the royal roads to the unconscious and so to take the opportunity of your speaking or your impulse to speak to try to understand yourself better as opposed to speaking and losing yourself in the speech I've known so many people who have had out of the body experiences while they're speaking but they didn't know it you know if you have an out of the body experience it'd be nice if you had a nice trip someplace but you know they're just kind of lost in their words not in their body so I think a number of things I've said today are hopefully something that will interest you to experiment a little bit with experiment with cultivating solitude or if you can't cultivate a lot of solitude at least practice a little bit of silence see what happens with silence in your life a little bit more maybe take a week or a day or an hour where you can intentionally take more silence or more solitude and see what happens another thing you might be interested in trying is listening more and exploring the world of listening maybe take one day where you're just going to listen you know turn the table upside down you know or whatever just listen as much as you possibly can don't contribute anything unless you're asked and another thing you might be interested in doing is experimenting with speech experimenting with maybe one of those four criteria at different times just explore the area of truthfulness explore the area of kindness or of usefulness or of concord I find it very interesting to say you have concord just speak in such a way that people feel more connected to you even when you're in conflict even when they hate you can you talk in such a way that somehow you know you feel more closer rather than continuing the division and then I'll offer you one more interesting exercise that you might try maybe for one day if you can manage and that is spend a day where you don't talk about anybody who's not present and then pay attention to your impulse whenever you want to talk about someone who's not present to understand why and what and what's going on for you and a lot of talking about other people who are not present is innocent enough is fine but sometimes it's kind of not so fine gossip and rumors and all kinds of things go on and talking about third party is not present but you might take one day just one day of your life and you might warn all your friends ahead of time to this day I'm not going to talk about anybody who's not present and then see what happens when you do that learn from that so those are my thoughts for this evening and we have a little bit of time if any of you would like to ask a question or comments or your own talk a little bit about your own experience of working with any of these three areas yes we started your talk I think that someone asked you a question but I don't think we have to open the question at the very beginning of the talk I said someone asked me a question is that what I said it's so long ago it was like 40 minutes ago go Krishna Krishna I had this conversation with a man who who had told me about his experience with Krishna Murthy and the Krishna Murthy didn't speak unless he was asked first asked the question first so there was a lot of things people wanted to know after he passed away but they'd forgotten to ask him I didn't encourage them to ask him and he didn't volunteer unless he was asked maybe that's yes oh we should be past this I shouldn't be holding it is it turned on you see the little switch I'm curious about how you have dealt with you were talking about sort of being liked by other people yeah how have you dealt with that what has helped you deal with that with the idea of wanting to be light a number of things have helped I mean one of the things that helped was seeing it really clearly and I only saw it so clearly when it got painful and so there's there's benefits in suffering you know seeing something so clearly you really have to see it you have to admit it's there and sometimes it's easy to admit something's not there you know pretend it's not there or not even know it's not it's there it was not painful when it starts getting painful we see it so it was actually very helpful for me that's really caused me to take it seriously and look at it another thing that helped was sitting a lot of meditation but at the time in my life when I really was confronting this I was living in a monastery and so we were doing a lot of meditation so I was going in and out and in and out of sitting quietly and going back in relationship and coming back and sitting going so in the in the sitting I was able to let go of so many things and then the state of letting go was able to go back and explore the world of relationship and see it come up again and you know in a course of a day I went back and forth a number of times and so meditation for me was very valuable and it's still valuable for me that to stay centered and balanced myself I see what's going on much better another thing which has been helpful is beginning to address or being able to identify or see some of the things that are behind the desire to be liked you know some there's a there was a level of fear a level of insecurity that I carried with me and so being able to see that fear and insecurity was actually more useful than seeing the desire to be liked and so being able to see that and then working with that and sitting with that and practicing with that with my practice I mostly did this through meditation practice because I was mostly that's where you know you know I was in monasteries and stuff and and other people sometimes eluded in therapy and other places so those are some of the things simple things that I was doing. Any suggestions on how to maintain mindfulness when relating to difficult people? How to maintain mindfulness when relating to difficult people? Sometimes it's easier when it's difficult people sometimes what I know for me when I'm most challenged that's when I better you know I kind of get revved up a little bit to be like this is important I better pay attention here as I get kind of aroused you know so that's you know so I often use that as a cue you know I pay attention to my body and my feelings and if I'm getting aroused or having a lot of reactivity then that's the time to stop and pay attention and that helps. I find asking questions very helpful sometimes difficult people depends on the difficulty people are bringing but sometimes showing interest in people and asking questions can disarm difficult people and when I was thinking about the monastery a lot but when I was at the at zen center for a period of time I was like the point person for original people who came to came visiting and there are people who are there are some people who are very original minds and they kind of wander off the street they're kind of homeless or this and that and so somehow I was I was they always find me to kind of talk to these original people and mostly I found just showing an interest in them and and being kind to them and and you know trying to understand what they need and what they wanted was helpful it's you know it's what do you find most difficult about difficult people it's such a huge topic so I'm kind of just fishing around but maybe if you can give us a little more specific thing I'll tell you a wonderful story of Mullah Nazardim. Mullah was this great Islamic Mullah, clergy, who was very wise. All these are wisdom stories, Mullah and Nazardim stories. And they're kind of funny, some of them. And Mullah had a garden and he had a problem with dandelion. There were weeds in his garden and they just kept coming back and taking over his garden. Tried everything, he went to all these gardeners and garden shops and books and tried all the different vices. Nothing seemed to work. There were weeds in his garden, these dandelions. And so finally he went to the king's gardener. And he was supposed to be the greatest gardener in the whole kingdom. So he went to the great experiment, the king's gardener, the old wise man who had been gardening for 80 years or something. And he explained the situation to the king's gardener about how everything he tried, all the different things he'd done. And he still couldn't get rid of these dandelions. And so the king's gardener was quiet a little bit and then finally said, well, in that case, I suggest that you love the dandelions. So, you know, if you've tried a lot with these difficult people, you might see if you can shift your perspective on what you're trying to do. If you're trying too hard or trying a lot and trying to change the relationship, change them or trying to fix it, occasionally it's the wrong approach. And sometimes it even is counterproductive because people pick up that you're trying to fix something. And what's most needed or what's maybe most effective sometimes is your kindness and acceptance of them. That sometimes works. But, you know, people are so different and circumstances are so different. I feel reluctant to... But what other people have found? I mean, I trust that a few of you at least have had difficult people in your lives and some experience. What have you found useful? So listening to the person is useful. Someone else? It's kind of letting the person be as difficult as they are and just accepting it. It's changing my relationship with how I relate to them and saying, well, that's just how they are. That's why it's worked for me. For me, most often when I perceive someone as difficult, there's something that I'm wanting for myself. So there's some kind of self-motivation in it. If I can recognize that, then often my perception of them shifts. Beautiful. Thank you. All the way in the back. Hello. I had a very difficult relationship with a boss and it was carrying on after I retired a number of years. It still would come up and I couldn't even say the name without feeling it. And finally I realized, well, a friend of mine married a woman who had five horses and he didn't know anything about horses. And this boss of mine also had horses. So I decided I will call and ask her to educate me on horses. Just I needed to take an initiative. I needed to ask her for something. And so I did and she told me a couple of things about horses, which I unrelated and I've never had that feeling about her since. It was to take an initiative and admit that she could help me to myself. And it just, it was beautiful. Well, maybe it's enough. It's nine o'clock and I don't want to become your difficult person for the evening if I just go on and on. So thank you for listening and, and, you know, a little bit of a paradox or odd for meeting the importance of listening and being quiet and all I do all evening is go on and on and on. Thank you.
