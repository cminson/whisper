 So I thought that I was thinking that we're still continuing the introductory course that ended two weeks ago. And the session is kind of after introductory course. I kind of like to continue on topics that somehow build on what we talked about. And so I have kind of two ideas of what to do this evening. One is to give a talk about walking meditation, because it's a very important part of the practice we do. And the other alternative would be to take this time just to answer questions. You've heard me speak a lot the last few weeks, and last week you had a guest. It might be nice to give you a chance to ask all your questions about the practice. So what would you like? A talk or questions? I heard more talk. Questions. Little of each. Okay, I'll try to do that. It might be useful to distinguish between two aspects of the mind. One is what we can call the activity of the mind, and the other is the mind's ability to be aware of what's going on, to be aware. And the two aren't separate from each other, because in many of the activities of mind we can be aware of the activities happening while they're happening. But activities of mind means many things. It means everything that the mind does. But one of the things that the mind does is it often enough is it chases after two discursive thoughts. It chases after ideas and concepts. And there's a way in which we can get ourselves wrapped up and preoccupied with particular thoughts, ideas, memories, plans in the future, whatever. And that particular planning of tomorrow, that particular memory of yesterday, that particular fantasy, or that particular concern, or whatever, begins to be the place that thoughts kind of chase each other, or get pulled each other, or I don't know exactly what they do, but off you go down this particular thought train. And there's all this mental activity around of thinking, around some particular concern, or many concerns. Some days it's just scattered, it's all over the place. And many of us live much of our life in our discursive thinking. And many of us, for many people, it's never occurred to them to live anywhere else. We grow up, at some point growing up we learn how to speak, and we learn how to think, and we learn how to think with concepts. And I don't know when it happens, and we're about a year and a half or two years. And then we're off and running, and forevermore in our thoughts and our ideas. And the idea that there's any alternative is completely foreign idea to some people. But one of the alternatives is, if you follow me with this distinction, is the mind's ability to know, to be aware. And knowing and the activity of the mind, I'm saying, are two different things. Because, for example, you can be involved in some kind of discursive thinking. And there can be this very direct and clear awareness or knowing that I'm thinking. What we try to do in mindfulness is to try to strengthen this capacity, very simple capacity, to rest in the knowing. Not so much we're trying to know more things, like chasing after more knowledge, but rather to rest in the mind's ability to simply be aware, as an alternative to kind of being, running around in discursive thoughts. The image of discursive thoughts is that of a, I had some years ago, is we had a little, in the house I lived, a little kitten. And at some point the kitten discovered its tail. And it was constantly running around trying to catch its tail. And it could never reach it. So kind of maybe thoughts are like that. We're racing around right after them, we can never get to them. And we get very stressed out, I think, with all the discursive thinking that we get kind of lost in and consumed by. And the more busy we get, ironically, the more busy we get with discursive thinking, the more preoccupation concerns are, the faster our life can often get it yet. And often less aware we are that we're lost in discursive thinking. There's a way in which all the discursive thoughts create a kind of veil over our ability to see clearly. And we don't see, we don't know what's actually going on. We kind of get lost so easily in this world. So to find some way to rest and just the ability to know, to be aware, is actually a very powerful way of living. And it's a kind of an alternative to thinking. Not so much to turn to the thinking, it's alternative to being possessed by our thoughts. It's interesting, many of us are so concerned with our thinking all the time that we have one thought and then we immediately kind of go to the next one. Immediately we're concerned about the next one. And immediately we're concerned about the next one. And we've never noticed that sometimes there's a gap between our thoughts. We don't necessarily think continuously all the time. There can be a moment where we're not thinking between the various thoughts. And who are we and what's happening to us in that gap in that moment between our thinking? And are we alive? Are we alive in a vital way? Is it a worthwhile place to be alive and vital in a place we're not thinking? For some people, I get very afraid when the mind is not thinking actively or in any kind of alternative place to be besides completely preoccupied in our thoughts because it's in our thoughts that we formulate a concept of who we are, the ideas we have of who we are, the ideas we have of how we have to be in relationship to everybody else in the world, belongs to the world of thinking and ideas. And if who we are, if we're attached to being who we think we have to be, and there's some moments where our thoughts are not operating that usual way, it can be very frightening because we don't have that reference anymore. Who am I in that gap between our thoughts? Because in the gap between the thoughts there's no idea of who you can be because there's no thoughts to have the idea with. Are you following me? Okay. So knowing is different than thinking. And the idea is can we find some way to rest in that? And knowing is pervasive. It's really part of our life all the time. It's here all the time. It's not like this weird thing that we imported from Asia, from Asian Buddhism so that, you know, to add to our life. You know, our knowingness, our ability to be aware is here all the time. So a lot of what the mindfulness practice is learning how to strengthen this capacity to know and finding that it's actually a wonderful alternative. It's a place where we can find some refuge, some peace, some rest, some sense of wholeness, some alternative to the kind of fragmented way we can feel when we're always in our thoughts and our preoccupations. So the five weeks of the introductory course was in a sense kind of trying to lay out the various ways in which knowing can happen, what we can be aware of. But the principle behind it all is this ability to know. And the beautiful thing about knowing is you can bring it to all of your life, including the most ordinary things about your life. And actually a lot of where spiritual life is developed is in the ordinary activities of living, of being alive. Someone once said that a spiritual life is first of all a life. I like that saying. Because sometimes there's a tendency to think that a spiritual life is a life that's different than our ordinary life. That we have to do something, we have to be really special, we have to do something really different. We have to go to a monastery or go to Asia or go do this and that. But it's first of all our life as it is. And it has a lot to do with how a spiritual life has a lot to do with how we live our life, not necessarily what we do with our life. And since most of us spend most of our time doing ordinary things, how we bring our practice, how we bring our knowingness, how we bring ourselves to the ordinary activities of our life becomes a very important aspect of Buddhist mindfulness practice. The how what we do. So for example if we go about washing the dishes or driving to work and we're like the kitten kind of chasing his tail in our thoughts, kind of preoccupied and worried about this and that and running around in our thoughts and what's going on. That's one how, that's one way of being. An alternative to that would be to wash the dishes and let the knowing rest in the washing the dishes to really allow yourself to be there and allow yourself to just wash the dishes to really wash the dishes not to kind of get lost in their thoughts or be preoccupied or be lost, distracted or to drive to work and simply allow yourself to drive to work with the knowingness that you're driving to work in a very simple matter of fact way. So there's presence, so there's kind of maybe some little level of calm, some settledness in driving to work. I know that I can drive around completely unsettled. I can turn on the radio and listen to the news and at the same time I can think about where I'm going, at the same time I can be upset about the traffic, at the same time I can be concerned about that sound my car's making. You know all these thoughts and concerns you know that actually in some ways pulled me out of the villages to be right here in this activity as it's happening. So one of the aspects of Buddhist practice is learning to find some joy and some worth wildness and actually in some sense being kind of simple in the ordinary activities we're always doing all the time, to find ourselves in doing the ordinary activities rather than doing the ordinary activities and actually being somewhere else because we're kind of lost in our discursive thoughts. One of the ordinary activities that many of us do is we walk, we do walking. The Buddha said there are four dignified postures for doing meditation practice in. The four dignified postures are sitting, walking, standing and laying down. And that's kind of supposed to cover all of it right? And so in all those activities you can do the practice. And so walking is just one other way of doing it. And because we kind of put a lot of emphasis on sitting, I do and I give the five week introductory course and I might never mention anything about walking meditation. And to a great extent by doing that I do a great disservice to those who listen to me who come for the introductory course which I apologize for because the implication or the sense or the idea that could be could be picked up is, oh sitting meditations where it's really at. And other activities well that's just kind of you know we have to do it but sitting is really an important aspect of the practice. But actually all our activities are equally important and walking practice is a very integral part of mindfulness training as anything else is. If you ever go on a retreat where one day retreat or 10 day retreat or whatever you'll learn that the walking period and the sitting periods alternate back to back and we'll walk just as much as we'll sit in meditation. We'll do sessions of walking meditation for 45 minutes or 40 minutes or half an hour or whatever and then sessions of sitting meditation and equal lengths of time of walking meditation. And the walking is considered just as important as a sitting. Some people find the walking meditation is actually more delightful for their daily life than sitting meditation and so their daily practice rather than sitting for half an hour or 45 minutes every morning they might do 45 minutes of walking meditation. And it actually seems to work nicer for them and kind of they connect to it better and they're able to kind of settle and be more present in the walking. So it's a it's a also the walking meditation as a formal practice has the virtue that it's much closer to our normal life than sometimes what's sitting is we sit here kind of still and we close our eyes and many of us have jobs that require a lot of sitting but it's kind of a different kind of sitting. But we all kind of walk most of us walk around quite a bit and or get about or there's different ways of walking and we get about we kind of move ourselves about mobile you know driving and rolling and all kinds of ways of getting about I mean it's all this comes to the same. So there's a formal way of doing it but but as we learn to do it in the formal way as we kind of formally do the practice then it kind of spills over into our regular activities also because we walk around. I know some people who make it a practice to every day do walking meditation where from the time they they get out of their car if they have this is if this is of circumstance until they arrive at their desk at work. So every morning they drive to work they get out of their car and they will be walking meditation that's 50 feet or 50 yards or however long it takes sometimes they might park a little bit further away so they can have a little bit further to walk. And that becomes a time it's kind of sacred time for them every morning where they actually do a mindfulness practice where they're not going to kind of be busy thinking and preoccupied and rushing off but in a dignified way to kind of slow kind of maybe kind of present kind of way be mindful of the process of walking in the same way that when you're sitting here you're mindful aware of your breathing what goes on within you. So the formal walking practice is relatively simple. As a formal practice we choose a walkway a pathway that's about 30 or 40 feet long and in some place where you're not going to be particularly disturbed or you know it was relatively easy to walk and the practice is simply to walk back and forth those 30 or 40 feet to keep the eyes open in this case but kind of down about 45 degrees to the floor not looking anything particular and keeping the hands in any kind of posture that seems comfortable. I often keep mine in my pockets when I do a walking meditation and simply walk back and forth at a pace and in a way that brings you a kind of sense of ease as you walk and most people can kind of find a sense of ease as they walk back and forth. Some people like to go for a walk when they're to cool down when they're angry you find some kind of ease kind of in yourself as you walk so to find a pace that brings you a sense of ease as you walk and often that's a little bit slower than maybe a normal walking pace. So just find that sense of ease in the walking back and forth and then once that kind of basic sense of ease is found it doesn't have to be dramatic just a little bit of sense of ease then sense the body kind of the whole body is like maybe like you imagine like you're a dancer and you're kind of moving through space like a dancer feeling from the inside what it's like to be moving and feel the body moving through space and then allow the attention to softly settle down into the lower legs and the feet because that's what's really the way the movement is happening is in your feet mostly and just like in the sitting we primarily pay attention to the breath or say differently the breath is kind of like the central point or the anchor that we keep coming back to so in the walking the central point or the anchor is the lower the feet and the lower legs as they walk and there's a kind of rhythm to the walking just like there's a rhythm to the breath there's one foot goes up and moves forward and comes down and then the next one and then the next one and simply to feel the sensations of that rhythm and to be there and the mind wanders away and then very simply come back and feel the sensations feel the rhythm and if you're walking somewhat fast you know then maybe mostly what you're aware of is the contact of your soul against the ground and you feel the pressure and the weight and just feel that you know alternately because feeling as it goes along and that helps you keep in the present you stay in the present stay in the knowing by feeling the feet touching the ground if you're walking slower and sometimes we'll naturally kind of end up walking slower if we're doing walking meditation because it's very nice to walk slow kind of you feel more intimate and calmer if you're walking slower you might find yourself kind of naturally going slower and slower then maybe rather than just being aware of the the soles of the feet touching the ground you're aware of the various sensations that come up as the foot begins leaving the ground the back foot kind of lifts up and you feel a kind of lightning and maybe a tightening a tensing of the muscles and then you feel kind of the movement of the leg kind of swinging through space and then you might feel the lowering sensations to release the relaxation the lowering and then the contact with the ground again and then the pressure and then you switch your attention to the back foot and you feel the same thing and it's not like this thing to strive for it's not that you're like really kind of grasping at these sensations but it's in this kind of sense of whatever ease you can find and doesn't have to be much you don't have to you can actually feel quite stressed out when you start doing walking meditation but if you can find just a hint of a little bit of ease in that context just kind of be with ease as you do the walking you kind of feel in that ease feel feet walking come back to the walking sometimes discursive thoughts get the upper hand and if you find yourself really lost in your thoughts then sometimes it's useful just to stop in the middle of your walking period just stop in the middle of your track and maybe even close your eyes and just take stock and just do little kind of mindful uh standing meditation standing mindfulness and just be aware of what's going on kind of do mindfulness of thoughts and feelings and emotions and kind of and once it's acknowledged and maybe processed then you can kind of continue with the walking um and it's lovely to learn a different how about how to walk many of us kind of walk at this point kind of automatically we don't give it much thought or we don't give it much knowing but to kind of learn and get a sense of appreciation that it's really delightful just to walk for walking sake now try to get somewhere i know i know in myself i'm trying to get somewhere there are times when i'm kind of subtly my grasping or my leaning forward is i'm kind of leaning slightly forward into the future or forward into the into the path like i'm trying to get something my thoughts are kind of ahead of myself and and my center of gravity is slightly projected forward but when i walk just for walking sake not to get anywhere particularly then i'm more subtle than myself my center of gravity is kind of going through my spine kind of a more subtle not leading forward in a subtle way and we can learn that in walking meditation appreciate it and then we can appreciate that that's actually possible even when we're walking we have to get somewhere you can actually need to get somewhere and not be ahead of yourself and actually just kind of walk with it you know you set yourself on that course and then you forget about it and just kind of don't anticipate where you're getting but just kind of walk in a way that you're walking in a mindful way this is a passage by a wonderful very sweet simple Cambodian monk named Maha Ghusananda who was living in Thailand during a genocide in Cambodia and because he's one of the very few monks that survived he announced the supreme patriarch of Cambodian Buddhism but he's just a very simple kind of guy i've met him she's really simple the Buddha called the practice of mindfulness the only way always in the present at this very moment from moment to moment and all activity in this very step this is why we say step by step each step is a meditation when the children in providence where he i guess he lives for a while when the children in providence see me off off at the station as i walk up to the train they shout slowly slowly step by step each step is a prayer and all the passengers look and smile this saying has become famous the children do not know english well but they know this sentence by heart they are the new Cambodia and already they know the way of peace in Cambodia we say a journey of 10 000 miles begins with a single step slowly slowly step by step each step is a meditation each step is a prayer so you might experiment a little bit as you go about walking in your normal life when you have to get somewhere to see if you can shift the how you walk to still getting where you have to go but shifting just walking for walking sake not to get anywhere and see if you can settle on yourself and just be present rest in the knowing of walking and maybe with time you'll find a very deep satisfaction in just being simply alive without the need of always be ahead of ourselves always kind of close to preoccupied with our thoughts another interesting exercise you might try at least once maybe some of you do this but anyway but find choose an hour somewhere or other and around your neighborhood walk for an hour for no purpose at all no direction in particular and just walk for walking sake without any goal for an hour that's an interesting exercise especially if there's an interesting exercise especially for those people who live compulsive lives which is 80 percent of the people in silicon valley 75 i don't know enough enough enough that it's useful exercise so that's a little bit about walking meditation so now we'll do the other half of questions yes i listen to this to this tape by joseph goldstein and he talks about the role of effort in practice and and he says there's this poly word that that the used a whole lot and he said the word was virya virya virya and i wonder what what what what you think of all that i mean what what what virya means and and what it means for us in the practice sort of the role that it plays oh it's a very important role there's a famous story of a man named suna i think he was a monk suna but before he was a monk he was a musician he played the lute and he came to the buddha and he complained said i've been practicing meditation or practicing practice for a long time now and nothing's happening the ends of the buddha kind of you got a sense of the situation and then he said when you were back when you were a musician playing the lute if the strings of the lute were too loose would you make beautiful music no just kind of go clunk and if the strings of your lute were too tight would you make beautiful music i said no it's just when they're just balanced when it taught this is just an imbalanced way then you make beautiful music then make nice notes and the same thing with effort and practice there has to be effort and practice but the effort should be neither too tight nor too loose but and it's a it's a task of each person to discover for themselves what that balance is and that balance varies from day to day a little bit just the right amount and part of practice is to find what the right effort is no one can really tell you what that is but you're going to find your own way to find that mid mid mid point if there's not enough and maybe synonym for for effort is engagement to be engaged in what you're doing to be engaged in the practice um you know you can stay at home and and and uh do a minimum amount of effort by just laying in the couch and staring at the ceiling and you know watching the television or whatever even that takes some effort everything takes some effort but that's kind of minimal right and you know and you get duller and duller and but um or you can kind of sit and try to be sit sit sit sit upright and or walk and try to kind of bring bring yourself back make the effort to keep bringing yourself back when you wander off keep committing yourself back but bring yourself back without straining without striving without judgment without criticism without attacking or dismissing something or saying oh that was wrong i wondered off don't be bothered by it we just come back to wake up to keep coming back and waking up and once we wake up and once we're present to try to maintain that but again not maintaining it by grasping at the present or at mindfulness kind of being kind of loose with it and if you're loose with it it kind of sometimes you wander off for sure if you're really grasping and maybe you won't wander off so much but you get the headache but if you so so if you have to make too much effort it messes up the practice but if you don't make any effort then there's no practice so effort is very important but it's a matter of finding that balance thank you yes i think it makes sense as you said at certain times in practice um and there are great obstacles in sitting practice with the mind being overwhelmed for an anxiety of early early discrimination and uh the strength of concentration of mindfulness in the face of uh those energies is very very small that it might make sense to uh cut back considerably on one's practice maybe i mean my sitting practice maybe even sit in short periods or 15-20 minutes and uh engage in more um walking meditation or meditation while doing tasks if the degree of concentration mindfulness is a bit higher in those situations rather than cultivate the habit of um sense being caught up in thought i see so what you're saying that if if if uh we're lost in a in a plethora of thinking and just we keep coming back it doesn't seem to help and we're kind of just we find ourselves kind of digging the ruts of thinking more and more and we're very restless or very preoccupied or something and that sitting maybe is not so useful then because we've sat we tried our best but it just seems like we're just kind of spinning ourselves more and more maybe developing bad habits that maybe some some alternative and one alternative that you suggested is sit shorter and sometimes if i sitting shorter you can sit for five minutes but just but by sitting that shorter time there's a kind of sometimes there's a way in which you add a better quality of attentiveness and ease because you know you only have these five minutes so i'm really going to sit here in a calm way in a present way but if you sit for 40 minutes then it just somehow because of the length of time it's the mind kind of comes in that's one way another way is not to sit at all sometimes sometimes it's not appropriate to sit if it's just too much restlessness and too much strong emotions or whatever and sometimes that's a wonderful time to do walking meditation and sometimes it can be very fast walking meditation actually kind of power walk back and forth because that walking and that power walking can can somehow allow you to contain the energy so you can be present for it and and be mindful of it without being overwhelmed or by at the same time sometimes taking a nap sometimes you know taking a shower there's lots of strategies but it's very well put and very very good point do you have more thanks do you have more to say that's it's no that's uh i think that's the same i mean obviously there's a skillful means yeah how one organizes their practice rather mechanically um or maybe at some point you have to have a sense of what's right i suppose the teacher's helpful at that point because you know i think he's deluding myself yes that's a very also very good important point that um uh if we have if we have too many options for how to practice they have all these skillful means there's walking and they're sitting and they're standing meditation and there's walking fast and they're walking slow and they're taking a shower and there's this and all these things i could do you know then um uh we can just kind of be constantly bouncing around because i feel a little bit uncomfortable now something doesn't seem to be working so let's try this and that you know and and there's something to be said about even you call it a mechanical but i i would have a kind of commitment to really try to kind of you sit for half an hour every morning and this is where you're even going to do this even when it gets difficult and uh and not at the first chance kind of both try to find different skillful means because part of what the mindfulness practice is is an acceptance practice and we want to learn to accept ourselves as we are even when things are really difficult even when we can't do the practice it's more powerful to accept yourself being unsuccessful to practice than it is to be a good practitioner does that make sense so so if you're constantly getting you know getting up and walking out to find a different practice to do so you can really do it but you haven't learned to accept yourself in a kind of rough kind of position you've lost an opportunity and uh so i think i actually kind of so so marty said you know maybe checking in with someone with a teacher or you know is sometimes useful if you find yourself wanting to vary the way you practice is to check out with someone else but yeah but uh you can use your common sense too and my teacher in berma he insisted that i never sit down to do sitting meditation unless i first did walking meditation and um and there was a way in which the walking practice helped settle me help provide kind of concentration and subtleness and presence but then would help a lot with the sitting and so for a long time after being in berma um if i sat when i sat in the morning i would not start with the sitting meditation i would start with 10 minutes of walking meditation and it was also often very nice the early morning because it kind of also kind of got the got me going a little bit kind of woke me up a little bit more and then i would sit down and i kind of be a little bit more energized yes how is this right and how necessary is to go back and forth because i think my neighbor's meeting that might be i think you go if you don't have a particular place in mind to go to you can't you can't go anything at all it's okay um because mindfulness can be done any any kind of way so given your circumstances you can you know do as you see fit uh one of the advantages of very important advantage of walking back and forth is it's simpler and if you're kind of walking around the neighborhood there is a part of your mind has to negotiate the path and you step around this you know car pulling out of the driveway and this and that and you know and then you have to kind of make sure there's no dog poop there and you know to kind of find your way and you can part of your mind is kind of concerned about it's very simple part of the mind but there's some kind of constant concern if you're walking back and forth in an environment it's a little bit protected pretty soon you know the route and so that part of the mind can actually be a little bit more at rest and that can be very useful and also after a while you kind of know that what's going on around you you're less likely to be distracted by sights activity around you if you walk around the neighborhood there's all these things that might actually pull you out of your simple presence to your body as you walk and into your thoughts and concerns about well look at that car you know they got bought a new car isn't that great i didn't know my neighbors you know and off you go right so so but if your situation is such that uh your neighbors are going to be ready to call you know the doctor if they see you walking any more back and forth like that uh then maybe it's wise you know to walk around the block or you can tell your neighbors you know i'm doing this is that this is a you know a 2500 year old tradition of how to meditate the last person to be enlightened in the lifetime of the buddha was enlightened doing walking meditation yes you know i had that experience where i live i'm in a little mother mama college in the back i was doing walking in the backyard thinking very private and then people in the front house were watching me and really concerned what is she doing at first they thought i was a man no they didn't even because i was wearing a jacket and threw up it was me and so fortunately someone in the front house recognized it was a form of meditation and well slowly over that as as as meditation becomes more familiar to our culture you'll be recognized more and more walking meditation is quite common in asia there's a lot of it and actually you have you have in different places especially in monasteries you'll have particular parts of the monastery set out for walking paths and they have all these they have walking paths you know specifically for that so uh with time we'll have that here too but it's a it's a concern like we're we're now kind of in the initial stages of trying to raise the money to have our own center here and follow this area so we can have our own meditation center and it would be nice one of our concerns just to be able to find a place where we could do walking meditation where it's a little bit of private so that uh you know we're not doing walking meditation you know out there on middle field you know and all the cars driving by and because it kind of if you don't know what's going on it kind of looks like you know all these all these zombies so it is a concern where you walk look what else yes it's probably not something you could incorporate daily but there is an interesting place for walking meditation at grace cathedral oh labyrinth nice and it gives you something to focus on nice and uh i found that there's a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of there's often new opportunities we're doing walking meditation uh if i'm waiting for something like waiting for the bus or the plane or waiting for someone to show up rather than sitting there kind of tapping my foot and you know or pulling up my hair or whatever i might do um just a walking meditation just back and forth and i don't really care too much what people think so walking back and forth most people you know it's pacing you know the guy's pacing he's nervous you know i wish he wasn't so nervous but he's pacing and um so i often often well you know if there's opportunity i often do still walking meditation and there was a time with our new baby that uh the baby seemed to do better we did better if we walked the baby and so i would put the baby in the carrier front carrier and go outside and just do walking meditation back and forth and the baby loved it just fell asleep nardi walking in nature allows for mindfulness um yes so so i i distinguished earlier between formal walking practice the formal meditation practice and then just you doing walking mindful walking is in all kinds of situations and there's a lot of value to doing very formally where it's so much simple and you're just kind of doing walking there's not a lot of different sites and to pull you out and into your thoughts and all that and it's also very valuable to kind of do it in all kinds of settings do it in nature do it at work do it on the way to work do it waiting for the bus you know but nature is quite nice and and i like doing in nature when i do it in nature then it becomes more for me a little bit more sometimes a choiceless awareness meditation rather than a walking meditation and the difference being when walking meditation i'm really trying to stay present for what it's like my body to be walking choiceless awareness is where i open the awareness up and i try to be aware of whatever arises predominantly in my awareness at any given moment so it might be for a moment with my a few moments with the feet walking and then i hear a bird song and i'm just there with the bird song and then i see kind of the dapple of light through the trees and then i kind of look and see that for a while and the mind kind of leisurely kind of goes and kind of is a presence for whatever the is it at that moment strongest experience and so nature is a great way it's very common can be quite a bit quite a quite a bit quite a bit it's a very strong there's a very strong forest tradition in buddhism doing all the practice in the forest and up in nature and and that same same thing as two ways of doing it there you can do it as a formal walking practice you don't pay attention to what's going on around you or you can do it more choicelessly and pay attention to things when i met this mahogu sonanda i had breakfast with him one day some years ago and he was talking about how he was on it he was on his way to england where he was receiving some kind of grant or prize or something from the british royal family to for a reforestation of cambodia and so i asked him somewhat just to see his answer i asked him you know what are you you're a buddhist monk and you're responsible enough for for rebuilding buddhism in cambodia and you must have a lot of busy work to do and and um you know why are you interested in reforestation and he said um he said basically what marty said that he said this is uh the buddha was born under a tree in the forest outside of nature in the forest he he was enlightened under a tree he practiced and taught under a tree and he died under a tree and it's a central part of buddhism is to have trees and have nature and place to go and practice so um yes kind of interesting that you distinguish between choice of awareness and then meditating as you are because i actually find that i focus more often at sometimes better most of the time better by choice of awareness because that's how i originally learned yeah it's a great practice it's uh in a sense it's uh the purest form of vipassana practice or it's the maturest form when vipassana our mindfulness practice becomes most mature it becomes a kind of choice of awareness exercise but what most people find is that um if they open up that choiceless kind of place too soon there's no stability and the mind just gets gets lost all the time just stays lost and so we use the breath as an anchor and so some people so it can be work and it can take a while to kind of get the hang of it which might be the case and sometimes it could be kind of initial kind of difficulty as we're kind of learning a new skill it could also be that there's a better anchor for you than the breath and if you like choice of awareness an alternative anchor kind of default where you keep coming back to when you get lost is to listening to sounds and so that's again you're selecting something to be the anchor and listening is a great one but choiceless would be open to the whole thing tastes and smells and sensations in the body and thoughts and just a whole whatever it might be and um so that's a great thing to do you don't have to do the breath as you as the anchor you can use sounds i was sitting here meditating thinking how much nicer it is to sit here where there's a sound to the bird rather than where i live where there's sounds of my neighborhood and i started thinking well is that um show the preference being partial i mean shouldn't i be able to shouldn't i be just as happy meditating in nature as i am in the city yes and we have to be realistic and pragmatic and if there's a preference that's that helps you to become more present more compassionate more more in your life then go with that preference for a while until your practice gets strong enough you can let go of that preference but don't don't don't necessarily let go of that preference while that preference can still help you but sooner at some point the practice you could you allow you kind of you're able to sit and find your presence without any kind of conditions so so so so so a useful way of being in during meditation time is to be receptive receptive to whatever your breath is receptive to whatever is happening inside of you receptive to the sounds around you allowing all things to be as they are as if they're kind of just passing through but you're present receptively for them as they do so so so so From love to justice I think it's difficult Listen it now Don't leave me unconscious So, if nothing else, I hope that today's talk inspires you a little bit to enjoy your walking more than you have. So, thank you all.
