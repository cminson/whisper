 So bringing our whole beings here, connecting our awareness with our breath, the felt sensation in and out through our bodies. In breath, rising, filling us, staying connected with it wherever we feel it. The out breath falling, leaving us, with many sensations, each of which we can feel. The out breath falling, leaving us, leaving us, connecting our awareness with sensations of the body, sound as it enters our ear, sensations that come from sitting in this space. The out breath falling, leaving us, the out breath falling, leaving us, being here for the sensations we're experiencing when they come to us, staying connected during their duration as they leave. The out breath falling, bringing simple attention to our thinking, to our thoughts as they pass through our mind. The out breath falling, allowing our awareness to be with any emotions we might sense. As they rise in our bodies, in our minds. In a few moments I'll ring the bell, and we can allow our awareness to open to those sounds as they rise for the length of their duration as they pass away. The out breath falling, I'm wired. Good evening everyone. My name is Carolyn Dilly, and Gil asked me to come and speak with you all tonight. He told me that this is the last of his introduction to mindfulness meditation, the last class in that series, the last week. Generally in this tradition we talk about mindfulness and meditation in our daily lives at this time, at the end of the series, and so that's what I'm going to do tonight. I think so often we make a distinction, particularly when we're just starting out with mindfulness practice between the practice and our daily lives. I think we have a habit of compartmentalizing things, and that's partly due to the way we're trained to differentiate and make distinctions, and that's partly to do with just the way our minds are set up to compartmentalize. That's the way we learn a lot of things, which is very wonderful and useful to us. But it can be unhelpful when we turn our attention to spiritual inquiry, because that kind of inquiry asks another way of learning that's not a compartmentalizing way of learning. We're so used to linear thinking, to black and white cause and effect, one thing following another, that sometimes we kind of get ideas in our heads about what we might need to do to really get into spiritual inquiry. I think this is very common, I certainly remember that I had ideas like that. For example, in order to really go deeply into mindfulness and spiritual inquiry here, we might have to lead a really renunciate life or become like a monk or a monastic. And we have often in the background of that, and sometimes unacknowledged, that if we're just kind of going along and living our lives, and we're doing any less than complete full-on renouncing the world, that we're not really getting it. Or sometimes we can just be kind of confused and up in the air, because if we just started sitting and started this practice, you've gone through the first four weeks of it, hopefully, and have kept coming back and integrating it in a way as best you can. So you've done that, and that little bit of sitting down that you've established, has kind of brought such a refreshment and a relief that it contrasts in a very stark way with the rest of life. Oh my goodness, the rest of everything is totally messed up, but when I sit down and just meditate, then it's very nice. So I'd like to explore a little tonight and look at it from a little different perspective, perhaps, which is that daily life is meditation practice, and meditation practice is daily life. And just by viewing them separately, by formulating a question of how to integrate them, one with another, we're likely to miss the actual fact that they are one and the same. At the same time, there's always at the same time, it all goes together. It's useful to look at practicalities and techniques and things we can do. And I'm going to suggest some that have worked for me, not just me, but from my own experience, I can say this, and many other people as well. And these are grounded in the Buddhist texts of awareness and intention, concentration, all the things that have been kind of unfolding during this four weeks of introduction to mindfulness, awareness, mindfulness, concentration. And I know that each one of us will discover ones of our own that work for us best in our lives. So I'll just say a few. I found it very helpful to read a poem or to aloud every day, that it's really wonderful how the resonance coming from our own body and the reflection of our body and mind kind of come together when we read a poem out loud. We hear someone else's words, yet it's coming through our body. So it's that kind of an integration that works for me. And it also, just as mindfulness itself does, the practice of sitting down to be aware and be mindful, it kind of gives a different perspective. It's really nice to do this in the morning before or after the morning paper. It's a little different view on the world than what the paper is bringing us or the news if you watch the news. Another thing is to maybe take a walk with no aim or goal in mind. And that can be a walk. It's nice if you can do it in nature, but just a walk around your house or around your apartment. And just noticing all the things that are around there in kind of a simple way without making, just keeping your mindful attention on what your eyes notice, what your ears notice as you walk around. And you might have to get up a little, it doesn't have to be a long period of time, maybe just five minutes and you get up a little earlier to do this. If you get up early in the morning, you can just hear the birdsong and just be aware of that. But if some people, that doesn't work for getting up early, you can at night, go out in the evening and listen to the sounds, smell the smells of the evening. You can also kind of play with in a playful way, in the sense play of holding things lightly, explore balance in your life and harmony about with your work activities and your social activities, your family activities. And then, of course, paying attention to your body is always very, a great ground for awareness practice. To know when it's alert, to know when it's really tired, to know when your body is truly hungry or just eating from habit. Another thing for you, I'm not sure, I should ask, it just occurred to me, because I didn't really check in with Gil on this time, but have you done some metta practice or loving kindness practice in this? We haven't done any of that. Okay, we'll skip that part for another series. Of course, a lot of this, what I just said, it's just common sense in a way, but so often we get wrapped up in our lives in a way that excludes our common sense. It's good to know we can touch base with that. And that that is a part of spiritual inquiry, connecting with our whole being, bringing all the parts together, including our common sense. It's just another way of saying that our meditation practice is our daily life and our daily life is our meditation practice. Because these practices that we do are natural ones. They're accessible to anyone who chooses to explore them. They're not esoteric and they don't require special settings like Himalayan caves or great renunciations. And there are many others, of course, other people have other suggestions, and we each ourselves come up with these, these arise in us naturally. So the ones I've just briefly listed perhaps might be helpful, but if they leave the impression there's like a laundry list or, or kind of, you know, a book that you can follow to do to become happy and free specific things, then, then they won't have been useful and they will have been misleading. Because there's no list and no book. It's, it's our life is the book for each one of us in each moment. And it's not so much about a program that we set up because setting up the programs is often we, we can often feel guilty if we don't follow the program, which is not a good cycle to get into. You know, in one sense there, there kind of is a program, I think, but we're following it more than, than, than, or it's kind of following us. It's, it's unfolding in our lives in each moment, each day, each breath. A metaphor that I like from one of my teachers who teaches, who talks here sometimes, Angie Boisivan, is, is that we're kind of being cooked by our practice. We're like the pieces of onion and carrot and celery that go into the soup, you know, the soup simmering kind of softens up all these pieces. It softens up all these bits of us. And it just happens naturally and we contribute our flavor to the broth. I like this for a lot of reasons. It points out to, you know, first of all, how we can just relax. It's not a program. It's going to happen. It is happening, you know, it is happening. We're in the soup. We're in that pot. I mean, in one sense, the only thing we need to do is, is put ourselves in the pot. There is some intention involved, in other words, to just sitting down with the intention to be aware. All the rest happens. And we nourish ourselves and others by this process. And of course, we can be mindful at any moment, whether we're on the cushion or not. The important reason that we do come together like we did tonight and sit down and do a formal sitting practice, a sitting practice, or do it on our own each day, is to remind us of what mindfulness is, is that it's a very deep part of our human nature. It's our birthright. It's born within us. We come with mindfulness. It's part of our collective genetic code. Suzuki Roshi, who was a Zen teacher and started the San Francisco Zen Center many years ago, he put it this way. The purpose of meditation practice is to discover the freedom that exists in our minds and bodies. And sitting meditation is a training that carries into every aspect of our lives, just as the soup nourishes every part of us. When we eat that soup, it nourishes our eyes and our blood and our brains and our minds, every part of us. I'd like to mix up a bunch of metaphors now. And perhaps this will kind of serve as a kaleidoscope, I hope, to take in different parts of this picture so that we might see how mindfulness works in our daily lives. Because it's interactive like a kaleidoscope is in a way. We turn it and it reveals to us, we take into our eyes and our minds, our brains, process these different patterns and colors as we turn around and then we get different views. So one metaphor that I like to use is that daily sitting practice is kind of a mental hygiene that conditions our days. Just as we get up and brush our teeth and take our shower, we could do it at night too. I'm not saying when you have to do it, but it kind of conditions our days. When I was making notes for this talk earlier, I noticed that I jotted down hygene. And that really tickled me. This genie popped out. Here I'm thinking of tooth brushing and the genie pops out. Hi, genie. Of course that reminded me immediately that in Buddha's texts, Shakyamuni Buddha uses several famous metaphors of being lamps unto ourselves and being lights unto ourselves. And in a sense what we do in meditation practice is rub the lamp of our own innate awareness. Sitting down with no agenda but to be aware of what arises is a clearing away of the clutter, our clutter. And we all know we have lots of that. And the interesting thing is that it goes on after we get up from the sitting. It is affecting our daily activities. Hygiene also brought up another metaphor or maybe linguistic note. It brought up medicine and medical and meditation share the same root, med, which the Latins picked up from the Greeks. And that root means measure, as in take the measure, as in measured, moderate, moderation. It also has very ancient connotations with healing because one of the Greek gods of healing was Medos. So that's where it originally comes from. And it very much relates to the Buddhist view of healing, of integrating, making whole our lives, our daily lives, which is the middle way. That measure, that middle moderate way. We participate in awareness to take the measures of what comes up for us, our breath, sensations, our thoughts, our emotions. And as we do so we tap into the spring. It's another metaphor. The spring is there, it's part of us, and it never runs dry. And meditation helps us discover that, both in sitting down to just train ourselves to be aware that it's there, and in our daily life. And that's what the story goes that the Buddha did. And he said before there was Buddhism, there was just the Buddha. And he was many things written down of what he said. And one, I'm not quoting now, but just sort of paraphrasing in my own words and my own understanding. He said what he had done was to just uncover this deep and complete wellspring of our lives. It's always there, but we forget about it. And he didn't get into the why we forget about it, and why we are the way we are. Well, we're really, we've got it all, we are whole, but we forget about it. He just said, well, I've discovered this and I think it's important. There is this deep, this deep awareness, this deep wellspring of our life. And then he said, here are some means to access it, to see it, to see it whole and clear, to see our lives whole and clear. As we tap into this spring, this, and let this integration unfold, what happens is that it, we become more natural in our lives. Like birds, they eat their seeds or their worms or their insects, and then they sing their songs and they build their nests and they raise their young. Of course, we're not birds. But the analogy appeals to me because it points to a place of non-separation, of practice in our daily lives, of where we're unselfconscious as birds or other animals, where each of us finds just a natural, unselfconscious individual expression. So I've mentioned like one way that we keep, that we tap into this spring is meditation practice. Another way is tapping into our curiosity. Our curiosity is a natural ally for bringing sitting practice and other aspects of our lives together. This faculty too is much discussed in Buddhist texts and it's usually called investigation there. It's also one of the classic factors of enlightenment in Buddhism, of really waking up to the whole big picture. And this kind of curiosity, it's, we can sort of develop that and see that. I mean, it's there, but we can develop our awareness of it, allow it to express itself. What is going on here in this exchange that I'm having with a colleague? Or what's going on with my anger at the guy who, you know, cut in front of me too fast on the road? Here's another metaphor. I really got into playing around with the metaphors. Sometimes I do compare meditation practice to a software debugger. We're running lots of programs and many of them are distinctly messed up. So once we install the debugger, we start to see where the glitches are and where we get hung up. And that's all we have to do. Then the debugger is running on its own and it's sort of taking care of things in a way. So it's not a huge project once we kind of just bring that intention to be aware there. You know, I kind of like to do a little outline of how this might work in an everyday occurrence and it kind of unfolds as a process. And in real time, these come together very quickly, but it takes time through language to kind of describe them and break them down. So in action in our daily lives, definitely can involve mindful awareness of the situation as it's happening, noticing that that person is tailgating me and what one's, the thoughts and feelings that arise after one notices that. Oh, I noticed that. And then what else am I noticing? Oh, I have a thought that that's bad form. Doesn't anyone know about road courtesy anymore? And then I have, perhaps I feel some anxiety or discomfort in my body around that thought or around this event that's unfolding. And then I can do a review of alternative actions. I could, I can say, oh, well, I could decelerate or put on the brakes or speed up or make a rude finger gesture or see whether there's room somewhere else on the road to go. And then I can select an action. And I can select any number of actions, of course. With the sort of cooking that goes on, the sort of being in the soup of awareness, we often notice that we select actions which are more easy on ourselves and on others. We kind of get a sense of how we're connected with others. We kind of get a sense of how we share the road, even though they're doing something that's not very nice. And it's really important to see that connection, I think, especially in our daily lives, because of course, life presents us with situations that aren't very nice and calm and sitting back. If someone's being harmed, we might have to summon the courage to help them, even if it means using physical force, even if it means putting ourselves in danger or harm's way. And those, too, are very basic parts of our human nature, as we know when there are those dramatic situations when people rescue others. Not that practice necessarily makes heroines or heroes of us, but we do see over time more clearly how our own well-being and those of others are inextricable and how to act from that ground of knowledge. We can see many opportunities for our daily life practice in ethics and morality. Wise action is a natural thing in a worldly situation. We're usually doing something more in the world than just sitting and watching our breath. But it's kind of an essence. Watching the breath with great care and attention can debug our stuck places and open possibilities of action that perhaps we wouldn't have seen before. Then when we're driving or working on solving a problem with others or building something or even doing something as simple as washing the dishes, we can act with care and attention, which is a kind of a wise action. And speaking is also a really very fertile ground of practicing in our lives and seeing how this awareness that we're cultivating when we sit down in meditation can open us to our connection with others, which is what we're doing when we speak. It's discussed a lot in Buddhist ethics, but this isn't a kind of an analysis that we have to say, oh, am I doing the right thing? It's just being aware that am I speaking in a wise way, in an attentive way, in a careful way. It's just being aware of what kind of speech wants to be expressed in us. Sometimes we'll find ourselves, even though we're kind of at loggerheads with someone, actually we might just get a glimpse of another way to view something that we and this other person don't agree on. We might find ourselves speaking in a kind way or just even a way that suspends judgment, not perhaps actual kindness, but just suspending judgment. In a way that's kind of a generosity practice. It's a very simple practice, but it can be quite transformative, especially this generosity of spirit rather than of material things. When we're speaking and particularly listening to others with care and attention, with the same care and attention that we cultivate when we sit down with ourselves and notice how our breath is. Be with our breath. Really feel that. Listen to it completely and carefully. Then this sense of separation, this tends to dissolve after time through listening, through acting in the world, through being aware that the practice, the separation of the practices here on the cushion is different from my life. We start to really see how much we are all together there in that soup. Poets and other artists often allude to this wellspring of awareness. And I'd like to close with a poem by William Stafford. This is from a collection of his work called The Way It Is. The poem is called Yes. It could happen anytime. Tornado, earthquake, Armageddon. It could happen. Or sunshine, love, salvation. It could, you know. That's why we wake and look out. No guarantees in this life. But some bonuses. Like morning. Like right now. Like noon. Like evening. It could happen. That's why we wake and look out. Well, thank you for your attention. And I'd like to hear what you have to say. Any observations you have of your own life and practice after these four weeks of introduction to mindfulness? Or any questions you have? Yes. So offer as to go on. Well, keeping on sitting every day is a very good way to go on. And here you have the resource of this center. So it can be a resource. It's helpful for some people to gather with others and to listen to others. There are other resources too, but the most important from my experience is to get in touch with your own experiences. By just simply sitting down and seeing the kind of the bonus, as William Stafford puts it, of your own awareness. This awareness that just is in us. This wellspring that doesn't desert us. That's always there. How often do you read? How often do you have these benefits? Well, these, actually there's a whole schedule here somewhere, right? On the back table. And I believe there's another series of introduction to mindfulness coming up in March. Is that? But Thursday nights, you keep coming. You can keep coming on Thursday nights at the same time. The format changes a little bit. Whereas like tonight, it began with a silent sitting. She did a guided meditation. But it starts with a 30 minute, maybe silent or guided meditation, followed by 45 minutes of talk and discussion, or a little bit longer. And maybe ends with a short sitting. That continues. And what's going to happen in March is that the introductory series, the class formats are going to move over to Wednesday night. But Thursday night it's going to be here. The teachers are coming and talking on the more beginning level types of talks. And that's from 7.30 to 9. And then in the schedule you'll find that there's another night, Monday night, that you can come. There's just more and more things that are opening up. There's a Sunday morning meditation program that's going on here. And more. There's yoga on Thursday mornings. And then on Monday nights. Once a month on Wednesday. It's going to keep building as things start getting more rooted. So there are many resources here. And this is like your first time. Then I come back again to kind of get the background on what I was talking about tonight. You missed the first part. But it's there and it's available. Monday night would be good, which is the main person who speaks here, Gil, is very experienced. And he has led the class up until this point. He's gone through all the steps and the techniques that I was talking about. The means to access that the Buddha kind of outlined. Thank you. Yes. I'm going to start talking about so-so. So-so. Starting from the end of the daily line. So I just want to affirm that to the others. And everybody I understand sort of has a lot of people have that experience at different times. Some people have left for two weeks. Some people have left for many months. For me it was about three months. And all of a sudden I started seeing things differently. And the more the reason it came at one moment. Well I've told this story before, but I was meditating and meditating and meditating. And noticing that I was forgetting my breath. Oh and I kept noticing that. And one day I was turning on my computer. And I had two computers, a Mac and a Windows. I don't like the Windows computer. So when I turned on I had a breathing anxiety. I just make myself use this thing. So I turned on the check email. Every time I turned on I kind of don't like it. Like here it goes. So it's antics. And after about three months of meditation one day I just turned it on and I said wait. And I was like totally recognized the stress in myself. That I built up over some bad experiences. Here we have the other kind of events. It was really amazing because I found as the computer came on I was starting to get keyed up and then I went I just breathed. I just noticed my breath. And I went wow that's like meditation. So when you asked me all of a sudden yeah it was three months of meditating like oh I'm pretty modest in this story. And your name is? Can. Thank you very much for sharing those stories those experiences. And I was like I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I'm going to do this thing. I used to get so upset. I used to be so mad myself. I hadn't prepared this stuff. And now I just kind of dealt with each thing one at a time and I guess that's mindfulness. I kind of alluded to earlier there there are each of us has our own way and it's Ken kind of alluded to. We each have our own timetable too. So our mind tends to want to go in latch onto and go in a certain direction and say oh that's it. That's in the book. That's the manual. That's the way you do it. But really it just keeps springing up. It's just the wellspring just keeps coming up. So each of your experiences may be very different than Ken's and your timetable may be very different than his. But we recognize that we mindfulness allows us these practices of mindful awareness allow us to recognize where we get stuck sometimes as Ken described in his stories. One of the things that I found very useful for me when I was early in my days of meditating was to have spiritual friendships. People that I could talk with about what was going on with me and questions that might come up. I found it very very useful and very supportive. Oftentimes we come together and we go apart without talking to anybody else. And it just to me is a practice to share and to share with people that are interested as well. I learned an awful lot that way. This center is a wonderful resource for that. And also if you find that you've been sitting for a while and you'd like to expand it a little more about once a month we have one day sitting from Saturday's show here in the center. And you can come for like the morning or as long as you feel like you'd like to. But it's very interesting to see what it's like to put two or more periods of sitting together and just first with walking meditation. And to see what it's like when you start setting down more which happens when you do more sitting and walking practices together. And you might come with the intention of maybe staying for the morning and not feel like you have to commit to the whole day. But if you come in the morning on the day that there are instructions then you can just see how well you feel comfortable. And you might find that you're staying the whole day. And you're staying with that kind of experience as well for the meditation as well. At one point I asked if Gil was doing a whole other form of meditation practice called loving kindness practice in this introductory series. And he hasn't but those are a whole other kind of way of approaching what our life is and how to allow our life to come together. There are many practices in this kind of Buddhist meditation and they're all in the service of allowing us to see our deepest nature and our truest nature. And you can tune into a lot of them here as Alison has pointed out. And it is very interesting also as she said to explore because this is our life. What do we do with it? I mean we do many things with it. We do things with our work and our families etc. But we're all here together looking at another something in our life that we want to put together. So it's large and wonderful. Yes Ken. Yeah I've constantly kind of kept away from that because we are so used to this idea of getting it out of a book. and this is such an experiential practice. It really, there is no substitute for actually doing the practice. But given that, I mean, I just really like to emphasize that. But that said, there's our curiosity. We are curious. Buddhism is a huge field and meditation is a huge field, and there's a lot out about it. There's also an interesting thing which I've noticed in my own practice, particularly at the beginning, was that the out loudness of it, the speaking to it, is a very important part of the practice. I'm not sure exactly I have some theories, but I don't think it's that useful to go into them. How that is, but I just noticed that it is to come together and listen, and to hear people speak about meditation, about these practices. And I would agree that if one wanted to look at one book on kind of the nuts and bolts of meditation practice, that Mindfulness in Plain English is a good book as a kind of a reminder. But it's not like you can spend 15 or 30 minutes reading the book, and then that substitutes for sitting 15 or 30 minutes. I was so interested in hearing the teachers. The book with Jesus is just a reminder, so during the week I could get a repeat. And if you want a very simple, if you're curious, the sort of essence of Buddhist teachings in the most simple and ancient form, there's a book called the Dhammapada, the Way of the Dhamma, which means the way of understanding. I mean, it's got a million translations. This is my translation. The Way of Understanding Our Life, Our Human Life, most deeply. The Dhammapada, there are a lot of translations. I guess a pretty accessible one to people is one by Thomas Cleary, but you could check out a few of those, because that gives kind of a poetic, philosophical way of understanding what these teachings that I kind of alluded to about knowing our inextricability from everything else. It kind of addresses that in a way. Alison? We may have a few books that would be on the back table on the Dhammapada for you to just take. They're freely distributed by Tamsara, because of the translation he's done. So we have some books, I think, on the back table that you could help yourself to in just this room, a joint room. I didn't even know he'd done a translation, but he's an excellent, he's an American who's a monk, a Buddhist monk, and he's quite clear, linguistically very clear. It might be interesting to you. Well, I think maybe we can end with just the last five minutes of simple mindfulness, being aware of our whole being, our breath and body and our thinking process, the sounds that come into our ears, any emotions we might feel, just they're all here, and we can just open our attention to them, to allow them to be and express themselves.
