When we practice mindfulness, we explore our experience, what's happening in our experience,
what's happening in our bodies and our minds.
We may start in our practice with something to help us kind of ground with recognizing that we're mindful,
like the breath, just to help us to collect the attention.
But ultimately, mindfulness is a capacity of our human system.
It's a natural capacity of our human system that allows us to recognize what's happening in the present moment as it's happening.
And this is the capacity that Buddha encouraged us to cultivate because it has a power to help us to see what's going on in our hearts and minds,
to help us to understand how we get caught, how we get hooked into our suffering, our struggles,
and also how we can move in the direction of more ease and peace.
So mindfulness is a key tool in our practice.
And we open to the, over time, we open to the entirety of our human experience, everything that's happening in our human experience.
All of our body sensations, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, all the sensations in the body,
and also including what's going on in our minds, thoughts, emotions.
So it's a mind states, so it's a very broad kind of practice that we're cultivating here.
And so we start with kind of getting familiar with the what of our experience,
the body sensations and sounds and sights and emotions, thoughts, moods.
And in being aware of that, there's often, I mean, we're exploring opening to more and more of our experience,
but it seems that there's aspects of our experience that are often kind of behind the scenes, things that we're not so aware of.
And it's occasionally, I mean, it seems that sometimes these things that are kind of behind the scenes,
the things that are deeply conditioned, habits and patterns that are kind of deeply ingrained in how we are,
it seems sometimes like no matter how long we actually look at what's happening, what's happening, what's happening,
what's going on behind the scenes may not actually ever become what's obvious in our experience.
And this what's happening behind the scenes is often where we are getting caught up,
where we are reacting to things, pushing things away, holding on to things.
And so often the place or the way that we end up getting tangled up with our experience is something that's not so obvious to us.
So this is the piece I wanted to talk about a little bit tonight.
It's kind of like we have hidden views or hidden filters or hidden kind of perspectives that we carry around that we're looking at experience through,
but not really clearly aware of.
These are often really deeply conditioned habits and patterns.
And so if we simply practice with the exploration of what is obvious, what's here, what am I aware of in this moment,
or just with the experience of the breathing or just directing our attention to something,
we may not ever really clearly become aware of the agendas or the way that we are paying attention.
These agendas or these, we could say these habits or patterns or ways of paying attention, these perspectives that we carry around.
When we're not aware of them, they are, it's kind of like they're just operating, they're functioning.
They are, if we have an agenda or a perspective of a little bit of aversion or not liking things,
then that perspective is going to be like how we view the world.
I've seen this in my own, in my own experience.
It kind of was a little bit of a surprise to see when I finally, when I started to really see it.
I have a very deeply conditioned pattern of aversion.
And at one point, one of my teachers asked me to just notice, you know, what is obvious in your experience?
And is it pleasant or is it unpleasant?
And every single thing that I noticed in my experience was unpleasant.
And I thought, well, this can't just be like randomly noticing this.
And I mentioned this to my teacher, you know, it's like everything.
This can't just be random. This has got to be, you know, based on something.
And it is based, it was based on my deep habit of aversion.
That with that habit of aversion, the mind tends to, this is what I discovered with time.
Actually, it took some time to really understand this.
But with that deep habit of aversion, the mind oriented to looking to things that it didn't like
and it could fix them so that then I'd be happy.
So this habit, this habit or pattern was kind of operating in the back of my mind and not really clearly seen.
Like I would walk into a room and like immediately notice everything I didn't like about the room.
Now somebody else might walk into the room and immediately notice everything that they really like about the room.
We each have different kind of perspectives that we carry.
And they tend to be these flavors of greed, of liking things, of wanting to have more of things,
of aversion, of like wanting to push things away, of not liking things,
and also of delusion, of kind of like not connecting or not really being clearly aware of what's going on.
At least three basic kind of patterns or habits.
Jack Cornfield, I think it's Jack Cornfield talks about kind of a little test that you can see which flavor that you may carry,
which perspective you may carry strongest by thinking about what happens for you when you go into a new place,
when you go into a room that you've never been in before, when you enter a new place.
If you tend to orient towards what you don't like,
you probably have a temperament that's kind of got that perspective of wanting to push things away.
If you orient towards things that you do like,
you probably have that temperament of orienting towards things that you like, that you want, that you want to hold on to.
If you walk into the room and it's kind of like, what's going on here?
You know, kind of maybe a little bit of confusion.
That may be the orientation of someone who's not really connecting with what's here.
So there are these perspectives. We have these perspectives.
And in our mindfulness practice, it's useful to begin to recognize these perspectives
because they often are the places or the ways that we get hooked,
like my own perspective of aversion.
I would just repeatedly get hooked into that pattern of thinking I needed to get rid of things in order to be happy.
And so the mindfulness practice can, we can become aware of these things,
but it often takes a little bit of extra curiosity or extra kind of interest to kind of check in.
Well, okay, this is what is happening. This is what I'm obviously aware of.
And how am I in relationship to it?
So this is the piece I want to talk about.
This is beginning to be curious about this in the first place and how we can explore it.
It's actually a pretty simple technique that we can use to check that relationship.
You can just kind of ask the question, how am I with what's happening?
Or what's my relationship to what's happening?
Sometimes one of my teachers uses the phrase or the word attitude.
What's my attitude about what's happening?
So this technique of asking a question, I would mostly encourage it to happen just very occasionally.
The bulk of our practice is still just noticing what's here, just noticing what's obvious,
what is obviously available to be known.
And from time to time, kind of being curious about how am I in relationship to experience?
This question isn't something to try to figure out.
It's not like you're thinking about.
It's not something that you drop in to try to figure out the answer to the question
or to try to think about what am I, how am I relating to this?
It's more to just spark the mind to be curious.
Is there some other thing going on here that I wasn't quite aware of?
Something behind the scenes.
Is there something else going on that's kind of behind the scenes?
So that question can kind of open the mind to be curious about what else might be there.
So in this checking in to what the relationship to experience is,
I mentioned so far, I mentioned three basic flavors.
There's the liking what's happening, wanting more of it.
There's not liking it, wanting to get rid of it.
So basically agreed in a version.
And then there's a kind of a confusion.
What's going on here?
I'm confused.
I don't get it.
That kind of a state of mind that might be happening in relationship to what's happening.
So those are three basic flavors.
There's a fourth basic flavor of relationship to what's happening.
And I brought it up in the guided meditation.
And that is maybe there's a relationship of what's happening is okay.
What's happening feels like I have ease with it.
Or there's some measure of calm or peace in relationship to what's happening.
This is actually an important relationship to recognize.
It may not be the first ones that we recognize when we start exploring this.
But over time, we do start to recognize that there are experiences of what's happening.
This is just what's happening.
And I'm okay with what's going on.
It's useful to recognize that because recognizing that okayness, recognizing that the mind is fine with what's happening.
There's no problem.
That's a state that's close to, we could call it in the neighborhood of equanimity.
It's in the neighborhood of balance of mind.
And it's a subtle flavor of mind that's really useful to kind of land with.
When we can recognize, oh, this thing is happening and I'm okay with it.
We might actually notice that around something difficult.
We might notice there's something unpleasant happening and I'm okay with it.
Recognizing that okayness can have a very nourishing effect on our system.
Sometimes we focus on the what is happening.
We might be focusing more on, well, there's this unpleasant thing happening.
And not really notice that the mind is balanced and okay with it.
And so this is a piece too of checking the attitude.
And I want to say that up front because when we explore the attitude a lot of the times,
what we do notice is some kind of reactivity.
We do notice some kind of aversion or we notice some kind of a wanting or a holding onto or confusion.
But that's not the only things that can be noticed.
And every now and then you might check in to the attitude and see, oh,
this is what it feels like to be okay with what's happening.
This is what it feels like to be okay.
So the other side though where we do kind of check in that relationship and we might see,
maybe you're noticing, maybe there's some sound going on outside while you're meditating.
And you're kind of trying to stay with your breath or you're staying with the breath.
And yet it feels like there's a little bit of pull to that sound.
And you come back, you want to stay with the breath.
There's this pull to the sound.
And maybe check the attitude there.
This is actually one of the times I find it's useful to check that relationship,
check how we are with the experience.
We could say this is like we're looking at what is happening and how we are with the experience.
What and how?
How am I while this is going on?
How am I with the sound that's happening?
Maybe you'll notice, I don't like the sound.
I want the sound to go away.
You might not have clearly noticed that.
It might have been kind of in the back of your mind.
You might have like heard thoughts like, why are they doing that?
You know, just the kind of the thoughts about wishing it weren't there.
But not clearly recognizing, oh, what's actually happening here is that there's a sound and not liking is happening.
The difference, there's a huge difference between kind of being in the not liking,
kind of, you know, not really clearly knowing the not liking.
There's a sound and not liking it, a little bit of pushing it away,
a little bit of like resistance to it without clearly seeing it.
There's a huge difference between that and clearly recognizing what's happening in this human experience
is that there's a sound and there's not liking happening with that sound.
There's a huge difference there and we can feel the difference.
Sometimes when we clearly recognize, at least I've seen at times when I kind of recognize,
oh, what's going on is this thing is happening and I don't like it.
When there's been that clear recognition, there sometimes is a sense of, oh, that's what's happening.
That's why it's so hard right now.
That's why it feels so stressful right now.
And then simply recognizing it or seeing it, oh, there's this thing and I don't like it.
There's something that, there's some kind of ease that begins to step in, that begins to happen
with simply recognizing the experience and the relationship to it, the what and the how.
And what my teacher Sayada Utejenia would say is that the, that that how, that the how we are with the experience.
So clearly noticing the not liking.
It's kind of moving from behind the scenes, that perspective that we're just seeing the experience through,
that hearing that sound through the not liking to hearing the sound and knowing the not liking.
So it's, it's like we're not, we're no longer listening to the sound through the not liking.
It's more that they're kind of both there and we, we, we know that both are happening.
It's almost like, you know, these, the, we can think of these things in the background,
these relationships, the how we are with experience, almost like colored glasses that we might wear,
different colored like, we put on different colored lenses.
And if you're wearing a colored lens for a long time, you kind of lose track of the fact that you're looking through that color.
Everything looks that tint, but, but you kind of lose track of the fact that you're, you're seeing through that tint.
And then suddenly somebody comes and says, Hey, you know, did you know you still have your sunglasses on?
It's like, Oh yeah, I thought it was kind of dark in here.
And then you can take those off.
And then you see things differently.
So you see the difference.
And you might, what the shift is that I'm talking about.
So seeing that there's the sound and the not liking, looking at the not liking, the sound through the not liking is kind of like having the glasses on of not liking.
And then the seeing the not liking is like taking the glasses off.
Like you can take the glasses off and say, Oh yeah, I was looking through those glasses.
And you can see them rather than be looking through them.
And that's the same shift that happens when we kind of check this attitude.
It's like, Oh, there is this thing happening and I don't like it.
And then the mind may actually be kind of okay with that.
What's happening is that there's a sound and I don't like it.
And we may actually begin to recognize it's okay.
It's okay that there's a sound and I don't like it.
And maybe you can notice that okayness.
Oh, okayness is happening.
I've noticed the kind of the feeling of okayness through a kind of a feeling of relief almost.
And I recognize the attitude that's happening behind the scenes.
And it kind of comes out of the background and into conscious awareness.
Sometimes it's like a relief.
It feels like a relief.
It's like, Oh, that's what's happening.
No wonder.
No wonder the mind is so caught up in things.
I hadn't seen the not liking.
And so there can be a little bit of a shift or a little bit of space,
a little bit of a relief or some release, a relaxation of mind that can happen
when we clearly see an attitude to the experience.
So the attitudes can be about the experience itself,
like I was just talking about sound.
You know, sound and not liking the sound that's happening.
You know, the sound might be the sound of a leaf blower or something,
some kind of mildly agitating sound.
But then there's other kinds of things that we can have attitudes about.
Or other ways, maybe we could say ways that attitudes are created.
It's not necessarily just about like the what that's happening.
It's not necessarily just about the sight, the sound, the smell, the taste, the touch.
Sometimes our attitudes have to do with kind of something else that's going on
in the background that's not quite seen.
A kind of a mood or a state of mind that's not quite seen.
And then we're reacting actually to that mood.
The thing that we're the attitude that's happening, like when we notice like,
oh, I'm really experiencing a lot of aversion here.
Maybe we notice that there's a lot of aversion going on when we kind of check in.
But we don't, it's like, well, what is there aversion to here?
It's sometimes it's not necessarily so clear.
I saw this earlier today. I saw a little bit of aversion and it's kind of like,
oh, you know, what's going on?
And I realized that I was really tired.
And I hadn't really clearly noticed that I was tired.
And so the attitude of aversion was itself to something that wasn't in the field of the what.
I hadn't really clearly noticed the tiredness.
So when I noticed that there was the tiredness, the aversion kind of just fell away
because it was like the aversion was because the tiredness had not been seen.
So sometimes the attitude can be not to what we're consciously noticing
but also to something else that's behind the scenes like that, you know,
that tiredness for myself earlier.
The other thing that attitudes can sometimes have to do with is
especially connected with meditation that when we're meditating
we have all kinds of ideas and agendas about what we want to be happening.
If that isn't happening, we can have relationships to it.
Now it may be that there's nothing in particular, you know,
it's not so much that we're reacting to the what is happening.
We're reacting to an idea about what we think should or shouldn't be happening.
And that's the agenda or the idea or the expectation that we may be carrying.
This is another thing to kind of be curious about.
Sometimes our attitudes are more about the beliefs we have
about what should be happening in our meditation.
So I want to leave a little bit of time for comments or questions.
So I think I'll stop there and see if there's any comments or questions.
Thank you, Andrea, as always.
One of my teachers says that it's actually by getting to know all of the challenging relationships.
By just fully opening to those that we step our way back into the more balanced or equanimous relationship.
And so it's like we get to the more balanced relationship by seeing what's in its way.
So it's not like we're going to sit down and just immediately have that balanced attitude.
We're probably going to see the others.
But it's not a problem.
Because what happens, again, it's like as soon as we see a relationship,
it's like that relationship comes out of the background.
And it just becomes another thing that we're aware of.
I started this by talking about we can be aware of anything.
We can be aware of sight, sound, smells, taste, touch, thoughts, things going on in the mind.
So we can be aware of everything.
But there are habits of mind that kind of keep things hidden from us.
And so as soon as we can kind of have that curiosity of, well, what's hidden?
What's back there?
And it comes into the field of what we can be aware of.
Then there's the chance for us to work with that too.
As long as it's hidden behind the scenes, it's kind of just running the show.
So it's good news to see these things, actually.
It's good news to see the greed or the aversion operating.
Because then it has a chance to not be driving the show, but just to be seen.
And we can learn from it.
And in learning from it, it begins to release.
It begins to let go.
So it's actually good news.
It's really good news to see these things.
I'd much rather see them than not see them myself.
I see them.
I'm also an aversive type.
But some mornings, like when I get up, there is more an aversion.
And then the other mornings, it just depends on how the conditions for the previous day or whatever.
The mood underneath it is that sometimes I'm not.
And it's really great to notice that difference.
To recognize, oh, okay, so yes, there's aversion today.
I didn't get sleep or whatever.
This thing happened yesterday.
This is shaping.
It's all conditioned.
The whole thing is unfolding in conditions.
And then the days when you wake up and it's like, oh, that mood is not there.
That's really useful to recognize.
What is there then?
Is there a little more ease?
Is there a little more calm and peace?
Notice that.
It's so useful to notice that too.
Because the noticing of that supports its development and its cultivation.
