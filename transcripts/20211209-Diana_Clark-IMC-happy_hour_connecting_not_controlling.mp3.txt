The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Welcome, welcome again.
Nice to see you all.
And I so appreciate, right, people coming together and practice together.
And I know some people that don't actually necessarily come all the time, but they either a or listening to the talks later as well as recordings, where there's maybe just something comforting to know that this is happening.
And there's the potential to be there, right, that there's this, there's something about the regularity of it that can be supportive, whether one actually goes or not.
I say this because there was times that I am see that I used to go regularly as a yogi just to go and listen to Dharma talks, and then I wouldn't wasn't going as often but somehow I just found it comforting to know like, oh yeah.
Okay, so they're just to know that they were there.
So today I'd like to continue talking more about equanimity on this topic that I've been exploring a little bit and as many of you know if not everybody equanimity is.
Sorry, I'm going to mute all of us just so that the recording is clear here.
And it makes it easier for our future selves to there we go.
That equanimity is the fourth of the Brahman of the heart is fourth of the heart qualities and some.
I think I use this expression when I taught last on Tuesday.
Something about it's the, it has this love this warm hardness and love of the truth.
So that's one way to think about like the truth of how things really are as opposed to our just wishing that they're different somehow, or not really paying attention to how things are.
I also want to highlight another quality in which equanimity can have this warm heartedness. And that is this movement from trying to control things natural human activity trying to control things.
This shift from trying to control to maybe connect with what really is or connect with another whatever it might be. So this movement from controlling, letting go with that, and instead going towards connection connection either with ourselves with what's really happening to ourselves to what's
happening out there in our environment or connect with another person rather than just trying to control them but instead just to connect with them.
There's such a big part of equanimity because it points to that sometimes right in the right in the heart of a difficult time.
Often in the difficult times of course when we want to control something right in the midst of a painful situation, we can find freedom.
Because sometimes when it's the most difficult when it becomes the most clear that we cannot control things in a way that we think we can.
There can be some letting go. And then maybe there's kind of this letting go there can be this wish to connect with what is what's actually happening the reality of the moment.
This requires a certain amount of self confidence that we can handle it that we won't be overwhelmed. And it's, it's some just this, even knowing that this is a possibility to let go of trying to control and instead to connect so it's not that we let go and then we're just lost and grounded.
We have to let go and to connect.
Some people might think about this. Sometimes, when we're trying to control is in our minds is a mental event in terms of, well, I should do this or I shouldn't have done that and they better do this and like I don't remember to do this.
Maybe that I got to do that. You know, that's kind of a thing that we get into sometimes when there's some difficulties.
And to recognize, oh, you know, I'm trying to control here but you know, this isn't going to make things really different here.
Because letting the thinking slow down a bit of spaciousness there and instead to really connect with the bodily experience here. Now, what does it feel like?
I mean, there's a lump in the throat. Maybe there's a terrible feeling in the gut, you know, these difficulties. Maybe we're on the brink of tears or pressure on the eyes.
But I'd like to bring in this poem by Rosemary Traumer.
I've brought in so many poems by Rosemary Traumer. I just appreciate her poems very much for this. It's called Pushing Buttons.
And she starts it with a quote from somebody else. So it starts with this quote, doing something typically feels better than doing nothing.
And the quote is attributed to Helen Langer, Harvard psychologist quoted in the illusion of control why the world is full of buttons that don't work. That was on CNN.
So that's the beginning of this poem is this quote. So here's Rosemary Traumer's the rest of the poem.
The world is full of buttons that do nothing.
Buttons at crosswalks and elevators and hotel rooms buttons that can be pushed but in fact have no functionality.
The Harvard psychologist suggested these buttons serve a purpose. They help people feel as if they have some control. She says it feels good to have something to do.
We could, I suppose, make buttons to press for these careening days when we realize just how little control we have.
Not over death. Not over weather.
Not over anyone's heart. Not even our own.
Or we could press our own belly buttons. A reminder, there are a few things we can do.
Write letters. Walk.
Say thank you.
Practice peace.
Protest.
Wear a ring coat.
Take vitamin B.
And of course, the most difficult thing of all to say yes to not being in control.
To dance in that uncomfortable place, laughing like a stream.
And of course, the most difficult thing of all to say yes to not being in control.
To dance in that uncomfortable place, laughing like a stream.
This is what part of what equanimity is about. This letting us let go.
But still dancing and laughing.
So it's not that this fragility or separateness from our experience or from others.
But still connecting but not trying to control.
And of course, loving kindness practice can help us with this.
So as I have been doing these past few times, I've been teaching this.
We'll do some equanimity practice. We'll start with some mindfulness practice just to get grounded and settled a little bit.
And we'll do some loving kindness practice to open the heart to bring in some warmth.
And then we'll shift over to some equanimity practice.
Okay, so with that as an introduction, we can take a meditation posture.
A posture that reflects your intention to meditate.
And taking a few long, slow, deep breaths.
Letting the breath return to normal.
Just feeling into the body, the bodily experience.
Not just saying how the body feels in a general sense.
So relaxed or tense.
Agitated or maybe a little bit tired.
Maybe it feels neutral.
However it is, we welcome that experience.
Let's move it into what's happening right now.
And our attention on the sensations of breathing.
Feeling the inbreaths in the chest and abdomen.
Maybe with the air moving through the nose.
What does it feel like to have an inbreath?
What does it feel like to have an outbreath?
What does it feel like to have an outbreath?
You don't have to make it be a problem.
It's what the mind is apt to do.
At the beginning of a meditation period, maybe the entire meditation period.
Very simply, gently begin again.
Feeling turning into the experience.
Feeling turning into the experience of the body breathing.
Just a reminder, you can always come back to this practice.
Whatever reason, loving kindness or equanimity practice doesn't feel like the right practice to do.
To begin, the next part of the meditation will do some loving kindness practice.
Some heart opening, heart warming practice by bringing to mind a lovable being.
No need to make this complicated, difficult.
Just going to start where it's easy.
With someone, just naturally, you feel warmth or care or respect, kindness, love, goodwill.
Whatever words resonate for you.
If somebody doesn't come to mind, can always be an imaginary, kittens, puppies, babies, can be a family pet.
Maybe somebody you don't have a relationship with, but who has touched your life with their writings or teachings.
And connecting with this lovable being.
Just visualizing them.
And to support our connecting with them in a warm hearted way, we can say these phrases.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Feeling the warmth, feeling the softness or spaciousness, this lovable being.
And can we extend it to ourselves?
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I live with ease.
May I live with ease.
And of course we want to send loving kindness to ourselves.
May you live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
And then to do some equanimity practice.
So bringing to mind somebody who's a little bit bothersome or some irritating a little bit, but you care about them.
I'll offer a few phrases.
And often with equanimity we just do one phrase.
Or you can do all of them.
Whatever resonates for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I care about you and I cannot keep you from difficulties.
I care about you and I cannot keep you from difficulties.
I care about you and I cannot keep you from difficulties.
Your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your actions, not upon my wishes for you.
Your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your actions, not upon my wishes for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I might wish things to be otherwise things are as they are.
No matter how I might wish things to be otherwise things are as they are.
No matter how I might wish things to be otherwise things are as they are.
No matter how I might wish things to be otherwise.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
No matter how I might wish things to be.
So this idea of equanimity being about moving from controlling to connecting, connecting
to what's actually happening, or a big part of equanimity is to not be off balance, part
of the way we define equanimity is to be balanced, which means to kind of be standing on both
feet or grounded or rooted in some kind of way, connected in some kind of way.
So it can be helpful to talk about these ideas with others, so I'd like to put you into breakout rooms.
And you can talk about this poem that I started at the beginning.
The world is full of buttons that do nothing is the first line.
I like this idea, but that they help people feel like they have control.
But instead, kind of equanimity arises when we realize we don't have control.
Not in the way that we expect or would prefer or anticipate or something like this.
So I'll put you into groups of three or four.
We've got an opportunity to meet for say, maybe 14 minutes.
So it's an opportunity to say some of these to share some of your thoughts about this and no need to say everything all at once.
It's really helpful to just say one thing, let it go to the next person, they say one thing and then goes to the next person and they say one thing and then it comes back around.
And this way everybody has an opportunity to contribute.
And it's also an opportunity for you to learn something as opposed to demonstrating how much you do know and maybe to create the conditions in which there's something new that happens, maybe something kind of special with everybody adding an ingredient to the soup, so to speak.
So here we go.
You are now in the main session.
Okay, so welcome, welcome back. Does anybody have a comment or question or something they'd like to share.
No.
Yes, Jerry.
I just, the comment, first of all, I again love these groups because it just takes you into the mind of another human being in the most intimate of ways, even though across continents and oceans.
The last comment was made, which I was struck by, we seem to want less suffering, but we sure create a lot of it.
This is a big part of what the Buddhist teachings are. We think that we're going to find happiness in this one particular direction and then turns out that's not what brings happiness or lack of suffering.
And so much, maybe I'll add in kind of like an assembly with loving kindness practice is a way in which our minds can settle and our heart can open and we can feel in the, oh yeah, this striving to bolster my sense of self to increase my status to acquire,
acquire whatever it is we feel like we have to acquire. It's not until the mind quiets and the heart opens that we start to feel the uncomfortableness of that always trying to get more of whatever it is.
And this recognition, it will never end. There will always be more. But sometimes with loving kindness practice, we can feel that and then we can start to turn towards, oh, but this connecting with other people, just as you pointed out, that has some satisfaction.
There's something a little bit different and better there as opposed to just acquiring.
But, you know, we can hear this a bazillion times, it's not until we actually have these experiences that the mind and the heart start to behave differently.
I would even say it's part of our biology to, you know, want more. It's kind of how evolution, we've evolved from beings that had more food, more sex, more status, and we're able to pass their genes on into the next generation.
Yes, Greg.
You know, in the group, we're just talking a little bit about sort of difficult sort of crucible like experiences.
And for some of us, they certainly include me and then also kind of people in my family. The tendency has been to try and control by thinking, lots of thinking.
The sad part of that is that my grandfather, on a personal note, was a pretty intense thinker. You know, he taught at a medical school, he was a lawyer, he was a forensic pathologist.
He was also wracked by anxiety and died an alcoholic.
One of my sharpest philosophy professors at Berkeley also died sort of profoundly sad and surely but slowly have begun to learn that this sort of hyper process of thinking maybe ain't going to take us to the promised land.
So maybe letting go, putting things unfold.
Maybe there's something to be said for just accepting it. I don't know.
Yeah.
Or, yeah, but something happens when there's acceptance. That's a way of stopping to control and then something else kind of rise. Things can unfold differently.
But I also want to just say, you know, it is such a human experience right to want to think our way in and out of stuff because it works. Sometimes it works. It just doesn't work for everything.
Right, some things we need to problems we need to solve by thinking. And so the trick is to recognize, okay, when is thinking the appropriate tool to use here and when is it not.
And this again, you can hear over and over again but it's not until you try and experiment and feel it for yourself do you realize, oh, there's there's another way to show up here.
We're two minutes after the hour I just want to respect everybody's time and I also kind of want to acknowledge that this is a tender topic.
But it's also can be such a doorway to greater and greater freedom and peace and ease.
This can be worth kind of exploring and feeling your way into or whatever way practicing with journaling about talking about whatever, whatever it might be.
Okay, so if you'd like we can unmute and say goodbye and I'll see you all next week.
Bye bye and thank you. Thank you. Bye everyone.
Thank you Diane. Thank you Diane.
