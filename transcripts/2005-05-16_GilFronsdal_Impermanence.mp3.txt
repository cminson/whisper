Yesterday I gave a talk. 
I was invited to give a talk, and I gave a talk at the Unity Church in Palo Alto. 
I kind of was going to give it a Sunday morning. 
I've never really been to Christian service before, so that was kind of new to me. 
And I guess I was invited to give the sermon, but when I got there they called it the lesson. 
So it was kind of interesting to see there and kind of nice. 
Every other thing they did was they sang. 
Very different than we do. 
When's the last time we sang? But they had one song, the Unity song I think, about silence. 
And that there's a sacred meeting place in the silence. 
And I have a sacred meeting place in the silence. 
So what is it we can meet in the silence? And just as I was sitting here and just getting ready to speak, the idea of silence came up in my mind. 
I felt that sometimes one of the best containers or holders of what's going on in life is silence. 
And that's the silence of ignoring or turning away, not that kind of awkward silence of not knowing what to do. 
But there's something very powerful about, very intimate about just holding what's going on in the silence. 
It's not turning away, but actually some things that happen in life, you can't really know what to do. 
You can't do anything, but it can be held in the silence and something different happens in the silence. 
I think sometimes it's a very respectful way of being with maybe the impossible. 
Somewhere or other I came, I remember in my head a quote that goes something like, in the silence there's a sound, the sound of flapping bird wings. 
And you might have had the experience in your life of being at some place where the silence was very pronounced or very strong or you're kind of absorbed in the silence or engaged in it. 
And then suddenly there's a sound and the sound, maybe it's an ordinary sound, but it's like the flapping of bird wings, but it becomes much more heightened. 
And you feel it and see it much more clearly. 
And I think that quote comes from Japanese Buddhism where they have a very big emphasis on impermanence, the ephemeral nature of our experience. 
And in many Japanese homes, many enough, they contrast silence or stillness with the ephemeral world that kind of is highlighted in that stillness and that silence. 
So for example, in Japanese flower arrangements, sometimes in certain places, they'll have just one flower. 
They could have a whole bouquet, but they have a wedding or something. 
But they had just one flower and they had a flower up on an altar. 
And the oneness, the singularity of that flower kind of stands out. 
And part of the idea is that in that special alcove of the altar, that one flower, you're much more aware of its uniqueness, but also much more aware of its ephemeral nature. 
And so somehow there's a framing of the experience which highlights some quality of it. 
When we bring mindfulness to our experience or sit and meditate, we're also bringing a new framework, a new orientation to understand what our experience is or how to see our experience. 
That's often maybe quite different from how we're normally thinking about what's going on. 
And you know those kind of drawings where depending how you look at it, you see either an old lady or a young woman, an old woman or a young woman. 
Someone tells you, oh, you see the old woman, all you can do is see the young woman. 
And then you kind of squint your eyes and you turn your head. 
And suddenly it pops out, oh, how could I have missed it? It's right there. 
Where's the young woman go? And it goes back and forth and you can't quite see both at the same time, but you can switch back and forth and see them. 
And often the way we kind of go about our daily life, we're kind of looking at things in one frame, in one way of understanding it. 
And there can be another flip. 
They can flip and see things in a new way. 
And that new way can be enlightening. 
The new way can be quite revealing. 
And the new way can kind of present kind of almost like a different world to live in than the old way. 
And it's always there. 
And so one of the flips that the Buddhist tradition puts a lot of emphasis on is that flip where our perceptions start seeing things as always changing. 
What might be called the changing nature of experience or the impermanent or the inconstant level of our experience. 
And it's kind of one of the paradoxes of meditation practice that the stiller the mind becomes in meditation, the quieter and more stiller it becomes, the more we tend to become acutely aware of how things are always changing. 
The busier the mind is, the more agitated the mind is and the mind is running around, the more the mind tends to create some idea of permanence, of stability. 
This is how it is. 
And partly that's because when the mind is really busy and active, it tends to be living in the world of concepts, ideas, because that's what the mind is chasing, is ideas. 
And ideas often have kind of stability to them as if they're stable. 
But when we start to stop kind of the busyness of the mind, the chatter of the mind, the mind becomes still, then what we see is not concepts, we see the immediacy of our experience. 
And the immediacy of our experience is not a concept. 
And that immediacy tends to be seen more and more as being something that's changeable, it's changing all the time. 
So Buddhism puts a lot of emphasis on the experience of change. 
And you might try that in your meditations, you might try it in your daily life, to kind of begin seeing that aspect of your present moment experience which is changing. 
And kind of watch new things arise in the present moment, something new comes. 
And something that was goes away. 
And you can kind of watch that kind of moving through. 
Hermonese kind of called it a stream, right? A river, to sit out there, sit out on the river and watch the river of life going by. 
And to kind of notice that and watch that things arise and things pass, suddenly they're there, they weren't there before and they're gone. 
And it's quite interesting to see. 
And you know, sometimes that experience of impermanence can be so acute, even in normal life, not even in meditation, that we're changed by it in some way or other. 
So on my way yesterday to talk at the Unity Church in Middlefield in Palo Alto, I was going early in the morning, 8. 
30 or so, 8. 
20. 
And I was kind of happy about going there and curious what was going to be like to be in new place, new people and curious about what it would be like to talk to people. 
I felt kind of happy and inspired. 
And I drove by the Safeway parking lot. 
I don't know if any of you saw, I read the paper today or saw. 
And I couldn't believe what I saw in the parking lot. 
You know, in the parking lot of Safeway, there was a car that the only way I could kind of, my mind could kind of conceive what the car was doing there was because of all the images we get from other parts of the world was it was a car bomb. 
Because the car just hadn't just burned because then the car was kind of intact. 
But this car was completely kind of burned and twisted and peeled open and one engine was one place and the transmission was another place and I couldn't, you know, what, you know. 
And so I felt I had to go back and see that. 
And not because I was kind of some morbid curiosity about the car, but what happened. 
But I felt like the contrast of kind of feeling happy and inspired and going to this church to speak and seeing this, seemingly a big tragedy of what had happened. 
Somehow I felt like it was important to witness it or take it in. 
And not just pass it by quickly to check that off, that's interesting or something, but really kind of let it impact me. 
I wanted that part of life to have an impact on me. 
And because it was an important part of life. 
And so I stopped and went back to see what happened. 
And it wasn't a car bomb, but rather it was some young men who had, middle of the night had been speeding down in Middlefield at some phenomenal speed probably. 
And just before Safeway there was a little bridge and they went airborne. 
And they lost control of the car and they smashed into this brick wall in front of Safeway and into two cars, which they then apparently, it's part of what it looks like when they flipped over those two cars. 
And then landed somehow in the lane between the parking slots with a car all, but I couldn't believe that metal cars could be so twisted. 
And one of them died and the other one, last I heard, is in critical care. 
And so that impermanence, the speed of it, how quickly things can change, it's just phenomenal. 
And to kind of take that in and be aware that's also present in a sense all the time, the possibility of that kind of change and the awareness of it. 
And after kind of a contact with something like that, what does that say about how you want to live your life or what's really important and what's valuable and what it means to be a human being and how we take things in and how just so many things can get highlighted and kind of realize something like that, that level of change and impermanence. 
So what I'd like to do today and then for the next few Mondays is to talk about what's called the three characteristics, the three insights, the three primary insights that gives insight, meditation, its name, insight. 
So insight into something. 
And the three insights, the first one is impermanence. 
And the second is suffering or dukkha. 
And the third is not self. 
And so today what's doing now is kind of talking about impermanence. 
So these three are called the three characteristics. 
And they're emphasized in the Buddhist tradition for a variety of reasons. 
One reason is that it's supposed to be kind of true that this can characterize our experiences, that there's some very deep and important aspect of them where they are somehow impermanent, somehow unsatisfactory or dukkha, or somehow that there's not self. 
And so, but one of the reasons why in meditation, why it's important to begin seeing that, and why it gets seen and highlighted in meditation is that it turns out that having some deep insight into these three things is a means, a vehicle to liberating the mind. 
So the possibility of the mind or the heart not to be shackled, not to be held back by fear, by distress, by greed, by holding clings in the heart, is made a lot easier or is made possible through this very deep insight into these three characteristics. 
So to open up to the world of impermanence as it is in all the different ways that it exists, how can we do it or how do we see that? How do we take that in in such a way that it helps us become freer? And can we be motivated to go in that direction? Partly out of compassion and care for the world around us, the need of the world. 
The world needs people who can be present in ways that are not suffering filled. 
So in the Dhammapada there is a description or a little statement about these three characteristics that's very interesting because of what it adds in the description of the three characteristics. 
The basic formula, basic descriptions of the three characteristics goes something like this. 
All created things are impermanent. 
All created things are suffering. 
All things are not self. 
So first it says all created things are impermanent and all created things are somehow unsatisfactory or suffering or dukkha. 
We don't have everyone translate dukkha. 
And then it changes as all things are not self. 
So that will become important later on in a few weeks when we get to not self. 
It will be important to understand why it shifts there from saying all created things to all things when it gets to not self. 
So that's the basic formula, basic way the teaching is formulated. 
But here's a full statement in the Dhammapada. 
All things are impermanent. 
Seeing this with insight, one becomes disenchanted with suffering. 
This is the path to purity. 
All created things are suffering. 
Seeing this with insight, one becomes disenchanted with suffering. 
This is the path to purity. 
All things are not self. 
Seeing this with insight, one becomes disenchanted with suffering. 
This is the path to purity. 
So somehow seeing that all things are impermanent with insight. 
Not because you read it in a book and your logic tells you all the mountains are impermanent, eventually they'll erode and fall away. 
But to see impermanence as an immediate perception, as a seeing, just like you would hear the flapping of the wings, the impermanent rising and passing the flapping of the wings in the silence, or the way that you would see a flower fade, or you would see the arising of a cough and then the ending of it, you'd see the arising and passing of things. 
You see it with insight. 
Seeing this with insight, one becomes disenchanted with suffering. 
Now that's a very interesting statement. 
Disenchanted with suffering. 
Did you realize you were enchanted with suffering? Probably, you know, most people are not. 
So I don't know exactly why it says disenchanted with suffering. 
But somehow the insight into impermanence leads to a certain kind of disenchantment. 
Now one kind of easy way of maybe explaining this is that to become disenchanted with suffering is equivalent to being motivated to get to the root of suffering or to uproot the root that brings about our suffering. 
Somehow come the terms with it, somehow resolve it, deal with it, face it in a very direct way. 
To be disenchanted with suffering is to no longer be interested and willing to go along with the fact that we're suffering and just accept it. 
Everybody suffers, I just accept my suffering and then I'll be peaceful about it. 
But rather than just accepting it in some way, but actually no. 
I think I don't want to suffer anymore. 
One of the noble things to do in human life is to get to the heart of suffering, the causes of it, and somehow come to terms with it. 
So somehow the insight into impermanence, oh yeah, I'm going to really, this life is very precious. 
My time is not very long. 
For my own sake and for the sake of others, I'm going to take in this world of impermanence and I'm going to live life and look at what's really important. 
And some people feel what's really important is to get to the root of suffering. 
If you flip that over, or the opposite side of the coin of that statement, is to be interested in happiness. 
To live a life that's happy or peaceful or somehow has some deep abiding sense of well-being in how we live our lives. 
It's a kind of happiness and well-being perhaps that's not so easily blown away by the causes and conditions of the world. 
So to flip the attention and start tuning into the impermanence, how is it that's valuable? What is it that can be seen in the world of impermanence? I like to differentiate between three different ways of experiencing impermanence. 
It could be called three different levels of experiencing impermanence. 
And the first is what can be called the ordinary level. 
And that's the level that's available to everybody and they live their lives. 
And impermanence, change is something that's certainly happening all the time. 
And change is a tragedy in certain times. 
Certain times it brings suffering. 
Other times change is a delight. 
I'm so glad that's over. 
There's about time. 
I waited for long enough and that's over and I'm free. 
And so that's exchange that's been very inviting. 
Sometimes because things change, there's a possibility of not just simply something new arising, but also a possibility of shaping something new, prompting something new, creating something new, allowing there's potential in impermanence and change. 
And so how do we participate in the world? If things were always fixed, then we couldn't change anything. 
But because the world is a changeable world, it's a changing world and a changeable world, to some degree we also have some role in that change, in creating that change. 
And one of the places that that role has the greatest importance is the responsibility we have in directing the change of our own heart, our own psychophysical being, our own spiritual life. 
So the experience of impermanence or change, which is available to everyone, sometimes we've already talked about, sometimes we become acutely aware of it in this life. 
Sometimes it's slow. 
I think it's maybe something that seems to come with age. 
Now that I'm 50 years old, I don't know if that's the reason. 
But somehow it seems like that things are changing, that things are ephemeral. 
It seems that things are moving through much faster than they did when I was younger. 
And I somehow feel much more acutely aware of how things are just always changing and becoming something new and unfolding. 
And then at some point you turn this corner at a certain age, where you realize you can begin imagining or seeing your own end. 
And I know when I was 20, my end, of course, but there was an end to life. 
But that song, the Beatles song, when I'm 64, that was so far away. 
Unbelievable. 
When I was a teenager, wow, people really get to be 64. 
And now it seems like it's just around the corner. 
So it changed in permanence. 
Our friends come and go. 
As we get older, people die. 
Someday, soon enough, I'll be the most senior person in my generation and my family. 
That'll be my turn. 
I don't know when, but it'll happen probably. 
And so somehow I'm aware that as I've given this talk today, maybe I'm a little bit sober than usual. 
I don't know if it's a kind of a downer to listen to, I don't know what it's like. 
But there's certain kind of depth, serious depth, some kind of depth in our life that we live. 
And so the silence that we live in, the experience of impermanence, I think is part of that which gives depth to our life. 
And so to really take in the changing nature of life and really take it in, I think it gives a kind of depth that in some ways I think is very satisfying. 
In some ways it's also uncomfortable. 
Satisfying, uncomfortable, in either way kind of depth through our life. 
So the first level of experiencing impermanence is the ordinary level. 
And I think a lot of people become really wise in their contact with the ordinary human experience of impermanence. 
And sometimes it's wisdom which is painfully gotten because of life experience. 
And I've known people who are a lot wiser than Buddhists are. 
A lot of Buddhists that I know. 
Because somehow they've lived through many of the changes that life puts us through. 
And in those changes they have learned from that and feel that they've become somehow better or wiser from that experience. 
I've learned from it. 
So it's available to anybody, the wisdom if we take it from there. 
What's unique to Buddhism is not an appreciation of ordinary impermanence, but it's the second and third levels of impermanence, how to experience it. 
And the second level is the impermanence of insight. 
The insight level. 
And that's the impermanence when we experience things without the filter of our labels, the filter of our concepts that we overlay it to give things a semblance of permanence. 
And I think it's really easy to give things a semblance of permanence. 
We do it to ourselves, we do it to other people, we do it to our experiences in life all too often. 
And I think some of you have been the recipient of projection or ideas. 
People have kind of put you in a category of senior certain way. 
Once, really a long time ago, it happened, maybe almost happened 20 years ago, that you once almost got angry. 
But someone was there at that time. 
And from then on they're always cautious around you. 
And you want to tell them, no, no, not always this way. 
You know, I'm always this way, please, give me a break. 
You don't always see me this way. 
That's kind of a silly story, but the idea that somehow we, you know, people get an impression of us. 
And then they assume that's who you are. 
And sometimes you feel, please, please, you know, don't see me that way. 
Or someone who's seen only through the filter of being someone's spouse. 
Please, you know, don't see me that way. 
Just because I'm someone's spouse, that's not who I am. 
But then we have this label and there's some kind of permanence there. 
Sometimes children are surprised. 
Usually I think when they become an adult, or when they start having their own children, maybe, they find out that their parents are more than parents. 
Wait a minute. 
You know, they're not just parents. 
They're not just a mother or a father. 
They're all kinds of other roles and things. 
That's a revelation. 
There's more to them. 
And we do that to ourselves. 
We kind of see ourselves in certain ways. 
And we limit ourselves. 
We put ourselves in a certain category. 
And we assume a certain permanence here. 
And there tends to be a lot less permanence in our makeup than who we are. 
Then the assumption that we operate usually has. 
So to somehow be able to kind of drop behind the concepts, or let go of the concepts temporarily at least, to kind of put the mind to rest, put the conceptual mind to rest, the ideas to rest is a really radical thing to do. 
What you'll find if you look at the relationship between your ideas and concepts and your inner life of happiness and suffering, that chances are a great deal of your suffering is rooted in ideas you have about how things are. 
And if somehow you can step out of the ideas, you'll have a different perception of what's actually going on. 
And it isn't that the ideas aren't always wrong, but is it supposed to be always a young woman or always an old woman in the picture? To have that flexibility to move back and forth, we see the picture more fully for what it's intended to be. 
So if we're always seeing things through the filter of concepts, then we're missing a really important part of what's actually happening. 
Today I talked to a person who's been practicing for a long time, a very serious practitioner, a very wise person, very wise practitioner. 
Practice has done a lot of benefit for this person. 
But it seemed to me in talking to the person that there was a very deeply entrenched idea that the person was stuck in. 
It developed a lot of wisdom around this idea because human life, we need to develop wisdom around this idea. 
It's kind of a very important part of human life. 
But the person only knew that this was what human life was about and this was what his practice was about, was clarifying this one area. 
And this was the area of interpersonal relationships, interpersonal relationships with other people and to the world around. 
And the Buddha's teachings, which put a lot of emphasis on interdependence, really spoke to this person. 
And this person really saw the practice as being kind of revealing and understanding the world of impermanence in a very deep way. 
But if that's the only game in town, interdependence, interpenetration, interdependence, then that's not where freedom is found. 
Or certainly not the ultimate kind of freedom. 
There's a possibility in the human heart of finding a kind of presence or a kind of way of being that is at rest in itself, that is not existing in relationship to relationships. 
Does that make some sense? So that place of kind of independent abiding, where there's not a reference outside of presence, the sense of beingness, the sense of consciousness, which is kind of self-luminous, there's no reference outside of itself for itself. 
There's a sense of presence that can rest and be at peace in itself. 
And so this person was so focused on the idea of interdependence and interrelatedness, that the person seemingly never had an experience of non-dependent happiness or peace. 
And so it was stuck in this world of this concept of interdependence. 
And if you're in there, you could do a lot in it, the world of interdependence. 
But to some degree it's also like, you know, rearranging the deck chairs in the Titanic. 
You can adjust it and change it and get it in certain ways and have a lot of understanding. 
But you're going to miss that flip where you can see another possibility. 
So the insights part of mindfulness is a lot to do with training to relax the mind enough so we're not thinking about things anymore. 
I mean, not even things that are far away, like in the past and the future, but not even thinking about what's happening in the present. 
And it doesn't mean that we go numb. 
It doesn't mean we kind of shut off. 
It's the opposite. 
We become more fully perceptive of what is going on right here and now. 
There's a clear heightened sense of seeing. 
This is what's happening, or sensing, or feeling, or hearing, or whatever is going on. 
And as we stop thinking about things and seeing them in the immediacy, it has to be in the immediacy. 
So it has to be an immediacy in our perception, an immediacy in our presence, and an immediacy in our perception of what's going on. 
Then we start entering into this world of insight impermanence, the impermanence of insight, the impermanence of how things are constantly, that aspect of our moment-to-moment experience, which is constantly arising and passing, arising and passing, arising and passing. 
And it's really phenomenal to enter into deeply into the world of insight and permanence, to realize or to experience how quickly and thoroughly things are constantly changing and shifting. 
And even something we thought was permanent, or assumed was permanent, it's not. 
So, for example, physical pain, or emotional pain. 
From a distance it can seem like, oh, this is the way it is. 
I wake up, I'm depressed, this is the way it's going to be the rest of the day. 
This is the way I'm stuck, this is the way I'm going to be the rest of my life. 
I know it. 
But if you look very, very carefully, you have this immediacy in your presence, where you're willing to let go of your thoughts and ideas, your thinking, and really look in the immediacy of your experience, you'll find that your physical pain, you'll find that your emotional pain, and everything else, is actually arising and passing. 
It's actually something that's in flux, it's something that's not solid, but actually something that's moving. 
It's shifting from thinking, seeing ice to seeing water. 
Ice is solid, water is fluid. 
And so that shift, insight gives us that shift from ice to water. 
We start seeing that everything is flowing and moving and shifting. 
It doesn't mean the pain goes away, but the pain is kind of seen very differently than if it's ice. 
So to enter into the world of impermanence through insight, to the sense of immediacy in our perception, some people at this level of insight will equate this with physics, that the experience of impermanence that happens in deep insight meditation gives you an accurate and true perception of the impermanent nature of reality. 
Now I see that reality out there is in constant flux, always arising and passing, and rising and passing, moment by moment, the momentary arising and passing, and what's out there. 
And then I can read the Dalai physics, and it seems like we're all saying the Buddhists and the physics are saying the same thing, and it's deep, atomic, cellular, electron level, everything's arising and passing, and I see it. 
That's very interesting. 
But I think it's a mistake to go into a very, very deep sense of this immediate perception, immediate awareness, and the deeper it gets, I encourage people not to make any kind of metaphysical conclusions about what it is you're seeing. 
What you're seeing is not that important. 
What's important is the function that seeing has in freeing you. 
So as we get down and see this deeper and deeper level of insight, as we see the arising and passing of things, arising and passing of our experience, arising and passing of our experience, our experience is changing all the time, whether that's an accurate perception of the world outside is a metaphysical question. 
But our experience is constantly arising and passing, this immediacy. 
And the deeper you can go into that world, the more and more that impermanence challenges the deepest held, cherished attachments that the heart has. 
And some of the deepest clinging that we are very hard to see and touch and to let go of, they're certainly not perceptible in the ordinary everyday mind. 
You're walking around the streets, you can't even see the depth sometimes of the way where clinging is in the heart. 
But when the mind is really concentrated and the insight is really deep, then it kind of finally begins to convince. 
Not you. 
It isn't like you're going to get convinced, but it finally convinces your heart that it's okay to relax, to settle on itself and let go, not hold on to anything, not be defended in any way, not be contracted in itself in any way, not holding on to anything. 
And this then opens to the third level of insight. 
And this can be called the liberative level of insight. 
That experience of liberation that can come in a moment when we see impermanence so acutely or so deeply, or it touches that part of our heart so deeply, where the heart finally says, I might as well give up, or I might as well let go, or I can't do anything else but let go. 
And so, for some people, the deep insight into impermanence is called, becomes what's called a gate. 
It's called a gate to liberation, a gate of liberation. 
And there is the avenue by which some people relax the heart. 
And it's great. 
I mean, that's what the heart wants. 
I think that's what the mind, the heart mind is the same. 
That's what the heart most wants, I believe, is it wants to be so deeply at rest or trusting or so deeply settled on itself that it's not even holding on to itself. 
It's so much trust in the heart that you just no need to contract, no need to hold on, no matter what's going on. 
So, three levels of insight, these three levels apply to each of the three characteristics, whether it's impermanence, dukkha, suffering, or not self, when each of those three characteristics provides a different door into liberation. 
And for reasons I don't know, some people tend to go through the door of impermanence, some people tend to go through the door of suffering, and some people go through the door of not self. 
That's the way to help the heart let go and relax. 
So I talked about the pictures, the old woman, young woman, flipping and switching the perception, seeing both, and so you might try that this week. 
And in particular, you might do that in the context of silence. 
Even when things are really noisy, you might see if you can kind of switch between into the silence or the stillness that's here. 
And perhaps that stillness or that silence will make you much more aware of how things are arising and passing, how things are passing through the impermanence of it all. 
And perhaps that will add depth and freedom to your experience of the life that you're living this week. 
So thank you for listening so well.
