One of the really important opportunities of meditation is  
that it’s a time in our life when we’re not actually doing a 
lot. We’re sitting here quietly . In times like these, we’re 
not having to do a lot of things,  to engage in the world , 
or to solve  problems . There’s an opportunity to switch 
our focus from what  we’re doing to how we are .  
 
We can switch our focus away from our activities, from 
what we think we are, and from our concern s. We can 
switch from what to how  – how we are ; how we are in 
the moment . The how means how we’re engaged with 
being present and mindful . And it also means how we 
are a living, breathing person at this moment. Are we 
settled? Are we agitated? Are we happy or sad? Are we 
confused? Are we confident, steady? Are we tense? 
How are we? How is it?  
 
Once we recognize how we are, then the awareness 
practice, the mindfulness practice, is to accompany 
ourselves with something very special. It’s like 
accompanying ourselves with how we are – as if we’re a 
friend to ourself. We can a ccompany oursel ves as if we 
might  offer a sense of sacred presence  – a sacred context for how we are.  
 
Mindfulness is like holding how we are . It is the place at 
the center , where we can relax or soften in the midst of 
however we are. How we are doesn’t have to change . 
But there’s a place inside that can be relaxed  – and can  
see how we are , be with it, accompany it, hold it , and be 
the companion for how we are.  
 
The idea of being the companion or accompanier of 
how we are is not a light -weight thing . It’s not a minor 
thing – which we would tend to think it is, if  what  is 
important were  doing or accomplish ing something , or 
figuring things out. I think that when we can offer a kind, 
supportive presence, accompaniment, companionship 
with how we are, it allows how we are to have space  – 
to be what it is . It allows how we are to evolve, change, 
grow, relax, heal, reconcile, open, and reveal itself . All 
kinds of things can start happening in that simple space  
of how we are – that simple sharing of presence.  
 
To start noticing how you are in the moment  – in 
walking meditation or in sitting  – is more than what 
you’re doing , and more than wh at you are. We have a ll 
these stories and ideas about what we are , what we 
need to do , what we should do , and what’s  happen ing 
to us.  
 
In switch ing from what to how , how is always in the present moment. How are you? How are you now? 
Then see what that is, and allow your attention to settle 
in, or be here in a supportive way with the how . Take it 
in. Make space for how in your awareness. Part of the 
function of present moment awareness, of being here, is 
to be with the how. If you like using the breath , or the 
steps in walking meditation, that’s like a meeting place  – 
a grounding for awareness  of the how. We breath with 
the how. We walk with the how. Just stay close to  it, and 
be its companion.  
 
The premise behind this idea of being with how you are 
is that how you are is actually very important. It’s a 
valuable part of yourself ; it’s precious. Even if you’re 
feeling off , depressed , or angry , or something – if you 
can accompany the ho w, it’s you. And you’re important, 
valuable.  
 
You can just be with how you are and see what opens, 
what unfolds, what happens in that meeting . Maybe if 
nothing else happens , then just the fact that you 
become relaxed about how you are – just allowing 
yourself to be that way  – can be quite meaningful  in the 
simplicity of just sitting, the simplicity of walking.  
 
May how you are be a path to peace.  Thank you.
