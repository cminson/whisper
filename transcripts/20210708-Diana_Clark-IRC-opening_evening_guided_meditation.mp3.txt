 So now we'll meditate for a little bit. So, allow yourself to get into a posture that feels like a one in which you can maintain comfortably. Try a little bit here. And we'll begin by just noticing that you're sitting. Can you sit and know you're sitting? In a global sense. Allow yourself to feel connected to whatever is supporting you. Maybe a chair, a cushion, couch. Feeling connected, grounded. And then bringing the attention to the sensations of breathing. Feeling the movement of the body as it breathes. Maybe resting the attention on the chest or the belly. Or perhaps feeling the air going in and out of the nose. Whatever feels readily accessible and supportive, choosing that location. And just feeling the sensations associated with breathing. Feeling the expansion and the subsequent contraction. Maybe there's a little feeling of stretching. Maybe there's some tightness and then the tightness goes away in this rhythm. Trusting that the body knows how to breathe. You don't have to manipulate the breath. We're just noticing the experience of breathing in a simple, relaxed way. And we find the balance between straining and jumping on the breath and being too cavalier. Just to have our attention lightly on the sensations of breathing. And when the mind wanders, we don't have to make it a problem. We don't have to make a big story about it. Just very simply, gently, begin again with the sensations of breathing. This Shutc Nothing in particular needs to be happening. We're just noticing, resting our awareness on the sensations of breathing. We're just noticing, resting our awareness on the sensations of breathing. We're just noticing, resting our awareness on the sensations of breathing. We're just noticing, resting our awareness on the sensations of breathing. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end of the inhales. Noticing the beginning, middle and end of the exhales. And the transitions between inhales and exhales. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. It wouldn't be surprising if you found yourself lost in thought. Just very simply, gently begin again with the sensations of breathing. Just like you've been thinking all day. Now we're just allowing the mind to settle. It absolutely does not matter how many times you begin again. It's irrelevant. We just simply begin again with the sensations of breathing. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. What would it be like to give yourself over to being with the sensations of breathing? Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end. Noticing the beginning, middle and end.
