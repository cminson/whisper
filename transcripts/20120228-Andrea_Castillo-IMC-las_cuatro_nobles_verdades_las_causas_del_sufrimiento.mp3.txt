The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

The four noble truths are considered the essence of Buddhist teachings.
It is said that if something does not enter into this topic of the four noble truths,
then it is not Buddhism.
Just as we saw in the five obstacles, these four noble truths are not taken as beliefs, but as a guide.
This idea, this concept of the four noble truths is part of the first sermon that the Buddha gave after his enlightenment.
It is called the Discourse of the Opposition in Movement of the wheel of Dharma.
There is an interesting story about why the wheel that I do not want to repeat,
but I recommend it if you were not here for the first part of the four noble truths and you can listen to it online.
Now with these teachings of the four noble truths,
the Buddha was not only trying to reduce the stress, but something much greater.
And that is why it is sometimes called the fact that these truths are inobligatory,
that is to say that practicing these truths endures the person.
Let's see if we remember which are the four noble truths.
Does anyone remember the first one we saw three weeks ago?
Do you remember, Sonia?
Yes.
What is it?
Suffering exists.
Exactly.
The first one is that suffering exists in life.
And I remember that we saw a little bit of the Dukha term in Pali.
It is traditionally translated as suffering,
but I like to use the term Dukha in Pali because Dukha in reality is the whole range
from a small inconvenience because it brings a little stone in the sock to an intense suffering
because you lost someone you loved.
It is the whole range.
So that is the first one.
Suffering exists and we all know that.
We can be uncomfortable because we eat too much or because we are hungry or because we are tired.
Everything is part of Dukha.
In the second noble truth we focus on investigating what causes make us suffer.
And that is what we see now.
In the third noble truth it is possible that we reach the end of suffering.
That is the good news.
It is possible.
And in the fourth noble truth the Buddha, recognizing that it is tremendously difficult to reach the end of suffering,
says, I will help you, I will offer you a recipe.
It is called Sendero.
The noble Sendero Octuple.
And in that account are the four noble truths.
Imagine a cordon that opens and there are eight aspects of how we should live our life
in such a way that we have the possibility to free ourselves from suffering.
At the end of these four noble truths we will focus on these eight parts.
So things arise because there is a cause.
So if we say that we are going to investigate now the causes of suffering, it is important to see that everything arises because of a cause.
There is a cause and then there is an effect.
It rains because there are clouds.
In the moment that the clouds arise, the clouds disappear, it stops raining.
The most brief and direct way to explain the causes of our suffering,
we can say that they are the multiple obstacles that we have.
If we look for a way to say as briefly as possible why we suffer,
Buddha says we suffer because we get stuck to endless things.
And that is what we are going to see.
How do we get stuck? What do we get stuck to?
Then Buddha says if there are these causes, we are going to see the way to get rid of these causes
because obviously when we remove this cause for suffering, we do not identify with suffering.
So here there is no identity and in the moment that there is no identity we realize that suffering affects us all.
It is the common denominator for all.
When we realize this common denominator, we can take it as an invitation to investigate these rigid and separatist limits
that we create between us and the others.
We do not realize that in reality it causes us a lot of pain.
We get isolated. The more we separate from the others, the more we are going to suffer.
So, really capturing the four noble truths is an invitation to dismantle these rigid limits that we have in our environment.
Discovering that suffering is part of the integral part of life and that we all share it.
Then we are able to have compassion towards ourselves and the others.
When we offer compassion and discernment to our suffering, we are being compassionate towards ourselves.
And being sensitive and receptive to the suffering of others is a compassionate act that extends outwards from us.
So it is of the same importance to have compassion inside and outside.
We want to have these two directions of compassion in the same proportion.
So, when we discover that our suffering is intimately connected with our attachment,
then the logical thing is that in the next step we are going to investigate our attachments.
In a Buddhist discourse, it crystallizes four attachments.
There are many lists in Buddhist teachings and this appears in one of its discourses.
The first of the attachments, what do you think it will be?
Think about the five obstacles.
Do you remember the first obstacle?
The sensual desire that appears in several of the lists.
We remember how we saw it with the obstacles.
The sensual desire in itself is not a problem, it is not a problem to feel desire for this or for the other.
It is a problem when we live life, when we act without regaining capacity.
The sensual desire can be as innocent as wanting a chocolate or as intense as wanting a drug
to be able to hurt someone to obtain this drug.
So, this attachment to pleasure, what causes suffering, is pleasure and to be comfortable.
This desire to evade discomfort, which can be expressed in a desire to be unmasked by food, sex, security, and to be accompanied.
All this has a root in something very simple, the desire to be comfortable.
The desire to be comfortable is part of pleasure or sensual desire.
Many people orient their lives in such a way as to obtain the greatest amount of pleasure and the smallest amount of discomfort.
There is enormous motivation to achieve this.
The Buddha says that when we live our life regained by desires, it is as if we were in debt.
As if we had to pay the bank a certain amount every month, but the debt has no bottom.
It is the same with our desires. There will always be more desires.
The number is enormous, constant.
The desire to give pleasure to each of our desires would have no meaning and would not be realistic as trying to empty the sea with a debt.
We are not done.
I also mention that not going to the other extreme is not appropriate.
The Buddha suggested not to live a life in which there is a total deprivation and an ascetic life where you almost don't eat and let yourself go through colds.
He recommends the middle path, to eat enough, to take care of yourself enough to be healthy, to be able to have the mental clarity that we need to live better.
It is always to find that balance, not to let yourself go through desires and not to be deprived of an exaggerated degree.
The second is our opinions, or we could also say our history.
We all have all kinds of stories, interpretations, and imposition of meaning to things.
We have opinions and impressions that we carry throughout our lives.
There are stories of who I am, of what has happened to me, of who and how others are.
That is something tremendously harmful when we make the totally solid opinion of who you are.
Because maybe you have a profound change and I am unable to see that you have transformed yourself.
It is very important not to solidify the opinion of others or ourselves.
When I was thinking about these attacks, I did not want to give you the list.
Instead, I started thinking about an example that I can think of in my own life, where I realized the suffering that one can experience when we attack our stories.
I remembered a situation a few years ago, when I was giving classes in Stanford as part of the doctoral program.
I had to give classes to a group of students, especially brilliant students.
I felt that I had to be alert, alert, because they all captured me on the flight.
On the last day of class, something complicated happened to me and I was wrong.
It is obvious that everyone realized that I was wrong.
And not only that, but as it was the last day of class, it was the day of evaluations.
I had to distribute the evaluations.
I felt awful because I said, I was wrong and now they are going to give me an awful evaluation.
In two weeks, more or less, the evaluations were sent to me in a envelope.
I still felt so wrong, so ashamed of having made this mistake, that I did not have the courage to open the envelope.
I hid it.
Somehow, I was carrying that suffering.
Years passed and when I was cleaning my things, the envelope appeared.
A little time passed and I said, well, now I have the courage to open it.
I opened it and I began to read the evaluations.
There was one evaluation after another of the most enthusiastic and positive.
The tears began to come out because at that moment I realized how it is possible
that all this time I carried the idea of having been unable
and my concern with myself and myself made me create my mistake,
inflate it much bigger than it was.
So, if we disclose this story,
one, as I mentioned, a simple mistake meant a misplaced meaning.
Two, I locked myself into a certain interpretation that caused me pain for a long time.
As part of my tool, I carried this burden for a long time
and I did not have the courage to face it, to unpack it, even after a while.
When I had the courage to face it, I discovered that my interpretation was not real.
In reality, we realize that at 95% of the time, it is not real
nor is it necessary these interpretations that we make in our heads.
So, I hope this story will help you because this is something we do.
For me, the moment of reading and the tears were like a moment of realization
of what I have done all this time.
The German poet Goethe says that our extreme concern with our person
makes us believe that our mistakes, just as our virtues,
are much bigger than they are in reality.
Interesting, isn't it? Not only virtues, but also mistakes.
It is such our concern that we inflame them, much more than they are.
So, a huge part of the wisdom of Buddhist tradition is based on the observation
of our stories, interpretations, and how we assign them meaning.
Also, the teachings help us to recognize how we build these stories,
how we recognize that they are actually arbitrary
and how they are not actually necessary.
The third appeal is quite interesting.
It is the appeal to religious practices or spiritual practices or virtues.
How do you see it? It is quite original.
So, let's think about history.
How many times have we not seen in repeated history that there are wars,
that people are killed because of religion issues?
It is very common for me to get involved in a religion,
and I feel that I have the truth.
And if you don't have the same idea as me,
I feel that I have the right to declare war and even kill.
It is incredible to think, but how many times have we not seen it in humanity?
So, I love that in Buddhism there is this protection,
that Buddha said,
be careful, don't stick to beliefs or Buddhist philosophy.
Always keep your mind open and let others think what they believe.
Never, never in Buddhism is this practice of wanting to convince others.
If you want others to share your ideas,
live the teachings.
Not necessarily speak them.
There is a comment that I heard a while ago
of a woman who went to visit her parents
and commented,
my parents get very upset when I say that I am a Buddhist,
but they love it when I behave like a Buddhist.
That's it.
Nice difference, isn't it?
So, people are attached to spiritual traditions and spiritual practices
because they offer us a sense of security and certainty.
There are people who lack that internal stability and need to stop for something.
My mother did, with the Catholic religion,
and she locked herself up and needed it.
She needed that stability.
Now, Buddha says,
be careful, don't stick to spiritual practices,
but be careful not to stick to practice.
Don't stick to meditative states.
If one day you have a wonderful meditative state and you feel exquisite,
be careful because 99% of us stick to it and look for it again.
We want to return to that state.
It's a very common trap.
The fourth attachment, and the last one, is the attachment to the I.
That's enormous.
The attachment to the identity and representation of the I and the self-image.
The whole constellation that we built around the idea of the I.
By regulating it, we all have a huge attachment to our I.
Now, having no attachment to the I doesn't mean we're going to do anything, neutrality.
As they say in English, a floor mat.
Something that everyone stares at you, that you don't have opinions.
No, not that either.
Let's remember that the Buddha was a guerrilla.
I told you that in the first part of the Four Noble Truths.
And that Buddhism is associated with the symbol of power, that is, the wheel.
The Buddha doesn't describe himself as a retreating person,
or that he is isolated or silent in his spirituality.
It is more, it is said, strangely, but it is said that he had a ray of the lion.
How to describe his power.
He had a confidence in himself, in himself that was very, very powerful.
So, to get rid of this attachment, we have to gradually get rid of the I.
That is done, paulatinamente.
I think that within the practices of these Four Noble Truths,
what the most work costs and what we need is more experience.
We can't let go too soon.
We have to do it in proportion to internal stability.
If we let go too soon, there may be some confusion, some anxiety.
Because for some reason we have this identity.
When we talk about a root, it implies something latent.
Something latent because we don't normally see the roots.
They are under the earth.
So it is something that we have to go to excavate, to do the work, to discover that they are there.
We don't see it easily.
Normally it is invisible to us.
But as I said three weeks ago, the reason for the meditation
is to begin to understand, to differentiate the roots and the branches.
The ability to look with more depth is a little like using a telescope.
When we can already have calm, imagine that it is like using a telescope
mounted on a very stable tripod.
If we use a telescope that is in constant motion, we don't see anything.
It has to be based on something very stable and quiet.
And that is our mind.
That is why we meditate.
In case of a sudden doubt arises, why am I doing this?
It is to achieve this attitude, to achieve clarity.
Now I want to finish with a very brief story,
which is very appropriate to clarify the subject of our glue and its consequences.
The story describes how in the south of India they used to catch the changos.
They took a coco, they made it into a small hole,
they took out the liquid and put it in a banana.
You hang the coco from the tree and wait for a chango to come.
You smell the banana, put your hand in it, take the banana and then you believe.
The hand no longer fits, you can no longer take it out because the hole is too small.
The chango does not release the banana, it does not happen to release the banana.
You hang it there and the hunter comes and without any problem, the chango comes.
Now imagine that this is exactly what we do with our glue.
We press them and we do not see how they are damaging us and the consequences are so strong that they come.
So that is all and now we are going to see if there are any questions.
Take your time because there is.
You mentioned at the beginning about suffering.
I sometimes heard that suffering is optional, pain is mandatory.
I do not know if I understand it well, or that is the expression.
Right now I want to say that we all suffer and I sometimes heard this,
that suffering is optional, pain is mandatory, or it is the same.
There is definitely this difference and if you remember, a while ago I told you the story
that the Buddhist teachings show that when the Buddha asks if someone throws a arrow to hurt me,
everyone says, yes, of course, and if they throw another arrow to hurt me, yes, of course, it will hurt me more.
So the first arrow, the Buddha says, that is the pain that exists in the world.
The pain that happens to me when I get injured and I get hurt.
The pain that comes when you get old, when you get sick, when you lose a loved one.
But what we add to it, the second arrow is what we add to it.
And that is what you are mentioning, Francisco, that is the optional part.
That is, the chango, its second arrow is that it does not let go.
If the chango could understand, if I let go, the silver does not save my life,
so much suffering has ended, but it is so close to the pleasure of the silver that it does not let go.
So how many times have we seen people we know that, for example,
they give a passion to someone who knows that they are going to cause enormous pain and suffering in their lives,
but they are not able to say, no, I do not follow this path,
because I know that if I follow this passion, I am going to create a series of enormous suffering,
the same is with drinking, if we do not have control of drinking alcohol, we are also causing a series of tremendous suffering.
Yes, is it clear? Have you heard it before or not? No. Yes, that is great. If you want, the second arrow is optional.
Another question. Yes, it is clear about the causes of suffering, of suffering.
Another question.
About the sufferings.
It is difficult for me to see how to work with the suffering of things living in society.
I understand that, for example, maybe that is why Buddhists retire,
or I had the idea that I lived a more distant, a more lonely life, but, for example,
I, who live in society constantly attacked by advertising, media, all this,
it is difficult for me to understand how I can work all this in my normal social life.
When I have the need that society itself pushes me to pay, therefore, to work, and to wish.
It moves in a circle, not in an orchestra.
You know, Francisco, that is a great question, because if we manage to crystallize exactly the point,
the threshold of why it is going to be more difficult for you in the middle of society
than a monk who is retired in his cave, why?
It is about responding to it.
Why is it more difficult for you in the middle of the trifle than the monk in his cave?
If that is clear, they are already on the other side.
Where is the Meoyo?
I think that conception has an idea.
Let's see, pass the microphone.
I think the difference is that the monk already has the consciousness,
and he is still fighting with the decisions he has to make.
Yes, you are right, you are right, but we can formulate it even clearer,
because what I do not want to be left in the mind is because it is a monk,
then he can or the monk, of course, they can and they have the opportunity to free themselves,
and we do not.
What is the Meoyo?
You said consciousness, tell me a little more, what is consciousness?
I think that he has already made the decision.
Ok, of course, and that is very important, but when you make the decision,
what is the monk has?
The option of saying, do you know what I do or do not?
Of course, and why does he have the option?
Because he frees himself, he has the knowledge that there is liberation.
And why does he have the knowledge?
Where is the Meoyo? Where is the root?
Because of the reasoning.
And the knowledge of himself rests on what?
A mind, how?
Echo, echo, there it is.
That is the Meoyo.
A mind that is calm, calm, that looks with clarity,
that is the base of the monk.
And from there everything comes out, what you told me is conception, of course everything is essential,
but even more below, I mean, I wanted to look for what is below,
because that connects us all,
that is, that you within this society,
you pull the television, you pull the network, you pull the radio,
you pull the family, you pull the friends, etc., etc.
Everything, everything, you pull the attention,
what we have to do is turn, turn, turn,
to look for that core of stability, of tranquility.
And there is calm, there are, there are, there are, there are vislumbas,
which is the correct thing for you.
Yes, no, what happens is that I do not say that it cannot be,
but it is much more difficult.
Of course, of course.
Yes, it costs me.
It is difficult because we are in an initiative process,
but someone who has walked through those steps and who has,
because I do know people who live,
I do know people who, living in a society,
if they have been able to get rid of most of things,
people who live very isolated and who live with great needs
of what they do not even have access to,
I think this is more internal.
Yes, look, how good it is that you mentioned that pillar,
because I do not know if you have ever experienced,
when you have gone through very difficult times in life,
that you are overwhelmed,
and you have the opportunity to go to a beautiful place,
to a splendid beach, and you arrive.
And there it is again.
They are in a calm, calm environment,
but what they bring in their mind is there.
So that is why I hear,
the beginning is tranquility, stability, calmness,
and that is why we want to meditate daily.
That is the best protection for this world
that is constantly pulling us.
The less we meditate, the less we realize
how the environment is pulling us everywhere.
But when we meditate, at least we see it,
and we no longer get agitated,
and we say, well, that's how our world is.
Yes?
Well, I had the opportunity to take out several important pieces,
so thank you very much for the contribution of these two.
Concepción, as I see a question that you want to ask.
Well, yes.
What happens to me is that many times,
I have done things with full consciousness,
and I know, and I say, why didn't I do it?
Why? Why?
You know?
And I know, but I say, well, I have to work on this,
and I don't have to do it for the next one,
I don't have to do it,
but sometimes it is difficult for me,
and I fall, and again I fall.
And sometimes I say, maybe I won't be able to do it.
How?
Sometimes I say, maybe I won't be able to do it,
and sometimes it causes me suffering,
and it can be worse,
because you already have the consciousness
of what you said or what you did.
Of course.
Yes, look,
when you advance in practice,
you are cleaning your behavior,
your mind, your environment,
and then the mistakes,
you realize that now you have a white cloth,
white, white, before it was a pagliacate,
and a little stain was not seen much,
but now you have,
you have done all this meditation,
and you are very calm,
now you have an impeccable white stain,
and there is a stain of tomato,
and that is what happens,
that when you go on a path where you know,
where your behavior is going,
your thinking is going,
and we make mistakes,
it hurts a lot,
but that is where compassion comes in.
So we take the thread again
that I mentioned a while ago in the talk,
which is about compassion.
Compassion is an incredibly important element
in this practice,
because the more clarity we have,
the more we realize the mistakes
that we bring inside,
all of us, all of us.
So if compassion does not grow
in the same proportion
that we see inside,
and taking out these old and terrible things,
we get discouraged.
We see ourselves so imperfect
that we are no longer able to continue.
So compassion, compassion,
and bondage,
we have to cultivate it
and see that we are all imperfect.
It is a little step at the same time,
a little step.
And also remember this of guilt,
that in Buddhism you do not work on guilt.
You say, ok, I put my foot on the other one,
this opportunity caught me,
but on the other one I will try to do it better,
I will try to do it better.
And you do not turn around and go forward,
and you do not give yourself a beating,
but you recognize with affection
that you realized and that is already very funny,
that is already the gain.
But it hurts, it hurts when...
I tell you because I have seen it in me too.
There are certain people who have the ability to touch our nerves and we play immediately.
Those difficulties, those people, we have to see them as our teachers who challenge us to grow.
We have two minutes, three minutes if there is another question.
Well, while I give you very good news, let's finish the recording.
