Bring your attention to the present moment.
Letting go out the past.
Letting go out the future thoughts.
Settling in the present moment.
Feel the body.
And feel the mind.
Take time to do some visualization meditation in order to understand the stillness of the mind.
In order to practice stillness as a meditation object.
Visualize a still pool in the deep, deep jungle.
Visualize a lake with still water.
Visualize yourself sitting in front of this water.
And comparing your mind to this still water, undisturbed.
Ooh.
The water is so still that you can almost not see the water.
Similarly, the mind is so still that there is no disturbance, no mind.
The early morning the dew drops can fall onto this body of water, making ripples.
Similarly, the thoughts may rise.
They may hear sounds. Just like those ripples, they rise, they pass away.
You don't need to do anything special to calm the mind. Just let it be.
Feel the intensity of disturbance and slowly it's passing away.
Visualize your body as a rock in front of this water.
Undisturbed still.
Let the body be part of the nature.
Let the body be still and the mind be clear.
Let the body be in the state of stillness and clarity.
Let the body be in the state of stillness and clarity.
If you forget where we are, return back.
Return back to that stillness.
When you are ready, let go of the visualization and connect with that stillness.
When you are ready, let go of the visualization and connect with that stillness.
Let go of the visualization and connect with that stillness.
Let go of the visualization and connect with that stillness.
Once again, when we forget where we are, return back to that place, the place of stillness.
Be aware how you feel the body. How does the body feel in the stillness?
What's the nature of your mind? The mind is undisturbed.
It's returning back to its nature.
Let go of the visualization and connect with that stillness.
Feel the whole body in the state of stillness.
I'm returning back to the visualizations one more.
The body of water.
This time, see how calm the water is, how still the mind is.
Even with all the sounds we can find silence.
Even with all the thoughts we can find peace.
Even with all the sensations, movement, we can find the stillness in the body.
Thank you.
