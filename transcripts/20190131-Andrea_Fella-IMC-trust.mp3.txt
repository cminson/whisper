The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So my name is Andrea, and for those of you that I've not met before,
it's nice to see you all here this evening.
The topic that I thought of reflecting on tonight is trust.
We could also look at it from the perspective of faith.
The word that's often translated as faith, sometimes it's translated as confidence, it's trust.
And so sometimes some of us have a conflicted relationship with the word faith,
so I like to offer different words.
But to start I'd like to think or reflect a little bit about how we start on our spiritual path.
For many of us, not all I don't think, but for many of us there's often some kind of contact with suffering,
a sense of feeling like, as the Buddha put it at one point,
does anybody know a way or two out of this suffering?
And so we begin a kind of a search there of, given the struggles that we're having in our lives,
does anybody know how to live life in a different way,
or does anybody know how to meet this so that it's not so challenging?
And so there may be a little bit of that contact with suffering and a little bit of a search.
Does anybody know of a way to meet this or work with this or transform this in some way?
For me, suffering was definitely the doorway into practice.
And I had this kind of question.
I'd been trying many different things to navigate my life,
and it just kept feeling like I just kept running into maybe different versions of the same wall.
Over and over again.
And I had that sense of that question.
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know how to deal with life?
And right around that time, a friend sent me a book about Buddhist practice.
And that, to me, at least, was the beginning of a little bit of an answer.
It talked about things in a way that I hadn't really approached before,
and it was not intuitive the way it approached working with suffering.
But at the same time, because I felt like I'd hit so many different walls,
it's like I was basically ready to try.
I was ready to try something new or something that didn't seem clear or obvious.
And so this points to two sides of what happens to us, I think,
as we step on a spiritual path, or things that help us to step onto a spiritual path.
We've got something that motivates us, first of all.
For me, it was suffering.
And then there's that sense of asking a question,
you know, does somebody know a way? And if we happen to hear or meet some teachings
or meet some kind of wisdom that points a direction,
are we willing to engage with that?
Are we willing to essentially have some faith or have some trust
that this proposed path is a good direction for us?
And so this, really, I would say that most of us,
probably if you reflect back on your own beginning of your own journey,
you'll find some flavor of hearing of some kind of wisdom,
some kind of teaching, something that a friend said
or something you read in a book,
and something maybe that piqued your curiosity a little bit.
And then there was a willingness, potentially, a sense of,
well, maybe I'll try that.
And to me, that willingness, you know, that sense of, for me, reading that book,
as I said, it didn't make a lot of sense to me.
I mean, the basic teaching in that book was something like,
pay attention to your suffering with mindfulness, be aware of it in the present moment.
That's kind of what I got from that book, and it's like, well, what good is that going to do?
Isn't that just going to make me suffer more?
And so the information was not intuitive,
and yet the friend that had given it to me had said, this has been helpful.
So I was willing to kind of trust my friend to some extent.
I was willing to think, well, okay, my friend said it's helpful.
I don't get how it's helpful, but my friend says it's helpful,
and the person who's writing this book says it's helpful.
And nothing else has worked anyway.
So what do I have to lose, basically?
And so that's the other piece.
So there's some kind of a meeting with some kind of a teaching or some wisdom.
And then there's the willingness to engage with that wisdom.
A willingness to engage with what that wisdom says.
And in the case of the wisdom of the Buddha, the teachings that the Buddha offers,
his whole teaching is oriented around the question of suffering,
and I think that's why so many of us in this particular path have a kind of suffering as a doorway in,
because the wisdom that the Buddha offers speaks directly to that doorway.
If you're suffering, the teachings say if you're suffering and you do these things
and you engage in this way, your suffering will release.
You will find your way to a different kind of happiness.
A happiness of letting go, a happiness of transformation.
Not a happiness that is our usual way of thinking about happiness,
of arranging our lives to be more pleasant, about arranging our lives to get rid of those things that are unpleasant,
but a different kind of happiness.
And so the wisdom of the Buddha is really speaking to suffering.
And if we, in hearing some of those teachings, have a sense of willingness to engage,
even that, for me, that's all it was at first, was a simple willingness to engage.
And again, for me, the way that the teachings were offered was pretty congenial for my mind,
because the teachings of other spiritual practices or offerings from other spiritual paths
that I had come in contact with to that point in my life,
felt like they had more to do with believing in something.
Again, so it touches into faith, having faith in something that is not tangible,
and that faith is what would transform me.
And I didn't understand or didn't see kind of things to do other than have faith.
And with the Buddhist teachings, what I found was a teaching that points to suffering and says,
and here's some things to do.
Here's a way to engage.
Here's some practices.
Doing this will help you be happier.
And so for me, it was a more accessible kind of teaching.
It felt more like a proposal.
It's like the book that I read was, well, if you're suffering and you do these things,
you'll suffer less.
And it's like, okay, well, that person says that, my friend says that.
I don't get how it works, but maybe I'm willing to run the experiment.
I tend to be kind of scientific.
And so it's like somebody says, you do X, it leads to Y.
It's like, well, okay, I'll try X and see if Y happens.
So there was this willingness to try something.
But that is a form of faith.
That is a form of engagement.
That kind of willingness to pick up the engagement with the practices that the Buddha teaches.
And so that the faith in this particular spiritual journey,
there is a little bit of a sense of trusting or faith in something that we don't know
or that's not tangible to us initially.
I mean, certainly what I read in that book around paying attention to your suffering
was like, I didn't understand.
I didn't have a sense of how that would be helpful.
And so there was a little bit of trust that it would be helpful.
But at the same time, it offered me things to do.
It said here, pay attention to your experience like this.
Use mindfulness.
Like turn the attention to the human experience.
What is the experience of this suffering?
Like whatever it is, frustration or confusion,
what does it feel like to be a human being experiencing that?
And so this was the simple, simple instruction that I got from this book.
And that I was willing to try.
It was simple enough that I could understand that much.
There was a lot else in the book I didn't understand,
but that was simple enough that I could understand that much.
And it felt like something I could try.
And so this is essentially how faith begins,
is a hearing of a teaching, a hearing of some kind of wisdom
and a willingness to engage in the Buddha's teaching.
It's a willingness to pick up the practices that he suggests.
In one poem, it's something like this is in the Dhammapada.
I don't remember it exactly, but it's something along the lines of,
you know, the Buddhas don't free you.
They just point the way.
You have to engage. You have to walk the path.
And so that to me was also very congenial.
It's like this is an action.
It's action for me to engage with this.
It's not just like somehow in some of the other spiritual traditions,
it felt like I was giving over action or giving over something
and hoping for some kind of grace.
But this was giving me something that I could engage with.
And so this for me was very, very congenial, this style of teaching.
And so this being the beginning of faith, are we willing to engage?
And so I'd like to pause here for just a moment
and reflect a little bit about the word faith.
As I said, it could be translated as trust.
That's the most congenial for me, trust.
I like that word. It's very resonant.
Can I trust this practice?
Can I trust how my mind is when I'm engaged with right mindfulness?
Faith, confidence. Confidence is another word that's resonant for me.
But what is it?
We in our lives are putting faith in something,
consciously or kind of subconsciously,
putting our faith in something that will help us to live our lives.
And this I think is really where I felt like I kept hitting these walls.
It's like all of these different ways I tried.
It's like, well, I keep running into a closed door there, a closed door there, a closed door there.
It's like, okay, these ways don't seem to be working very well.
Putting my faith in, trying to construct my life so that people would look at me in a particular way.
Well, maybe I had a little bit of success, but then somebody would not see me
in the way that I wanted them to see me.
Or a relationship that I really had kind of put my faith in.
This relationship is what's going to make me happy.
This relationship, this is going to be my relationship for the rest of my life.
There's a way that we put faith in these things.
That just crumbling and realizing that place was not a good place for faith.
And so what is it that we put our faith in?
Do we put our faith in material things?
Even in our ability to do a job or in having a home and all of those things in our home.
In some quiet, kind of subtle ways we might land there for our happiness.
I've got that as a place to land, that house, those things.
This past fall, last November, with all of those fires, I was reminded so much of how ephemeral,
even things that seem very solid are.
And so the usual ways that we do kind of look for happiness and place our trust, place our faith in,
they're not so reliable.
And the Buddha in his journey also ran up against this and began to ask the question,
why am I pinning my hopes for happiness on things that are unreliable?
Is there a different kind of happiness that might be available that's not about pinning my hopes on the unreliable?
And that was kind of the beginning of his quest, of his journey.
And through his own discovery, he didn't have somebody sitting there telling him,
here, try this.
He did have people telling him, oh, do this, or do this.
And a lot of it seemed to be about concentration practices or about ascetic practices,
or settling the mind into such stillness that there was a blissful kind of state for that time that the mind was settled.
Or these ascetic practices, which was kind of about denying the body of its physical needs
in the hopes that for some, I think there was this kind of a sense that as you deny the body of the physical needs,
then the soul kind of ejects itself from the body and there's a kind of transcendence that happens there.
And he had tried, and those were kind of the teachings of the time, at the time of the Buddha,
and he went to explore what was available, you know, that question.
Does anybody know a way or two out of this?
And there was this concentration, you know, settling into those concentration states.
It's like, well, for that time, you know, he said, yeah, for that time, that feels pretty good,
and it's still the same world.
I've not transcended, I've not answered the question that I have.
And the ascetic practice is the same kind of thing.
It's like, this is not the way.
And so he kind of found what he called the middle way,
which is very much about this exploration of what is the experience in this present moment.
And his discovery, really, I think that the brilliance of the Buddha was discovering
that this kind of way in which we habitually go about finding happiness,
organizing the world to have things that are pleasant and get rid of things that are unpleasant,
that very mechanism of finding happiness contains the seeds for suffering
in the mind state of craving, of that neediness to control,
to manipulate, to organize the world in the way that feels like we'd like it to be.
And so his discovery around craving, this kind of neediness around certain, certain,
we kind of have a push-pull around, need to have this thing.
It's like, what is it that I feel like, where am I putting my faith?
So much we have put our faith in craving.
We've put our faith in craving to find our way to happiness,
and then we feel betrayed by the world,
or we feel betrayed by our partners, or when things change.
This is what the Buddha is saying. It doesn't work to crave happiness,
to try to land on reliable happiness in something that is unreliable.
And so he pointed to this craving as being this kind of a mistake for us.
And so he points to this, his understanding there.
He, in his own exploration, began to understand ways to articulate, to help us to see that for ourselves.
And one of the primary tools for that, seeing that for ourselves, is mindfulness.
Beginning to look at our experience.
Beginning to turn with that kind of curiosity about, well, what is this experience that I'm calling suffering?
How does it feel in the body? How does it affect the mind?
What is fear? What is anxiety?
Not, how can I change the world so that I can get rid of it, but turning towards the feeling.
Now that, you know, paradoxically, I mean, it sounds like, and this is something,
we need to be careful in terms of not misinterpreting what the teachings are,
because it may sound like in that turning towards to be curious about the experience,
that we wouldn't act in the world.
That it sounds like a kind of a passive thing, this mindfulness.
But what I have seen and, you know, what seems to happen is that when we turn with mindfulness to our difficulties, our struggles,
you know, we see the pain that's in there, but we also see that there are motivations in our heart
that are connected to beautiful wishes.
So, you know, when we are experiencing fear, for example, you know, the fear is kind of like this agitated energy
around the sense of lack of safety often.
And connected to that fear is often a wish for safety.
And that wish is a very natural human wish that is expressive of kindness to ourselves
and of compassion for ourselves and others.
May all beings be safe.
This is a beautiful wish.
And so in the midst of that fear, we may begin to touch into a different kind of motivation,
a motivation of compassion and care and concern, rather than this agitated energy around the fear itself.
And so the turning towards our suffering begins to help us to kind of, you know, tease apart and recognize that there's certain motivations
of heart and mind that are motivated by this craving and other kind of motivations of the heart
that are connected to love and compassion and wisdom, generosity, patience, kindness.
And those qualities in our mind also want to act in the world.
You know, when we touch into compassion, compassion is a very active force in our hearts.
And when we're touched by compassion, we want to act to alleviate suffering,
not out of fear and not out of confusion and not out of anger and hatred,
but out of that connectedness of the heart.
And so this turning with mindfulness to our suffering begins to kind of tease apart the craving side of our motivations
from these beautiful parts of our heart and helps us to begin to land in and act from that place.
And so this all what I'm saying is kind of some of the wisdom that I've learned from the Buddha.
And that, for me, you know, that kind of simple, the very first thing that I heard was just, well, try turning your attention towards your suffering.
And I didn't understand how that would work.
But pretty quickly, actually, in that exploration, as I turned towards that, pretty quickly I began to understand how it was helpful.
I began to see that the mind got a little more settled.
It wasn't as reactive as much.
It had a lot more room to navigate when that suffering did come up
so that I wasn't just like pulled into the rabbit hole of it and swamped in it.
I had a lot more space.
Just through very simple, oh, this is the experience of anger.
This is what's happening right now.
So the first couple weeks doing that and doing it in daily life created so much more space around my challenges
that I was like, well, I don't really get how it works, but I'm going to keep going.
You know, this is helpful.
And so this is kind of the next kind of step in faith.
So at first it's just like, well, I'm willing to run the experiment.
No sense of having anything verified at all.
No sense of having a sense of any confidence in, well, there may be kind of a borrowing of confidence.
We could say, well, I borrowed the confidence from my friend and borrowed the confidence from this book.
But I didn't have personal confidence.
So the next kind of step in faith or the deepening of faith or the evolution of faith in our practice of trust
is that we begin to touch into something that helps us to recognize for ourselves directly inexperienced.
This is helpful.
This seems to have a, you know, we start to see, and as I said, we might start with just seeing the mind settles down a little bit more.
We have more space around our reactivity.
We have maybe a little bit of even a sense of well-being at times.
That kind of shocked me at times in the meditation.
You know, it would be like, wow, I actually feel good.
And, you know, there had been so much misery in my life.
It was like such a contrast.
And so there were these little like pointers or little things that helped me to see.
And I could see it was directly connected with the practice.
And so that created some trust, created some confidence.
And so we become more willing to engage, more willing to look and investigate.
Because we have some kind of, maybe just a little bit of having the wisdom verified for us.
A little bit of a sense that, yeah, I mean, the wisdom that got verified for me is, yes, it is helpful to look at my suffering.
That was about all that it was at first, was, yeah, see, this seems helpful.
And so I kept going.
And over the course of the months, kept seeing more and more ways in which the teachings that I was reading in these books, it's like, oh, yes, this, this is helpful.
And so at this point, trust is less about a leap of faith and more about connecting to the confidence we have in our own capacity to engage with these practices that the Buddha offers.
And then we might start to see some deeper truths, some deeper kind of pointings.
You know, there's a few kind of, I've talked a little bit about impermanence, you know, beginning to recognize when things are impermanent, they're not reliable as a place for happiness.
And as we turn with mindfulness to our experience, we begin to taste.
I mean, so the first thing, sometimes some of the early things we're seeing is our reactivity, you know, we're seeing how we are in relationship to experience in terms of, oh, I don't like that, and I like that, and I want more of that.
And we feel the kind of tension of the craving and the resistance around the things that we don't like.
And we begin to recognize that there's some suffering in the craving itself.
And this is a kind of a deepening of insight as we start to recognize and understand that that habitual pattern, the habitual way we've gone about finding happiness, contains right in the middle of it this kind of tension, this tight knot of craving.
And it's a little bit of a kind of, wow, you know, I've been doing this all of my life thinking this was going to make me happy, and I just, it's just, I see this as not the way.
And yet we still, you know, so we see that, we may see that in some ways to see that the wanting, you know, the wanting certain things, that kind of that craving, that needing, oh, that thing, that's what's going to make me happy, that that movement is kind of taking us out of right here and now,
and we're in a fantasy about how great it's going to be in a few moments or next week or whenever it is, we get that thing, how wonderful it will be.
And we are essentially not noticing right here and now this tightness of craving.
And so as we turn with mindfulness to our, that push-pull, we begin to feel right directly in the moment how our strategies, how our usual strategies for finding happiness are not very helpful.
And that's, you know, kind of a deepening of understanding around how suffering works in our mind.
And we also see, another piece of that, is that we see that very much the things that we had thought of, the places we thought where we would find that happiness, that all of that stuff is, is unreliable.
Now that's not to say that we don't navigate our lives and come into places where we might be traveling in a stream with certain people for a period of time.
You know, it's not to say that we just, you know, let go of all connection and all relationship. Again, that's not the teaching of the Buddha. The teaching is very much pointing to how can we be connected skillfully?
How can we have care and love that's not got this tightness and tension in the middle of it?
And so we begin to see that the kind of, that holding on to things that are impermanent.
And we begin to recognize that things are impermanent at a deeper level than we could possibly have even imagined.
And so sometimes in our meditation, we begin to touch into just how quickly experience is changing.
And this is also wisdom the Buddha offers. He points to just, he told his son, one of the things he told his son is, cultivate this understanding and perception of impermanence.
It will help you. And so if we begin to kind of, at times even we can do this with reflection. And again, this is using wisdom. This is connecting to the wisdom.
At first we use these wisdom teachings to help us understand directly in our experience what he's talking about.
And so this teaching, he said to his son, cultivate this perception of impermanence.
And at first it might just be kind of simply recognizing, reminding ourselves.
You know, when something comes into being, it's like, well, that's new. That's an arising. It wasn't there and now it is.
That's a manifestation of impermanence. Kind of to recognize that, you know, we often seem to attribute a kind of permanence going past.
But we can recognize that something's coming to being. Or maybe we can reflect on, well, this is something that I have now that feels like it's pretty solid.
But when did it start? You know, reflect on the nature of how things come into being and fall away.
And let yourself connect to that. And when things end, recognize that too.
You know, so that you, at first it's more of a reflection, more of a kind of a recognition, oh, things actually do come into being and fall apart.
So that begins to be a way that we orient to things in the world. And that helps to undermine our tendency to land on those things as being reliable sources for happiness.
Because we begin to recognize that they're not so stable.
And so we start to see these things, you know, we can remind ourselves of these things. And then we might start to see it much more in a momentary way.
Or experience it not through reflection, but in an actual understanding of impermanence.
There's a difference in kind of noticing or reflecting, oh yeah, that's gone now. And then having that there's kind of the understanding of that is not there anymore.
I'll give an example of this in terms of the insight side of this.
So this is the next level of trust in a way that I'm pointing to. You know, at first there's the stepping into something that we don't know how it will work.
That kind of being willing to run the experiment. Then there's a little bit more verification of seeing this is helpful.
And then there's a touching in to the experience of insight, of direct understanding of things being impermanent and unreliable, uncontrollable.
And that has a different kind of something happens in the mind a little different there. It's kind of the mind kind of shifts, understands something in a new way.
And then there's an even deeper sense of trust that we understand much more fully the whole structure of what the Buddha was talking about.
The whole understanding around, yeah, you know, really, really I understand things are impermanent. There is no point in clinging and craving to things that'll go away.
So an example of this, I was working with this practice of noticing that things were impermanent on a retreat.
This was a meditation retreat and I was in on these meditation retreats we have jobs to support the running of the retreat and I was a vegetable chopper.
So in the morning I chopped vegetables with a group of about six of us in the kitchen.
And this was a big retreat. There were 100 people on the retreat and so there was a lot of vegetables to chop.
And I would just be kind of using this reflection on impermanence during the veggie chopping, kind of recognizing, okay, you know, and through the day it's like, so here are these vegetables.
I have whole vegetables, a whole zucchini in front of me and over the course of the vegetable chopping it gets turned into something else. It gets turned into chopped zucchini.
And then at lunchtime I see it in the casserole. It's cooked zucchini and so this is, it's changing, you know, it's impermanent.
It's doing different things and then I eat it and where is it now, you know, it's being transformed even more.
And so this was a kind of reflection I was doing about impermanence.
And then one day I walked into the kitchen and we were chopping chard and usually the cook had put buckets around with chard and many buckets and there were lots of buckets around the thing
and we'd put some in the middle and we'd chop that and then we'd pick up another bucket and put it in the middle and we'd chop that.
Well, this day the cook had put the entire bit of chard onto the table and when I walked into the kitchen it looked like a mountain of chard, you know, it looked like it was three feet high in the middle of the table.
It was this huge pile of chard and when I saw it I just felt my heart sink, it's like, we're never going to finish that.
That's so much chard and so there was and I didn't really see this at the time but there was a kind of an imputation of that being a thing, that mound of chard being a thing.
And so I just like started chopping the chard, we all just chopped this and put it into the cooking pans and then at some point I looked up and that pile of chard was gone.
And it was a shock.
There was this kind of like, that thing that I thought was so solid doesn't exist anymore.
It's gone.
I mean it sounds just, it sounds when I tell the story, it sounds kind of like the same thing about noticing just things, how things change.
But there was a very different feeling and some of it was around the sense of the shock of, it's not there anymore.
That was a kind of a touching into the seeing of impermanence in a different way.
And there's even more deeper levels of seeing these kind of how rapidly things change.
But part of the way that our minds make things seem permanent is demonstrated by this story because my mind had created a concept of the mountain of chard
and believed in its reality, believed in its stability.
And then when it was seen that that concept wasn't stable, there was a little bit of a shock to the mind.
So it was a seeing of how kind of this interplay between our concepts.
When we have concepts about things, that's how we attribute permanence.
And so this functions at many different levels in our experience, this concept making.
And we begin at a very deep level in exploring our minds, exploring our experience.
We begin to see that underneath concept is just kind of shimmering, slippery streaming experience.
Nothing solid or stable.
And again this seeing this begins to help us to have a kind of, this is really where we have the confirmed, it's like our faith is confirmed.
We understand for ourselves the truth of what the Buddha was talking about with respect to how sufferings created in the mind.
And we have a deeper sense of trust.
We could look at the entirety of our journey as being an evolution of trust, a deepening of trust and connection to the understanding of wisdom.
As we understand our experience through this lens of wisdom, the trust in the wisdom gets stronger and stronger.
Until we don't have any doubt anymore about that.
And also another piece of the trust, I think, and even a different avenue or lens is in our, as we start into the practice,
we may see times in our lives or times that it feels like our minds are not very trustable.
We get caught in our anger, we get caught in our confusion, and we begin to recognize, I actually initially thought I did put my faith in anger.
I thought anger was going to help me, but at some point I began to see that the mind that was angry was not a trustable mind.
And then there's the question of what kind of mind is trustable? When is the mind trustable?
And this is an exploration, this is also a journey that to me is a part of how our hearts begin to grow and deepen in this practice.
At this point, you know, there's kind of a simplicity around this question of when is the heart trustable?
And when there's reactivity in the mind, I think early on I began to see, okay, the reactive mind is not so trustable.
If I have the capacity to not act out of this reactivity, that would probably be helpful.
So beginning to trust that bit of information, reactive mind, not a good place to leap into action from.
But then beginning to feel my way into, you know, we begin to feel our way into when is the mind more trustable?
When is our heart and mind more trustable?
When it's not reactive, when it's motivated from those beautiful qualities,
when action wants to come from compassion and love and wisdom and generosity, that's more trustable.
And it's kind of simple in a way, you know, the mindfulness, the practice of mindfulness begins to help us to feel into what is the kind of, what are the kind of qualities?
What's a familiar, what are the similar qualities of those reactive states of mind?
And what are the similar qualities of those non-reactive states of mind?
And those reactive states of mind, when we're present for them, often have this feeling of some kind of constriction in the heart, some kind of tightness.
And those non-reactive qualities have a feeling of connection, of softness, of openness.
And so that's almost, you know, my guide, that's how I check in, is this trustable here?
And if there is that feeling of contraction, then I, you know, use my kind of understanding, this may not be the time to act.
So I had a, you know, kind of a challenging situation last week with, you know, trying to navigate many different opinions, conflicting views about something that we needed to all make a kind of coherent decision on.
And I was in the middle of this particular one.
I was the one who was gathering the information and pulling together the ways, the proposals.
I was the one doing all the proposal making.
And there were so many times as I, as I, you know, received these various messages that there would be the sense of, either a sense of, oh, I'm so tired of doing this,
or a sense of, you know, a little bit of reactivity, no, can't you see that's not the right way?
And, and, you know, when that happened, it'd be, okay, it's time to close the computer.
I'll pick this up again later, because that didn't feel like a trustable place to respond from.
And then when I could find my way to that more trustable place, okay, yes, this feeling.
And there's kind of a, there's such a delight in connecting to that, even in the midst of conflict.
Even in the midst of kind of trying to navigate so many different things.
When I, when that kind of heart of, of connection and care for all the different perspectives can be held, it's very, it's very satisfying.
It feels so, I don't know, just rewarding in a way to, to be able to transform that.
And so these, you know, these two things around trust of the kind of the way it kind of evolves through our journey.
And then this kind of very simple, almost compass we can learn to develop around what's trustable.
And that evolves too, as we practice that, that kind of touching into that, that quality of heart, of what's a trustable heart.
So there's a few minutes if there's any comments or reflections that anybody would like to offer.
There's only a couple minutes, so why don't we just touch into that?
How is the heart right now?
Sometimes I can feel a kind of a shifting of the heart.
Maybe a little confusion there of not sure if it's trustable.
And can that just be held with some kind of kindness?
Whatever's there in your heart, for me very much this area around the heart is a kind of a place to touch into, in terms of the feeling there.
Whatever's there, can it be allowed?
If it feels spacious and open, that's beautiful. If it doesn't.
I'm exploring kind of a bigger container that might be able to hold that with some kindness.
Thank you for your attention.
