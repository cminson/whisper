 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Welcome, welcome everybody. Hope that you are well. And I'm happy to be practicing with you, with you all. So to begin our meditation, just arriving this moment, arriving to this constellation of experiences. And feeling into the body, what is it like to be here and now at this moment? I like this expression, to sit and know you're sitting. To sit with some balance, some ease, some alertness, some uprightness. Maybe checking in with the body and see if there are any obvious places of tightness or a little bit of discomfort. Can we gaze upon them kindly with our mindfulness? It might be, but if we bring some kindness, some warmth, some non-aversion to those aspects of our experience that are uncomfortable, they might unfold differently under the gaze of kindness. No guarantees. This is such a part of mindfulness practice, bringing our awareness to whatever is arising, including the uncomfortable aspects. Thank you. Allowing the awareness to rest on the sensations of breathing. Feeling the expansion, contraction as the body breathes. We might feel that in the chest, maybe in the belly. Maybe we feel the air going in and out of the nose. And when the mind wanders, as it's want to do, just very simply, gently begin again. Thank you. Allowing the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing. Thank you. And when we find ourselves replaying a story, lost in a fantasy, or a memory, or planning, we just very simply begin again with the sensations of breathing. Can we do this without annoyance or irritation or exasperation when we realize that we've been lost in thought? Just very simply, gently begin again. Thank you. It doesn't matter how many times we need to begin again. So much of what mindfulness practice is about is just beginning again, having the patience to hang in there and allow the awareness, the attention to come back to the sensations of breathing however many times it needs to. Thank you. Thank you. What would it be like to bring patience to our practice, recognizing that it takes time for the mind to settle? Maybe you've had a busy day, lots of planning, lots of decisions or problems to work with. Can we just bring patience, this recognition that things might be a little bit uncomfortable or not settled, but that's okay. We just begin again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
