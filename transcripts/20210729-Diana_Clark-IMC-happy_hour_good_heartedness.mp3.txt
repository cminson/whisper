 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome to a happy hour. Really warm welcome for everybody, all of you. Wherever you might be, before we turned on the recording, we were talking a little bit about IMC. So whether you've ever been there or not, welcome, warm welcome. So tonight I want to talk a little bit about this passage that I came across. It's in Sharon Salzberg's book, The Force of Kindness, which is a lovely book. She talks about kindness, not surprisingly, with a title like that. But here's something that she writes, and I've just been reflecting on this and thinking about it. I'd like to share it with you and we can kind of maybe bring it into our practice. So this is a quote from Sharon Salzberg. In 1997, while attending a conference in San Francisco called Peacemaking, The Power of Nonviolence, I walked by writer Ellis Walker, who was having an informal conversation with a group of people. I overheard her say, as I get older, I realize that the thing I value most is good heartedness. I realized that the thing I value most is good heartedness. I don't know, quite something, Ellis Walker, this amazing, powerful person, saying that how much she values is good heartedness. I don't know if she would still, this is 1997. I don't know if she would still say that today. But this idea, she says, as I get older, I realize the thing I value most is good heartedness. You might think that as we get older, we have a little more wisdom, maybe a little more disappointments. And realizing all these plans we might have had for our lives or for our family members' lives, other people's lives, expecting how they were going to unfold. And sometimes they unfolded that way. And it seems to me most often they don't, involve just how we're expecting them to, or imagine that they might. But to come to this realization or this recognition of the value of good heartedness, and I kind of like the vagueness of this language, good heartedness. There's a number of different ways we might consider this or think about it or express it. But maybe if we, sometimes I like to think about the opposite of a word to help kind of create, when I'm thinking about come alive, so bad heartedness. You're like, okay, bad heartedness, just this idea of having some bad intentions, having this, this, the hostility you wanted to cause harm. So good heartedness is maybe non-hostility, no bad intentions. And of course we know that even though our intentions might be good, doesn't mean the outcomes are necessarily good. But to start there, to start with an open mind, open heart, some warmth, some goodness, good heartedness, and so many different ways it shows up, maybe generosity, giving people the benefit of the doubt, giving them time, giving them some of your expertise, sharing some of whatever you have cultivated and skills you've acquired in this lifetime. I show up with just deep listening, patience. Maybe it shows up as being an activist, Alice Walker, and really being out there making a difference. Or maybe that's a more quiet way, whatever way, this idea of good heartedness. And then maybe the last thing I'll say here is the idea that Alice Walker is saying, as I get older, just for us to think, of course, we all have heard about this, but that as we're lying on our deathbeds, what are we going to be happy that we've done? When we reflect back on our minds, what will we be happy about? What will we recognize, oh, maybe I shouldn't have worried about that as much or spent as much time or whatever it might be. I'd like to think that something like good heartedness would be there as in the constellation of things when we think about our lives as we get older, those times in which we were good hearted, how it might have been a support for others, support for ourselves. And of course, loving kindness practice is a way to help us bring good heartedness more and more into our lives. And so many myriad different ways it might show up, just with this simple practice. So with that as a introduction, let's do some meditation practice. So taking meditation seat, either literally or figuratively, and just feel into what it feels like to be in this posture right now, connecting with the bodily experience. Maybe we'll do a little bit of a body scan. Checking in with the area around the eyes and the jaw. Might there be just a little bit more ease or softening, though forcing it or making it happen, but more just allowing a certain amount of softening. The shoulders and then be away from the ears. The upper back, lower back. Maybe they're touching a chair, maybe not. The chest. Sometimes we collapse in the chest a little bit. Is there a way that without being stiff that we can open or relax or bring the shoulders back just a wee bit. The belly, I mean it's soft and feeling the way we're connected, touching the chair, cushion, couch, floor, whatever it is that our body is connected to. Our body is always touching something. Well, for the most part it's so touching something. The upper legs. Just bringing our attention to these areas. The feet, feeling grounded, connected. The arms. And the hands. Feeling what the hands are touching. And feeling what is it like to have hands, the experience of having hands. Maybe there's a little bit of tingling. Maybe there's a little bit of pressure against the hand. Like from the inside, what does it feel like to have a hand. And to bring that same type of awareness to the sensations of breathing. I feel the sensations of breathing. Maybe the chest moving, expanding, contracting, abdomen, the belly, moaning. Perhaps the air going in and out of the nose. And just hang out here for a few moments. And the mind wanders. Just begin again. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Bringing to mind a lovable being. Someone for whom it's easy for us to feel some warmth, some openness, some care. Bringing this lovable being to mind. Whether it's somebody you know. Or maybe somebody that has inspired you or touched you in some way, but you don't actually have a relationship with them, but you feel appreciation for what they've offered or what you've been in contact with. Or maybe it's an imaginary. That's what feels most available for you right now. An imaginary kittens, puppies, babies, or maybe a pet. It's less important, this specific lovable being. What's more important is that there's a sense of ease with this lovable being, uncomplicated. It's an openness toward them. And connecting with them. Connecting with that openness, connecting with the lovable being. And then to support our connection with the lovable being and our cultivation of loving kindness. Can say these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. Maybe reconnecting with this lovable being. Bringing them to mind. And then to expand our loving kindness. To include a good friend or family member. It's a way that we care about, but maybe our relationship is a little more complicated. Bringing them to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Maybe this good friend expresses good heartedness sometimes. Maybe we've expressed good heartedness with our friend. In an easy, relaxed way, can we allow a memory to support our cultivating loving kindness. You're getting lost in the memory necessarily, you're searching, straining to find one. There isn't one right at hand that's perfectly fine. There is one, allow it to be a support. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. And refreshing the inventory of our good friend. Connecting with them. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. And then, can we extend our loving kindness to ourselves. Can we have good heartedness for ourselves, care, warmth. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Can we be good hearted towards ourselves. Sometimes we're mean to ourselves, not all the time but forever can be our final reaffidence. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Turning into maybe a felt experience at this moment. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. And can we extend this warm heartedness, this goodwill to somebody we don't know. Maybe it's somebody on the Zoom call that you don't know. Maybe it's somebody in the neighborhood that you don't know. Wishing somebody that we don't know about recognizing a common humanity. Just like me, they wish to be happy. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Sometimes it takes a little more effort to do loving kindness for someone we don't know. When there isn't a charge with the individual, sometimes the mind slips off. Sometimes it takes a little more effort to do loving kindness for someone we don't know. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. And then we'll end with a little bit of equanimity practice. So bring into mind somebody that you know and you care about, but sometimes it's a little bit bothersome. Not the most difficult person you know. I can say this phrase. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. And then to end this meditation, your feet on the ground, the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body. And when you're ready, can gently open your eyes. I'm repeating the quote I said earlier that Sharon Salzburg, who many of you know, is virtually responsible for bringing this practice to the West. She was at a conference and she overheard Alice Walker say, as I get older, I realize that the thing I value most is good heartedness. Yeah, good heartedness. There's so many ways that that can show up in our lives by our expressing it or maybe other people expressing it as well. But having a loving kindness practice, maybe let's a little softening happen or some type of, you know, just makes it more accessible, easier for the mind and the heart to incline that direction. So now I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms to get a time, an opportunity to talk about some of these ideas about valuing good heartedness. And why don't we have an opportunity to be in the room for about three, 14 minutes. There'll be three or four of you. And it's nice to like build something together. So one person say something, what is what is good heartedness mean to you? And or this idea as I age, I realize what I value most. So right as we get older, our values are changing. And what and to keep in mind, what might we value at the end of our lives as well? If not good heartedness, what might it be? So that's a lot that I'm giving you there, but something to maybe discuss and explore. So to have just say one idea, one sentence to a few sentences and then it go to the next person and they say one or two sentences, then it goes to the next person. And then it goes to the next and maybe comes back around. And so you have a second chance to say something having been influenced by what you heard before. And so maybe as a collective, you can come up with maybe learn something new and share some things. And so that's if it's helpful, you can go in alphabetical order by screen name. Okay, here we go. Welcome back. Welcome back. Does anybody have questions or comments? No, nobody has anything they want to share. I was thinking just recently, there is sometimes this distance if you find someone who is kind of hard and everyone in that room is really kind of hard. And you're like, oh, but it feels so bad today. And you wonder, should I go there? Because I feel that it's not taking me a while to just be where the way they are or where they are emotionally. That's the only thing that I thought about. So you have this idea that maybe you're not being in the same mind state as others might. Yeah, that distance, the distance that sometimes you feel because like, oh yeah, they're really in a good place, but it's not taking me a while. And you feel this distance sometimes you feel like maybe I shouldn't even go there. I see. Do you think it's really a distance? I think that I'll just offer. What is the I forget exactly what this saying is, but just like how just a little bit of sugar turns what's bitter into something that's no longer bitter so it might feel like it's a long distance, but maybe it's just this one switch to turn of the mind turn of the heart. What do you think of that? Yeah, I would love to know the right switch for certain days. Yeah, yeah. And maybe that's why we do this practice too is so that it becomes easier and easier to maybe we have more switches, something that's easier to like, oh yeah, we can turn that direction or something like that. Yes, thank you. Okay, so really warm welcome and Trudy I'm hoping that you'll stay I have one thing to say to you, just conveying things this way. But until then, let's all say, let's say goodbye, and we can unmute Shannon say goodbye so. Thank you. Bye. But I'm staying.
