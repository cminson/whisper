 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning. Thank you for the introduction. Hi. Nice to be with you. And with you also on YouTube. So I'll do a lightly guided meditation to support us to settle in and to leave a lot of space. So let us arrive in our bodies in this moment. If you need to move maybe at the very beginning, left or right, front and center, front and back, just to find the center of gravity to really bring attention to your body this morning. Maybe roll the shoulders back a little bit. Ah, so that there is a sense of integrity in the body. Allowing the back to be upright. As if your spine, each vertebrae is being stretched upward. As if there is a light magnet on top of your head pulling you up. Ah, you're not pushing up. You're just being pulled up. Wow. A sense of integrity sitting tall like a mountain. And letting the rest of your body, your sit bones, to sink into the cushion, into the chair. Connected well rooted to the earth. And if you're sitting in a chair, let's let your feet, the bottom of both feet, to be touching the earth. A sense of stability, groundedness, feeling the bottom of your feet. On the earth. Stable, grounded. As if you have roots into the earth, your feet, your legs, your sit bones. And also you have wings upright, pulled up. I'm bringing your awareness inward to the breath. Moving, moving through your body. Moving through the abdomen. The entirety of the in breath, the entirety of the out breath. Aware. And you don't need to make a project out of breathing. It happens on its own. It does not need to be effortful at all. Relax, soften the body. Let it go of any tightness or tension and just receive the breath. Receive the entirety of the breath. And your optimum in your whole body. Let it be nourishing. Let it be soothing, calming, grounding. Receiving the breath, not a forceful act. But as if each breath was a gift, you're receiving a gift of kindness that keeps this body alive, functioning. Relaxing, receiving. Each breath. Relaxing. And if thoughts arise, you notice the mind is now entangled in a plan for the future, memory from the past. It's okay. It's alright. It's okay. No need for self-flagellation. Noticing what this thought, the scenario, the story is. And smilingly releasing, releasing. Thank you, but not now. I see you, but not now. And inviting the simplicity of this present moment. Just sitting. The privilege of just sitting and being breathed. A moment of refuge. Taking refuge. Right here. Right now. Right now. Each moment a new arrival, reconnecting with the breath. The abdomen, the lower abdomen, your whole body. Thefollow your Mister! Receiving the breath in whatever is arising spaciously, kindly. If you like you can open also your sphere of awareness to include the sounds, the sound of silence in the room, the sound of my voice, the sound of your breathing, the noises, the noises that arise and pass. All the sounds, spaciously, spaciously, thoughts too are like sounds arise and pass. Just as we don't need to get entangled with every sound that arises and passes, every passing car. We don't need to get entangled with every thought that arises and passes. Receiving, relaxing, receiving it all, unmoved, upright, rounded, sitting like a tall mountain, seeking refuge in this moment, in your heart. The sound of silence. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Receiving. Please experiment. Please experiment with wearing a smile and see how a smile can shift the space of your mind, your heart in this moment. Giving yourself the kindness, the gift of a little smile. See how it might shift the landscape of your heart, your mind. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. The half smile of the Buddha. And as we bring this sitting period to a close, offering yourself a gift of kindness, appreciation for having showed up as well as you were able to, not judging, comparing what happened or did not happen during the sit. Whether you were distracted or sleepy or emotions were coming up, no problem. You planted seeds of presence, spaciousness and now kindness. You did the best you could, appreciating your whole hearted intention, the goodness of your intention and offering your goodness, trusting there is goodness here. Co-created in this moment. Together offering our goodness, the merit of our practice to all beings everywhere as a gift. Wishing for all beings to be safe, happy, healthy, have ease. May all beings everywhere be free, including ourselves. Wishing for all beings to be free.
