 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. To start with welcome, and we'll be entering this practice today with a guided reflection, guided meditation. So just beginning by allowing your body time. Time to tell you what it needs right now. And taking whatever time it needs to care for your body as you settle into this meditation. And taking time to receive and recognize what's happening in the heart-mind. What might the heart and mind need from you in order to benefit from this sitting? And continuing by turning the attention towards whatever is being received in awareness in this moment exactly as it is. And allowing awareness to continue to receive whatever arises, whatever remains here for a while, whatever passes at the rate or pace of the time that it's operating naturally. That may be relatively quickly or it may be very slowly, whatever is being received in whatever pace. Being aware of it just as it is, no need to change it. No need to try to have the right kind of meditation simply allowing exactly what's here as it arises, as it is here. Being present with it, not rushing it out or off, allowing some space and time for whatever is being received. Resting in the truth of what is here right now. What is known in experience right now is the result of causes and conditions that may have preceded this moment or that may be coming up right now. What is being experienced is neither your fault nor your accomplishment. It's simply how things have come to be, how they are coming to be in this moment. Allowing some ease with things as they have come to be and are changing. Receiving, recognizing, allowing. Resting in the truth of how things are coming to be and how they are changing. Thank you. Thank you. If attention drifts away for a while, that too is not yours. It's just conditions playing out. It's simply a noticing awareness has returned and noticing what is it aware of. Continuing in silence again and again, receiving awareness, recognizing what it is aware of and allowing space and time for that process. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
