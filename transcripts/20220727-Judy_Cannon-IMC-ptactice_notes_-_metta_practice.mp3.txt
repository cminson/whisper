 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodharma.org. Introduce the ideas from excerpts from the Metta-suta. Metta meaning loving-kindness or friendliness. And suta meaning a Buddha scripture from the beginning and the teachings of the Buddha. The Metta-suta reads part of it. To reach the state of peace, one skilled in the good should be capable and upright, straightforward and easy to speak to, gentle and not proud, contented and easily supported, living lightly and with few duties, wise and with senses calmed, not arrogant and with greed for supporters, and should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize. One should reflect. May all be happy and secure. May all beings be happy at heart. All living beings, whether weak or strong, tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, seen or unseen, near or distant, born or to be born, may they all be happy. Let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere. Let no one, through anger or aversion, wish for others to suffer. As a mother would risk her own life to protect her child, her only child. So toward all beings should one cultivate a boundless heart. With loving kindness for the whole world, should one cultivate a boundless heart, above, below and all around. Without obstruction, without hate, and without ill will. Standing or walking, sitting or lying down, whenever one is awake, may one stay with this recollection. This is called a sublime abiding here and now. One who is virtuous, endowed with vision, not taken by views, and having overcome all greed for sensual pleasure, will not be reborn again. So with our thoughts on loving kindness, on the teachings of the Dharma, we'll continue our practice now with walking meditation, and we'll walk until 11 o'clock, either inside or outside. We're asked not to walk in the parking lot of any business.
