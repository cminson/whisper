So good morning everyone. Can you hear me okay? Is this loud enough for everyone?
Okay. So good morning.
Part of coming to meditate is to give ourselves time to catch up to ourselves.
The mind can be racing ahead, busy and we're not really coming to rest here with ourselves with what's happening here.
Or our body is somehow racing or collapsing or still lingering in the past, something.
But to bring the body and the mind and to end up here, catch up to the present, slow down to the present,
to give ourselves time for this. And then in doing so, to discover a different way of being with ourselves,
being with the world, then we can do if we're racing ahead or lingering behind, coming here.
And it doesn't seem like a very remarkable thing, perhaps, just to be here breathing, connected, attentive.
Not as exciting as a lot of things we can do, not as frightening as a lot of things we can imagine, perhaps.
But just here, with this. And for this purpose, I'm very fond of using the word here sometimes as a grounding word for meditation.
Because I say the word here to myself in a kind way, a friendly way.
And it's a very unambitious word. I'm not trying to do anything more, but recognize I'm here and allow whatever is here to show itself.
Here, here, it's like this. Here, I am anxious. So this is what it's like. Here, I am tired. This is what it's like. Here, I'm breathing.
This is what it's like. And that kind of starts bringing me in, gathers me in, connects me here and here and here.
Until eventually it kind of becomes more easy to be present for the experience here and now.
So with that, we'll sit quietly for these 30 minutes or so. And then we'll go from there. Thank you.
