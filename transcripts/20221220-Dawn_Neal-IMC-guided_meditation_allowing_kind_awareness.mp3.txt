The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, to start our meditation, the invitation is to settle back,
make sure any alerts or devices that might disturb your practice in the next half an hour or
silenced or turned off.
You're welcome to turn away from the screen if that's more comfortable for you.
Just settling into the body, into the moment.
Noticing whatever's present for you right now.
Not judgment.
Noticing the quality of your heart and mind.
Busy and distracted or calm and settled.
Contracted or spacious.
Grumpy or grateful.
Whatever's there.
And for this time of meditation, setting the resolve, the intention
to meet whatever arises with kindness.
Inviting now the body, this body to relax, soften.
Maybe an extra long exhale.
Allowing tension to release.
Noticing any relaxation or softness.
And allowing the rest.
It's helpful you're welcome to scan through your body.
Maybe starting at the very top of the head.
Just allowing the awareness to soak in the scalp, forehead and temples.
The whole face and putting the softening of the eyes, tongue, cheeks.
Noticing the breathing through your throat.
And allowing that to invite the softening in the neck.
Letting the shoulders drop down away from the ears.
The arms and hands to just be.
Allowing the breathing to soften the sternum, upper back, ribcage.
Allowing the diaphragm and the belly to relax outwards, just being.
And inviting the whole spine to carry the weight of the bones and muscles and viscera.
With effortless support.
Noticing the weight of this body on the chair or cushion.
Allowing yourself to relax and to trust that support.
Held by gravity.
Held by the earth.
My hips and buttocks soften the thighs.
The knees, calves and shins.
Allowing any excess tension to drain out as the ankles and the feet relax.
Allowing the whole body.
Allowing awareness to fill and soften.
Heart and mind.
It's helpful to anchor the attention on breathing.
Or body or sound.
The invitation is to lightly stay in contact with the herb and flow of that physical experience.
And otherwise to open awareness. To greet with kindness. Everything that arises.
And everything that passes away.
