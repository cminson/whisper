The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, hello on this 4th of July, Monday.
And I've been back from being away for a week,
I thank my friend and fellow teacher Paul Haller for teaching while I was gone.
So, the last two weeks that I've been here,
the first one I talked about practicing with emotions,
and the second week in particular focused on anger.
And for this week, I'd like to have the theme be grief.
Perhaps sometimes these follow each other, are closely related.
So much so that I know some teachers who, when people come to talk to them about grief,
will gently ask about, what about sadness?
And when they, people ask about, when to come and talk about sadness or grief,
they might ask, the teacher might ask, what about the anger?
Is there anger here?
Sometimes they operate kind of in tandem or in relationship to each other,
or one is partly sometimes a partner to the other in our lives.
It might be a little bit strange to talk about grief on the 4th of July holiday here in the United States.
But nothing has left out celebrating an independence that was violent.
There are certainly things to grieve in that.
I had a friend who, a Buddhist teacher, who first time he was asked to perform a wedding for a couple,
did so, but he gave a Dharma talk as part of the wedding,
and the Dharma talk was on dying, death and dying.
And probably it was a bit of a surprise for some people who came.
I don't know if the couple knew that was coming.
But for the Dharma teacher, this was the occasion to the wedding,
to talk about something for him that was really at the heart or center of a wise and caring life,
to take it into account.
So perhaps there's some way that a wise life, a caring life, even on a day of celebrating a certain kind of liberation and independence,
that for that independence, liberation to be realistic,
maybe there has to be space to also recognize and sit with grief.
So grief is a hugely important issue for many people.
Sooner or later, most people will go through a period of grieving, feel grief.
But even so, people who speak English, grew up speaking English, might think they know what grief is,
but maybe there's no real solid definition of what grief is.
And in fact, if you go to some different cultures, people who speak different languages,
some languages in which it's difficult to find an equivalent for the English word grief,
or it might not have the same connotations or the same meanings or the same emotional associations
to exactly what we might mean at grief as English speakers.
And even within a country like the United States, there are many different ways in which people grieve,
many relationships people have with grief, many ways in which people understand it and have meaning for it.
So it's a very rich area to explore, a very important one.
It's also one that's very difficult.
And I'm certainly aware that bringing up this topic today and for this week
is very difficult for those of you who are in the middle of maybe intense grief
and you'd come to the 7am sitting for an alternative to some kind of something else
rather than having to be reminded of it or sit with it or address it.
So for those of you, all of you, to be careful this week around this topic of grief
and care for yourself.
And hopefully I'll do this week with a lot of respect for each of you
and for the challenges and difficulties that this world of grief might have.
But it's not just a challenge and difficult thing.
It's such a profound and important part of our human heart
that there's something very meaningful and powerful and wonderful
that can happen when we learn to respect the grief deeply,
when we learn to allow it and understand it and allow it to move through us
and find freedom with it.
And so I think it's an important topic that we'll do.
So today's mostly introductory words about the topic.
And I want to tell a story, a very brief story from the Buddha's time,
Buddha's teachings.
The Buddha had a lot of disciples,
but he had two disciples that historically are considered his main disciples.
Some people have called him the left-hand and right-hand disciples,
really the closest to him, the wisest, deepest practitioners
that were responsible for a lot of teachings of the Buddhist community at his time.
So these two teachers were Sariputta,
and one who's less known in the modern world is Mahamukhlyana.
And both of these kind of very close, closest disciples of the Buddha,
he'd known them for years and years.
They died before the Buddha died.
The Buddha died when he was around 80, 81 years old.
And Sariputta, I think they both died in the last year the Buddha was alive.
And there's one little vinyet that's preserved related to this.
After Sariputta had died, the Buddha addresses his order of monks, his monastics.
And Sariputta was a monastic, one of the leaders of the monastic community.
And so the Buddha is addressing the community and he says,
this assembly, this gathering of our community feels empty now that Sariputta has died.
He doesn't say anything more about what he's feeling, but he sees it as being empty.
And I find this very evocative idea that people have asked,
does the Buddha grieve? Is the Buddha ever sad?
And the closest that we come to some evidence of something like grief
in the Buddha is him recognizing that looking out across the assembly,
what's most poignant for him is the absence of his two disciples,
or his story, his one disciple.
And so grief, one way of understanding it, is that it involves the loss of something,
the absence of something.
Something is not here anymore that was important.
And then that absence is an absence that we feel.
And we feel that in different cultures, in different people, different societies,
different religions, that absence has different meanings,
has different associations, different impacts on us,
so that the death of someone is so varied how people will experience that death,
so varied the impact it has on them.
What that empty space, that empty loss, that absence entails,
and the impact it has, and the meaning it has, and the function it has,
and all the things that change, that is what we want to study.
That's what we want to understand and respect.
And I offer the story so that we don't have some idea that we know what grief is,
or that grief is just grief by itself,
but rather grief is a very broad word for a range of emotions,
a range of meaning-making, a range of impact that all kinds of losses might have on us,
that we can get to know better, that we can sit with and be with.
And if we just call it grief by itself, we might not really see the fullness of it,
and might not see the conditionality of it, the contingent nature of it,
and how, given that conditioned, contingent nature of the grief that we have,
how we can best live with it, or respond to it, or allow for it, or respect it.
And so to begin kind of unpacking, what is it, this empty thing that happened?
So one of the definitions I have for grief is that grief is the pain that comes with a loss.
Grief is the pain that comes with something that was important is no longer here.
And I don't use the Buddhist word suffering here because suffering implies a lot more than just pain.
But pain is more of a basic feeling of discomfort or pain.
And then in that, in relation to that pain and the sense of emptiness and space and even potential that grief is,
what is going on for us? What are we experiencing? What are we contributing?
What are the stories we're telling ourselves? What stories are we living by?
That this loss, this absence has impacted that story.
What identities do we have? What hopes for the future have we had?
What have we been kind of comforted by or cherishing that's no longer here?
What's the nature of that pain? What are we contributing? What arises with that pain?
And there's many things. So that's why some people say that when people,
sometimes therapists or Dharma teachers will describe grief,
they'll describe it as being a combination of many different emotions.
Sometimes anger, sometimes numbness, sometimes hostility comes out,
sometimes despair, sometimes discouragement, sometimes the sense of hopelessness.
All kinds of things come into play.
Some people in some cultures, that pain and loss, the pain and emptiness that comes with a loss,
sometimes comes along with a lot of love and compassion.
Sometimes it comes with even joy and celebration.
There's some cultures I've read about that where the word that's their equivalent to the English word grief
is a combination of sadness and love.
So what is it that in this complex, this rich domain of grief,
it's part of the depth and complexity and fullness of our life.
It's not a singular thing.
And so in the meditation that we just had,
I suggested this practice of as you breathe in to touch all of who we are.
And on the exhale, allow something about it to settle,
not to disappear, not to push it away,
but allow it to kind of, as it is to rest.
So with grief, in meditation, to breathe and touch the grief, that subjective experience.
And as you exhale, allow something about the grief or relationship to the grief to settle.
And in that practice of doing that in the middle of it,
we're not caught in the grief or lost in the grief or reactive to the grief.
We're exercising our freedom to touch it and to allow something to settle.
And in a sense, that is where we find our freedom
so that we can give freedom to our grief, to our sadness.
And that's a wonderful thing, to have our freedom together with the grief,
not one or the other.
So that's the journey we'll take this week, it's a journey through grief.
And by the end of the week, I hope that you'll understand something about
not how to be free from grief, but how to give freedom to your grief.
And by giving that freedom to your grief, you'll find your freedom too.
So, thank you. I look forward to this time.
