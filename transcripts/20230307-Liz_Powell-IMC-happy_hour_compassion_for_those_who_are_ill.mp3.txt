 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome to Happy Hour. I'm glad to see you this evening. And looking forward to spending the time together. So thank you, Neil, for being here and also for posting in the chat information about how to connect with our Google group, which is a way you can stay connected and also receive information. In fact, earlier today, some information was posted on it about a class, a five-session class in loving kindness, that Don Neil, one of the frequent visiting teachers here, is going to offer starting this Saturday. And there's information both there and on the IMC website about how to register for that if you'd like. So on the right-hand side of the web page at IMC, you would find it in the listing of what's new, and you could find a link there to click to register. So I hope some of you who are newer to chat could enjoy that. Excuse me, newer to Happy Hour. I'm looking at the chat button. So as we sit together this evening, I wanted to mention... I'm about to sneeze. I wanted to mention that what has been in my heart quite a bit this week, and also this year, in fact, is compassion for volunteers at both our retreat center and our meditation center communities who have been going through serious illnesses themselves, or accompanying the serious illness of a loved one. The practices we do were the result of the Buddha's inspiration to come to the end of suffering after when he was a young man, he first saw people who were ill, old, or dying. And these meditation practices start to prepare us for those inevitabilities in our own lives and help us go through them with others that we care about. Most of us will fall ill at some point or another, and if we're lucky enough to live a long life, we'll go through aging. Ultimately, we'll all die. And these happy hour practices, as well as other Buddhist practices, help us have the resources and inner strength to go through these processes either with less suffering or completely free of suffering. So I wanted to read you an excerpt from a reflections from an article by Zongchen Ponlop Rinpoche. And I'm going to send Neil these excerpts later this evening, or a link to this article. Zongchen Ponlop Rinpoche is coming from a different Buddhist tradition than the one we practice. He's from the Vajrayana rather than the Vipassana or Theravada lineage. But I found the section that he wrote in this article interesting to consider when we reflect on serious illness. So I'll read it to you. Whenever we embark on a long journey, there is a sense of death and rebirth. The experiences we go through have a transitional quality. The moment we step outside our house and close the door, we begin to leave our life behind. We say goodbye to family and friends and to the familiar rooms. Sorry, allergy season started. To the familiar rooms and routines that we inhabit. We might feel regret mixed with excitement as we climb into the taxi that will take us to the airport. As our vision of home recedes, we are both sadly parted and joyfully released from all that defines us. The further from home we go, the more focused we become on our next destination. We think less of home and more about where we're going. We begin to look at a new map. We start to think about where we'll land, about the new people, new customs, and new environment. All the new sets of experiences to come. Until we reach our destination, we are in transit in between two points. One world has dissolved, like last night's dream, and the next has not yet arisen. In this space, there is a sense of total freedom. We are free from the business, or busyness, of being our ordinary selves. We are not tied to the day-to-day world and its demands in quite the same way. There's a sense of freshness and appreciation of the present moment. At the same time, we may have moments of feeling fearful and groundless because we've entered unknown territory. We do not know with certainty what will arise in the next moment or where it will take us. The moment we relax, however, our insecurity dissolves and the environment becomes friendly and supportive. We are at ease in our world once again and can move forward naturally with confidence. Leaving this life is similar in many ways to going on a long trip. In this case, the trip we're making is a journey of the mind. We're leaving behind this body, our loved ones, our possessions, and all our experiences of this life and moving on to the next. We're in transit in between two points. We have left home but have not yet reached our next destination. We're neither in the past nor in the future. We are sandwiched between yesterday and tomorrow. Where we are now is the present, which is the only place we can be. Though there are some parts of that that might not apply to illness, I don't think we look forward with anticipation to going to the hospital or be cared for. But there is something about in this in-between place where our familiar things are left behind and we're in an unknown transition period and we're not sure what's going to unfold. That brings up quite a bit of compassion for people who are suffering through illness. In that spirit, I thought we might offer some compassion practice this evening for those who are going through serious illness. You can offer this to someone you know or to strangers you don't know, but to whom you'd like to offer this compassion. By the way, with any of the guided meditations offered, you are welcome to join them fully or to let the words just wash over you or even let my voice fade into the background or mute the sound for the next 20, 25 minutes and simply enjoy meditating with others in the group. It's always fine to respect where you are in practice. So with that, let's settle in to our meditation together, finding the posture and the way to be this evening that supports you. Allowing yourself time to settle in, to get comfortable and aware. Receiving whatever is most prominent in awareness from moment to moment, allowing whatever is arising and passing in the body, the heart, the mind. Receiving all the glues and signals about how you are. And if there are edges of discomfort or a lack of quietude in the mind, respecting that and extending some compassion to yourself for the conditions that arise in us as human beings all the time. And when you're ready, perhaps bringing to mind someone in your life who is ill or yourself if this is your situation. Or allowing yourself to imagine the people in a hospital near you who are going through illness. Allowing images and perhaps memories to come to mind and heart. Perhaps seeing a specific person, excuse me, at their best, their acts of kindness, their smile, generosity, whatever's characteristic of the person. Perhaps times when they were well and perhaps their courage or how they are in the face of any struggles they've had in their life before this. Really allowing the person to fill your heart and mind. And if there's sadness or even tears well up, allow that, allow the natural quality of deep feeling. You can send kind and compassionate wishes in the presence of strong emotion. It's very natural for human beings to form attachments to one another. And it's subject to the human condition. And it's not climbing the mind for its compassion for this person or people. It's not just the human phrases very quietly in the mind or merely hearing them and letting what you hear resonate for the person you're holding in mind. It's free to modify any of these phrases to fit your wishes for the person or simply letting the feeling of compassion flow from your heart towards them. May you find ease from your pain and suffering. May you find inner healing and outer healing as much as possible. May you connect with the present moment. May you be supported by caring people. May you and those who support you be strengthened during this time. May you face the unknown with courage. Simply being present with whatever arises is courage enough. May your suffering lessen ease. May it come to an end. If the heart wants to extend these wishes towards yourself, just for the pain and suffering that occurs in life from day to day and year to year, allow yourself to wish yourself these compassionate inclinations. Or continue to send them to the ill person whom you're holding in your heart. May you find ease for pain and suffering. May you find inner healing and outer healing as much as is possible. May you find connection in the present moment. Connecting with your own heart. Connecting with the people who are caring for you. May you be supported by kind, compassionate people. May you and those who support you be strengthened during this time. May you find courage simply to be present with whatever is arising with awareness. May your suffering lessen and cease. May your suffering come to an end. Continue to send wishes of compassion in silence for the next number of minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And in the last few minutes of this meditation, perhaps including yourself and all living beings extending some wishes of kindness and compassion, may we all be well. May every living being be safe. May we all be happy. May all living beings be at ease. And may we all be free of suffering. May we all be well. So many different things can arise when we're doing a compassion practice. And the hope is that you allow whatever has come into your awareness with kindness and compassion for whatever it is. And then for the next 10 minutes or so, we'll have time to share what came up for you or any thoughts or inspirations with one another. And the invitation is to share what feels comfortable for you. You don't have to stretch beyond your limits. And as you go around your small group of three people, you might each just share one thing at a time and continue to go around the circle sharing just one thing at a time. And doing so without commentary on each other's sharing or advice giving or opinions, just wholeheartedly listening to what the other person shares when they're sharing. And also watching for what's coming up in you as they share in silence. And then when it's your turn, sharing what's on your heart and mind. So I will create the about 10 breakout groups and send you off for about 10 minutes. See you soon. Thank you.
