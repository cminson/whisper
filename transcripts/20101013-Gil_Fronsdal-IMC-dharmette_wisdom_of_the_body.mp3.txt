Dharmette: Wisdom of the Body  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

I’d like to talk about mindfulness of the body , which is 
such a fundamental aspect of mindfulness overall  – and 
of Buddhist spirituality. It was a surprise to me to 
discover how important the body is in Buddhism. I think 
when I was first introduced to Buddhism,  I was reading 
books  and the body didn’t seem to be included – only 
these wonderful abstract ideas. But i n all the different 
places I’ve trained in Buddhism – monasteries , 
meditation centers – you had to bring your body along 
[laughs] . And not just that, but a lot of the training was 
bodily.  
 
Sometimes with mindfulness of the body, you pay 
attention to your bo dy, and sometimes it’s through using 
your body. When I was at the monastery in Japan, we 
didn’t meditate that much, oddly enough. I was a little bit 
– actually very much – surprised . We meditated some  
every  day. After I was there for about three months , I 
was disappointed , and I thought I should leave. But I 
stayed through the five -month period I had committed 
to. And after I had been  away from the monastery for a 
while, only then did I realize how much the monastic 
experience had affected me, especially through my body. When I was there, I was just doing the bodily 
things you do, m oving through the monastery. It wa s 
very choreographed : a lot of bowing , and activities with 
the body you had to do. After  I left, I could feel how my 
body had been chan ged by all the ritual, all the activity, 
all the meditation we did with our bod ies. The body had 
been included  as part of the training .  
 
Part of the beauty of that was that  in Zen, you don’t 
have to teach as much  if you use your body a lot,  as 
part of the  practice field, as part of the monastery.  
Whereas in our tradition, Vipassana, we put a lot of 
emphasis on mindfulness of the body, but it’s not by 
using the body . It’s by paying attention to it . So we have 
to teach a lot more. I will give you a little ex ample. In 
Vipassana , we teach the importance of balancing effort 
and calm, effort and concentration. We talk about how 
to recognize when  there’s too much effort, how to 
recognize when there’s not enough effort , and also h ow 
to recognize when there’s too much calm, and when  
there’s not enough , and how to bring them into balance . 
And you pay attention to that.  
 
In Zen , you have to sit up straight;  you can’t slump . And 
you place  your hands together with one hand over the 
other, and with your thum bs lightly touching . An oval is 
formed between your index finger and your thumb. 
What happens if there’s too much energy, or if you’re 
tense, is that your thumbs together . And if you’re too slack , your thumbs fall apart. You’re told : “Just keep 
your thumbs  together, lightly touching.”  They don’t have 
to teach you so much about making too much or too 
little effort [laughs] because the thumbs tell you . Or your 
body being upright  and straigh t will tell you. In Zen, a lot 
of the te aching happens through the body:  how you hold 
your body , how you  move your body through space, and 
the rituals involving the body .  
 
In our tradition , a lot of the teaching is done, perhaps  
conceptually, but it’s meant to be translated into an 
inner knowing through the body. I’ll sh are with you as  
example of the difference between Zen training and 
Vipassana from when I did one of my early Vipassana 
retreats in Nepal . Another student on the retreat  was 
one of the most senior Western Vipassana teachers at 
the time . We shared a room , and we did all our 
meditation in th is little room where we slept. S o the four 
of us in that  room  were quite intimate . I could see him 
meditating,  and I would meditate there  too. We would 
go to interviews with the teacher together , and I would 
hear his interv iew with the teacher, so it was intimate to 
find out what was happening  with him  on the inside. 
After a week or so into the retreat, he started talking 
about his back pain , and he gave a beautiful, very 
precise description of his pain. He never complained.  It 
was obvious that it was excruciating for him , but he was 
very present, very mindful of it. At some point he told 
the teacher, “Back in the Sta tes I would probably go to the c hiropractor.”  Being in Nepal , that  probably wasn’t 
easy. As I was listening to this, I felt this compassion for 
him. You weren’t  supposed to talk during the retreat , but 
I snuck over to him in the room and whisper ed, “If you 
just sat up straighter , it would p robably be better for you 
back”  [laughs] . He was all slum ped over;  his posture 
was horrible. I was there as a Zen priest and had Zen 
garb on , so he knew I was a Zen practitioner, and he 
was this Vipassana teacher . He turned to me  and 
looked at me with great, soft compassion, and he said 
“Oh, in Zen , you do it fr om the outside in. In Vipassan a 
we do it from the inside out,”  meaning that in Zen, you 
take this upright, good posture , and you work from the 
outside in. In Vipassana , you have this attention that 
goes from the inside out . I don’t know if I actually did i t, 
but I felt  like I shrugged my shoulders, saying “ Okay , if 
you want to suffer [laughs] , let it be.”  
 
Ideally, I think it’s a combination of both. It’s both inside 
out and outside in. You take some care for your posture 
and for what you do, but the strength of mindfulness in 
our tradition is not the outside in , but i s really from the 
inside out. You need both , I think.  
 
This idea of knowing yo ur body from the inside out i s a 
different kind of knowing, th an knowing through our 
thinking  or conceptualizing. It’s closer to knowing 
through sensing or feeling.  What’s beautiful about 
sensing  and feeling the body, is that  it is not dualistic with what’s being sensed or felt.  
 
If you put your finger on you r thigh and push, you can 
sense  or feel, the sense of pressure on y our thigh  and 
the pressure that you feel happen  in the place where 
the pushing is . And t he sensations o f pressure happen 
where the sensing is happening. The se nsation and the 
sensing are non -dual – you can’t separate them out. 
You can’t have sensations without sensing. You don’t 
have sensing with a sensation , and you can’t really 
separate out the sensing fr om the sensation.  
 
You can think about the pressure. I can say to myself, 
“Oh that’s a finger pushing against my thigh. That 
pressure feels like i t’s ten pounds per square inch.”  I 
can think about it in va rious ways , but that’s different  
from the actual s ensing experience. There’s something 
very intere sting about the non -dual, non -separate 
aspect  of sensing and sensat ions. If your awareness 
resides  not in your thinking, but in your body, in the 
sensing itself, then your awareness is all over your 
body. It’s everywhere.  
 
You can relax,  soften, and be mindful by sensing and 
experiencing, where the body becomes alive and awake 
through sensations, thro ugh experience. You don’t feel 
like you’re separate from sensations. You don’t feel like 
knowing is only happening from a di stance. The 
knowing is intimate  and connected . It allows for relaxing because the sense of being tense, held, or braced from 
life of ten happens because we have a mental reaction  
to our experience. But to be able to have the awareness 
reside in the body, and to be felt like global, 360 -degree 
awareness  that emanates from the body, this allows for  
a much more intimate, relaxed, and easie r soften ing into 
the body. It’s easier for the body to soften if the 
awareness is broad and wide.  
 
For some people, w hat often happens is they’re cut off 
from the bod y, or parts of the body go numb. I’ve known 
people  who know they have a body below their neck , 
but they’ll tell me, “ You know , I don’t really feel anything 
from the nec k down, ” or “from the waist down.”  They’ve 
disconnected. Sometimes when p eople have very 
strong and difficult emotions , and they can’t bear 
experiencing those emotions, they’ll numb, or cut off the 
connection to certain parts of the body , because it’s only 
by feeling those emotions in certain parts of the body, 
that they can feel those emotions. If you don’t feel below 
your neck, you’re not going to feel a lot of your 
emotional l ife, and so people think it’s safe r.  
 
Some people have occupations that keep them always 
in their heads. It becomes a habit, a conditioning, to 
always be thinking about things, rather than feeling  or 
sensing  them . Or they have teachings they’ve received 
from their religious tradition  that somehow the body is 
bad. Or y ou shouldn’t be connected to the body. You shouldn’t sense and feel it. You certainly shou ldn’t feel 
any joy in your body – that’s really bad. I remember 
once on retreat, I had the p rivilege of telling this woman 
that it was okay to experience joy in her body when she 
meditated . She had got ten this very strong teaching 
from her other religious tradition that somehow that was 
sinful. You could see her relax : “Wow. I can feel. I can 
enjoy my body? ” 
 
There are  a variety of reasons why people feel they are 
disconnected from their bodies. Some people have an 
aversive relationship to their body, partly because their 
body is not always a perfect instrument. Have you 
noticed that? [laughs] The body i s not living up to what 
we want it to be. We can’t do all the things we wanted to 
do. So then people are angry with the body, or they feel 
that the body is getting in the way . We’re stumbling 
along, and w ho we are is a brain on top of a stick 
[laughs] . But u nfortunately, we have to negotiate this 
body as well.  
 
There are  all kinds of att itudes people have to their 
bodies that make it difficult  or less likely, that they’re 
going to really relax, or settle  into the body , and let 
awareness r adiate through the po res, througho ut the 
body everywhere. One of the beautiful things that can 
happen with mindfulness practice is that as we develop 
greater mindfulness  of the body, and slowly, slowly , the 
body begins to wake up. We become more aware of the body, more  alert through the body, and there i s more of 
a sense that we’re in this world , living in the body . We’re 
part of the world ; we’re resting in it; we’re grounded;  
we’re centered in it, as opposed to being in the head, 
which is telling us that we’re somehow separate , 
distinct, or isolated.  The mind can often have these 
ideas of separation , which are not that healthy  or 
helpful.  
 
It’s not necessarily a beautiful or pleasant  process to 
wake up in the body , because the body can hold a lot of 
tension . But one of the great , worthwhile things to do is 
to drop into the body, to feel it, feel the tension, and feel 
the emotions that are locked up in the body. Even if 
these emotions  are difficult, trusting the body  means 
trusting the inner unfolding that happens within . It’s as if 
the body has it s own wisdom  that knows what needs to 
unfold, what needs to relax, what needs to show itself 
and come up, in a way that we can’t access if we’ re just 
thinking about our life  and trying to negotiate our life 
through our thoughts.  
 
The analogy I like to give  for the wisdom of the body, is 
when you cut your finger . You can intentionally cut your 
finger with a knife , but you can’t in the same intentional 
way heal your finger. You can’t orchestrate  the healing 
of your finger. The heal ing is such a complex, 
neurophysiological event, with all the chemical s the 
body pours into the wound and  everything that goes on . My guess is that  you’d need a really complicated 
computer to direct all  the things that have to happen. 
What you do i s keep the wound clean and covered – 
that’s your job . And then something that’s much wiser 
than you  in the  body knows how to do the healing.  
 
I think  it’s the same thing  with psychological wounds 
that we carry  in our body . The body knows how to heal 
them , if we get out of the way. But getting out of the way 
means  we don’t turn on the TV and ignore it. It means to 
be really present for it. Be awake to it. Feel it in your 
body. Feel what’s going on in your body. Come back to 
your body. Be with it in the body. Trust the body. Trust 
the way the body experiences it. The chances are that 
something will unfold, unravel, and reveal itself , and 
become clear.  
 
Trust your body. A big part of mindfulness of the body  is 
learning that inner trust, that the body is really your best 
friend – it’s your monastery.
