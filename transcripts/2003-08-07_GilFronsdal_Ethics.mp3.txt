In the old days in China, when there was a great time of the Chan or the Zen tradition in China,
there was a Zen master whose name was Tree Nest Master, the Tree Nest Master,
because he liked to meditate up in trees, so he had this name.
And one day the governor of the province came to see him or came by or something,
and he looked up at him in the tree and said, you know, it's really dangerous up there.
And the Zen master looked down at the governor and said,
it's a lot more dangerous where you are in your position.
And he said, no, I don't think so. That's the case. You're the one who's up in the tree.
And then the Zen master said, well, in that case, you don't really know your mind and heart very well, do you?
And then the governor said, you know, what's the essential teachings of the Buddha?
And the Zen master said, to avoid doing evil, to cultivate the practices of the good, and to purify the mind.
This is a very ancient little teaching that goes back to the very beginning of Buddhism.
And the governor said, even an eight-year-old child knows that.
And the Zen master said, even though an eight-year-old child might know it, an eight-year-old person might not live it.
And that's the end of the story.
And so there's a few things here. One is, where is the real danger?
And the Zen master is trying to say that the real danger resides inside of yourself.
There's a real danger here. If we succumb to hate, if we succumb to greed, or if we let fear get the upper hand,
and we act out in paranoid ways that are not very helpful to anybody, including oneself,
that we provide ourselves our greatest danger.
We ourselves are, in some ways, our greatest threat to the well-being of our heart, or what's going on,
our sense of wholeness within ourselves, the sense of being wholehearted.
And one of the teachings of Buddhism is that our hearts, this wonderful sense of integrity,
of wholeness, or deep sensitivity that can reside within us, is only really harmed by ourselves.
There might be causes and conditions around us which are somewhat atrocious, terrible things that happen,
but that if we succumb to hate, or if we succumb to greed, or to fear, or all these different kinds of forces within us,
and indulging them, or acting on them, or living by them, that we are then causing harm to ourselves.
So there's one famous teachings of the Buddha is, if you get angry, you're doing your enemy's work for.
You're pleasing your enemy. You're doing a harm to yourself that your enemy could never do to you,
implying that, you know, our enemy could be angry at you and do all kinds of terrible things to you,
and the enemy really wants to hurt you, and when you get angry, then you're doing something inside of yourself
that's causing you pain and suffering, and that pain and suffering of being angry is kind of doing your enemy a favor.
So again, this pointing this way in which, in some way, I'm not going to argue here it's universal,
all the ways we suffer come from our own way to retreat at each other ourselves,
but one of the important aspects of Buddhism is this way of becoming a caretaker of our own heart,
our own mind, our own inner life, and recognizing the ways in which we harm it ourselves,
and the way that we can benefit it and support it and nourish it.
And one of the very foundational teachings of Buddhism for this purpose is that of ethics, of morality, of virtue,
and we find in the Buddhist tradition tremendous emphasis on the importance of living an ethical life,
and this little teaching that the Zen master gave the governor, the essential teachings of the Buddha,
to avoid evil, to cultivate good, to practice good, and to purify the mind.
That's kind of an ethical teaching, to avoid evil and do good, and then to purify the mind.
It's very central to Buddhism, and the word for virtue, or the word for morality in Buddhism,
the word is sila, and sila sometimes has been etymologically connected to the word of a bed or foundation,
a foundation stone for a house or something, and it's a real foundation for our lives.
The Buddha said once that if you harm other people intentionally,
if you go about intentionally through cruelty or ill will, harming other people, you are destroying your own foundation.
The foundation that supports you and nourishes you, that supports this inner kind of life.
And traditionally in Buddhism, the teachings on ethics and morality are supposed to be taught first.
And as I was coming down here today, I was reflecting how for many years in Palo Alto,
I taught the introductory course in meditation on Thursday evenings.
I would just interrupt the regular Thursday evening kind of sitting group,
and then do a five-week introductory course.
And always the first week I'd start with meditation on the breath introduction.
Maybe many of you have taken the course that I've taught.
But for many, many years, the week before I taught the intro class,
I would give a talk on ethics, on the precepts.
And in my mind, I kind of told people are there,
but in my mind, the five-week class was really a six-week class, and it started that day.
But if we advertise, like introduction to ethics, people aren't, you know, be so interested in that.
People want, in our cultural societies, they want the benefits of mindfulness and meditation.
What many, and it's fine to do that, what many people find after practicing meditation for some time,
is that there's a kind of sense of inner, and this is my own language.
I mean, everybody will have their own words, ways to describe this inner sense,
but inner change, whatever, some inner sense of integrity that we touch, we feel, we encounter.
Some sense of wholeness, some sense of well-being, some sense of compassion or love or goodness or something
that we touch inside of ourselves.
And when we touch inside of ourselves, then it becomes, begins to become quite obvious
how living in unethical ways becomes a way of harming ourselves.
And the little thought experiment which I often give is, imagine yourself going off into a wonderful hike
on a wonderful, you know, maybe weekend afternoon, and it's a beautiful day, just the right temperature
and comfortable and beautiful sun and blue sky and springtime and the grass like green
and beautiful wildflowers, you go hiking, and you come to a wonderful place to stop for lunch
and you have just the right amount of food for lunch, not too much.
And you lay down under this beautiful oak tree, and it's just so peaceful, so delightful,
and you're just so satisfied and content.
And you even maybe get a wonderful little nap, you know, a short nap,
and you wake up so refreshed and so cleansed in the sense, maybe.
And your friend who's sitting next to you kind of wakes up at the same time
and you turn to your friend and said, you know, you're a jerk.
Or you lie to your friend, or you see your friend still taking a nap
and you see that your friend, you know, has this beautiful thermos.
So you take the thermos and it's stuck in the bottom of your backpack
and your friend will never see that, you know, where it's gone.
And, you know, in that kind of thought experiment, you imagine how you feel,
the sense of well-being, the peace.
And maybe I hope that it feels like real, it feels like, you know, a little bit grating perhaps.
And it feels a little bit like it's against the spirit of how you're feeling.
It's like, you know, it's like, I hope that's what you felt,
somehow kind of personal violence to yourself in that piece that you're feeling
to cause harm to someone else.
Then if you kind of forget that thought experiment
and imagine yourself going down the freeway at five o'clock in the afternoon,
you're late for a very important appointment.
It's rush hour traffic, it's gridlock.
You can't, you're actually standing still in the freeway.
When you're finally able to move a little bit, someone cuts you off
and your air conditioner doesn't work so your windows are down
and all this sauce is going into your car.
It's just, you know, you're feeling you have a headache.
And then one more person cuts you off.
And how easy it is to kind of get angry, how easy it is to flip them off
or how easy it is to honk your horn some very aggressive way
or how easy it is to kind of, they're trying to get in
and you kind of force yourself forward.
I'm not going to let that person in at all, you know, who's that person.
And in a state where we're already agitated and quite, you know,
harried and upset and frustrated,
it can be quite easy to do something that's unethical
and not to feel the cost of it, not to feel the effect it has.
Does that kind of thought experiment work for you?
Does that make sense, the difference? Yeah?
It kind of works.
Some of you, it doesn't work.
People who doesn't work, you know, admit it.
Say it, because I say this a lot
so no one ever gives me any feedback.
So I should ask for it someday.
This is a kind of thought experiment that works as a teaching thing.
And, but I think that as people meditate,
there tends to be kind of inner integrity
or some sense of within ourselves
that translates then to wanting to start living a more ethical life.
Ethical life then becomes an expression of how we want to live.
We want to safeguard, we want to protect this inner sense of well-being
or integrity we have.
And traditionally in Buddhism,
because of that intimate connection with ethics
and our inner sense of well-being,
the instructions are to start with your ethics before you meditate.
You try to clean up your ethical house.
You try to live in a way that doesn't cause harm.
And as you do that, you get a number of benefits.
One benefit is that you're not doing anything intentionally
through your behavior or through your speech.
That is causing harm to others.
And in doing causing harm,
you have nothing to regret in terms of hurting someone.
You're not acting on those impulses.
And acting on it, actually acting on the impulses of causing harm
is like making the whole wound much stronger and more deeper.
So if you start living an ethical life,
part of your life becomes kind of quieter and more peaceful and more at ease.
And you're not struggling so much with it.
You don't have any doubts about it. What should I do in this situation?
You've kind of taken a commitment.
I'm going to live an ethical life.
I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to steal.
I'm not going to kill.
I'm not going to involve in sexual misconduct that harms other people.
I'm not going to indulge in intoxicants
that can cause a whole slew of problems once we get drunk.
And a person has some real confidence
that this is how they're going to live their life.
And there can be, for some people,
a tremendous sense of feeling safe,
feeling some sense of well-being
in knowing we're not going to cross those kinds of lines
because they made some kind of commitment.
As we start living this way of not crossing a line and being unethical,
this in return supports the cultivation of this inner sense of well-being,
this inner integrity.
Another integrity supports the inner integrity.
So that's kind of like just, you know, that's one benefit.
The second benefit is that as we start being interested in living an ethical life,
and for lay Buddhists, it's often defined as being guided by the five precepts,
the five training rules, the five trainings.
Maybe it's the best translation in English, the five trainings.
The five trainings are not to kill,
not to intentionally cause harm,
not to steal, not to take what is not given,
not to lie,
not to be involved in sexual misconduct,
which most people, we understand,
is not user-sexual in ways that can cause harm to others.
And then not to indulge in intoxicants.
So these are called training, the five trainings.
And in using the word trainings,
a lot of people like to then see the difference between the idea of commandments.
There's some absolute moral rule that is being given from above,
and to thou shalt, and if you transgress it, you've done a sin.
It's a training that Buddhists take on to help them
and be more mindful, more attentive to what's happening.
To give maybe an example from the time I was a monk,
there are all these rules.
Monks have five precepts, they have 227 to live by.
And a lot of them are very simple things,
things like what kind of dwelling you can live in,
what kind of shoes you can wear,
and how you eat your food.
Like for example, there are all these rules about how you're supposed to eat your food.
You have this big bowl and eating this bowl,
and you're supposed to kind of basically mix everything together,
the desserts and the salads and everything, just eat it all,
without any preference for whatever.
And there are certain ways of eating.
And then one of the rules is,
and you're not supposed to look into your fellow monk's bowl to see how he or she's eating.
Because you can imagine, the judgments they can go on, how could you?
So it's a beautiful rule.
The principle is pretty great.
You're supposed to follow this rule,
but don't judge other people whether they're following it or not.
Isn't that great?
So there's a lot of rules for the monastics.
So when I was a monk,
there were simple rules like,
you weren't actually allowed to pick anything up.
It was not your own.
Unless in some ways it was offered to you,
or told you, it's okay for you to do it.
Look at this, you know, whatever.
And so you come into someone's house,
and you see something nice on the table,
like maybe it's one of these,
what are they called, coffee table books?
These conversational books, these books full of pictures,
and you know, people have them.
And, you know, it's there for people to look at, right?
And you feel the impulse to pick it up and look at it,
so it's really fascinating what's there.
But you have this rule,
that you're not allowed to pick something up as a monk,
unless it's been, it's clearly offered to you to hold.
That's not an ethical rule per se,
but it's a training rule.
Because in knowing that you can't pick it up,
you feel the impulse to pick it up.
No.
I get to be mindful of what I'm doing.
So having this rule sets a barrier in a sense,
or sets a limit, or sets like a mindfulness bell.
Oh, I have to be mindful of myself,
of my conduct and behavior when I come around coffee tables.
When I come into these situations where I might pick something up.
And I was really surprised when I became a monk
how wonderful it was to live under these rules,
because how mindful it made me be.
In 227, you know, rules,
there were so many different situations where I would come into,
where somehow the rule applied,
and I had to be attentive, I had to be alert.
And I wasn't oppressed by it.
Oh, one more rule I have to think about that.
I actually felt more liberated by it.
Oh, to be present and awake and really noticing what's going on.
And then I noticed, for example,
if I was going to pick up something like this book,
I would notice the impulse to pick it up,
and I'd refrain for a number of benefits.
One benefit is there's a lot of strength,
a lot of freedom that can come
when we have cultivated the ability to restrain ourselves peacefully,
to feel an impulse.
I don't have to go there, I'm going to do that.
I can just let go, restrain myself.
I know some people equate restraint with being suppressed,
and kind of being oppressed.
If that's the case, then maybe you shouldn't restrain
unless you're causing harm to someone.
But the spirit in Buddhism is there's a way
in which restraining ourselves provides freedom,
some ease.
If we're acting on impulse and on compulsion,
then we're not free.
So if we have a compulsion to shop,
the American ideal would be
to find a shopping center and freely shop.
That's what American freedom is about, shop till you drop.
And I'm free to shop.
The Buddhist freedom would be
free yourself from the compulsion to shop.
You might still shop if you need to shop for good reasons,
but to drive the compulsion.
So the mindfulness, the rule of picking up something,
is this kind of restraint.
It also becomes an opportunity,
it also becomes a mirror for me to see myself at that moment.
And it might be that there's some impulses which are not so pure,
some impulses that are not so helpful, healthy,
going into play in a situation,
and by having some boundary that I can't cross in a sense,
it becomes a mirror for me to see,
that's what's happening.
So maybe coffee books are not so interesting,
but maybe they have some great Buddhist book on that table,
the coffee table.
I've never seen this book by a teacher that I greatly admire,
I've never seen this book.
And so I go to reach for it,
but I know as a monk I can't actually do it.
I'm not allowed to pick it up unless it's said,
please look at it, and I'm not allowed to hint either.
That's also out.
So you have to really, you know,
and so there's a mirror, you know,
why did I want to pick it up?
And perhaps, you know, 10% of that impulse to pick it up,
part of it is, that's what I want.
I want this great Buddhist book to tell me how to get rid of my greed.
You know, this impulse, you know,
I see that impulse and it's great to see it.
It's great to be aware of it.
And hopefully as you develop your mindfulness practice,
you'll discover this great delight you can have
in noticing what's happening.
It might take a little while as you kind of struggle,
and for a while the old habits kick in and you judge yourself,
oh, I can't believe I'm doing that again.
Oh, gee, I'm such a greedy person.
But after a while, when mindfulness is really strong,
there's a wonderful flavor of it.
Oh, it's kind of, it's actually freeing in the moment of being mindful.
So part of the idea of the precepts is to learn restraint,
which is freeing, and the other part of it is to learn mindfulness,
awareness of what's going on in deeper levels,
which is also freeing.
And the third benefit that I'll mention tonight
is the benefit that living ethically is a gift we do for others.
It's one of the greatest gifts you can give someone else
is the gift of fearlessness.
They don't have to fear you.
You're not adding fear to the world.
They can trust you, they feel safe around you.
They can put their coffee table books down,
they know they're going to be there when they come back.
You know, it's okay.
You don't have to lock it up with something when you show up.
There's no equivalent to that.
I remember when I was in Thailand,
I lost my wallet at the entrance of the monastery gate.
And this was a part of Thailand that was kind of the Wild West.
I was told that most of the men in that part of southern Thailand
had guns and a lot of violence and a lot of stuff goes on there.
And I said, you know, but it wasn't, you know,
the gateway to the monastery.
I'll never see that again.
And not only was the abbot holding and waiting to give it to me,
but all the money and everything was in there.
Everything was in there.
The monastery was a safe place.
So living ethically is a gift to others.
And a part of the impulse to live ethically for some people
is out of the impulse to be compassionate.
And compassion is one of these wonderful qualities
that seems to grow as we cultivate mindfulness,
as we get more settled and more at ease with ourselves,
less in conflict with ourselves and more attentive in a deeper way.
That compassion is as if compassion is an innate quality of the heart.
If we just get out of the way, it will radiate forth.
And if you start having little inklings of compassion,
I think it becomes more and more interesting to try to live ethically.
Not just ethically in the moment,
but, you know, to anticipate situations
where you might not be so mindful
and where you might do something uncompassionately.
Maybe, you know, in that rush hour traffic,
you can be compassionate up in the meadow after a beautiful hike.
It's easy. You can love all humanity.
But can be compassionate in that rush hour traffic.
Other situations where you're really tested
and where you might do something unethical.
So part of the dedication to the precepts in Buddhism
is not just to feel like compassion is good when it happens,
but when you start feeling compassionate
to kind of imagine into the future, in a sense,
imagine situations where you need protection from,
where you need preparation for,
so that, you know, that you can continue offering the gift
of fearlessness, of safety, of, you know, coming from a compassionate place.
So for lay people in Buddhism, there are these five trainings.
And some Buddhists, some lay Buddhists,
will cultivate these, will work with these,
explore these for quite a long time
before they learn meditation practice.
I remember the awe I felt when I met this friend of mine
when I was a student at Stanford.
She was a Chinese, I guess she was Chinese American now,
but she grew up in Taiwan, in Thailand,
and some in Japan and mostly grew up abroad.
But had come to America to go to college
and become, you know, settled here.
And she was quite a devout Buddhist.
And she was actually studying with,
I mean, in the department I was studying Buddhist studies at the university at Stanford.
And she was also studying Buddhist studies,
that she'd made that her kind of, her thing in life was just to do Buddhist studies.
But all Buddhism was her kind of thing.
So this person was quite serious about it,
and so I asked her one day,
you meditate?
And she said,
No, not yet.
I'm preparing myself for that,
so that I'm worthy of it.
I'm preparing myself so that I'm worthy to learn to meditate,
in order to meditate.
And I was kind of amazed.
I'd never heard, you know, I'd spend most of my time, you know,
practicing here in the West,
mostly among people who were kind of,
what can we call convert Buddhists,
who had not, you know, grown up as Buddhists.
And the idea that you would put off your meditation
because you were preparing yourself for it,
purifying your conduct and your behavior,
and working on your precepts and your ethical life,
my generation of kind of people coming out of the 60s kind of,
you know, ethics was kind of like, you know,
that wasn't so interesting.
And, you know, we were, you know,
we were going for the real stuff, the important stuff,
the transformational stuff, you know,
that which was, you know, better than acid, you know.
And, you know, so, so, I was, you know,
I was ready to bow to this beautiful woman.
I thought it was so beautiful.
And I'm not necessarily recommending you spend years
working on your ethics.
And she was a very ethical person.
It wasn't like she was an ethical person.
But she was aware of the subtleties of these things,
the subtle ways in which we take what's not given,
the subtle ways in which we might cause harm
and do these things.
And so I think we don't have to stop meditating,
but I think it's very valuable to start seeing
the interconnectedness between virtue and mindfulness
and how the two really support themselves,
support each other.
If you start trying to train yourselves
by the five precepts,
that training itself will strengthen your mindfulness,
because you have to be mindful in order to kind of live by them.
It will also strengthen your inner sense of well-being
and integrity for most of us.
Some people who are kind of guilt-bound will often,
or, you know, feel so sun-worthy to begin with,
that many people in our culture feel
that any emphasis on ethics and precepts
can kind of sink them,
because, oh, I can't live up to that.
And so maybe it's better not to start with ethics then.
But generally, it's considered to be, you know,
very helpful to work with them together,
not to kill.
It's beautiful. You go to retreat centers,
and people have been meditating for some time,
and they're very quiet,
and they've taken precepts at the beginning of the retreat.
And then some insect flies into the meditation hall.
And you see these people, you know,
they're supposed to keep silent,
and they go over there, and they go, you know,
like this, you know, their most cherished pet, you know,
or they take a piece of paper,
and they're very carefully, you know,
and they're very mindful,
and they're very carefully carrying it outside this little insect,
and they open the door, and they shh, you know.
It's, you know, they don't,
not only, you know, not trying to kill the insects,
but they feel the insects going to die
if it stays inside this kind of environment,
you know, there's nothing in here for it to eat.
So, let's, you know, I'll take it outside where it belongs.
And, you know, it might seem like maybe a petty thing,
or to, you know, not kill insects,
or take, you know, take the insects and take them out of your house
rather than to kill them.
But when the sensitivity is deep enough,
when the sense of inter-integrity is deep,
when we settle them on self is deep enough,
being at peace with self is deep enough,
not only does it feel better,
but actually I believe there's a kind of a delight or joy
that comes with that kind of compassionate activity.
So not just simply avoiding causing harm,
but the opposite expression of that is
to do that which is compassionate in any situation.
Each of the precepts is not just a,
each precept, even though it's stated in the negative,
not to kill, not to steal, not to lie, and so forth.
The understanding in the Buddhist tradition
is that the negative implies cultivating the positive.
So not killing implies the cultivation of compassion.
Not stealing implies the cultivation of generosity.
Not lying implies the cultivation of honesty.
Not misusing sexuality implies, I'm not sure what,
restrained, treating each other with integrity and compassion,
and not involved in intoxicants.
The opposite of that is clarity of mind,
cultivating a clarity of mind and valuing that.
One of the surprises I had when I went to Asia,
Southeast Asia, was to meet a Buddhist there
who felt joy in their ethical conduct.
And this was a foreign idea to me.
In America, kind of growing up, I hadn't thought about much,
but if someone had, you know, was being super ethical,
they were kind of, we had kind of a derogatory term for them.
They were kind of goody-goody.
You know, kind of like, you didn't quite, somehow.
And so that idea that someone would feel joy
was a kind of, you know, foreign idea, a delight.
And that it's kind of a protection in a way of,
it's an offering, it's a gift.
So what is the quality of mind?
What's the quality of the heart?
Where everything I'm saying tonight resonates, speaks deeply,
inspiring, kind of feels right.
I know there are qualities of mind and heart
where it just seems ridiculous,
or just seems maybe kind of, you know, why bother,
or, you know, I'm already ethical
and what's he giving this talk about ethics for, you know?
All kinds of things that come up.
But I suspect that in everybody's heart,
there's some place where it feels really right
to be ethical, to be compassionate, to live this way.
Is that a place that you want to nourish?
Is that a place that you want to feed and develop?
Or you want to kind of overlook it?
Or feel like it has no real value?
What has value is competition, you know?
And, you know, cut-throat competition,
ambition, getting someplace, getting things in life, you know?
You know, I can, you know, rather than cultivating
that place within me,
I could, you know, go home and watch television.
You know, there's a lot of interesting things on television,
I imagine. I don't know.
I don't watch television.
And so, you know, how many times does a person choose
to watch television?
Or we're doing something that's as beautiful
as cultivating their compassion?
Which is more valuable?
Which is more, you know, among all the choices we do,
what we do, what does it feed?
What does it develop inside of us?
So the last thing I'll say about the emphasis on ethics
or virtue or this integrity that's part of the Buddhist tradition
is that it's not meant as a kind of self-righteous kind of approach.
It's not meant to be kind of being moralistic in some ways.
It's not meant to in any kind of way be oppressive or burden.
It's really supposed to speak to that part of our life,
that part of ethics where it's a liberating movement
towards joy and compassion.
Something that we delight in.
If you don't feel that delight, don't feel that joy,
you have one or two choices.
If you want to, you know, explore this world of ethics
and the trainings of the precepts.
If you don't feel the joy in it,
one choice you have is to chuck it
and go back to the way you were.
The other choice you have is to study
why is it you don't feel joy?
Is there something that's getting in the way of that?
Is there something else that's happening instead?
And really bring your mindfulness really clearly
and see what's going on here.
Am I lazy?
Is it too painful to do this
because I tend to be self-judgmental in the process?
I'm worried about what my friends think.
If I start carrying the insects out of my house,
my friends are going to think I'm gone cuckoo.
What is it going on there with you?
And that's, you know, a mindfulness practice to explore that.
So exploring these five trainings,
being guided by them, being trained by the five trainings,
is really the first instructions
for a beginner who wants to learn mindfulness meditation.
And you just got it.
So what do you think?
What's your reactions to this talk?
What's your thoughts about it?
What's your questions?
Yes?
What's the Buddhist attitude towards having stolen once or lying once
or God forbid, killed once?
There's a variety of things that Buddhist resources might point to.
One is that rather than feeling guilt about something,
the point would be to be forward-looking
and not linger in the past in order to feel guilty and bad,
but look into the future about how you can do better in the future,
how you can avoid doing those things in the future,
how you can maybe be compassionate and be helpful in society
rather than, you know, something like that.
I know some of you might have read it to around Palo Alto,
but there was this young 17-year-old boy who was killed in a car accident
about, I think it'd be two weeks ago, Saturday, I think.
And his best friend was driving the car.
They were apparently speeding,
phenomenal speed going up into the mountains, I think.
And maybe he was passing someone,
maybe passing in a curve or something, and they ran into a truck.
And the driver survived amazingly.
And we ended up at the hospital a little bit, but basically we'll be fine.
And his best friend, who was next to him in the passenger seat, died.
And at the, I'm not sure if it was a funeral, but one of the first things
that the father of the dead boy said was, as I was told,
was, there's no blame here.
That's a kind of amazing thing.
The first thing, because he's taking care of other people,
taking care of himself and everyone, there's no blame here.
You can imagine how that father would feel, you know,
and his son was killed basically by someone.
There's no blame here.
And the next thing he said was, I don't know if the next thing he said,
but what part of what I was told he did was he set up a fund,
kind of like a scholarship fund or something, a little foundation, I guess,
to have money in it, in his son's name to offer people scholarships.
I don't know exactly what it was.
And then he made, I don't know who all the people are who became the board
of that foundation, but the boy who was driving was put on the board.
And how I know this is that one of our Sangha members' daughter
was these two boys' best friend.
She was supposed to be in the car, but something happened.
She couldn't be there.
And there were two best friends with these two boys.
One was distraught, and he put her on the board, too.
And so here, part of this legacy of this guy is that, you know,
they're not just simply feeling their grief, but they're also, you know,
thinking about how they can continue the spirit of this boy who died into the future.
I can take his goodness, in a sense, and do goodness, do good into the future for it.
So, to be forward-looking in some way,
depending on what the person's done, we have to be very honest and look,
are those forces within us still there?
The force to lie or to steal or to kill, are they still in there?
Are we likely to do it again?
And then the Buddhist approach would be, try to work on those forces within us.
Either try to uproot them, or try to develop yourself in such a way
that they no longer have any force over you.
Another thing a person might do is, depending on the magnitude of what happened,
it might be necessary to make some kind of amends.
One of the most powerful things to do is act of confession.
And it could be to go to someone who feels a confidential confessor.
So I'm saying, you know, I need to tell someone about this,
because unless I tell someone about it, I'm going to hold it inside of myself,
and I want someone else to be the witness that I know that I did this,
I know that it's wrong, and I'm committing myself not to do it anymore.
And sometimes I kind of confession really necessary in order to kind of,
kind of a ritual of turning the corner.
Sometimes it's necessary to go back and apologize to someone.
I've known many people who started a meditation practice
in memories of 20 years ago, what they said to someone comes up.
They haven't thought about it for 20 years.
And there's a feeling that in order for the spiritual life to deepen any further,
the person has to go somehow back to that person and apologize.
And to call them up and, you know, remember me? No.
Well, I want to, anyway, that's okay.
I want to apologize for what I said once.
And if it's the fact that, you know, if someone's killed,
then the amends, you know, might take much more serious forms.
It might be that if a person's, you know, I don't know, you know,
it might take, you know, it might mean going to jail, willingly go to jail.
It's what I need to do or something.
And not for other people's sake, but because it really was necessary
in order to somehow do something for oneself and to write what's there to make amends.
I was very touched many years ago when I saw the movie Gandhi.
And I don't know if this is a true story in the movie,
you know, a lot of the movie was based on truth.
Near the end of his life, I guess after the independence of India,
there's these Muslim-Hindu riots going on.
And it's a very difficult time for India.
And Muslims are killing Hindus and Hindus are killing Muslims.
And Gandhi goes off to some place where a lot of this rioting is happening.
Try to stop it.
And he encounters a...
I forget exactly what it is, but I think he encounters a Muslim
who comes to him for counsel.
And the Muslim says something like,
I've killed.
I've killed someone.
I've killed him in the rioting or whatever.
I killed a Hindu child or I killed someone.
And, you know, what should I do?
And Gandhi says,
find an orphaned Hindu child.
This is a Muslim he's talking to.
Find an orphaned Hindu child and raise him as a Hindu.
And, you know, the shock and dismay in this Muslim's face,
you know, just because of what that means.
But I guess in my understanding of that, Gandhi had some sense
in order for this man to be healed from what he had done,
he had to atone for it.
He had to make amends in some way that was very powerful.
And the only way he could do that was to raise someone,
one way I meant only way,
was to do something like to raise someone else in that religion
that he had killed people at him.
You know, make them personally a good Hindu or understand.
So that idea, you know, sometimes you have to make amends to what we've done.
So there's a whole series of things, you know, answers to your question,
depending on the magnitude of it.
If, you know, if you finally realize, it's been 30 years ago
that we did something horrible,
and you realize that your heart's completely transformed and changed in that time,
then there's a different response that's needed,
a different thing that happens, perhaps.
Does this make sense, what I'm saying?
Is this a satisfying answer?
So, is the notion of confession embodied in Buddhism?
It occurs in Buddhism.
Is there a procedure for it?
Well, in terms of a procedure, there is for the monastics.
The monastics have a particular, they go to another monastic,
and,
I would like to confess my transgressions,
and then there's a whole way in which they do that.
For lay people, there's no particular procedure that's been laid down,
but there is the understanding that acknowledging one's transgressions
to someone that you respect,
and really making clear to that person,
I've done this, I don't believe in this,
and I'm now committing myself not to do this again.
That little thing is something which is, you know,
understood to be very, very important and effective.
It's not codified in any way.
It's kind of in the wisdom tradition,
and you can pick that up if you'd like,
and you don't find Buddhism saying you should do this,
but it's there.
And then you have to find the person to do it for.
And if you've killed someone,
especially if it's recently,
then there's all these issues of confidentiality,
and it gets a little bit more complicated in our society,
but it was a long time ago.
I met someone, I met a few people in my life
who came to me and told me they had killed someone.
And both people, they were soldiers,
they both had to do with World War II.
So at the time they told me it was long after,
one was a soldier,
and one was a person who went through concentration camps
in Indonesia.
Japanese captured the Dutch
and put them in concentration camps.
And when he was released,
and he was treated awfully,
and many people were,
and there was one particular prison guard.
And it was awful, a torture or whatever.
And when the war was over,
and all the Japanese were being sent back to Japan,
him and his buddies went and found that guy
and killed him in cold blood.
And I don't know if I'm telling you this,
but it was so long ago,
and I didn't know what to say.
He wasn't coming to me as a Buddhist teacher.
He was actually a kind of acquaintance,
a distant family friend, people I know.
And he was telling me his story.
And I was, you know,
what do you say to someone who said they've killed someone?
I just let him continue his story as he developed.
It was so long ago.
But you know, it didn't sit right with me
that he just told it matter of factly
and then moved on with the rest of the story,
even though it was so long ago.
And even though he thinks,
feels like he had just cause, you know, it was really necessary.
Yes?
A few things.
One is, I appreciate the idea of restraining yourself
as a way of liberation.
I don't follow that.
So then we don't have to have everything, you know.
I like that idea.
But I feel like, well, I have two things.
One is, I get angry fast,
especially when somebody's in my face.
And I don't, I just,
I have an example.
There was a little car,
but somebody was driving,
and she got out of the car and opened the door
and hit the guy's car near us,
you know, just by opening the door.
And he was furious, just furious.
And I got furious back again,
just furious at me.
But I feel like I've done all this work.
And I, it's still kind of boring,
the button's pushed, and, you know,
if somebody would be yelling at me here,
now, after I've meditated, I'm fine.
I'm gonna be really cool, you know.
But when I'm surprised,
or even when I'm teaching,
but when I'm surprised by it,
I might as well be two years old again.
And I'll smash the guy's face.
And all that energy just is there,
regardless of my years of meditating.
And I know just that.
Has it improved over the years you meditated,
or no difference?
No, it has improved with aging.
Oh, the aging?
But I don't want to hurt other people for a moment.
I forget.
I just respond.
I think that, I mean, there's a...
It's one thing to meditate.
It's another thing.
A whole other thing, actually much more difficult,
and actually maybe the more important part
of all this spiritual life,
is to take what you feel in meditation,
the sense of calm, or the sense of integrity,
or the sense of being mindful and sensitive and attentive,
and to try to live that way in daily life.
And some people kind of are quite dedicated to meditation,
but as soon as they get up,
they forget that about the whole stuff,
and they go off and do their life,
and you get very busy very quickly.
But what does it take to be settled in yourself,
so that when you go into any kind of situation,
you're not surprised by anything?
I remember when I was a Zen student,
we would sit, you know, in Zazen for many hours,
and one of the Zen teachers had a custom of going around,
and sometimes would come and adjust your posture,
and you'd come up from behind you,
and very gently, he was very gentle,
he feels compassion.
Just very gently lay his hands on your back first,
and warn you there,
and then kind of make the adjustment to your posture,
so you sit up straighter.
And he would...
It was very interesting that when I was present,
really present and settled in myself,
he could come up,
I had no idea he was coming up, sneaking up on me,
and I'd feel that hand,
and I would just feel soft,
just like the hand was going into cotton.
If I was lost in my thoughts,
and he came up and touched me,
then I'd be startled.
So one of the things to study,
is what does it take to be more settled
in a deeper way in daily life?
And do you want to?
Is it high enough priority or value for you
to really take what...
to have that being settled or being at peace
throughout your day,
that you might have in meditation?
If you're relying on osmosis,
that you do meditate,
that has effect the rest of your day,
then that's great.
But if you really want to take the spiritual discipline
to heart in a very deep way,
it has to be more than that.
You have to go and start meditating daily life,
in a sense.
And then to study, for example,
what is it that the world's experience
is hitting inside of you?
If you come along a situation,
and something happens,
and something happens,
you're only going to react
if that strikes something here in you.
If it doesn't strike anything,
in a sense it goes right by.
And that's maybe after you meditate,
maybe you're that way.
What is it that it strikes?
And there's a very important investigation to be done
to explore what is it that's there
before you get angry.
That is already a wall,
or a button, or a trigger, we say.
What is it?
And to really spend a lot of careful time
discovering what that is
that's before you get angry.
And then begin to take some responsibility for that
and work on it and see,
what can you do about that,
so that to settle it,
so it doesn't get in the way.
Is this speaking to you?
Yes, I'm very willing to try it.
I spoke to somebody who was a monk
at Plum Village,
and he said,
he felt there was no way
to lead a normal life,
like nine to five kind of job,
or whatever, something like that,
and for him to keep his heart open,
and that's why he went to Plum Village.
And I was really struck by that,
because the pacing of our lives,
here, you know,
driving somewhere, or tired,
or cranky, it's too hot,
it's too much traffic,
you know, I mean, all these little things,
so anyway.
So it's true, so sometimes
we have to make behavioral change.
Some people think they can just kind of live their life
and then add this wonderful thing to it and make everything.
Sometimes we have to have behavioral change
in order to be sane enough to
get enough exercise in order to be,
you know, if you don't get enough exercise,
then it's easy to be triggered by all kinds of things.
So some behavioral change is really necessary.
It's unreasonable not, you know, to...
And then it has a lot to do with
what your highest intentions are,
or your deepest intentions.
And then it's one thing to know what they are,
and then it has a lot to do also
with the strength of that intention,
the strength of motivation
to live by that.
A lot of people have deep intentions,
lofty intentions,
but there's no strength behind it.
They're really going to live by it and act by it.
If a person's intentions are strong,
they really want to act on it,
I think almost any situation,
a lay life, 95 job,
it can be done.
Good luck. I wish you well, really.
So let's take the last two minutes
and just sit quietly
and compose yourself
before you get in your cars.
So thank you very much,
and I wish you a wonderful week.
