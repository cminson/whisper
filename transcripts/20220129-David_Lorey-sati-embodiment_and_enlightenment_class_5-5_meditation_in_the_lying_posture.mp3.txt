And now we'd like to do another period in a less energetic posture.
Yeah, so now we'd like to do a little sitting, as it were, a little meditation, a little cultivation of mindfulness directed to the body in the prone posture, the lying down posture.
And as Kim and Ying have indicated earlier today, these postures, these postures, we may find useful for different, for different aspects of our practice, they open, they make available different ways of understanding the body.
And they also are, we'll find for each of us at various times, a good fit for activity in the mind, or physical pain, or discomfort.
They tend to be very effective in alternation simply because they keep, they keep our, they keep some alertness.
So we highly recommend, I think I can speak for all the four of us, sort of experimenting, making this part of the adventure, not getting too stuck with one posture.
Each of them take a little learning or a little getting used to, that may feel very strange to stand, for example, at first.
The lying down posture can be very effective to when the mind is really busy.
There are people, myself included, who, if the mind is busy, find that walking, and even sitting are postures associated with problem solving solution finding.
Lying down, for me, one of my main postures.
I love them all. I don't think I have a favorite.
Lying down is a posture not associated for me with puzzling things out.
And so it can be one that's very conducive to settling into a different aspect of the body.
I'm going to try to demonstrate the lying down postures. And hopefully, I have a soft voice, hopefully, you'll be able to hear me as I do some demonstration.
I want to demonstrate because one of the risks of the lying down posture is becoming drowsy and falling asleep.
Maybe experimenting with a lying down posture will be easier if you don't do it in places you associate with sleep or napping.
Find a good surface that is maybe a place you don't associate with rest, and it'll keep you more awakeful.
There are two classic postures, one of them we find in the text, and ways to keep alert with them.
Hopefully, you can see this.
I did experiment with this, and we'll see if this works.
So you can lie down
like this.
I'm getting a thumbs up from Diana.
So you can lie down with this, and you'll notice I should have worn light colored pants, but my knees are up.
And you can lie down with your knees up without your knees touching
so that
so that if you become drowsy,
one knee will fall us to one side.
And that will bring you back to wakefulness.
With the knees up like this, also good for the small of the back, of course, or with the knees down.
A classic approach to the lying down meditation is to put one hand up like this.
And this too, when drowsiness happens, if it happens, the arm will fall one direction or the other.
Some people additionally hold an object in their hands.
And as the body relaxes, the object will fall.
And these can keep you wakeful.
The classic posture we read about in the suttas is called the lion's posture.
I have a Buddha in the posture.
And this is one where you lie on your side
and kind of stack your knees and your feet on top of one another.
You can hold your hand with one hand like this, or you can lie all the way down.
If you do it like this, again, you can raise your lower hand
so that it will fall if you become drowsy.
So take one of these postures to experiment with.
You can have fun with this.
And I think you'll find there are a couple of things that are very nice about this posture
as you settle into it.
So go ahead and take a lying down posture if you want.
Feel you need to, any place you can hear my voice, any place that's comfortable.
You can lie on your back, lie on your side.
And feel free to turn your video off if that makes it more comfortable to move around.
And I'll just give a little guidance that maybe you'll find useful for the lying down meditation.
Feel free to continue sitting if you want and give this a try at another time.
I'm actually going to guide the brief portion here at the beginning sitting up so that you can hear my voice.
I'll then lie down and join you on the floor.
But again, bringing the eyes down.
And a particular aspect of the lying down posture that is powerful
is the way it shifts our weight in the body and puts us into greater contact
at several points with the earth, with the floor, with the ground.
It's a posture in which it's possible to feel additionally grounded.
You can notice the subtle pressure of weight at different points against the floor.
And maybe noticing at each of these points the feeling of gravity holding us firmly to the planet.
The breath to may feel different lying down.
Either end of the breath between the inhalation and the exhalation and between the exhalation and the next in breath
can be a wonderful sense of greatest ease.
The body is apparently most most at ease in these two pauses.
And the lying down posture really provides access to this this greatest physical ease that we
that the body can know.
Many practitioners find that the lying down posture also can lead to a very expansive feeling throughout the body.
And the body is freed as it were from the routine responsibility of maintaining balance, whether that's in the walking, the standing or the sitting posture.
Our awareness can spread out in a rather different way through the body.
Once we sense that the mindfulness or the samadhi that become available in these postures is each of them of a different quality and the lying down posture can open our mindfulness up in a broad open way.
The lying down posture can open our mindfulness up in a broad open way.
Possibly you may also notice that the lying down posture opens easily into some of the pleasant or pleasurable aspects of the meditation, the seclusion that we experience in the meditation from daily life.
Secluded here from distractions, even that of keeping the body aloft, keeping the body balanced.
Sometimes we can be more attentive in an alert way to the pleasantness of the ease in the body as we lie in the prone position.
We may be aware of feelings of well-being. Sometimes these are active feelings of tingling or pleasantness and sometimes a more general sense of well-being, of warmth, of contentment.
The lying down posture can open easily into a place of equanimity or clarity in our attention, in the mindfulness we cultivate in these postures.
And we cultivate these things, we strengthen them, we learn the path simply by paying attention.
When we notice ease, we notice available openness, we notice some clarity. When we notice those things, we cultivate them, we strengthen them.
Noticing can be a very soft touch.
Maybe it's a labeling of experience, but maybe it's just some curiosity.
Just shining the light of attention on our experience of the body in this posture.
Maybe we notice here that the body in the lying down posture without the rigidity of the other postures, without the motion or energy field of the standing or walking.
Maybe in this posture we notice that the boundaries of the body are a little less important, a little less relevant. The body can kind of spread out and be at ease.
Thank you for watching.

So in this lying down posture, the mind may also wander.
Perhaps in this posture it's more prone to daydream, causing this haziness of thoughts.
As in the other postures, we can gently tug attention back to the breath, to the weight of the body touching the ground in its various points of pressure.
We can return attention to the pleasantness of the meditation experience, having taken this time away, this pleasure born of the seclusion from the usual concerns and tasks of us,
householders,
being present for these experiences in and of the body,
not holding on to them either.
Thank you for watching.

So welcome back.
And Diana.
