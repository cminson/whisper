 So as we begin this sitting, I'd like to say a few words about the heat as part of the meditation practice. I find it actually quite helpful, not necessarily pleasant when it's hot, because it places me in my body and reminds me that the locus of practice is in my body. I feel my body, I feel very much the sense of contact of the heat against my skin and my body. And maintaining a continuity of attention with the body is very helpful in meditation. It's all too easy for us to drift off into our thoughts and our ideas. The art of being with the body as it's hot in meditation is to be very attentive, that you don't get carried away with your opinions about the heat, your attitude about the heat, which is very different than the heat itself. And you might find that it actually serves you, helps you to stay more connected to your breath or your body as you breathe, as you stay mindful. It keeps you kind of like the heat comes in a container that holds you in place here and now in this body, as opposed to not having the container in the mind carries you away to distant places. If the body is, if the heat seems too oppressive or difficult, an alternative way of meditating, which some of you might even do, is when you follow the breath, is to follow the breathing at the nostril. So you feel, you feel the sensations of the air coming in through your nostril and out through your nostril. And by doing that, usually it's a little bit cooler, especially on the in-breath, than sometimes how we feel the temperature in the rest of our body. And if we focus on that place in the body, we both focus on maybe a little bit of coolness or the tingling sensations of the air. But also, the more focused you can be, the less you're connected to your torso and other places where you might feel the heat in an oppressive way. To be at the tip of your nose or at the tip of your kind of lip below your nostril holes can be, you know, can almost take you away from the sense of being oppressively hot. So the preferred way is just to be with the heat and not be troubled by it. But if that doesn't work, then you could try just being with the nostrils. In either case, it's helpful at the beginning of a sitting to take a few, to close your eyes softly, and then to take a few long, slow, deep in-breaths. And the deep in-breaths can be used to feel the body from the inside, to let the body expand, to connect to it. And then as you exhale, exhaling a little more fully than usual, let the exhale relax you. Exhaling your shoulders, your belly, different parts of your body. Taking long, slow, deep breaths at the beginning in a conscious way begins turning the stream of your mental thought, your mental activity towards the meditation itself, consciously picking up the breath, the body. And it can be helpful to make a decision to turn the attention of the mind away from its mind thought, thinking, and mind talk and chatter, preoccupation's concerns of the day. To turn away from that and just feel what's happening in the body and be with the breath, and let all the activity of the day settle away, letting the traces of the day's activities that appear in your body, to let them slowly in their own time to dissipate. And then after a series of deep in-breaths, then let the breath be normal, no special effort to breathe in any way. Then turn your attention over to the breath, hand your attention to your breath, turn yourself over to your breathing as if your breathing is your best friend, your best ally, and you can entrust yourself to the simple experience of breathing as totally and completely as you can, consciously breathing in, consciously breathing out. When the mind gets cut up or carried away in stream of thinking, very gently, but consciously and clearly begin again with your breathing, letting everything else go, trusting that it's okay just to be present for breathing and nothing else, nothing that you need to figure out, nothing you need to remember, nothing you need to plan, no conversations you have to repeat. Let go of it all for these half an hour and let this best friend of yours, the breath, feel the half an hour.
