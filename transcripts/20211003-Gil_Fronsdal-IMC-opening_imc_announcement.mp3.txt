 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay, so welcome to our community meeting. And I was looking forward to this, the concept of an IMC community meeting brings me much happiness. And it just feels like it's such a wholesome thing, and the F is gathering. I look forward to the day that we can have a community meeting in person. But for now, this is what we can do. But I think that the opening is in sight. And I feel a little bit tentative about it because this COVID-19 times are so uncertain what will happen. So, you know, it's even conceivable we'll have to change our mind on short notice or sometime in the future close and with no notification at all, if it just rears up. And that's how the pandemic for us started. In a sense, we were doing a Saturday day-long retreat. And that morning, we decided that we had to close. We couldn't open because of the COVID back in March of 2020. And as people showed up and we said, I'm sorry, we're not meeting. So it seems like this situation now is maybe different than how it was even in August when we were thinking of opening then in different kind of way. It feels like it's appropriate to be more careful in the opening. And so this is what the plan is currently, is that we'll open for only people who are vaccinated. And I feel very apologetic for people who are not that you're not able to come. I know some people, I mean, it's unfortunate to have that kind of maybe available some or not to others. And I'd be very happy to try to figure out something to do for the unvaccinated. And maybe at some point we can have a meeting outdoors in the parking lot just to meet and talk or do something together. But I don't think we can open at all if we were going to open to everyone. So it's a way of opening. And we still have everything that we offer, what we're opening up now to do, like I'm doing. We continue with offering things on YouTube. And so that'll continue as before. So they still have access that way, especially those people living far away. And so everyone will be vaccinated, has to be vaccinated, and with what's considered full vaccination. And that depends on the vaccine people have had. There's different meanings of what that means. The J, it's one shot. The Pfizer Moderna, it's two shots. And I think at this point the preference would be that you even had three shots. But we know that some people are not accessible to them yet. But I think I had my booster shot last week because the nursing home, the memory care home where my mother lives, and they're very keen to have the family members who visit regularly be fully vaccinated as possible because in April of 2020, the beginning of COVID, they lost 10 residents to COVID back then. So they're still living with the pain of having people they were cared for under their care dying from COVID. So they're very careful. So they offered. And so I accepted because I want to also be careful with their residents. So everybody has to be vaccinated. And we want to have the proof of the vaccination. So because of that, we're setting up a registration system. And that registration system is, it'll be in the primary place you'll find this, is in the What's New section of IMC's website. So if you don't know IMC's website well, please at least peruse the homepage because the calendar is there. And what's new is really the main place we have for making announcements. And so you should be familiar with that to know how to look at it regularly. And there's an announcement a little bit there that repeats what I'm going to try to tell you here today. And so I don't know if the links are still there yet, but at some point the links to the registration process will be available. And so registration, what that involves is letting us know your email address and also for you to post a photograph of your vaccine card. So we have proof that you're fully vaccinated. And we'll review that to make sure that that's the case. And I think it's helpful for people coming to know that we're doing this kind of reviewing, that we're making sure, do the best we can to make sure that this is possible. And people come here more relaxed knowing that we're being careful, that careful. Once we've reviewed that you've been fully vaccinated, then you'll be on an email list. That's why we need your email address. And I propose you use an email address that you actually check regularly. Some people don't want to give away email addresses, make up ones or have like, you know, extra ones, but they never check it. So and then it adds complications. And what we'll do is we'll send out then an email periodically with the dates that we decide to be open. And and that's that you're the only people who are going to get those dates because we don't want the general public to know it or other people who know it to know it, who are not vaccine hasn't gone through this process. And the poor volunteers who have to stand by the door and check who's coming that you have actually signed registered and signed up for it. It's not a nice thing for our volunteers to just talk to someone and say, you know, I'd like to get in, you know, and you can't come because you're not registered. And then who knows where that conversation goes. So if you read, if you register, that's how you'll get know that have the dates for the different things. And when we open and there'll be a block of things you can sign up for maybe three weeks at a time or whatever we have up to that point, what we decided to do. And and so you get an email with that and that also provide you a link to a sign up system. And that way we can keep the number. We're going to keep the numbers at a certain threshold for now. And so we're going to start with opening on a Sunday and we're going to limit the sign ups to twenty five people. And we think that makes a nice fine way of number of people to be here and I am see for an event and that. So and the sign up system we have, it's clear if there's any spaces and if there's no spaces, then, you know, you didn't sign up in time. And we'd like people to only sign up for one time in those the block of time that's being offered because we want other people, everyone to have a chance. If a couple of days before the actual event starts, there's still blank spaces, then you're welcome to sign up for more than one during that block. But but, you know, sign up for one and then just wait before you sign up for more. And and because we're going to have twenty five people here at a time and because that's not a lot compared to what we usually have done for Sunday morning, we're actually going to have two sessions. And the first session will be from eight to nine in the morning. And and that and that'll be a 40 minute period of meditation and a 20 minute question and answer period with myself. I'm the one who's scheduled at the beginning. So I'll be the teacher of the first rounds of this. And and so that's that'll be it for one hour sitting together and then a Q&A. And then we're hoping and we're going to encourage this the best and most wholesome way we can. You're going to be inspired to leave quickly through the back door by the kitchen and then you and maybe even do so in silence so that you really leave because once people start talking, you know, it's hard to do anything but talk. And so you can talk then when you get out in the parking lot. But but in that way, we can have a smooth transition because there'll be people out on the porch waiting to come in. And we don't want you to run into the early people to run into the later people because it turns out some of you will know each other. And then you'll stand in the door and nothing will happen. It'll be a bottleneck and stuck and you'll be talking and you have to catch up for the year and a half and and the whole system will kind of fall apart and unravel and will never manage. So I'm hoping everyone will cooperate with this system that the people coming for 925 sitting will patiently wait outside in front of the building and don't interfere with the people at eight o'clock who are who are coming for the eight o'clock sitting who leave through the back door. So that's the plan. And so two events, both of them for 25 people. And I think the final thing to say is that a few things to say is that masks will be required the whole time you're here. And and and to inspire that, try to find a nice mass to meditate in. I meditated. I taught a retreat in person retreat in August where all the the whole of which was done outdoors and sleeping and everything was done outdoors camping. And and I wore a mask during part of it for the meditation and I actually enjoyed it, believe it or not. I found it was a way of understanding how to do that. That was actually beneficial for my meditation. And so specifically for me, what happened was that I let my mouth be much more open than usual and breathe through my mouth more than I usually do because the mask kept the humidity nicely there. So my mouth didn't dry out and I kind of thought it was different and the different was kind of nice. And so so so if you're resisting the idea of the mask meditating when you mask, think again and be creative. Look for a different mask, but to get a good quality mask, my preferences would be you got an N95. They're easy to get now or I have one that's a KN95 that I really feel comfortable wearing. I like it kind of except for what it does for the years. But for an hour I can manage my years. And then the let's see. And then in terms of being here, there are some changes you should know about. So you feel comfortable coming here. We have some four strong, big portable air purifiers, blue, blue air that are very good. And and when they're on the first setting, lowest setting, they're pretty quiet. And so I think during the meditation, we have a lowest setting and other times having them in a higher setting just so we clearing the air. We also can have the air, the HVAC system has a fan that circulates here. And in the past, it only circulated indoor air, which is not helpful for us. But now it's also has a we put in an event that brings fresh air into the HVAC system and mixes it with the internal layer, still using internal layer, but it mixes it now. So there is a steady bringing in fresh air into the building that way. So there is we'll have that fan on and without bringing in fresh air. We can also have some doors open and we'll have windows open and different things. So I think that between the air purifiers and the fan and outdoor air and whatever else ways in the masks, I'm pretty confident that it's very, very, you know, it's about as safe as it gets for people who are fully vaccinated. It seems responsible enough or appropriate enough to to make it work this way. And it does seem like, you know, one of the views of how this whole COVID thing is going to unfold into the future is we are going to have to learn how to accommodate it as opposed to feel that where it's once and for all it's over. So this is, you know, finding like finding our way. And and hopefully over the next weeks and months, we'll we can shift that that process. And so maybe it'll feel appropriate to have more people come and different things. I kept saying one more thing, but here's one more thing. And I haven't decided what we haven't decided what to do about the Dharma teacher speaking. I know that it's some Dharma centers when they've opened that everyone's mask, except for the teacher during the Dharma talk. And so we'll see. I'll experiment and see if I can find a mask or so that I can speak clearly with a mask on. But if not, maybe it's OK for I don't know if it's OK enough for me to be unmasked while I give a talk and people don't just sit near me or something. I don't know what to do about that, but it's it's it's a concern of what to do about that. And I could practice enunciating bigger, better for a while, put pebbles in my mouth and give Dharma talks and see if I get clearer and clearer. So even with a mask. So that's I think that's what the plan is as far as I can present it here. And and do you have any question? Oh, someone asks in the chat about Plexiglas. The reputation that's been happening lately is that Plexiglas apparently doesn't really work, doesn't really do much, even at stores where they're going on. Apparently, they just everything just kind of tumbles over and goes around and it doesn't really apparently doesn't do as much much as they hoped. They shields. Yeah. So that's what that's what the latest I've been reading about is that people don't put a lot of emphasis on them. But I could if people preferred me to wear a face mask, a shield, I could do that. And so. So. So there's people putting questions in the chat, I guess I can maybe I can try to answer those. So social distancing. Yeah. So we're going to set up the meditation hall. It's actually set up a little bit that way now for people who are starting to experiment with how to do it. So there's like six feet distance between people. So it was twenty five people. It works pretty well to set up the hall with distancing. And if a couple comes, I don't know if they're better off sitting next to each other close in and creating more space for everyone else around them or whether it's. Oh, the couple's coming. The thing about couples, they each need to sign up separately. It's our system registrations to mix it too hard with one one one person to sign up for both of them. So so hopefully you should be on computers at the same time and be sure you both get a spot. Those of us from a distance be able to join on Zoom or on YouTube. Yes. The what we're talking about now is not retreats, but rather what we're doing here at I.M.C. and I.M.C. will be available. Whatever I do, it's planning to continue doing it on Zoom. So Sunday morning will still be on Zoom now on Zoom, on YouTube will be on YouTube. And there'll be no difference, except there might be people walking in front of the camera periodically. So there's that. So, yes, the will the in-person sessions will be on YouTube and they'll be live. Yes. Those of us not on a computer savvy, will there be instructions of how to send photo of vaccination card? Hopefully, hopefully that becomes pretty clear. And any plans for I.R.C. Yeah, we're still planning to open I.R.C. for or start our in-person retreats on November 14th and then keep going. Nothing else changes. It doesn't it. Covid doesn't get worse. We'll just keep all the everything is scheduled to be opened. We'll continue. And for that, we have our protocol for how to be it there and including including, you know, certainly only for people who are vaccinated, a PCR test before coming and antigen test when you arrive and an antigen test at I.R.C. two or three days into the retreat. And there we're kind of behind the curve in terms of opening as a retreat center. Spirit Rock has opened. I.M.S. was supposed to be opened by now, but they didn't have enough staff to open. So they're planning to open in I think in November, but they would have opened earlier, but all their staff kind of left and they couldn't get him back in time to start up again. Cloud Mountain is open and the various retreat centers already open. We're kind of late to open. So which I don't mind that we're late. What time was this is the second session on Sundays? So the second session will be the usual time that we have for the for the for the nine twenty five sitting starts at nine twenty five. And we'll open the door at nine fifteen for you to come in, provided that the earlier people have followed the very inspiring and wholesome protocol of silently leaving immediately. So and for now, we're just opening up on Sundays and and then after we've been open once or twice and just seen how that went, then we're going to just consider what other things we might be able to open for. And and and that won't be so that won't be it will not be publicly announced for now, but rather it'll be something that be announced to the people who registered. So even if you can't come Sundays, if you're interested in what becomes available in the future, register. And so you get that information. Yeah, the registration should be able to be up very soon the next day or two. So and that you'll find that under what's new section of IMS use website. And I'm getting so many chats now that I probably skipping some of the early ones. And I think that you need to do a little bit more than that in order to get the results, be sure to get the results before you come. And so probably you should do it, you know, four or five days. Usually sometimes the results take three days. If they're guaranteed to be faster, you can, you know, closer to the retreat, the better. But you want to you can't get into the retreat without the results. Other registration is now open, it says. So it's up and available. So you don't have to rush to register because. But you can rush to. Yeah. There are people with hands up. Okay. So thank you, Jim, for letting me know. So let me maybe it moved to the people whose hands are up. And I think the first one is Jan and Barry. Hi, everybody. Good to see all your faces. Gil, did you want us to announce this idea of the Sangha Zoom meetings? Yes, I didn't reply to your last email about it because it's hard for me to be involved in all these details about what to do. So if you would take responsibility for figuring that out, maybe with the help of Hillary, that would be great. But I might make your announcement. It was great. It's a good time for it. For those of you who have been coming to work coming to IMC on Sundays and have missed the time after the Dharma talks when we would gather to share our thoughts about the Dharma talks and, you know, have practice discussions and just socialize. Barry and I are going to offer a zoom meeting after each Sunday Dharma talk for all of us to just meet together and talk and have some breakout groups. Just a chance to, you know, have a feeling of Sangha some more than we already do. So we'll send out an announcement that will be probably on the website with our zoom address and come one, come all to connect with each other. Great. Thank you. And that's wonderful. Also for the people who never could come to IMC in person that you know, you can also be part of that community that way. So thank you, Jan and Barry very much for offering to do that. And I am really happy about it. So thank you. So that'll start next week. It will start next week. Great. So let's go either. If I don't remember to announce it somehow tell me and I don't know how to get my attention and on YouTube and you know, but I'll try to announce it. And so, Don, this is going back to an earlier thread you talked about. I just wanted to check my understanding is the HVAC system itself also has a filter. Oh, yeah, this I didn't say that we got a very high quality air filter for the HVAC system. So when the air in the air, an internal air goes and filters through it actually filters it out very high quality. We have a number of filtration systems, but the raw filter itself is I think it's a MERV 14, which is considered very high. And we have two, we actually have two HVAC systems, one for the outer hall and one for the inner meditation hall. And both of them have fans and both of them have this high quality. So we'll turn those on and be circulating the air that way too. I'm really impressed with how carefully this has been thought out and dealt with. One notion that I've seen at other places that seems to work well for the teacher or the speaker is to have a stand alone blue air right by the speaker. And that way everything emitting from their mouth gets filtered before it gets very far away from them. Great, great. Thank you again. So then we have Nancy. Thank you. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up. There have been a number of people calling about the day longs that are. Oh, yes. Saturday are still on the calendar. Could you address that? Thank you. Yeah, I've been meaning to get to the calendar to take it off. But, you know, I'm challenged with all kinds of ways. And so, yeah, so they're on the 16th of October. There was supposed to be a day long. And and we're not going to do that in person and I don't want to do it on Zoom. So it's not happening. So I'll take it off. Maybe when we finish here, I'll hopefully get to it. And and I don't know what else, but I'll look ahead in the calendar and see what's happening. And there's a lot of things that were left there from time we thought we could open. And so I'll update it. OK, thank you. Thank you. And then Steve. Either either folks on the tiny bit of an outside educator. I've been in person to MC and IRC and I've been on the seven o'clock things since the beginning. But I'm I have a question. I'm up in King County, Washington, because we're opening ours. And what I wanted to ask was the King County standards for religious groups are I'm vaccinated myself, by the way, but are that they're not just not requiring people to have people vaccinated or not, but everyone should wear masks. That's the standard up here. And I'm struggling with that because I know I can count six different people I know who are very alternative, super smart people who have chosen to not be vaccinated for intensely held reasons. And so under the heading of the Dharma and embracing everyone, I'm sort of leaning towards not requiring vaccines, but requiring masks in accordance with the King County because I don't exclude anybody. And it seems like one more aspect of that is, you know, we do know that people who are vaccinated can get sick and can transmit the virus, maybe not as much, but they still can. So it's all a matter of degree. Right. Which was your thinking about that? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. All this has been thought about. In fact, when we were going to open in August, it was just simply we weren't asking people to show their cards or we had requested that it only be people who are vaccinated. That was just a request that was kind of lightly held. And I imagine people would have showed up, you know, not adhering to that request who were not vaccinated. But the feeling then was before the understanding the Delta variant was that the danger was mostly to the person who was unvaccinated. And at some point, we have to figure out how to live with the risk. Is it more risky to drive on freeway 101 here than it is to get COVID and maybe then we're willing to live with their COVID risk. And so the people who are not vaccinated are doing so making their own choices, both whether or not to get vaccinated, but also whether or not to place in some situations when they might be exposed. And at some point, you know, we can't be responsible for people's choices that way. So that was kind of the original idea. But then with a Delta variant that is so much more transmissible and has a higher level of breakthrough cases and situation where the people who are vaccinated can be transmitters as well to some degree, it felt like we need to have a higher standard now to be careful. And so that's why we're going to be strict here about it. And, you know, and what other groups do, it's, you know, that they have to decide for themselves. But this is our decision now. So any other questions or concerns about all this? And as I said, the description of the process is on what's new on the website. And apparently the links are there now as well. I don't know exactly where they are, but to register. And hopefully the process is smooth. And I'm very grateful for all the volunteers who are making this possible. And they're volunteers who've set up the whole system of our station, which is quite an accomplishment. And volunteers are going to be checking it. And we're looking for volunteers for people who will be willing to be at the door. People come with the sheets and checking people off to make sure that only the registered people come and who signed up. And I suppose one of the perks of offering to be the person at the door to check people off is that then you're kind of guaranteed to get a spot. But it's also just it's also a very nice way, I suppose, if to say hello to everyone, you know, just briefly say, you know, make a connection to everyone. And if you know a lot of people, it's kind of nice as long as you don't slow the whole process down and the long line behind. And if you don't know much of people in our community, it's a quick way to kind of be at the center of it and then, you know, say hello to people and welcome them. So let's see. So. Looking at the chat now to see if there's any other thing question there. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for the volunteers. A big thanks for all the volunteers. It's a tremendous amount. You know how much our whole system is based on volunteers. And it's it's a part of the nourishment for everyone's practice for themselves. If the whole community that's nourished, be nourished by the goodness of people's generosity and goodwill. And this I hear Bill Kostura offers to volunteer at the door. And so this is the volunteer director. Hillary is the person who's kind of, I think, and Beverly Spiker and Hillary Borson are going to coordinating all this. So you need to somehow contact them and. Yeah. Who's the contact person? I am. See, email people have questions about the schedule, et cetera. I don't have it. I think that. I mean, right now it's you, Cindy, who are so. But you can ask. Certainly can ask Hillary Beverly first, maybe, and then you can ask me for questions. And that's probably where you would go. Thank you. Oh, there's a see there. Someone put it posted Hillary's volunteer email address. That's nice. I kind of love this. All everybody's participating here in different ways and together in this friendly way. And I'm certainly delighted to look forward to seeing you in person. And so. So is that a nice that we'd meet for about half an hour. So hopefully that's enough. And and and then we're not doing a breakout group today. And but to each other would be nice. But I have to go. And but next week, Jan and Barry will host a little social time together after the talk. And so thank you very much. Have a nice vacation. Yes. Thank you. So we can we can all unmute if you want and say goodbye to each other and thank you for this. Good policies. Thank you. Thank you. Bye everyone. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thank you. Bye. We everywhere. See everyone. Bye. Bye. So I could I didn't I wonder if there's people still on zoom. See so now I see there's people on zoom putting chat in there. If if you want to put in new chat I can maybe answer questions for you as well. If there is something that you. You're not seeing what's new section I'm sees website. So what's new. Yeah. He's on the column on the right. So lower right hand corner. There's a little like a box kind of thing and it says what's new. And now. And so. OK. I'm going to shut down all this. And now. Thank you for being part of it.
