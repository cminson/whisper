I'm going to offer a few remarks now, a little darmette, and if you'd like to stand up and
stretch a little bit or something after a little period of sitting, that's fine.
I'll begin speaking, but you could move yourself around so that you'll be able to be alert
and relax as you listen. That'd be great. So finding balance in our practice, that's
the theme I want to explore for today. The first thing to say about that is that it's
always a little bit different, you know, what's needed in order to come into balance. So as
I've been recommending during the sitting periods, it's really helpful to check in with
yourself. Also, during daily life, to check in with yourself as you go about your normal
tasks as well as in formal practice and ask, maybe, what might be needed at this time to
come into balance. If there's a need for it, you might be walking around completely balanced
feeling, present feeling, at ease, able to meet whatever arises. But a lot of the time,
I think we're maybe moving a little bit into straining, into hurrying, or a little bit
into distracting ourselves, or getting vague, and unconnected to what's going on. Sometimes
you want to feel, we might feel stressed about completing some project, or maybe starting
some project, and then we can just notice it, notice the effect on our state. Oh, I'm
a little bit tense here, I'm a little bit contracted. And then one thing that we can
do, a kind of antidote that we can apply when there's tension is to take what we call the
three breath journey. You might have heard of that before, it's something that's often
recommended. I think there's always time, whether we're at home doing tasks around the
house, or at work, if we're working in an environment with other people, to stop what
we're doing for one minute, you know, and take three deep breaths in order to settle,
to ground ourselves, takes less than a minute really. In our practice, and especially on
the cushion, I think it's really useful when we find there's tension in the mind, tension
in the body, to lengthen the exhalation, the out breath that engages the parasympathetic
nervous system, it's a way of calming the nervous system. When we're working on the
other side of the energy spectrum, you know, feeling kind of a lack of energy and inability
to focus, what helps me in that kind of situation is often to go outside, actually outdoors,
the weather allows that, maybe pull a few weeds or sweep a walkway, do something that
engages my muscles and kind of builds a little bit of energy in the body. Or in meditation,
when there's, when there's a kind of dopeyness, a lack of, a lack of focus, I might count
my breaths, that's something we often recommend, or stand up, if there's a lot of sleepiness,
a lot of an in heaviness in the, in the body and mind, something that helps me engage more
with what's happening, developing some curiosity, developing some interest, whatever sort of
state we find ourselves, that seems unbalanced, we can respond with a kind of antidote.
You know, there's a story that's often told about Ajahn Chah, who was a Thai meditation
master of the last century, a teacher of many of the senior teachers in our insight tradition.
And apparently, one time someone complained that he gave totally opposite advice to two
different students, you know, that his teaching was inconsistent, you know, inconsistent teacher.
And he replied that for him, teaching different people was a little bit like following them
down the road, or a path, we might say, use a Buddhist metaphor. If they veer right, you
know, you just give them a little push to the left. And if they veer left, you just
give them a little push to the right. It's about staying in the middle of the road, which
might spark your, your mind a little bit to bring up the idea of the middle way, which
is often seen as a kind of defining characteristic of the Buddhist path. And often this, this
middleness, the middle way is used as a way of defining the path, the Buddhist path as
neither ascetic nor indulgent, you know, a kind of balanced approach to the way we take
care of ourselves in our lives. But the implication of this middleness is really, it's very much
related to balance in lots of areas, not just in indulgence or asceticism. And there's
a sutra in the text that's often spoken of in reference to this, and probably many of
you have come across it before. It's the Sona Sutra. It's from the Angutra Nikaya, the story
of Sona and the Lute. So Sona was a monastic whose practice was not going very well, according
to him. And he was considering leaving the monastic life, going back to live with his
family. And the Buddha, who was far away at the time, apparently was able to read Sona's
mind. And it said he magically then appeared before him and spoke to him about his plan
to leave the, leave the monastic life. And this is part of the conversation. I'll read
part of the conversation. What do you think, Sona? When you were still a layman, weren't
you a good player of the lute? Yes, sir. When your lute strings were tuned too tight, was
it resonant and playable? No, sir. When your lute strings were tuned too slack, was it
resonant and playable? No, sir. But when your lute strings were tuned neither too tight
nor too slack, but fixed at an even tension, was it resonant and playable? Yes, sir. Then
the Buddha goes on to say, In the same way, Sona, when energy is too forceful, it leads
to restlessness. When energy is too slack, it leads to laziness. So, Sona, you should
apply yourself to energy and serenity, find a balance of the faculties, and learn the
pattern of this situation. That's a translation by Ajahn Sujato, who's an Australian monk
who has done a lot of translating. He's the founder of the site Suta Central, which is
a really great resource for if you like to look at the Buddhist texts and compare different
versions of them. So, his translation of this last phrase, learn the pattern of this situation,
the pattern of this situation. So, I really like that. I think, you know, what is appropriate
in this situation? Tune your effort to fit this moment. You know, sometimes more effort
is needed. Sometimes not much at all. Sometimes what we need to bring is more discernment.
Sometimes it's more care, more concern, more meta, and a balance of serenity and energy.
You know, a sweet spot in the middle, a balanced place. And of course, for me, this brings
up the teachings on wise effort, which is another, you know, another one of the teachings
that really focuses on a balance. The wise effort, of course, is one of the factors of
the Eightfold Path. And in that context, it has four parts, cultivating and maintaining
beneficial mind states. That's the first two parts. And then avoiding the arising and
letting go of or abandoning harmful mind states. That's the last two. So, we train the mind
to cultivate what is beneficial, what leads in the direction of peace, of freedom, spaciousness,
and then to let go of what takes us, and maybe others that we're interacting with, toward
more dukkha, toward less freedom. So, that's, that's, you know, a very simple explanation
of the four wise efforts. And in the wider context of the teachings, wise effort is not
only about cultivating beneficial mind states, but also about the quality of our effort,
the quality of our attention, the quality of our energy, what the Buddha was speaking
of when he was talking to Sona. So, tuning our energy to fit the situation, when we strain,
when we apply too much effort, when we move away from peace and spaciousness, we tighten
up, we contract. And I think often early in our meditation practice, people will focus
on their meditation object as if they were kind of drilling into it with their attention.
The object can seem so slippery sometimes that we just grab onto it, grab on tight.
But a mind that's really tightly focused on its object is in the long run, it's really
not so useful. So, we ease up, we open up, we're there, we're present, we know experience
as it is arising, but we don't need to bear down onto it. We don't, we allow it to unfold
and we receive its impressions. And then also, sometimes on the other end of the spectrum,
the mind sometimes is dozy, disconnected, vague, or scattered, restless. When it's
like that, you know, we can sense that more effort would be useful. We want to bring a
little interest, bring a little curiosity into the mind. We might count the breaths,
I mentioned earlier, we might count the breaths if the breath breathing is the anchor for
your practice. Might take the effort to consciously connect with each breath. That's another
thing that's often suggested. And there's a metaphor for that that I like. It's a roller
skating or ice skating, if you do that, if you live in a place where there's ice or
skiing, the practice of putting the whole foot down and then gliding, connecting with
the ground and then letting the connection unfold. We can do that with the breath. We
can do that with paying attention to physical sensations, to connect with the sensation
of breathing and then just stay connected for the full length of the breath. And then
again reconnect, just like skating, that kind of really rhythmic, kind of pleasant rhythm.
Staying present through the whole process and repeating again and again. That's a way
of developing a little bit more energy when that's needed. Staying connected. No matter
what's going on in our experience, we can always come back to awareness of just that.
What is going on? Just to ask ourselves even, what is going on? What's happening now? And
sometimes the conditions for that are really supportive, making it easy. Our life is quiet,
there's nothing much going on in our minds. We're not worrying about anything, anticipating
anything and it's quiet in our outer environment. We're lucky enough to find the Goldilocks
moment. It's not too hot and it's not too cold. Just right. But often in life it's not
like that. Sometimes there are many things going on in our lives that all seem to be
competing for our attention, sometimes very loudly. But even as things get complicated,
awareness, mindfulness, mindfulness can be our friend. It can help to keep us steady.
The breath can keep us connected to what's happening moment by moment, one single moment
at a time. We can take that three breath journey. We can connect with our sense of body and
space. We can remind ourselves that this is just how it is right now. We can meet the
moment with a kind awareness. These are all tools that we develop as we practice that
keep us in that help to keep us in a balanced posture, an internal steadiness.
When we approach our experience from a balanced place, not pushing it away when it's difficult
or struggling to hold on to it when it's delightful, we're creating the conditions for the clarity
of mindfulness to strengthen, moving in the direction of insight. This balance is a really
important piece of the path toward awakening, toward freedom.
Something important to recognize, our practice is not about striving to create some state
that seems desirable, but it's about asking right now what's needed, what's most beneficial
in order to keep me present, in order to keep my mind clear, awake. We look for what's
the most useful thing to do right now. I think in the poem that I read before the last meditation
session gives us some hints about that. What is appropriate in this moment? How do I meet
need by giving? How do I meet a burden by carrying it? How do I meet calm with peace?
That's what I have for this morning, a very brief little offering.
