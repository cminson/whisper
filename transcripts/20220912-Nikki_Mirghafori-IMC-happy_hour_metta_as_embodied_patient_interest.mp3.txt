 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There. Okay. Great. So, a warm, warm welcome to you all to happy hour. Lovely to be with you, to feel your presence in cyberspace. Welcome this moment in time. And the theme for our practice today. I'd like to invite us to explore the sense of interest, investigation, curiosity for resistance. So it's something very specific I'm pointing to. Let me unpack that. So, this practice I want to invite us to explore and pay close attention. It's not about thinking about the past or the future or circumstances in life. It's not a lot of thinking. It's not a thinking practice. What it is, it's about what is arising in this moment, right here, right now, in our bodies, in our hearts, in the emotional space, in the experiential space. It's not so much spinning out and thinking about things, but what is felt? What is known? What is known? And then, noticing if there isn't resistance, if there is a pushing away of reality, how it presents itself right now. And there could be some say unpleasantness in the body, unpleasantness in the emotional space, in the mind, in the thought space too, but again, present moment, let it be felt in the body. And then being curious, being really gently, lovingly curious about that resistance, about that pushing away. This curiosity is not about pushing away the pushing away. It's not about adding aversion to aversion, which gives it more power and it doesn't solve anything. But it's about releasing, or one might say healing, healing these nooks and crannies and edges of our hearts and minds that often hide, because we just push it away, we resist it, we don't want it to be this way. And then we fall into thinking, habitual pattern, problem solving. How do I do this? How do I shift and change my life, my relationships, my this, my that? It becomes, it became, it became tight. But to actually feel into what is the edge here? What is the edge here and can we, even if we don't like it, even if we don't like how things are right now, can we release into it with curiosity, with love, with interest, with care? And care and interest are synonymous to love and metta. The sense of being undefended, the sense of being open to what is arising in the experiential field. Ah. And letting, letting it teach us, letting it teach us what needs to be, what needs to be known in this moment. And it takes, this practice takes patience. It's not, okay, I have an insight, I just let go into it. Okay, I know exactly what to do, but it takes patience. It actually trains us in patience, in non-reactivity. I'll say that again. It trains us in the value of patience and kanti, and non-reactivity. And we can see this beautiful word, patience in the ten perfections, ten parames in Buddhism. Sense of patience with, and opening to, and it's not resigning, it's not giving in, it's not giving up, but there's a sense of aliveness. There is an aliveness of curiosity, aliveness of interest for right here, right now, and this, which becomes the leading edge of our growth, the leading edge, the, the insight producing edge of where we haven't been before in our psyche, in our minds, in our hearts, in our humanity. Just being patient, because if we get to difficulty and we go into our habitual patterns of resistance, we don't like it, like how do we fix, we're doing the same thing over and over and over again, like this karmic knot that maybe we have and we keep just tightening it further and further. But having gentle, loving curiosity, releasing into it and being patient, lovingly for ourselves for what is arising, and this can be transformative, can be transformative, can be the way, the way into loving what is, loving what is, opening the door into further being, fully being, perhaps becoming, maybe I'll use that, becoming ourselves more fully. So maybe what I'm teaching or what I've just taught seems conceptual, seems complicated. I hope it isn't because I'm giving very specific and clear instructions, and I do see some of you taking notes, which is great because this is a step by step direction. So if it seems so heady, don't worry about it, I'll lead us into a guided meditation for us to explore. But one thing to remember, just to simplify, one thing to remember, whatever arises in this moment, not future, not past, not thinking, if there's a story, let go of the story right away, come back. Let go of the story, come back to the feeling in the heart, in the mind, and gently explore, gently open to with curiosity. Don't have to think about it, it's not thinking, but just being with. What happens if you just sit with it, sit with what is arising? Let it teach you whatever it needs to teach you. Maybe the lesson takes days or weeks, but is worth staying with. All right, let's give it a try. So let's practice together. So I'd like to invite you to land in your body in this moment. Ah, here, here. Letting go, letting go of whatever has come before, letting go of even thinking about what tonight's theme is about. Just let go arriving here in this moment. Let go of the simplicity of this body breathing. Just breathing in, breathing out. Let the breath be nourishing in the body, connecting you to your feet and the earth. Let the breath moving through the lower abdomen. Letting go, letting go. If thoughts arise, thanking them for coming and saying, not now, gently, ever so gently, not now. Landing, landing in this body with this breath, refuge, taking refuge. Just this breath, this body. Let awareness connect with the in breath, with the entirety of the in breath, the entirety of the out breath, and your sit bones to ground you. And then you're spending a few minutes feeling your sit bones, your bottom on the cushion, being breathed to your hands, your feet, your whole body. In breath, out breath. Thank you. Thank you. Let the breath be calming, soothing. Thank you. And can each breath in breath and out breath be comforting, as if you were breathing in kindness, breathing out kindness. Feeling good will, feel your lungs, feel your abdomen, feel your whole body, a sense of care for this body, calming, soothing, any anxiety, stress, difficulty. Letting go, letting go. Letting go of whatever is not helpful in this moment. Letting the breath in breath bring in kindness, good will, soothing into your heart, gentleness ease into the body. And let each out breath, breathing out kindness, breathing out good will, metta around you, all around you, into the space around you. Letting go of your heart, your body, your mind, your heart, all around you, breathe out kindness, breathe out kindness, as goodness inside us, trusted, trust, this goodness that receives care from the universe and breathes it out. Letting go of each breath in breath and out breath. Letting go of your heart, breathing out kindness, and out kindness, letting go of your heart, breathing out kindness, relaxing, releasing with each breath, with each out breath. Letting go of your heart, breathing out kindness, as goodness inside us, trusted, you you you and now you can stay with the breath breathing in breathing out Metta into the body the heart to the mind maybe that's what is needed today maybe that's all that is needed right now and you're so trusted continue to be nourished and healed in this way benefit yourself and all others and if you like to take on the suggestions you're welcome to and yet let them be from your body following them with your heart not with your head these invitations are not to think about but to explore in your lived experience so feeling your breath in your body in your abdomen in your heart center in your feet in your hands and your shoulders feeling embodied invite your heart to open up to relax into whatever is arising right now in this moment in the body there is an emotion the body sensation a feeling if it's a story let it go if it's the story let it go come back to the body open up to the felt sense in the body and say if there can be some gentle kind curiosity and some interest not resisting whatever is here even if it's challenging or difficult tell me everything child tell me everything your heart your mind opening this challenge in the body in the heart in the mind not the story not the story but to be known as a felt sense without resistance just breathe and be patient making more space in your heart maybe it's a headache let it be just as it is not to fix it push it away just breathe with it gently opening up it's a very subtle interest interest synonymous with love physically hold whatever is happening give it space fashioning a new pattern a new way of being with what may be challenging just breathe be breathed be with what is arising without an agenda this sense of open curiosity gentle allowing being with this synonymous with metta with care in the deepest sense not pushing away fixing but really deeply making space with each breath for what is and you don't have to get answers simply with humility sit with interest and care and for the last minutes of this practice period letting there be a radical acceptance of whatever arose or did not arise in this practice period opening the doors of your heart as if embracing a big hug thank you for sitting thank you for showing up for yourself hugging yourself with your own care with your own metta regardless of what happened or did not happen you showed up you did your best let this be a moment of radical acceptance and care patience interest love and may our cultivation of care interest care for ourselves and for others the way we can sit for our own challenges we can offer to others not trying to fix it go away because we are uncomfortable with our own suffering but to make space with care curiosity and patience may our cultivation be of service to all beings everywhere including ourselves may all beings be happy may all beings be free thank you all thank you for your practice so invitations to be to let go of the story to open up with curiosity interest patience and radical acceptance of what arises in the heart and in the body to fashion a new way of being with what arises so we have time and

in chat privately if you like maybe we're all very quiet right now so tell you what if there aren't any reflections right now cherry let's make space please um thanks i guess um uh i was finding it uh i was trying to understand what was different from what i would normally do in terms of i did try to follow your directions so i was happy when you said oh well let's go and try to do some uh meditation and um so i was just trying to understand what was to be different in this meditation from others so perhaps i'm a bit simple here but i just didn't get it what was the difference ah well maybe this is what you usually do i don't know what it is you usually do jerry so i can't answer that question i wish i could be in your mind and i could read your mind would be fun if i were a mind reader but i don't know so it's for you to discover my dear okay thanks how's that zen answer thank you it's true thanks yeah um couple of reflections i read them and then we'll go into groups let's see here uh one person says the best i was able to do is to bring my attention back to the breath there was so much chatter in my mind no problem just bringing the attention back to the breath uh this is beautiful practice especially appropriate if there's a lot of chatter just called it no this is chattery buddha this is busy mind buddha it's okay no no judgment another person says so awesome not to be with inner critic meta and loving kindness to you to you as well another reflection aligns closely with where i've been trying to go beautiful another reflection i've enjoyed this practice tried standing quietly which kept me alert and in my body great beautiful i'm glad that you tried to stand up take care of your body your sleepiness very skillful to do that keep yourself alert and in the body beautiful thank you for all those practice reports so appreciate them one after another great so dear ones um let's turn to uh practicing in community and and the um reflection the invitation as always is to first take care of yourselves take care of each other with kindness um in the breakout groups um maybe going in reverse alphabetical order and um and the prompt tonight is um with this practice is there something that you perhaps explore that seemed different for you opened up or maybe not it was similar or maybe you don't know could just be the question of i don't know want and what particularly about the steps that we went through if anything was new to you or is this what you usually do aligns with what you do what is what which of those steps is really um lights you up is really you've discovered is really uh opening for you is it the letting go of the stories is it the putting with curiosity staying in your body could be all of them but maybe being clear about one helps you be witnessed by others each person can offer a nugget could be i don't know could be the silence i pass right now the next person will offer a nugget the next person offer a nugget and we'll go round and round a few times make sure everybody has a chance to share and and um yeah and be witnessed so please take care of each other take care of yourselves and it's going to take me another minute to to finish creating these rooms please be patient with me and um and um ah i'm taking a long breath here we go okay i think i think i have them okay here we go take care of each other take care of yourselves you you you you you you you you just about a couple of minutes um for any reflections what might have come up in the rooms any aha moments questions so a question um i experienced a lot of physical agitation and mental agitation and um you know emotions that just felt like they were overtaking me and my body it wasn't a decision my body i'm in a swivel chair and my body just turned and then i settled back down and it it it was more doable and i guess my question is is that skillful or unskillful and should i stay with what feels like terror yeah yeah thank you for sharing that mary and and listening to let me reflect back to you what i heard because i think the answer is already there so so you said that when just you were being assailed and it was with let's say mara with your assail with all these thoughts like the trickster mara the inputism is the trickster with all these thoughts and and then your body so it wasn't so much what i heard you say wasn't a decision like okay mary now let's turn it's like your body just like okay this is what we're doing now mary i'm gonna take you for a ride like oh different perspective right that's what i heard you say mary it was definitely the body there you go so trust the wisdom of the body and there's a lot of wisdom in in in this shift it's it's like you know when you're in a funk the best medicine is go for a walk like get out go for a walk right you're let your body take you for a walk and you walk around it's like oh yeah a different perspective so the wisdom of body is like all right darling turn
