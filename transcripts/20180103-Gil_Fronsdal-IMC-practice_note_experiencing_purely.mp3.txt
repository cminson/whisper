Practice Note : Experiencing Purely

If a lake surface is agitated with a lot of waves, it doesn’t 
really reflect very well – or not at all – what’ s around  the 
lake.  But w hen the lake water gets still, it becomes 
mirror -like. And the more still it is, the more clearly it can 
reflect what’ s around. A person might lean over and 
look at their face, and see it fairly clearly in certain kinds 
of still water situations.  Or there might be a spectacular 
reflection of the mountains in the distance – in the 
reverse direction. It’s quite beautif ul to watch. When the 
water is still, you can sometimes look into it and see 
what’ s inside . You can see the fish and whateve r other  
life, rocks,  or stones that might be there.  But w hat’s 
required for both reflections and seeing inside  is to have 
the water still, quiet. It’s the same thing with the mind , 
with practice. Something needs to be still inside – to be 
quiet – so that we can see clearly.  
 
What we’re looking for in mindfulness practice is to see 
clearly, and to clearly recogniz e what’s happening as it’s 
happening. But we’re also looking to do our observation 
from a place of quiet or stillness. What’s unique about 
this practice is that we’re not trying to force ourselves 
into being still, or to force a busy and agitated mind to be quiet. But we  are looking for whether there’s some 
place within where we can be still and quiet in our 
observation.  
 
One of the ways to find this is to think that in looking , it’s 
the looking  that can be quiet  – a certain stillness in the 
looking. The eyes might look at different things, but 
there’s a quiet – a stillness – that’s there in the looking.  
 
In the hearing , we find the stillness and quiet that’s in 
the hearing. We might be listening to noise, but the 
hearing itself is not the noise. Can the hearing be still 
and quiet?  
 
In the tasting, can there be a quiet stillness in the 
tasting?  
 
In the smelling, just the smelling. Not our reactions, not 
our responses, our desires and aversions. But in the 
smelling in an d of itself, can there be a stillness – a 
quiet – in the smelling?  
 
In feeling what’s going on in our body, in sensing our 
tactile sensations – can that be still and quiet?  
 
And we can be aware of what’s going on in our minds. 
We can be aware of our thoughts, our feelings, our 
intentions, our desires, all kinds of movements of the 
mind. Can the knowing of the mind be still and quiet?  The mind is allowed to be busy and agitated, to do what 
it does. The body can have lots of energy. But one other 
place to look for this quiet, still place is in the ways in 
which we know – the knowing of something.  
 
As you practice today, you might think of the calm, still 
lake that reflects whatever comes. It reflects what it 
sees. The reflection is not troubled by what c omes. It’s 
not attacking what comes. It just allows what walks by 
the shore to be reflected.  Can you find – or begin to 
find, approach finding – some place within, some way of 
being, where there’s a kind of stillness? Sweet stillness. 
A kind of quiet. A co mfortable quiet through which you 
can know what’s happening.  
 
In the seeing…quiet. In the hearing…stillness. In the 
tasting…quiet. In the smelling…stillness.  In the 
body…quiet. In the mind…a certain kind of stillness that 
knows what’s happening.  
 
If what I’m saying today makes sense to you – as you 
do your walking meditation, as you go to the bathroom, 
as you have tea, if you come back here to sit  – you 
might see if you can intuit , or sense, or feel your way, 
into a place of quiet and stillness that’s not forced.  It 
doesn’t actually require you to quiet or still anything. But 
there is a place within – a place where you can be with 
whatever is happening in a still way.  
 You might experiment , and see if you can find that, and 
how it can support you as you go through the day.  
Thank you.
