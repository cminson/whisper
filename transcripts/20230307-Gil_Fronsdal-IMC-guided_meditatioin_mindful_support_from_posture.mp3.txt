 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. www.rhedu.com Good morning everyone, or hello. Good afternoon in some places, evening in others. Happy to be here with you. And we continue this overall series on practice, working with challenges. One of the important principles of Buddhism is that our inner life, how we engage it, how we work it, is the nutriment, the food for certain things to grow. So we want to be careful what we feed. And one way of understanding this is that our capacity for attention is a kind of food that feeds whatever it goes into. And so if we give all our attention to fear, to despair, to anger, to preoccupation, to our imagination, our projections of what's going to happen, if all our attention goes in there, we're actually feeding those very things in a certain way. And we're feeding something which is not actually so beneficial for us. And the analogy would be maybe something like if a person has two good feet that they can walk on, and they've learned to walk and they can walk stably and well, if they give no attention, zero attention to their feet as they walk, and all their attention goes into the hands swinging, making sure they swing far enough and far enough away from the body, close enough to the body, the right whatever, just everything goes into there, absorbed in just the swinging of the arms. Then the feet might be functioning, but the full support, the full benefits of those feet might not be available to us. We might not notice where we're stepping. We might not notice that there's a cliff we're walking into. We might walk on difficult gravel and not really pay attention to where to walk or slippery ground and not pay attention. So because we're not paying attention to our walking in our feet and where they go, we are not benefiting from what's possible, how they can support us. So the same way if most of our attention is going into our preoccupations, our fears, all these things, then we're not available for a broader support as we go through our life. One of those supports the Buddha gave is our posture. He talks about in mindfulness instructions, clearly knowing that you're sitting when you're sitting, the posture of sitting. Know that you're standing when you're standing. Know that you're walking as you walk. Know that you're lying down as you're lying down. It's so simplistic, this instruction, it's easy to dismiss it, ignore, just kind of sail right over it than reading it. But it's actually pretty fundamental, and it's fundamental in working with challenges. If we can have, really, engage our posture as a place to inhabit or embody awareness, embodied posture, just when we're standing, really know, clearly know and embody standing, sitting, embody and know we're sitting and so forth, and whatever posture you're in, then we have enough attention to our feet as we walk to get the support of the feet. Then, if we're in challenges, then not all our attention is going into the challenges. We might be thinking about it, focusing on it enough, but we're not lost in it. We have a grounding, we have a place of stability, we have a place that keeps us balanced more and keeps us connected to the present moment in a vital way, in a way that is wonderfully animated or wonderfully connected. So it's a protection from getting lost in just paying attention to the hand swinging as if that's all there is. It's a protection from getting preoccupied in our challenges in such a way that we don't have available to us the full intelligence of our whole system. We can get lost in that world. And finally, it's one thing to try to do this when we're in a challenge. It might be too late, but the more we can practice mindfulness, all the different aspects of mindfulness, but the more we can cultivate an embodied presence in the posture of whatever we're doing, and that becomes a second nature, becomes really a grounding, we're familiar with it, and the channels are quite open and clear about why this is beneficial. We feel it. Then we're prepared for challenges. Then we bring that with us into the challenge and we'll find there's a strength, there's a grounding, there's a whole kind of support system present that we wouldn't have if we weren't mindful. So cultivating this mindfulness of posture is one of the important steps that the Buddha gives for working with challenges. So assuming a meditative posture, each person will find their own posture that's right for them. A couple of guidelines around meditation posture is ideally it's a posture where there's no obstructions. Nothing is constricted or collapsed. Some people find it useful to loosen their belt if it feels tight and constricting there. It's also useful to have a posture that does feel aligned and balanced. Aligned so that both sides of the body are doing the same thing as close as possible given the circumstances of your body. Aligned so that the muscles of your body have the best opportunity to relax deeply. Slumping in a couch to meditate might be better than being tense, but it also doesn't allow for the muscles to relax that deeply. Some people avoid upright aligned posture because then they feel their tensions of their body. That's okay. We can still cultivate this embodied awareness of posture. And also we begin, we offer the creating the conditions for that tension to really relax deeply that they wouldn't do if we mask it by slumping in a chair or something. Gently closing the eyes and taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. And those deep inhales, if you really take as full of inhale as you're comfortable with take maybe even hold the inhale a little bit at the top. And with that, adjust your posture. Exhale along, exhale. And at the end, hold your breath for two seconds and see if you can relax more of your body. And then letting your breathing return to normal. And for a few more breaths, relax in your body. One of the functions of relaxing in the body is to bring your awareness into the body. So you can be more embodied, a greater sensitivity to how the body reveals itself through sensations. And then taking a few moments to feel your body globally. Justlaw, And with a global awareness of your body, to whatever degree you can, have kind of a relaxed global awareness of your posture. The sensations accompanying your posture. What your posture looks like from the outside doesn't matter. What your posture feels like from the inside does matter. So, okay. Okay. And as the posture feeling the sensations, okay. Think of it as the support, the gentle holding of a deeper embodied attention to breathing. That the posture is a grounding here and now, a gentle that holds the sensations of breathing. And in some ways, if you're aware of the breathing in your torso, the expanding and contracting of the breathing, touches up against your posture, at least there in your torso. And the posture touches your breathing. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Perhaps giving a little bit more attention to your posture, just a little bit. So the posture grounds you more here and now, and maybe supports your attention to breathing, to the present moment. Okay. Okay. And as we get, come to the end of this sitting, to again, bring some attention to your posture. But imagine that you're sitting with someone who's a friend or someone you respect and who you trust, feel comfortable with. And the person is sitting in front of you with a posture that shows presence, balance. They're fully grounded in themselves, aware. And at the same time, they seem fully present for you. Not leaning forward, not pulling back. Eyes are soft. The hands and arms are soft. The shoulders are relaxed, but the spine seems almost like, their torso seems like embodiment of attention, balance, a certain strength. And as they're sitting there in front of you, you become more aware of your own posture, hopefully, without any judgment of what it is. But how would you adjust your posture for a few seconds to resonate with their posture? How would you adjust your posture to be more grounded, so your torso is more present and maybe even excursion certain kind of strength of presence, of being here in the present. Maybe your chest a little more open. And then the two of you close your eyes. And then you realize that with your eyes closed, you're less self-conscious and allows your heart to open, allows your goodwill and your friendship, your kindness to flow. And you sit here quietly with a friendly disposition, a kind disposition, not necessarily wishing anything for anyone, but sits present with your friend, others, the whole world, with a friendliness or a generous heart, with love, with a disposition that it would be easy for you to have thoughts, words and actions of goodwill, of care, spreading your wealth and your love, of care, spreading your welfare and wellbeing to all beings, so that in your small way, you contribute to the welfare and happiness of everyone. May all beings be happy. Thank you.
