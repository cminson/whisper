 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Welcome, everybody. And thank you for being here. And I especially want to thank you for your practice, for your sincerity. I was thinking today that if I were looking for a word to describe or characterize our far-flung meditation community of practitioners, I think I'd pick sincerity. So let's begin by taking a moment to recognize where we are in this particular community. With each person sincerely doing their best to practice meditation and to walk in the footsteps of the Buddha. So I'm sending out to you a silent expression of appreciation for the sincerity that each of you is bringing to our practice together. If you like, feel free to take a moment to do the same. So far this week, we've cultivated three of the wholesome mind states that prepare the mind for awakening. We're allowing the full impact of this Dharma practice to come alive in our own hearts. These qualities of mind are receptivity, softness, and being free of self-centered preoccupations, free of the hindrances, which function as barriers, obstructions to awakening. And when we have just a brief moment when the thinking mind is taking a break from all the commentary, I think perhaps the most natural response to that is gladness. Because now the mind is ready for the sunlight, fresh air, and spaciousness of the Dharma to reveal itself to us moment by moment. So let's begin by setting our intention for this meditation. So what is your deepest wish for how this practice could benefit both yourself and others? And now taking your meditation posture, peeling the contact with the Earth, and sending your roots down deep into the Earth, letting it support you. Lining the spine so that the energy flows freely. You might think of opening the lower chakra in the perineum to receive the energy of the Earth, and the topmost chakra at the crown of the head, where there's a little space between the plates of the skull, opening that to the heavens, allowing the energy of the sky to come inside as well. It's good if your posture gives you a feeling of stability. And now begin relaxing the body, scanning down from the head, relaxing the shoulders, the arms, the hands, and the fingers. The torso and the belly, the hips, the legs, the feet, and the toes. Taking a long, deep, slow breath, and relaxing into the process of breathing. And as we stay with the breath, we can let the awareness of the breath be slightly in the background, and just to a few minutes of loving-kindness meditation, metta, creating a space where we're protected by this warm-hearted feeling of well-wishing towards ourself and all beings. May I and all beings everywhere be safe and protected. May all beings everywhere, including me, be happy, be peaceful, and free. And with this warm-hearted well-wishing, we bring in the wisdom to vow that we'll sit quietly, quiet body, quiet mind, weaving our preoccupations outside the door, and now bringing the breath back into the foreground, and connecting with the breath, the flow. Breathing in, noticing the felt sensations of the beginning of the breath, and the continuation of the in-breath, the pause at the top, which gives way to the out-breath, and as it flows down with a pause at the bottom. Sometimes I enjoy thinking about the cycle of the breath as an oval of energy and flow. So, closing the eyes, you can imagine the in-breath beginning at the base of the spine in the back, and reaching its end at the top of the head, and then the out-breath flowing down the front of the body, reaching its end in the perineum. So, just staying with the breath, flowing in, and out. And giving your breath as an offering to your mindfulness, as a beautiful, non-static object of meditation, constantly changing. Perhaps you may feel it flowing up the back and down the front. If it feels right to you, lighting a little candle of gladness in the heart. Breathing in, welcoming gladness. Breathing out, spreading gladness as far as it wishes to go. But if you're struggling with loss, depression, despair, hopelessness, fear, I trust you have the wisdom to know that repressing your emotional state is counterproductive. And if that's the case, recognize your pain. Perhaps you can appreciate just being here in the safe space, breathing. Inviting gladness on the in-breath, radiating gladness on the out-breath. And like all these wholesome states, states like gladness exist on a wide spectrum. So, if you're really free of the hindrances, you might feel elated. But if life is difficult right now, then you might just be able to access a little hint of gladness. And that's fine. That's to be honored. Or you could try these meta phrases. May I live with an open heart? May whatever clouds my heart be dispelled? So, if you feel that support would be beneficial to you, please go ahead and do the well-wishing of living with an open heart and letting whatever clouds there be dispelled. Perhaps we can be satisfied just to be here. A sincere practitioner in this spot on planet Earth, breathing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Breathing in, welcoming whatever gladness may be present. And allowing yourself to feel it, and breathing out, sharing it with all beings. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And by staying contentedly with the flow and ebb of the breath, allowing yourself to perhaps glimpse the freedom that is possible when the mind and the body settle down, even for just a moment. I'm going to be glad that, wow, this freedom is possible. Even for me. And in this openness, breathing in, radiating gladness inside, breathing out, radiating gladness, giving it away. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
