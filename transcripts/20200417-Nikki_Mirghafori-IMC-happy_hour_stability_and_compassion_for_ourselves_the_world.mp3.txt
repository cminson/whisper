The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Welcome. Whether you're new to Happy Hour or if you've been following online for a while,
welcome. It's really lovely to have you, especially this Friday evening.
I wanted to say the end of the week, but nowadays our weeks are...
What's the beginning of the week? What's the end of the week?
It's so interesting how the conventions that we are used to, the concepts, the world of concepts,
are being challenged, very interestingly challenged by this virus, by this organism.
Really, this is a wonderful time for a lot of reflection on what we assume on the concepts
that we assume in this world. So, without getting too philosophical and hypothetical,
I wanted to share. We also have other people saying,
hello's is lovely to see other hello's from people following us on YouTube.
I think so many themes, so many things that could be appropriate for this time for us to sit together
and reflect on and also have a guided meditation. The theme I wanted to share with you tonight
and do a guided meditation on is in some ways inspired by it being the proverbial Friday,
even though I was just talking about the concepts and how this whole COVID-19 era,
the concepts are questions, but it's a sense of a more easeful, a more easeful guided meditation
and also one that is inspired by the following quote from Ryokan,
the 18th century Zen monk in Hermit. And the line of the poem is,
oh, that my monk's robe were wide enough to gather up all the suffering people in this floating world.
I read it again. Actually, you know, I'm going to put it in the chat window,
because some people are visual, so it might help you to actually see it here as I read it again.
Oh, that my monk's robes were wide enough to gather up all the suffering people in this floating world.
It's a poem of compassion, just gentle compassion. Oh, if my monk's robes are wide enough,
just a gentle compassion. So with tonight's offering, guided meditation,
I would like to invite you first into settling, settling into the body, breathing, connecting with yourself
and resting, relaxing, coming back into yourself, connecting.
And with all that has been going on in our world,
both challenges that each and every one of us faces in different ways, as well as how our hearts are open
and how we are impacted by what is happening for two people that we care about,
people that we don't know, all beings in this world.
So, and I would lead us after settling, breathing, connecting to ourselves to a gentle practice of compassion,
which is just turning, just simply holding presence, holding presence for all that is going on,
both for ourselves and other beings.
So, with that, I'm going to mute, let's see, I think I already muted, and I'm going to there.
And also, for now, during the guided meditation, I'm going to turn off the chat to all except to me, the host.
If an issue comes up, you're welcome to invite me.
But these are a couple of things I'm trying to do to support the Zoom room from potential Zoom bombing.
So, just so you know.
So, I'd like to ask you to get into your meditation posture.
Sitting in a chair or a cushion if you need to move right now, you need to lie down.
However you would be most comfortable supporting yourself, supporting your body for more comfort and ease.
Taking a moment, perhaps, as you're settling, to just move, maybe, a little in your chair or cushion, left and right, back and forth,
just so that you find your sit bones, you find the center of the gravity.
Maybe some adjustment is needed so that you really land in your sit bones.
You really land.
Ah, landing.
Landing in your body.
Landing in this moment.
Taking refuge in the simplicity of this moment, sitting and breathing away from all the, all that's happening in the world, in your life, in your mind.
Just turning away for a moment, bowing.
Just for this moment, bowing to them and saying, thank you.
Maybe take just a moment of respite, a moment of seclusion in my heart, just through nourish, to nourish and rejuvenate myself.
Not turning away completely forever, but with wisdom so that you can be more available for yourself and others through nourishing yourself in silence and solitude.
Gently turning off the newscaster in your mind, the announcer.
Not now, not now. We'll come back to you later.
Ah, just landing, landing, settling.
With each in-breath, inviting more, spaciousness, more aliveness.
And with each out-breath, settling in more, settling, relaxing.
Connecting with each in-breath and out-breath for the entire duration, the sensations.
And at the end of the exhale, dropping in, landing, relaxing more into yourself, into your body.
If your body was a cello or a violin, feeling the breath as if it were the bow, the bow touching in its entirety.
Moving up and down.
Feeling the contact of the breath in your abdomen.
And at the end of the down bow, at the end of the out-breath, relaxing, dropping some more, especially if there's any tension you feel in your body.
And at the end of the down bow, at the end of the out-breath, relaxing, relaxing.
And as if you're enjoying beautiful music, as if you're enjoying beautiful cello, deep sound, perhaps a bass, letting yourself enjoy the movement.
And off the breath, the beautiful music of your body, your instrument.
Calming, soothing, grounding, rich in its resonance.
The thoughts, plants, worries arise.
Noticing them, simply noticing them with gentleness, kindness, without shame or guilt.
This is going to happen many times throughout this practice period.
It's all okay.
And after you've noticed you have seen that the mind is resting on smilingly, smilingly.
Providing your attention, your awareness to the breath within the body to enjoy, to relish the beautiful resonance, resonating music.
Love your breath on the instrument of your body as a whole.
Love your breath on the instrument of your body.
If you happen to find yourself distracted this evening, one extra tool that can be supportive is to notice in-breath, out-breath.
And count at the end of the out-breath, from 1 to 10, and then starting from 1 again.
Letting most 95% of your awareness rest with the sensations and only 5% with the counting to provide structure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The breath breathing in and out, being aware of the breath within the body,
killing the soil of our awareness, settling, calming.
Thank you.
As you sit, feeling connected, feeling connected to your body, your sit bones to your breath.
I'd like to invite you to perhaps sit a little more upright.
You need to adjust your sitting to sit a little more upright.
In the sense of groundedness, integrity, tall like a mountain, stable.
Feeling the breath, the movement of the breath in the abdomen, creating more groundedness, stability, rootedness.
And feeling both the softness, the relaxation in your body, as well as the groundedness and the stability.
The sense of confidence that comes from having a posture that's grounded, upright.
From a sense of relaxed, relaxed, spacious, soft stability.
Opening your heart more to yourself with kindness.
Because if you are holding yourself with care and kindness, as a caring, loving mother do with a young child,
or a loving, compassionate being of light, whatever metaphor works for you,
something that doesn't don't struggle, just you, something that works for you.
The sense of care opening, holding yourself metaphorically, holding your own challenges.
A place of strength, not a place of self-pity, a place of strength that acknowledges all the blessings, all the goodness in your life also.
Perhaps considering three blessings right now in your mind, silently.
Maybe right now you are not ill with this virus.
What is a blessing? Maybe a roof over your head, say from the elements right now.
Maybe you've checked in with a friend or family member today, another blessing, whatever the blessings are, large or small.
Acknowledging the goodness, really the goodness that's here.
And also acknowledging what is challenging for you right now and holding that with care, with tenderness.
The caring being would maybe addressing yourself.
So sweetie, I know this is hard for you right now.
I know you're having a challenge with this or that.
Yeah, this is hard sweetie. This is hard, I know.
Yeah.
And holding yourself, your own challenges.
From a place of grace, ability, confidence.
As if you were a child, a young child you were holding, when you hold a child there's a sense of strength, stability in your arms, in your back.
You won't drop the child, the same sense of stability in your body as you hold yourself metaphorically, attending to your own challenges and pain in this time.
Thank you.
And if you find yourself instead falling into self-pity, which is the near enemy of compassion, but not compassion,
then it's okay to come back to the sense of stability in your body, in your breath and just breathe.
Perhaps you're collecting the blessings just to stabilize yourself.
And when there is more stability, opening to hold both the blessings and the challenges.
The paradox of the goodness in your life and the challenges both.
Letting your heart expand, be expanded to allow for both to be here.
Breathing with, breathing with.
The blessings and the challenges.
Again at any time when it becomes too heady just come back to the breath and the body.
The cello and the bow, the movement settling and calming.
Letting the resonance of the joys and sorrows without any words, be held in the expansiveness, spaciousness of your heart.
Breathing with, breathing with.
Breathing with.
And as you feel, allowing yourself to feel.
However little or much sense of peace, ease, expansiveness, spaciousness there is for you.
Holding blessings and challenges of your heart.
With spacious and ease for stability opening up.
Your presence wider, presence wider.
Not sitting, not turning away but sitting with presence.
I hear the sound of sirens where I am sitting.
It's always a sign to me that someone is suffering right now.
It's a practice I have to wish whoever is in trouble in this moment.
Wishing them well, wishing them well-being, wishing them ease.
And taking this person who right now somewhere in Mountain View, California.
Is experiencing, challenged or distressed.
Taking them as a stand-in.
For so many people in the world right now who might be in distress in this moment.
Opening our heart with presence.
Just breathing, just breathing.
And simply wishing, wishing goodness, wishing ease, wishing comfort.
As if you're radiating goodwill, if you're radiating.
Not pushing it out but it is radiated.
Imagine it is radiated but by just putting your intention there, by just intending to.
Sense of goodwill, radiated.
If you like to experiment by putting your hand or both hands in the middle of your chest.
The proverbial heart center, not your heart which is on the left side, but your heart center.
Connecting with yourself, with your good wishes, with your goodwill.
People in this world.
Knowing that as your goodwill radiates from your heart center, from your chest outward.
It touches you first.
As you are most worthy as anyone else.
Of your own compassion and care, goodwill.
And expanding further.
To all the beings, all the beings.
Whatever their conditions right now, whether they're in distress.
Whether they're suffering.
Whatever their condition might be at this point.
If it's neutral at this point, wishing them well.
Knowing that all beings right now are affected by the conditions in our world.
Affected somehow.
And Ezra O'Conn said, oh that my monk's robes were wide enough to gather.
Gather up all the suffering people in this floating world.
All the suffering people in this floating world.
It's an expression of goodwill and tension.
Thank you.
Knowing that the same way that Rio O'Conn's robes could not be wide enough to hold the suffering.
To gather up all the suffering people in this floating world.
And without attaching to outcome the same way.
We acknowledge that our sharing of goodwill is without attachment to outcome.
Wishing goodness and ease as a cultivation of our own heart.
Of our own courage.
The word courage, curl, and French heart.
The strength of our own heart.
To be with, to open up to.
What is challenging for ourselves and others and not turn away?
For the last moment of this practice.
Now seeing you to hold yourself with kindness and ease or whatever arose or did not arise.
Letting go of outcome.
Appreciating that you tried.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So welcome back to the Zoom room.
And we can have actually, I'm going to turn it up in the chat.
If you'd like to share a word as to what's arising for you right now.
I'll read a few entries.
What's happening for you right now.
For me there's a sense of stillness.
More stillness and spaciousness and connection than before.
Calm and gratitude.
Warms.
Confidence.
Quiet.
Resolve.
Stillness and ease.
Peace.
Thank you for all these reflections.
Beautiful.
So I'd like to invite you now to the next part of our practice which is practice and community.
In a few minutes sharing each other how are you, how are you right now, how was this practice for you.
And there's no right or wrong at all.
Just checking in and in this time connecting with other practitioners.
As people were reporting last night on the Zoom, it can be very supportive.
And if you haven't tried it yet in this format, it's very different from being on Zoom calls at your workplace.
It's a very different way of connecting to practitioners.
So I do invite you to partake and try it.
And if you decide it's not for you tonight, it's perfectly fine.
And it's fine to bow out right now before I create the rooms, which I will do in the moment.
So see if you want to try it tonight or not, either is fine.
So I will create the breakout rooms right now of size 3.
Okay, here we go.
Size 2 or 3 is what we're going to have.
Let's see.
Okay.
Let's see here.
Creating rooms is always fun.
Okay.
All right.
So most rooms have 3 and maybe one has 2 people.
Here we go.
I'm going to open all the rooms.
Okay.
So welcome back.
Okay.
Yeah.
So thank you, Forrest.
There's a suggestion to be more clear about the instructions about what to do in the groups for next time.
And I will make sure to be clear.
It's the each person has a couple of minutes to share.
And I guess I'm making the incorrect assumption that many people have been either come to happier or listening to the full instructions on the audio.
So I'm taking a lot of short hands, but that's a big assumption to make.
So I think I need to be a little more clear about it.
So thank you for that suggestion.
So given that any reflections, any questions about tonight's practice, either the guided practice or we're in community and you're all going to raise your hand by pressing the space bar.
I believe it works or maybe typing something in the chat.
We have a few minutes.
Any reflections, especially if you haven't spoken before.
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm Susan and part of Insight Santa Cruz.
Been a while.
I haven't seen you on the TV before, but I like you in real life.
I miss in real life and I'm really grateful for these zoom things and I've gotten to do a lot with Santa Cruz.
And then with you all yet.
So I'm really grateful for the connection and the breakout room is just so really nice to open the heart with human beings.
So thanks.
Thank you. Thank you so much for, for showing up with your heart open to practice with other human beings and connecting in this way.
It is beautiful.
Yeah.
Thank you.
And first, I think you had your hand up.
Oh yeah, actually couldn't figure it out.
Oops.
Wait, what happened?
Oh, you got muted again.
Sorry.
Go ahead for it.
Yeah.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I couldn't actually figure out how to raise my hand.
So I think I collapsed instead, but.
All good.
Which next time.
Yeah.
I wanted to ask.
So I really appreciated the meditation, especially the part of remembering blessings first because for me, compassion is really hard.
I tend to fall into sadness and that happens for myself.
And I think it also happens if I, I have not really been thinking about compassion for other people because it just seems kind of overwhelming to even think about it.
So I just don't even think about it.
But I'm wondering if there are ways to also avoid falling into sadness when spreading compassion for everyone else during the crisis.
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for that question.
I really appreciate that question, especially because a sense of overwhelm can come up and let me ask you something for us as you were in the guide of meditation tonight as you were following it to some extent.
I'm wondering if, you know, what I tried to do was to conjure up first a sense of stability and strength in the body, right from the posture.
And then bringing in a sense of goodness and blessings and then opening up the challenges so that there's not a sense of overwhelm into the sadness.
So was there some access for you tonight to open up, for example, as the sirens were blaring like you probably could hear them through my audio?
Was there ability to open up that way without falling into overwhelm, sadness overwhelm?
Well, I like what you said about first finding strength in the body and I really liked the cello imagery. I think that brought a lot of stability.
I think when I heard the sirens and I heard you talk about someone suffering, I still just, I mean, I didn't even think, I didn't get an image in my mind of, like, I didn't make a connection, I guess, to someone suffering.
Okay, okay. So, which is fine, just wondering how, you know, how it's working for you.
So the idea, so I'm delighted to hear that the idea of stability and the cello and just really stability in the body, that is the place to really start with a sense of stability.
And then that can help because the stability also connects to sense of equanimity, another practice which allows not falling into the overwhelm of sadness.
They're all related. So start by cultivating more sense of stability in your body and your heart opening to kindness.
And then when you find yourself overwhelmed with sadness, pull back, pull back and turn towards comforting your own heart, kindness, kindness, and then open again and see how much you can stay and maybe visualize.
Maybe start with someone that you know and you care about. Start small instead of imagining the suffering of the whole world. Start small.
And then if that gets overwhelming, then turn again to comfort yourself. So start small.
Yeah, and even as, as you were talking and I was feeling it, I think I could tap into a little more of it. So thank you. That was great.
Beautiful. Thank you so much. So, ah, 702. Thank you all so much for showing up tonight, Friday night, practicing stability, calm, compassion for ourselves and the whole world has really been a delight.
Thank you, Nikki. Yeah, thank you. I was exhausted before this. So just, I'm feeling better now. I feel happier right now having shared this practice with you.
Happy hour. Happy hour. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Take good care. You too. Bye. See you on Monday. Maybe.
