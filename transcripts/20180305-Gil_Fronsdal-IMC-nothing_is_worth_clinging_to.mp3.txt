The ancient times, the ancient Buddhists, who sometimes like to have fun. 
And they like to have fun in offering some profound teachings. 
And so it was kind of offered in order to make some interesting points. 
Sometimes if you have myths or fables, they make some interesting points that stand out kind of in highlight. 
And if you're part of the ancient world, maybe you would laugh and smile about it all. 
And so I don't know if you will laugh and smile or cry or get upset. 
And in it, one of the things that makes it kind of special is someone asks the Buddha for his teachings in brief. 
And so the Buddha offers him a very brief synopsis or kind of summary or pointed kind of formulation of what is most important. 
Now in this ancient world that Buddha lived in, there were people who believed that great spiritual teachers had omniscience, that they could know everything. 
And so it's a little bit, the Buddha goes along with that. 
Tell me in the instructions and saying how you could become omniscient. 
So that should be interesting if you're interested in such things. 
So listen carefully. 
So I suppose once upon a time, that doesn't say that to here, it says, thus have I heard one of the great gods of the pantheon of gods of the time. 
His name is Saka in Pali. 
And it's said that it's the Pali word for the God Indra. 
So Saka went to see the Buddha and he paid homage first. 
And then he asked the Buddha, Venerable Sir, how in brief is a monastic liberated in the destruction of craving? So here the liberation that the Buddha was talking about, the particular form of liberation, freedom he was talking about was freedom from craving. 
Another way of saying that this little bit more makes more sense, maybe for a modern audience, is freedom from attachment of all kinds. 
So how is a monastic liberated in the destruction of craving? Being one who has reached the ultimate end and attained the ultimate security from bondage. 
I kind of like that. 
So how do you get completely free from being entangled, being caught, being trapped by anything whatsoever? And attain the ultimate holy life, the ultimate goal, and one who is foremost among gods and humans. 
This is an interesting idea. 
The great god, the pantheon, is saying, how do you become foremost among the humans and gods? How does a monastic do that? How does a renunciant do that? And so the idea here is in this Buddhist text that the attainment of liberation, the full spiritual awakening, puts people at a plane or at a level in the hierarchy, higher than even the highest gods. 
So the Buddha then replies, here, ruler of gods, monastics have heard that nothing is worth clinging to. 
It goes on a little bit more, elaborate a little bit, but nothing is worth clinging to. 
And that's kind of like, that's the pithy statement. 
And so that's the summary, that's the heart kind of thing that the Buddha has to tell, the great god, nothing is worth clinging to. 
And it's one of those phrases that is very worthwhile carrying around with you for a while and reflecting on it, thinking about it, debating with it, arguing with it, protesting, the best you can. 
Come up with ideas of when it's okay, when it's worthwhile to cling, when should you cling? One of the ways to kind of consider this reflection is that if you're doing something wholeheartedly, whatever you have to do, you do it wholeheartedly, so you can't really do more effort, you're doing it wholeheartedly in a good way. 
Is it better if you are clinging at the same time as you did it? Do you need to cling if you're engaged wholeheartedly in what you're doing? Or is clinging a bit of a wind drag? Is clinging a little bit of, you know, makes it a little bit harder to do what you're doing? If you're with a person that you love a lot and you're able to share your time together, are you better off just being with them, or are you a little bit better off if you clung? Or is it really not worth the advantages that come from clinging? It's not really worth clinging to this because it's already good. 
So those are like two little examples you can consider. 
One suggestion is that maybe people sometimes cling to things when they're not doing their life wholeheartedly. 
And that's a kind of funny thing, right? If you're not doing it wholeheartedly, maybe the more likely to cling, not giving yourself wholeheartedly to what you're doing. 
So that's more of the reflection you can do. 
You can think about how this might work for you. 
Nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. 
So then the Buddha goes on and continues. 
And this is the omniscient part. 
So you're probably waiting at the edge of your seat for this part. 
When monastics have heard that nothing is worth clinging to, they directly know everything. 
They know something about everything. 
That's the omniscience the Buddha was interested in. 
Not omniscience where you know everything about everything, past, present, and future, but rather to know something key about everything. 
Like a common denominator or a common aspect of all things so that you can have a wise relationship to no matter whatever you encounter in your life. 
Wherever you go, whatever you do, you know something that is liberating, that's freeing, that's worthwhile about that thing. 
And the thing that can make you omniscience, if you really understand this, that nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. 
No matter what you encounter, not that, not that. 
Is that right? What do you think? Having directly known everything, they fully understand everything. 
Having fully understood everything, whatever feeling one feels, whether pleasant or painful or neither painful or pleasant, they abide contemplating impermanence in those feelings. 
So here we get into a part of the Buddha's teachings that is not going to be obvious to everyone, I think, but he has a way of saying that everything that we encounter and we experience, we experience through the filter, we say like a funnel, maybe like an hourglass, like the whole world that we experience goes through the hourglass of our contact with the world, how we experience, touch the world and see the world and smell the world, all kind of through our senses. 
And when everything goes through the senses and then comes out the other side into the brain, for example, that's where we reconstruct everything. 
That's where we make up, you know now that the brain is a big reconstructing machine and it reconstructs the images and ideas of what's going on. 
But it goes through the funnel of our senses. 
And as our experience of the world goes through the funnel of our senses, there's a feeling tone, there's a hedonic tone to that experience that's either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. 
And for the Buddha in his kind of strong capacity for mindfulness and concentration, if you can be really present in the moment in the place where you actually make contact with the world and you see that that contact and that feeling is impermanent, that it rises and passes, it comes and goes, it appears and disappears, there's something about seeing the inconstancy of it which is at the heart of the Buddha's movement towards freedom. 
So he says, if you can see it that way, all this is being impermanent, then that begins a process towards freedom. 
And that process begins by becoming disenchanted with those feelings. 
Disenchanted means no longer enchanted, no longer in the spell of them, it breaks the spell, that whatever kind of attachment is kind of a spell note. 
And then these feelings begin to fade away, the feelings, but our attachments begin to fade and it isn't that attachments just, you snap your fingers and you can stop being clinging, but with insight, with understanding, then attachments begin to fade away until they finally cease. 
Contemplating thus, they do not cling to anything in the world. 
When they do not cling, they are not agitated. 
When they are not agitated, they attain nirvana. 
So that's the good news, that's the little story. 
So the God came down to see the Buddha and he wanted to be told in brief. 
And you'll see, partly he wanted things in brief because God has a lot to do. 
And so you don't want to have places to go, IPOs to open, important things to do. 
And so you want to kind of get your spirituality quickly, efficiently, so you can go on to other, maybe more important things. 
So the Buddha accommodated him and gave him this very powerful teaching. 
It's kind of a nice summary or something. 
Other places, this is unpacked and explained in greater detail to make sense of it, it's kind of in brief. 
So then, Saka, this great God, the great decides, goes home, back up into the heaven where he lives. 
But nearby, listening to this conversation is a disciple, a monastic disciple of the Buddha by the name of Mahamukhlyana. 
And Mahamukhlyana is curious, how well did Saka hear and understand what the Buddha taught? So he decides to go visit him. 
So, in the way that they were able to do back then. 
So Mahamukhlyana says, did that God penetrate to the meaning of the Buddha's words? Or not? Suppose I find out whether he did or not. 
Then just as quickly as a strong person might extend their flexed arm, or flex their extended arm, the venerable Mahamukhlyana vanished from this earth and appeared among the gods in the heavens. 
It's a pretty good trick. 
So now, on that occasion, Saka, the ruler of the gods, was furnished and endowed a hundredfold with five kinds of heavenly music. 
And he was enjoying it in his pleasure park. 
So it's pretty good to be born these high gods because you have a lot of good karma and so you get a lot of pleasure and delight and all kinds of wonderful things. 
So he got all this music in a different version of the story. 
He's not only listening to music, but he's also taking a bath with a hundred celestial maidens. 
But that's in a different Buddhist tradition. 
But in our tradition, we're a little bit more modest about our fantasies. 
And so Saka sees venerable Mahamukhlyana coming, and so he stops the music and goes over to Mahamukhlyana and says, Come, good sir, Mahamukhlyana. 
Welcome, good Mahamukhlyana. 
It is long, good sir. 
Since you found an opportunity to come here, sit down, good sir. 
This seat is ready. 
The venerable Mahamukhlyana sat down on the seat, made ready. 
And the great god Saka took a low seat, a more humble seat, and sat down to one side. 
So this, of course, is a great PR for Buddhists, for Buddhist monastics. 
Even the highest gods will take a lower seat to the Buddhists monastics. 
It's a little bit of PR, I think. 
And then Mahamukhlyana asks him, Saka, how did the Buddha state to you in brief the liberation by destruction of craving? It would be good if you might also, if we might also get to hear that statement. 
Can you repeat what the Buddha said to you? So, then, Mahamukhlyana answers like this. 
Remember, this is the guy hanging out in his pleasure park, listening to music. 
Good sir, Mahamukhlyana. 
We are so busy. 
We have so much to do, not only with our own business, but also with the business of the gods of the other heavens. 
Besides good sir Mahamukhlyana, what is well heard, well learned, well attended to, well remembered, suddenly vanishes from us. 
Good sir Mahamukhlyana. 
It once happened that war broke out between the gods and the titans, the godlike creatures. 
In that war, the gods won and the titans were defeated. 
When I had won that war and returned from it as a conqueror, I had a great palace built. 
Good sir Mahamukhlyana. 
The palace has a hundred towers and each tower has seven hundred upper chambers and each upper chamber has seven nymphs and each nymph has seven maids. 
Would you like to see the loveliness of the great palace? The question was, can you repeat me the profound statement the Buddha said? And the answer he gets, the monk gets, come look at this palace. 
So the Mahamukhlyana consented in silence. 
Then the Saka, the rule of the gods, went to the palace giving precedence to the venerable Mahamukhlyana. 
When the maids of Saka saw the venerable Mahamukhlyana coming in the distance, they were embarrassed and ashamed and they went each into their own rooms. 
Just as a daughter-in-law is embarrassed and ashamed on seeing her father-in-law, so too when the maids of Saka saw the venerable Mahamukhlyana coming, they were embarrassed and ashamed and they went each to their own rooms. 
So no wonder he's busy. 
Then Saka, ruler of the gods, had venerable Mahamukhlyana walk all over and explore the palace. 
See good sir Mahamukhlyana, the loveliness of the great palace. 
Mahamukhlyana said, it does the venerable Sakyak credit as one who has formerly made merit. 
Because he made a lot of merit in a former life, he got born to be the Sakyak, the great god. 
You don't get born as a god unless you did something really fantastic, good deeds. 
So he must have done some really good deeds, good karma. 
So Mahamukhlyana is saying, hey, you must have done something really good to merit this. 
And the traditional commentary on this story is, he's kind of telling him, don't forget that you have to keep making merit. 
You can't just kind of sit around and enjoy the pleasure because you're going to lose it all the next time you die because in Buddhism, gods don't live forever. 
And so you should continue to make merit. 
But this seems to go by Mahukhlyana. 
Then the venerable Mahamukhlyana considered this. 
This god is living much too negligently. 
What if I stirred up a sense of urgency in him? So this guy needs a lesson. 
This is important, this life of ours. 
The sense of urgency is a fantastic word in Pali called Samvega. 
And it's a sense of spiritual urgency. 
It's like this life is short, the task of kind of coming to the bottom of our craving, becoming free, is a really important matter. 
And so some people get this idea, oh, this is important. 
I've got to do this. 
I can't, shouldn't waste any time. 
So this is what the sense of urgency means here. 
So what if I stirred up a sense of urgency in him? Then the venerable Mahamukhlyana performed such a feat of supernormal power that with his toe, he made the great palace shake and quake and tremble. 
Saka, the great god, was filled with wonder and amazement and said, sir, it is wonderful, it is marvelous. 
What power and might the recluse has that with his toe he makes this heavenly abode shake and quake and tremble. 
When the venerable Mahamukhlyana knew that Saka, ruler of the gods, was stirred to a sense of urgency with his hair standing on end. 
Imagine the great god. 
I guess he got a little afraid, a little earthquake. 
So then Mahamukhlyana said to him, how did the Buddha state to you in brief the deliverance, the freedom in the destruction of craving? It would be good if we might get to hear that statement from you. 
And then, so now he's gotten Mahamukhlyana's attention. 
So then he repeats the statement, nothing whatsoever is worth in here clinging to. 
That's the end of the most exciting part of the story. 
And you can imagine that in the ancient world where they had no TV and they had no books, there was no written things at that time, that the primary entertainment, the primary means for education, for learning, for passing on information was oral. 
And we believe that in ancient times there was really rich storytelling. 
Probably storytelling was richer in the ancient pre-literate world than it is in the current world. 
So I don't think it had justice, but I think that the story probably was told with great flair. 
And this is, imagine that people's imagination was filled with the image of heavens and palaces and also the humor of this great god being so silly and saying he's too busy to repeat the short brief statement the Buddha said. 
And then he is busy showing off his palaces. 
And then Muhammad Mughaliyana goes back to the earth, goes back to the Buddha and tells the Buddha, this is what Saka heard and was it accurate? Then the Buddha repeats the whole thing over again a third time. 
So in a storytelling technique is to repeat the most important thing maybe three times just so it sinks in. 
So nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to is the teaching. 
And what would happen to you if you carried that phrase with you through the days and repeated yourself in different situations. 
So you wrote it out and you put it on your desk or on your mirror and dashboard of your car. 
You know, you put it across the screen of your smartphone. 
So every time you kind of looked at your phone or got in your car or something, you saw that. 
Nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. 
What kind of reflections would come up for you? What would you think about? What perspective would it give? Would it give you pause to consider what you're doing? Would it function as a kind of a mirror to help you notice if you are in fact clinging or not? At that moment, are you clinging to anything? If not, then go and be happy. 
But maybe are you attached to something? Are you caught in something? Are you preoccupied in something? And if you are, then ask yourself a question. 
Is it really worthwhile clinging to this? Some people get confused around this kind of question because they assume that if they give up clinging, they have to give up pursuing something or doing something, engaging something. 
But perhaps there is pursuit. 
There is engaging and seeking and doing things, but it can be done without clinging. 
What does clinging add to the situation? Are you better off because you're clinging? Are you more effective because you're clinging? Do you keep things in a more secure way because you're clinging? One of the definitions of freedom that Buddha gives is freedom from bondage, security, be safe from all bondage. 
Clinging is a kind of bondage. 
Some people, that bondage, that grip of their clinging, their attachment, their desire is so strong that it ruins lives. 
People make huge mistakes in their lives sometimes. 
So to spend some time, maybe this next week, with this phrase, nothing, whatsoever, is worth clinging to. 
And if you want to try to tell me, you know, I'm too busy for that. 
You have a lot of important things to do. 
You can't do that. 
Then you can remember the story. 
Even the great God of the heavenly world tried to get away with that one. 
Too busy. 
So, that's the story. 
So any comments, protests? Do you want to try to convince me that there's actually one thing that's important to cling to? Where would you like us to talk about questions, anything? Pass the mic. 
It's just a short question. 
Can you cling to your ideals? Yes. 
I think it's possible to cling to anything you can think about. 
Ideals. 
Some people cling very tightly to ideals, and it messes them up. 
And sometimes it's a problem for everyone else. 
Some of the great political movements that have been a disaster, someone was clinging to ideals. 
But say more, because that's a very interesting question. 
What prompts it for you? I was just wondering what I might cling to. 
What would I put at the top of the list? Oh, your favorite, oh. 
My daughter was high up there, not going to do that. 
And my ideals are things I believe are important, things I really care about. 
That seemed like something I might try to grab on to. 
So part of this investigation is, is there a distinction between commitment or some whole-hearted engagement in ideals versus clinging? What's the difference? Is there a way of being involved in ideals that's supportive and helpful? Is there a way of being involved in ideals which is harmful? I think teasing that apart is part of this investigation. 
Thank you. 
If you can pass the mic over here. 
It seems like, in a sense, bonding is a sort of, can be a sort of unconsciously developed clinging. 
Can you talk a little bit about the difference? Bondage? Bonding to somebody. 
Oh, bonding, yes. 
So I loved one. 
The English, at least here, uses the word bondage. 
So the word bond means to tie something together. 
This is where we have to be very careful with semantics and the meanings of this. 
In Buddhist English, we have our own jargon in Buddhist English. 
And the word attachment is considered like a pretty bad thing in Buddhist English. 
But when my first son was born, my wife went to a local organization here in the Bay Area called Bay Area Attachment Parenting. 
And there's a psychological term called, you know, there's healthy attachment, there's attachment, you know, dysfunctional attachment disorders and things. 
So, you know, exactly what we mean by these words, we have to be a little bit careful. 
If we, too quickly, the word bond looks a little bit too much like attachment and we dismiss it, we might miss some of the healthy connectivity, healthy bonding, healthy relatedness that can happen between people that's actually important, like for children and parents, it's very important. 
And to have that developed strongly. 
I remember one of the times when my son was quite young that I kind of saw this operate, he was a toddler, so he was just beginning to walk. 
But he didn't have much sense of the world. 
And I was walking down the sidewalk in town and I ran into someone I knew. 
So I said hello and he started talking. 
And it was just, you know, it was kind of taken by surprise and engaged in this person I was talking to. 
And then suddenly realized that enough time had gone by, I had no idea where my toddler was on the sidewalk with busy streets and cars. 
And so I immediately spun around. 
I mean my instinct was like I spun around and to look out towards the direction of the street to make sure that he wasn't out in the street. 
I said wow, that was quite an instinct. 
And so that's kind of maybe a, you know, I had kind of a primal bondage with him and so that was probably my job to have that kind of connection. 
But I don't know if that's clinging. 
I was thinking of unwillingness to let go or to lose. 
Given the Buddhist emphasis on the non-permanence, impermanence. 
So you're unwilling to let go and willing to lose something. 
Yeah, that can be painful. 
I mean, if things are going, it's painful to hold on to them when they're already going. 
People hold on. 
That's a fairly common clinging is to not let things go when it's time for them to go. 
And you know, there's the Zen teacher in San Francisco, Shinryu Suzuki Roshi, he defined renunciation as something like accepting, allowing things to go when they go. 
In picking up on the issue of attachment from a psychological perspective, I remember reading the novel, Siddhartha in College, and I don't know how accurate that is in terms of the reputation of his life. 
It's a very accurate depiction of Hermann Hess's imagination. 
But it disturbed me greatly that the Buddha and that story left his family and that the idea that that was an important part of his liberation. 
Yeah, in the ancient story from the ancient times, it said the Buddha also left his family. 
And with the way the myth is told, we don't know exactly if this had happened, but there's all these myths around the Buddha. 
But the myth, the way it's told, is that he left the day his son was born. 
So in our modern sensibility, that's a horrible thing to do. 
We don't know what it meant, and if that's to happen, we don't know what that meant in the ancient world. 
He was supposedly in that myth, kind of royalty. 
There are cultures where a father has very little to do with a child until the child is a certain age. 
There are some cultures where six or seven, that's when the father starts getting involved in the child's life. 
But until then, it's the mother and the women who are involved. 
So exactly, we don't know all the ins and outs of the culture of the time. 
He certainly didn't abandon them to poverty because they were a royal family. 
There are many ways of looking at this and understanding this issue. 
But don't we have examples even in the modern world of young people who decide to leave their families for a great cause? In America, we certainly give high praise to the people who decide to join the military. 
And then they go off, and some of them do leave their family and their kids in order to serve their country. 
And it's considered a great honor and a great thing to do that. 
Some people decide to do things like that for the sake of an education. 
I really need, it's important, I need to go off and I need to get, I'll go to a different country, I'll go to America to get an education, and I'll come back. 
But I know that we have a young child, but this is our future is to go get this. 
In ancient India, there were no schools, there was nothing like this. 
But I can imagine that some people, I've met people who are so deeply stirred up since urgency to try to understand what this is life is about and that the life as it's given to them just doesn't make any sense to them. 
And they are going to, you know, wither up and die if they can't really try to understand and find out and discover what this is all, life is all about and do this in their spiritual education. 
And he might have been one of those people who almost didn't have any choice. 
Maybe he was deeply depressed, who knows what was going on. 
But, you know, I don't think it's too hard to imagine someone whose personal circumstance is such that that kind of choice is the only thing that they can do. 
If we measure, the tendency is when we look at that story, is we see it through the eyes of kind of being a standard family, a standard situation. 
And, you know, there's two or three standard people around it. 
So who knows what was going on. 
But what the stories do continue, that when his son was seven, the Buddha returned to his son's life. 
And then he was the primary parent for the rest of his son's life. 
So we don't think of the Buddha as a parent. 
But he was apparently the primary parent for the rest of his son's growing up. 
And the son became a monk and was happily ever after. 
I wrote an article about how the Buddha taught his son. 
It's on the article page of IMC's website. 
So maybe you have time for one more. 
You know, there's a lot of men have spoken. 
Are there any women who would like to say? So maybe it is. 
At what point is the Dharma itself no longer worth clinging to? Oh, when is the Dharma itself not worth clinging to? Well, that raises the interesting question, when is it worth clinging to? And so, you know, this whole question of what is worth clinging to, you know, it's a great question. 
And sometimes the answer is that for the time being some things are worth clinging to. 
And, you know, if someone has a trouble with addiction, for example, it's better to cling to something that will keep you from drinking, you know, rather than not cling to that and then succumb, for example. 
And sometimes the strong tendencies of the mind and the attachments, the neurosis, the fears, all kinds of them. 
Some people's minds have tremendous challenges and their hearts have challenges. 
And so sometimes we need some stability. 
We need something to hold on to for a while to get our bearings. 
And so sometimes clinging is worthwhile. 
But it's understood to be temporary. 
The people who cling too long, way beyond it's no longer needed, don't become free. 
So that's one possible answer. 
You have something to say about that topic? I was just, what came to mind is survival of clinging. 
Is survival clinging? Yeah. 
I've known people who have trained people how to survive in the wilderness and they say the most important thing you can do is don't panic. 
And panic is a sign of clinging. 
Generally people's minds are more intelligent when they don't cling. 
So in terms of problem-solving. 
So, but you think it can be very brief? Yeah, it's a question about the idea of clinging to love. 
Clinging to love. 
Why is that good? How is that useful for you? Because it's a lot of STS, kind of a universal meaning of goodness to all that renews the universe. 
So clinging to love is kind of like clinging to universal goodness that fills the universe. 
Is it possible to relate to that love, to be involved in it, to be connected to it, maybe even be committed to it without clinging? That's a good point. 
But at least in Buddhist English, clinging is kind of like. 
. 
. 
We say sometimes, you know, the person was clinging to me and it just feels very uncomfortable as someone kind of clawing at us. 
Clinging is a compulsive attachment, compulsive drivenness around something where we can't easily drop it. 
We can't just say stop doing it. 
It just keeps coming back. 
It keeps hounding us. 
It keeps pushing and insisting. 
It's kind of like a little bit of an obsession. 
So please, be devoted to love. 
But my image of clinging to love begins to squeeze the life out of it. 
So great. 
So if you're interested, spend the week with that phrase. 
Nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. 
And see what you learn. 
Thank you.
