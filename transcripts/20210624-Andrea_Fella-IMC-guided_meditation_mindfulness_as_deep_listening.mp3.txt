 Arriving with yourself in this moment. And perhaps allowing a connection with relaxation, which is so supportive for the natural capacity our minds have to be present. To be aware. And the mind is caught up, tense, concerned, worried, thinking about things. It's not usually relaxed. And so relaxation supports this settling back and being available to be with ourselves. To be present with how we are in the moment. So we can perhaps scan through the body and you may take some time to do that. Just checking in various areas of the body and seeing if there can be a softening or releasing of tension. And sometimes it's another way into this exploration of relaxation is rather than doing a conscious body scan and trying to consciously relax. So basically having a, or giving yourself an invitation to relax. This about whether the body, the mind may know how to relax. Sometimes we can drop in an intention or an invitation. May the body relax. And then we don't have to necessarily try to do that. But just see how does that intention land. It's dropping that into your mind and body. May the body relax. And then be available to see what happens. May the body relax. May the mind relax. Does the body and mind come to whatever place they are, however much relaxation is available in this moment. Listening to how you are in this moment. The kind of friendly curiosity. How are you right now? Refriending yourself. A good friend may ask that question of us, how are you? And really mean it. Really be interested in listening to how you are. Our mindfulness practice can be thought of in a way as a deep listening. Listening to how we are in the moment. Not thinking about or trying to figure out how you are, but just settling back and being with yourself. Listening to the body, the mind. Feeling the body, the mind. Listening with the body and mind. There's no need to look for anything in particular, just receiving what the body and mind are telling us or saying in this moment. How are you right now? The friendly, interested, curious, loving attention. Remembering relaxation will support this listening. Just listening.
