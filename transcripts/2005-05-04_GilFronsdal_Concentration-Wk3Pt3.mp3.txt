 In order to develop a practice of concentration, or to develop a capacity of a concentration, it's in part developing a muscle, a strength. So, for example, if you can hang in there for two breaths, then you want to kind of develop the strength to be able to hang in there for four breaths, kind of stretch how long you can hang in there. So certainly the mind gets stronger as you do this. If you spend a lot of time memorizing things, like memorizing the metasuta, you develop a certain strength of capacity to memorize. It becomes easier to memorize the more you do it. You're developing that muscle in a sense. And then parenthetically you might say that memorizing texts, memorizing things, actually helps meditation practice, helps with the concentration, kind of like the same muscle you're using. So there's a strength thing that happens. And that strength is something that you can kind of carry with you into your daily life. It feels like working out in the gym, so you kind of get stronger and you can carry that strength into your daily life. You strengthen your mind. The other side of concentration is learning to soften and let go and relax. And so there's a whole side of learning what to let go of, learning not to be caught by our preoccupations and learning to soften. And both happen together. And in different times you might be learning more the strengthening part, other times the letting go part, the softening part. But both are needed, they happen simultaneously, and both are needed in order to develop Samadhi, the Buddhist tradition. The Buddhist tradition distinguishes different kinds of concentration. So kind of like, perhaps kind of like, I don't know if it's a fair word, but kind of like quantum leaps in concentration. And, or different, you know, right now four categories of concentration that I'm talking about now. There is what's called preparatory concentration. And that's the kind of concentration you need when you're not able to get concentrated. It's the cultivation of concentration, the work of getting concentrated. It's the work of kind of engaging and trying to get concentrated. So the mind wanders, you come back, you focus again. It's preparing yourself to get concentrated, preparing the mind, working the mind. It's called parikama samadhi in Pali. And that's kind of like what happens when you sit down in regular street consciousness. You've been going around in your daily life and you sit down and the mind is a little bit distracted, wild, caught up, agitated. And then you have to apply yourself that initial application of the agitated mind, distracted mind. That kind of concentration in there is called parikama, preparatory concentration. The next kind of concentration is called upachara, I think it's the word upachara samadhi, which upachara means neighborhood vicinity, or access. It's access concentration. It's that concentration you need that opens the door for the possibility of going quantum leap into the next level of concentration. And the word also has the meaning of neighborhood. You're in the neighborhood of getting concentrated. And this access concentration is a concentration when there's no longer any distractions that keep you from being concentrated. The hindrances, the concentration, are no longer operating for you. So nothing's hindering the ability to be focused. You're kind of in a groove, it's possible to stay there. The mind might wander away a little bit into thought, but it's kind of like there's a rubber band attached to your thoughts. And you just come right back. You kind of go out, but the rubber band stretches and then pulls you right back. Mostly you kind of stay there, you can be one-pointed focused. It can often come with a sense of well-being, a little bit of joy or delight, a sense of now you're kind of in the groove, you're there, you're present. And there's not really anything that's going to pull you away. No distractions anymore, particularly. No hindrances can get in the way. That is kind of a door, or say this way, and access concentration is a fork in the road for meditation practice. And there's two directions a person might choose to go. One is the person could go into doing Vipassana practice, mindfulness practice. Because in order to do mindfulness practice really deeply, really thoroughly, you need to have the obstacles or the hindrances to concentration settled out. They're no longer grabbing the mind, holding onto the mind. And then when that mind has this clarity in the groove of being concentrated, then it can go into developing further mindfulness, more careful investigation of what your experience is. The other fork is not to do any investigation at all of our experience, but rather to develop full absorption, full concentration, one pointed concentration on one object. And this doesn't involve investigating or understanding anything, it just means kind of plunging in or diving in or abandoning oneself into what the object of focus is. So the word that's nice in English is become absorbed in what you're focused on. And like absorbed in a good book, you get absorbed in your breath. And this stage of absorption then has, again, different stages, different quantum kind of steps as you go through, as you go deeper and deeper, higher, higher, more and more concentrated. And these are what's called the jhanas or the absorptions. And there's eight of them. And we'll talk about them next week. So there's three basic phases. There's the preparatory phase, there's the access phase when you kind of arrive at the door of being able to do something with your mind, and then there's either getting absorbed or going into greater mindfulness practice. So the initial stage is the preparatory stage. A lot of that has to do with working with the obstacles to concentration. And there are a lot of obstacles to getting concentrated, which some of you have probably gotten a hint at already. It's pretty unusual person who can sit down and just get concentrated, get absorbed. Occasionally you meet people who for whatever reason are like the berry bonds of meditation. And they just seem to have some kind of inner capacity, just like, you know, wow, that person did it. Most people do not have an easy time getting concentrated. So most of you, I think, hopefully will take that as an encouragement rather than discouragement, that your difficulties in getting concentrated are completely normal. Most people have a difficult time getting concentrated. And it's possible to develop your capacity of concentration. It takes time, it takes effort, it takes knowledge, experience and wisdom to do it. But you have to do it, it'll come. Most of the people who are good meditators, most of the great realized practitioners of the past, were like you and they had trouble with the concentration. Whatever trouble you're having is normal. If you ever watch a baby learn to walk, most babies have trouble with that. Very few, they just get up and they're just like, hey, I'm ready to go, let's go for a hike. You know, they kind of take one or two steps and they fall down, you know, and then they try it again and they take another couple of steps and they fall down. There's a lot of falling down, they wobble and they trip and they, you know, it's a mess. For some reason, that's probably necessary. Very few of these toddlers get discouraged. They just hang in there and they keep doing it and keep doing it and keep doing it. And eventually they kind of are walking. So for people who have never tried to cultivate their minds, their minds are like babies. And learning to develop concentration then is a lot of faltering, a lot of falling down, a lot of obstacles, a lot of difficulties that arise. Please don't get discouraged by that. You just have to keep trying and keep trying, keep working and keep working on it and things will come along, things will gather together and support your ability to concentrate. So what this means though is that obstacles, hindrances, difficulties in concentration, to concentration are normal. And anybody who wants to develop concentration has to learn how to work with the difficulties that might arise. And so this whole preparatory part stage of meditation is a lot of that has to do with learning how to be wise and skillful with the obstacles to concentration and the difficulties that arise. So in saying this, I want to emphasize that in order to develop ability to get concentrated, you have to have a lot of experiences with the obstacles to concentration so you can become wise about them. What that means is that you're not going to get concentrated really fast. You're not going to sit down and boom, there you go. You're going to try to get concentrated, you can engage in the practice and the mind will get stronger day by day. But you have to have hopefully a sense of welcoming or feeling of appropriateness and learning to understand and explore and work with the very factors and make it difficult to get concentrated. So there's many things that might happen. One of the things is your thoughts, your thinking. And so you have to develop certain kind of wisdom around thoughts through your own experience. You can certainly hear what teachers have to say or read books about it. But a lot of it is really looking at your own thinking mind and working with it and understanding it and negotiating how it is. I think whenever possible, its best policy is not to be bothered by your thoughts. Being bothered by your thoughts is one of the great hindrances to getting concentrated. You're not going to get concentrated if you're bothered by your thoughts. So don't be. Easier said, right? It's really easy to be a teacher. You just say things and then the practitioner has to kind of deal with it to look with it. So that idea of don't be bothered by your thoughts. Meditators sometimes are bothered by them and then they just agitate themselves some more. So if there's thinking in the background, don't worry about it. Keep the breath in the foreground. Long as you keep the breath in the foreground, don't worry so much about what's in the background. Maybe it'll settle down by itself eventually. Or if thinking is in the foreground and really prevents you from getting concentrated, don't get agitated or don't get judgmental about that. Just kind of, okay, this is what I have to work with. A lot of the things I teach in the mindfulness class about working with thoughts apply here, where you need to learn to understand the emotional ground that the thoughts arise out of. If thoughts are really bothering your meditation, there's probably some mood or emotional ground that's giving rise to the thoughts you're having. So if you're planning a lot, there's probably a ground of worry. You can tune into the emotional ground, then it's more easy to settle the thinking pattern and work with that and resolve that. Sometimes there's the energetics, there's tension in the body connected to thinking. Sometimes you want to look and see where the tension is and then relax the tension. Soften, give yourself a massage. So there might be tension in the jaw, or in the forehead, or in the brain, or in the skull someplace, or in the shoulders. Many different places it might manifest. Sometimes you need to relax that, soften that. Maybe as you breathe out, just relax, relax. To relax the thinking energy that's there. You can let go of thoughts forever, but if the thinking energy is wound up, it will just keep pumping out thoughts. So what is it that needs to be settled and be relaxed? One of the ways of relaxing is to use the breath as a relaxation technique. Every time you breathe out, relax, relax. Remembering if you do too much of it, you fall asleep. A useful skill around thoughts sometimes is to say no to them. Sometimes thoughts are like little kids and they need limits. Little kids, they really like limits. So they might take you for 30 seconds for setting limits, but they actually feel a lot happier because they know what the boundaries are. They find there's a good place in the world. So sometimes our minds are like little babies and little kids. You should say no, we're not going to think about that. That really can be sometimes very effective, very solid. No, not now. Sometimes it's soft, not now. Some people use the image of noticing what they're thinking about. They say, well, I notice what I'm thinking about. I'm going to shelve it. They take their hand up and put those thoughts up on a shelf. I'm going to shelve it and later I'll think about it. That's enough to let the mind put it aside for now. Then you can keep going. Occasionally with thoughts, if there's a lot of thinking going on, and you can't stop your thinking, sometimes what you can do is give up. In a sense that you're thinking, I can't do anything about my thinking. I can't stop my thinking. My thinking is not going to, I can't stop it or let go of it so I can stay focused on the breath. What you do then is you go along with the thinking, but you start thinking about useful things. Just start thinking, okay, I'm going to think. Maybe start thinking about your breath. What's that breath like? I wonder, just kind of create a whole thought world around your breath. If you're going to think anyway, might as well think about the breath. Or think things that are useful or healthy. Think about wholesome things or skillful things. Think about nice things. If you can't stop thinking, maybe you could choose what you think about. At least think about something pleasant. Think about something nice and just think away. Chances are, if you think about something nice for a while, or if you think about the breath, that whatever's been agitating you will settle down and relax a little bit. That's a useful thing to do. Another thing occasionally that can be useful to do, and you have to have a lot of wisdom for knowing when this is, but occasionally it's appropriate is to, the ancient texts say, clench your teeth and just kind of bear down. I don't know if you have to necessarily clench your teeth, but sometimes you just kind of get really, even tight, kind of really solid, kind of directed and kind of, I'm just going to stay with the breath. I'm not going to leave my opposite options of focus. Kind of really kind of hold on tight. If you're in a big storm and on a boat and the boat's being swayed back and forth and the big waves are breaking over the boat and the wind is pushing you around, you hold on tight. Don't you? You hold on really tight and that's appropriate. Occasionally in meditation that's appropriate, but it's only very occasionally, because sometimes you can get in trouble doing that kind of approach. So someone has to do with the whole understanding of the world of thinking. Part of this having wisdom about thoughts, understanding that it's not useful to spend time in meditation thinking. As one teacher has said, nothing whatsoever is worth thinking about while you meditate. So to really be convinced that thinking about the various things you can think about is not really useful, not well spent time during the period you're meditating. To really be convinced about that, so you're willing then to put it aside later. No, not now. I'll let go and come back. If you're not really convinced and that's so, why would you want to let go of your thinking? Your psyche is going to keep going there. So to have the wisdom to understand this is not useful now and have the wisdom perhaps understand it is useful to develop concentration. There's a lot of benefit that comes from it. So that takes a lot of time maybe to kind of get a handle on the world of thinking. And that's one of the things we need to do as we develop our ability to get concentrated. The other thing that might happen is it turns out that your psyche, your mind is agitated for particular reasons. And until you take care of those reasons, the mind is not going to get settled. And if sometimes you keep pushing, trying to get concentrated without taking care of some of the reasons for being distracted, agitated, it's not going to work. So you might need to do a moral inventory. You might have to look at some of your things in your life that you've kind of unresolved issues. Maybe you need to go and resolve some of them. And one example of this is my friend John Travis, who was meditating in India in the 60s. And he was long retreats, very dedicated practitioner. And at some point, he was having trouble with his meditation practice. And he was having some thoughts about his father. And he went to Ramdas in India at that time and explained what was going on. And Ramdas said, oh, enough of this meditation. You need to go back to Kentucky and visit your father. And Ramdas said, don't stay too long. And so John Travis went and cut his hair and got a suit made and went to Kentucky and saw his father and entered his father's world and kind of had a kind of resolution about his relationship with his father. And once that was resolved, he was able to go back to India and continue on his practice. Some people who meditate think meditation is supposed to solve all our problems. Sometimes meditation shows us that something we have to take care of things in other areas of our life in order to get it. It's not so uncommon for new meditators to have memories of earlier times in their life come up. And sometimes those memories have to do with transgressions or pain that cause other people. And people realize, oh, you know, I need to go apologize because it's still kind of sitting. I didn't realize it was still sitting deeply lodged in my heart, this unresolved issues. The fact that I lied or stole. And the heart's simply not going to open up or relax or do what it needs to do in order to get concentrated until somehow you make amends to heal the kind of relationship. So it can be kind of funny. You call up someone after 30 years and say, you know, it's Gil and I want to apologize for what I said. I lied to you or something and Gil who? You know, or sometimes people don't want to, sometimes you call someone up and they don't want to talk to you. They're still angry with you. That's their issue. They don't want to talk to you. But the fact that you made the effort, maybe all you need to do to settle your heart, but kind of a cleansing of your moral life is sometimes a necessary thing to do or your interpersonal life, resolving things. Sometimes that's what becomes clear. Some meditators will go to therapy when they come to a certain area of their life where they just can't go get concentrated. So that's an obstacle that might happen. Other obstacles might be, you know, how we live our lives. If our lives are really stressful, then we might think it'd be good to get concentrated and calm through meditation. But actually there's a very close relationship to being able to get concentrated and living a life that's supportive of concentration. So you might have, some people might have to look at how they're living their lives and maybe try to figure out some way to change their lives, to make it more supportive of developing the kind of health that can come from a concentrated mind. So you might need to sleep more, get more sleep, watch less television, go to fewer horror movies. You may find different work occasionally. Maybe certain kinds of professions are so driven, or the way we're engaging them, so driven, so ambitious, so toxic, that maybe that environment is simply not compatible with beginning to kind of open up and relax and soften and get concentrated. So some people need to kind of, in order to settle some of the obstacles of concentration, really need to kind of look at their wider life and take care of that, settle that, live a less stressful life, live a more ethical life. Some people need to exercise. If the body is not in some kind of decent shape, it's very hard to get concentrated in a deep way. I think the body needs, it's helpful for the body to be in basically kind of, you know, it doesn't have to be, you know, kind of Schwarzenegger kind of shape. But you know, just a little bit, you know, it needs to be a little bit of, you know, good operating order. Actually getting too much exercise can be detrimental for developing a strong concentration practice. But you need to have the body a little bit in good shape. So looking at the rest of a life is sometimes helpful. Sometimes there are psychological issues of how we relate to ourselves and how we see ourselves. So it's not really a relationship to other people, but a relationship to ourselves, they're the obstacle. And sometimes they can be settled through meditation practice and dealt with that way. But sometimes they can't. And sometimes you need to do something. And it could be a variety of things that somehow you deal with the psychological issues of your life. So for example, there's a lot of self hate, or self lack of self esteem, or a lot of fear, or a lot of something. Maybe that has to be dealt with outside of meditation. And sometimes fear, if we drop kind of the surface consciousness of the mind, the mind settles to some degree. Some people are surprised at how much fear there can be, and how pervasive it is in our psyche. And so sometimes meditation can help and you can work through to the meditation. And sometimes you need to maybe do some kind of work therapy or something else to work with some of these psychological issues so that the mind can get concentrated. Classically in Buddhism, there are lists of hindrances to concentration. And the most classic list is called the five hindrances. And happens to be the newsletter article this month is on the five hindrances. So if you haven't read it, you can read it now. It'll go into it. The five hindrances are one of the most talks in the five hindrances, are probably the most common talk given on meditation retreats that we teach. Every retreat gets a talk about the five hindrances. And that's because they're so common. They're so common that it's best not to take them as being personal failings. They're just what the mind does. And we have to learn how to work with it. The mind tends to be very driven by desire, very driven by feelings of ill will or aversion. And driven means it gets caught up in into those worlds of desire worlds of ill will, and gets caught up with restlessness and anxiety, gets caught up in sloth and torpor, resistance, lethargy, and gets caught up in the world of doubt. And these are very very important mental factors that every good meditator needs to start getting a handle on. The deeper the meditation goes, the deeper the concentration goes up into the point of access concentration, the reason why the Buddhist tradition lists the five hindrances as being kind of the fundamental hindrances to concentration is that even when a lot of other things are settled and the mind is starting to get concentrated and calm and relaxed, these are very tricky. It's so tricky the mind can still kind of go off into wanting things to be nicer, more comfortable, or holding on to comfort in a way that prevents concentration, or involve very subtle movements of ill will, or subtle moves of aversion to what's going on, or something, or very subtle movements of doubt. And so good meditators need to understand the world of what's called the five hindrances and learn how to work with them. We can work with them through mindfulness. Sometimes when we're doing concentration practice we need to switch sometimes and let go of the concentration practice and do mindfulness for a while, explore these things and kind of settle them. Sometimes things get settled by just ignoring them and just staying with the concentration object and just know they're there and kind of have the wisdom not get caught by them and stay focused and involved. And sometimes we need to do some things like develop the antidotes to the hindrances. So for example, if you're lost in a phenomenal bout of lust, I'm sure it doesn't happen to any of you, it does occasionally happen to people. You can do this in a playful way, a creative way, rather than in a puritanical way. But you might imagine your object of lust that you have, and then kind of look at them and their body in unusual angles like, kind of imagine those parts of the bodies which are unappetizing. The tradition talks about snot, bile, spittle, feces, urine. Most people find certain aspects of the human anatomy to be unappetizing. And so if you do this in a playful, creative way rather than a puritanical way, it can help you with your bouts of lust. And it might be a useful thing to do sometimes. If there's a lot of ill will, maybe it's useful to cultivate loving kindness, to do some loving kindness practice and bring some more friendliness and kindness and goodwill into the picture and soften the heart and relax some things. So sometimes the antidotes kind of settle something out, relax something. With sloth and torpor, sometimes the antidotes classically is light. So it can be physically, it can turn on the light and have light coming into your eyelids or sit in front of a bright window, but have some way to kind of do something that brings energy back into the system. You can be creative with the antidotes. Doubt is a very powerful one, and faith is the antidote to doubt, confidence is. So try to arouse, do something that brings faith and confidence. Sometimes doing a reading before you sit can help with that. Read some kind of inspiring passage. That can be useful sometimes. Or sometimes you are under mindfulness and explore the area of doubt, what's really going on there. I think it's best when working with the obstacles to concentration to feel like you have permission to be creative, maybe even playful, around working with these. If you have the idea that this is a terrible burden and unfortunately this should be happening and the drag is embarrassing, these things are happening, or it's a sign of personal failure, you have to overcome them as quickly as possible if you can because there's a marathon race going on, you're trying to get concentrated faster than everybody else. Those kind of attitudes are not so useful, but maybe you have a feeling of, oh, what's creative about this? What can I learn from this? What's the opportunities in exploring this? How can I be playful with this? That maybe is a much more nicer attitude to have about meditation. It's a lot easier than to develop concentration if you have that kind of more lighter attitude of what's going on. Wow, look at that. I just criticized myself again. Isn't that amazing? I wonder, how can I work with this self-criticism? Sometimes, don't follow my example here, but I'll give you an example of a creative approach to meditation. Sometimes I've imagined thoughts as being like a ping pong ball and awareness is like the paddle, knocking it away, or like pinball. I like pinball a lot. As a kid, I played a lot of pinball machine, so you kind of imagine that the mind's kind of like a pinball machine. I don't know if that's wise exactly, but it was creative, it was fun, playful, and it's certainly better than some of the alternative ways people relate to their minds. And if you have that more lighter spirit for what you're doing, it's a lot easier than some grim idea of what you're doing. One of the obstacles to concentration is not enjoying what you're doing. Meditation is not always pleasant, or not always good news. But hopefully you have some sense that this is a satisfying thing to do, or a good thing to do, or a beautiful thing to do, or a phenomenally valuable thing to do, a dignified thing to do. The Buddhist tradition talks about a nobility. It's a really noble thing to do, to engage in this kind of practice. To engage in this kind of practice of concentration and mindfulness meditation. And to really feel some inspiration about, this is really a valuable, wonderful thing to do. It's some satisfaction from that, some joy from that, some delight in it, some inspiration from it that can help. Meditation is seldom... developing of concentrated states, concentration, development of meditation, is not a linear process. And often we kind of linear focus in the sense that I'm getting calmer, things are going nicer, there's a good meditation, it's only going to get better, right? It doesn't work that way. Sometimes it goes in... it's more like spirals, or more like it goes up and down. And so you can expect that there'll be times of deepening concentration, and then times when it's going to be really hard, and then deepening, and then hard. And part of the reason, as I talked about earlier, is that as you're purifying the mind, concentration practice, the purification process, you begin dislodging things that are embedded in your heart, that have been embedded for a long time, and that dislodging process dislodges something which is difficult to deal with for a while. And it's not so uncommon for people to say, what happened? I've gone so far backwards, I'm so agitated now. They're really going backwards, it's now they're dealing with more difficult stuff. And so they have to work through that, and before they can kind of get settled again and get concentrated again. Probably the most useful advice around working with obstacles, working with the difficulties beginning concentrated, is to have a tremendous respect for continuity. With tremendous respect, we're just hanging in there and keep doing it. Practicing and practicing, maintaining momentum, day in, day out, just practicing and practicing and practicing. Don't measure the success of your meditation on a daily basis, a weekly basis, or even a monthly basis. We're just kind of hanging in there, doing it day after day after day. The rhythm, the continuity, the momentum that gets built up is very, very, very helpful. And there might be obstacles you're working with for a long time, but in fact, if you're just hanging in there and making that effort, you're concentrated every day to kind of, you know, there's a kind of concentration just to show up every day to be there, kind of certain kind of commitment. And just to follow through, continuity is one of the great secret supports, secret supports to developing concentration. And so I'll end with this analogy. I hope I didn't give it earlier. Do I give the analogy of rubbing sticks to make fire to you? I teach so much, I don't know where I said what. But if you want to make fire by rubbing sticks together, you know, you rub for a while and they start getting warm sticks. And then I said, I think I'll take a break now. And you come back after a while and you try it again. I think, you know, I'll go have some tea. You come back after a while and you start again. You know, well, now I need to go pee. You're never going to build up enough heat to create a spark. So what you have to do is you have to kind of the continuity, you have to stay there long enough till a spark happens. So with meditation practice, also, you have to have the continuity when you build momentum. And that happens in many different levels. But for people who sit every day, sitting every day, day in, day out, starts creating certain kind of momentum. And it might take a while, but eventually something begins getting warm enough by doing that. So continuity is very, very important. And a lot of things will get organized. A lot of things will settle. A lot of things will kind of reorganize themselves around your continuous practice, you know, psychically in your mind. A lot of the obstacles are going to work themselves out. It's really phenomenal to me how much the psyche will work itself out, even itself out, smooth itself out, as a person does a regular meditation practice. You don't have to get involved and negotiate everything. You should do the continuity and the regularity. Regularity is regular, regular, regular. So then at some point, the hindrances fall away. The hindrances don't fall away permanently, but at some point they're no longer getting in the way. And at that point, the hindrances are not there and the mind is able to maintain at one point of focus, the present. Then a person is attained what's called access concentration. And the different Buddhist traditions, different Buddhist teachers have different definitions or ways of characterizing access concentration. But the primary one that everyone shares is that the hindrances are no longer there. There's nothing really in the way of getting concentrated anymore. A person's there. You're here. It can feel very nice. It can feel very wonderful because we're no longer fragmented. We're no longer in conflict with ourselves. The mind is no longer racing off in different directions. There's a kind of healing that happens when everything is here and you're able to be present and focused and concentrated. And that is the doorway to going into states of absorption, which are what we'll talk about. One of the things we'll talk about next week. So thank you very much. I'd like to say that if you don't know about it, our center here has a website called audioDharma.org. There's a link to it from our regular website. And a lot of talks given here, the audio are there. You can download them and listen to them on your computer. And if you miss one of the concentration classes, I don't know how quickly this is making it up there, but the last concentration in the class I taught two, three years ago is up there. And so if you miss the second or the third or fourth week, it's kind of similar, you know, what happens in different weeks. So you could kind of listen to it there, get a little different take on it from last time I did it. Thank you very much.
