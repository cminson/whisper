The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

We've been exploring over the last weeks the teachings on mindfulness from the Buddha,
the teachings in the Satipatanasuta.
And last week we started exploring the exercise in the fourth foundation,
or the instructions in the fourth foundation, around exploring experience through the perspective,
or the framework, or we could say the lens of the Four Noble Truths.
This exercise in the fourth foundation says that we should observe our experience
looking at or understanding in the present moment these four areas or aspects of experience.
So the framing of the text says something like, well, I'll read it.
I'll say it says something like, I'll read it.
So the translation that I'm reading is from Bhikkhu Bodhi,
and he, for the fourth foundation, uses this word mind objects,
which is an odd kind of language a little bit, you know, what are mind objects.
But the word it's translating is dhamma, which often simply means experience or phenomena.
It has other meanings as well, but in this context it appears to simply mean no experience.
Be with phenomena is in the present moment.
And so how does one abide contemplating phenomena in terms of the Four Noble Truths?
How does one abide contemplating phenomena as phenomena in terms of the Four Noble Truths?
One understands as it actually is, this is suffering.
One understands as it actually is, this is the origin or the arising of suffering.
One understands as it actually is, this is the cessation of suffering.
One understands as it actually is, this is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.
So as we explored last week, the language here.
It's language of understanding.
It's language of understanding in our direct experience,
what is suffering?
What is that experience of suffering?
And this language also,
because it says understands as it actually is,
this is really an insight.
Now we can recognize experience as suffering
and have it not be terribly insightful.
It might just be, wow, I'm really angry
and I've gotta figure out how to get rid of this problem
as opposed to with this teaching.
And it's not to say that it's not useful to explore
and understand or like how to work
with the external world in our lives.
And yet this teaching is pointing
to understanding the experience.
This experience here right now, this is suffering.
This is painful, this is stressful.
And so that's the orientation to understanding.
So when, for instance, something like anger is arising,
we might understand this is anger and it's a problem
or we might understand this is the experience of anger.
So it's kind of different ways of being aware
of the same phenomena, same experience.
That understanding of this is what it's like
to have the experience of anger,
doesn't preclude acting and like changing the environment
to say, alter some situations, alter the environment.
But it's rather than acting out of the reactivity of anger,
there's the container in which there's the understanding
of what anger is, how it functions, how it ripples out,
how it tends to perpetuate anger.
And there may be different responses that would arise
through that understanding.
And so there's sometimes is a misunderstanding
in what mindfulness is.
I mean, mindfulness is simply, mindfulness is simply
this recognition of kind of the reflective of,
this is what's happening in the present moment
as an experience in the present moment.
But people often take that teaching to mean,
and you don't do anything with it, and you don't respond.
And so the, what I found at least in my own practice
is that when I'm more available to really know
what is here in the present moment,
there's more wisdom available to respond in a skillful way.
And so this pointing to the direct understanding
can, of what suffering is, can open us to some wisdom
that may be here in our system, in our hearts and minds,
to, in terms of a way to respond that may be very different
than if we were just responding right out
of the reactivity of that suffering.
So the understanding or the direct understanding
this is suffering, a valuable understanding,
not only for ourselves, but also for the world,
because it can affect or influence how we respond
to that suffering, how, what steps we take,
what actions follow.
So understanding it as it actually is, this is suffering.
This is the arising of suffering
and the next understanding.
The first insight or understanding is really
just kind of noticing or knowing
the direct experience of suffering in the present moment.
It may not come with a lot of like detailed understanding
of how it happened or what the causes were
or what the triggers were, but there's just this like,
wow, that hurts, this is what it feels like.
So I'm gonna go through these four insights
with respect to one understanding I had very early
in my practice and I did, I talk about this insight a lot
because it was such a seminal understanding
in my practice.
It was like probably two months
into my starting meditation practice.
And this first understanding around this is suffering.
So what I was exploring was anger.
There was a particular anger at a particular person
or something that they did.
And boy, I was really angry, really, really angry.
And it was kind of consuming my life,
really making me non-functional at times.
I would find myself frozen sitting in front of the computer
and not able to even think about anything
other than the anger and what was happening here.
And then I got a little bit of instruction around,
well, notice, can you notice this experience
as experience in the present moment?
And I was a complete newbie to this whole thing,
complete, like I didn't understand quite
how it would make any difference.
In fact, wouldn't it make it worse
to be aware that I was angry?
And so, but I kind of hit bottom
because I was so torqued out from this anger.
So just like, okay, well, I'll give this a try.
Nothing else has worked, so let me give this a try.
And I started just seeing if I could notice.
Yep, this is what it's like to be angry.
And there over a couple of months, just that exploration,
just noticing this, this is what it's like to be angry.
I began to notice that this was suffering.
I had not really clearly, I mean, it was kind of,
I remember being at one point where I was,
what I was doing, and it's like, oh my gosh, you know,
I somehow thought this anger was helping me.
It is very painful.
That is kind of a little bit of that understanding
or that insight.
This is suffering, you know, that the mind
and its reactivity in the reactivity to anger
thought the anger was making me feel better
by making somebody else feel worse.
And then as I began to experience
or feel into the experience of anger right here and now,
that understanding of, oh, this hurts me.
This is painful here.
So that was, that's that kind of flavor
of that this is suffering.
And there, you know, it's really just a very kind of
almost direct and visceral kind of experience.
These insights or understandings tend to be
direct experiential understandings.
So I spent a couple of months really getting familiar
with that, getting familiar with
what is this experience of anger
and how is it, you know, how has it felt as suffering?
And just that, just that exploration was very powerful
because I did notice over the course of a couple of months
that the anger started, like it's like the mindfulness
broke in to the pattern of anger earlier
and earlier in the cycle of anger.
And so I was not as angry by the time I noticed
that I was angry and I began to notice
it's not as painful to be not as angry.
You know, yeah, it's still painful, but it's boy,
was it painful when I was in that rage?
And so there was some learning that happened there
around that first noble truth.
And one thing that I'm pointing to here,
I'm gonna kind of step back and kind of make,
set a little context for this because at the end
of the last class last time, somebody asked the question
about why the order of these four noble truths?
Now, wouldn't it make more sense?
The four noble truths, this is suffering,
this is the arising of suffering,
this is the ceasing of suffering,
this is the way leading to the ceasing of suffering.
And the question was, don't we have to know the way first?
And why is that insight last?
Or why is that one stated as the fourth noble truth?
And I gave some responses to that, you know,
some variations on responses to that,
different understandings for why it might be,
the path leading to the ending of suffering
doesn't start the whole teaching of the four noble truths.
But then as I was reflecting on this after the class,
I was remembering this experience that I'd had.
And it struck me as I remembered through
this whole experience of the insights
that happened around the anger that they happened
in the order of the four noble truths as they're stated.
So like for instance, at the beginning,
I kind of, I had some learning understanding
about the way, right?
I had somebody tell me, it's helpful to be mindful
of anger as anger, that was the way that, you know,
so there was some of that.
There was a wisdom, somebody had sent me a book
and it's like, okay, well, I can try this,
but I didn't have insight into that.
It was just kind of taking it on faith
and that's not a small thing to take it on faith.
I was willing to engage,
but I didn't have the direct understanding
that it was helpful, that it would be helpful.
As I began practicing, I began seeing the value
of what I was doing because I was noticing
I was less angry over time, you know,
the anger was reducing,
but I still didn't have the direct like,
oh, this is what, you know, this is the path.
I didn't have that until much later.
So this first understanding around this is suffering.
This really came first.
This was the first thing when I started,
took that instruction, be aware of your anger.
That was the first thing that happened.
I noticed, wow, that's painful.
This is suffering.
And then I began seeing the value of that recognition.
And that recognition is pretty simple kind of insight,
you know, it's not a very complex mental,
like seeing a lot of detail.
It's kind of like, ah, that hurts.
You know, so sometimes these insights are very simple.
Just that hurts.
This is suffering right here and now.
So that insight into suffering
can be a pretty simple insight.
Sometimes I think with insights, we think about,
or we think that our understandings,
in order to have understandings,
in order for insights to be, quote, real,
they have to be really complicated,
or they have to be, you know, seeing a lot of detail.
And in my own experience, sometimes they're really simple.
And I think around this insight of this is suffering,
it can be really simple.
So continuing the exploration around the anger
in my first couple of months of practice.
And also, by the way, I was doing this in my daily life
rather than in sitting primarily.
So the understanding of seeing,
this is how anger comes to be.
That was a couple of months later.
And that came more clearly in a way
because this is the story I tell a lot.
I was just in my kitchen,
I was cutting an apple with a knife.
And, you know, I wasn't trying to be mindful so much,
but I think by this point,
because I'd spent a couple of months
really attuning the mindfulness to the anger.
You know, so like the mindfulness was real,
it was almost like anger was a mindfulness bell.
As soon as anger came up, it was like mindfulness
was right there with it.
And so that's a great thing, actually.
It really helps the ability and the capacity
to respond more skillfully when the mindfulness
comes up more quickly with that challenge.
And so I was just in my kitchen, I was cutting an apple,
and not particularly trying to be mindful,
not looking for anything in particular.
But as I cut that apple, I noticed in that moment,
so this was where the seeing, the mindfulness,
revealed a lot more complexity and a lot more detail.
So I noticed as I cut the apple,
a memory arose in my mind about being with the person
I was angry with at a fruit stand some years before.
So a memory arose about that person.
And I saw how the mind kind of wanted to jump
on that memory about that person
and think more thoughts to kind of gear up the anger.
So there was a kind of an impulsion
in the direction of anger.
I saw that before the anger happened.
So I'm describing this, it takes a lot of words
to describe this, this happened in a split second.
So I saw the, I was cutting the apple,
I saw the memory, I saw the impulse to anger.
And the next thing I saw was not something,
again, none of this was something I did,
but the next thing I saw was the mind recognize,
heading towards anger, that's gonna hurt.
I don't think so.
And so the mind right in that moment saw both,
how the suffering was coming into being.
So the kind of the impulse of the direction,
the arising of suffering, the origin of suffering.
It saw the trigger being the apple, the memory,
the thought of the person and the intention
to think more thoughts and get angry at the person.
So the intention to anger was there,
but the anger wasn't yet there.
But there was a direct,
there's a really clear understanding in that moment
that intention to anger is going to lead to anger.
So that's kind of seeing the arising,
the conditions that lead to the arising of suffering.
That's that second understanding that's pointed to.
Also in that moment,
the mind understanding,
that's gonna lead to suffering.
Something in the system,
like this was where the wisdom that had been developing
over the previous months of seeing anger
and understanding right inside the being,
this is gonna hurt, this is suffering.
The mind let go of that intention
to that direction to anger.
So essentially what happened in that next moment
was I was kind of waiting to get angry
or kind of I saw that the mind didn't have to,
that what the mind said is,
I don't have to jump on that train.
And I didn't, the mind did not jump on that train,
but I kind of didn't believe that that was possible.
I kind of thought that I had no choice
but I had to get on that train
and it was gonna happen whether I wanted to or not,
but it didn't happen.
And I attribute that to the wisdom of the practice
because it wasn't a choice I could have made.
And so right in that moment, also seeing,
I wouldn't call it the cessation of anger,
but I would call it the non-arising of anger there.
So that there was the cessation of the intention to anger,
which followed then by not anger, not arising.
And so that's in the terrain of that third understanding,
the ending of anger, in that moment,
the mind saw and understood anger's not happening.
So right there in that split second,
seeing the second understanding of how anger comes to be
and that it doesn't have to follow
if the intention is released.
That's seeing that those two insights.
So again, the first understanding was this is suffering.
There was a lot of time I spent in that terrain.
And then this moment of understanding,
of seeing the thought arise from the apple,
the thought, the memory, the intention, seeing all of that.
Now that's a more complicated kind of insight, right?
I mean, it's seeing a lot of detail.
And it was very powerful to see that.
It was very powerful to see how the intention
would lean to anger and that the mind let it go.
It was really powerful to see all of that.
And so sometimes I think that kind of insight,
I definitely over the course of my early practice,
especially, preference that kind of insight.
It's like, I thought that was where it was at.
I had to see all the detail.
But then I began to understand actually some
of the more basic understandings of like,
wow, this is suffering, very powerful.
That just the simplicity of that insight.
And also subsequently in more recent years,
one of the ways the insight around the ending
of suffering has been happening
is just feeling or seeing something let go.
Feeling and feeling a suffering kind of just,
pfft, letting go like there's kind of the recognition
of the suffering and the ending of it
just in the same moment almost, just feeling that.
And sometimes it almost feels like it can release before.
I've even noticed the suffering.
It's not something let go.
And I didn't even know what it was.
I hadn't known there was suffering there.
But there was this feeling of release,
this feeling of something letting go.
And there's not a lot of detail either around what let go
or how it let go or what the conditions
for the letting go were.
It's just the release and the understanding
there was suffering that was released.
So sometimes that third noble truth
can also be experienced as a really simple understanding.
Just pfft, wow.
Suffering's not happening right now.
And the kind of delight and joy that can come with that.
So to continue the story around this split,
a few split seconds in my practice,
early in my practice.
So having seen the mind,
having seen mindfulness watch all of this unfold
and not go to anger.
In that the next, as I said,
I was kind of waiting for anger to come.
You know, it's like I was standing there,
still had the knife in my hand.
And it's like, oh my gosh, anger is not gonna come up.
And I think, my memory is that I sank to my knees
in gratitude for understanding or seeing away
a possible path towards not having to be ruled by my anger.
So that next moment was like, wow, this is,
I understand now how this works.
I understand, it's like I saw
that it's not something I do right in that moment.
It's like I saw something, it's not something I do.
But I saw something, I saw something.
I saw something, I saw something.
In that moment, it was like, I saw something, it's not something I do.
But it's coming out of the conditions
of practicing mindfulness and being curious about suffering,
being curious about experience
as present moment experience.
This release from suffering came about
because of that practice.
And the appreciation and the knowing of that was like,
oh, this is the way, this is the path, this is helpful.
That's that fourth understanding, that fourth insight.
This is the way leading to the ending of suffering.
There was a direct understanding that it was the way.
A direct insight that this works.
I don't think we get that insight.
I mean, like the early part of understanding
something about the path and understanding
something about the way was being told,
be mindful of, in my case, anger when it's happening.
And so there was some willingness to pick that up,
but there was not an understanding.
At that moment of having seen what happened
with the mindfulness being present
and the letting go of the movement towards anger,
there was a direct understanding of this is the way.
And there was almost like an internal alignment with,
yeah, this path, I'm gonna be on this path.
I'm gonna walk this path because this is helpful.
So that understanding into the path,
it's like it wasn't the very ending
of my suffering around anger.
But it was kind of like, I stepped onto,
fully stepped onto, this is how anger can really weaken
in my life.
So really fully stepped onto the path in that moment.
And that then spurred kind of like more interest
in being aware of suffering when it arises,
being aware of what I could learn about how it arises
and how it might come to the ending.
So these four insights, and it's a kind of a very simple
way to think about how we are mindful,
orienting towards mindfulness of suffering,
how it comes to be, how it might let go,
and the commitment and the kind of understanding of,
yes, this way is helpful.
That is also described as an insight.
And as I thought back over that,
it's like, yeah, that was actually the moment
I stepped on the path fully,
that it wasn't just, well, I'm willing to see how this works.
It's, yes, this does work.
So it's kind of another analogy Gil has used in the past.
He says, you know, you might have a linoleum floor
that's just completely stained and like, you know,
it's like the linoleum gets really dirty easily.
And you know, you might go down
and you scrub a little piece of it
and it's like, wow, this little piece of it,
this little square inch, I can get that part clean.
It's possible to get that clean.
And so then you know, theoretically,
that it's possible to get the whole thing clean.
And so that's kind of what happened in that moment.
It's like, that moment was not like the ending
of suffering in my life,
but it was the understanding of the possibility,
the possibility for suffering too.
And so that really led to a real like engagement with the path.
So the last, this Four Noble Truths,
the teaching on the Four Noble Truths
is the last exercise in the Satipatanasuta,
the last description of ways to engage with experience.
And you know, I think of that,
they can be understood in many ways,
these many exercises in the Satipatanasuta.
You know, I think of them often as each one
is almost like a complete practice in itself.
And so for instance, the mindfulness of breathing,
the first instruction in the Satipatanasuta,
there's a whole suit to devoted to mindfulness of breathing
that describes it as being a complete path in and of itself.
So we can use that.
If that's where it feels like it's most resonant
to be mindful is with the breathing,
that can be a complete path.
And then some of us, like for me,
like I came in through the doorway of suffering
and noticing it in my daily life.
And it really feels like that fourth,
the Four Noble Truths understanding
was kind of my orientation,
especially early on in my practice.
Since then I picked up on some other instructions,
you know, other teachings like around the five aggregates
or the six sense spaces and being curious around those.
But early on in my practice,
the Four Noble Truths was really a foundational orientation
for how I looked at experience.
Is it suffering?
Is this the way leading to the ending of suffering?
So any particular orientation around being aware
of experience in the moment
as experience in the present moment,
it could be the breath,
it could be looking at a particular suffering for me,
such as anger early in my practice.
It might be orientation to feeling tone,
the pleasant unpleasant neutral aspect of experience.
It might be the elemental nature of experience,
the kind of the physicality of our experience,
so many different ways in to being present
with what's happening in the present moment.
But the key really is the mindfulness,
the being present with experience
as experience in the present moment.
Kind of like I described that distinction with anger
about knowing that there's anger
and kind of following the anger versus knowing,
oh, this is what anger is like in the present moment.
That orientation of experience
is what right mindfulness,
a kind of a simple way to describe what right mindfulness is.
And there's many ways in to exploring experience.
Whatever's happening in your present moment experience,
there's a way to be with that kind of wise mindfulness.
The conclusion in the Satipatanasuta,
to kind of move in the direction
of this whole discussion around wise mindfulness
and the Satipatanasuta has been in the context
of exploring the Eightfold Path.
And the ending of the Satipatanasuta points to
kind of almost a little promise that the Buddha gives.
He says, if you cultivate this wise mindfulness,
if you cultivate this wisdom,
mindfulness, if you cultivate this kind of mindfulness,
for seven years, you will find freedom.
And then he says,
you can cultivate it for six years
or five years or four years, you'll still find freedom.
You can cultivate it for seven months,
you'll find freedom.
Now, as you begin, as this unfolds,
you begin to get the understanding
he's talking about continuously.
Not just like, oh yeah, I'm gonna practice mindfulness
for a few minutes today and a few minutes tomorrow
and that's two days in a row of practicing mindfulness.
That's not what he's talking about here.
He's talking about continuity of mindfulness.
But what he comes down to,
what he comes back to is the promise
that if we cultivate mindfulness
for seven days continuously, freedom will follow.
Now, he doesn't then go down to seven hours.
So it's like, that's a lot of mindfulness.
Seven full days of mindfulness, I haven't gotten there.
The mind has gone off, but there's so much learning
that can happen.
We don't have to give up or feel like,
well, just because I've had all these gaps
in my mindfulness, it's hopeless.
I mean, my own practice has really shown.
I mean, just that example of that moment
of seeing how the anger didn't arise.
That was not continuous mindfulness for two months,
but boy, there was so much freedom in that moment
and so much power of that understanding
in my life going forward.
So a lot of freedom is possible.
The Buddha's pointing to full freedom here,
the full release of greed, aversion,
aversion, confusion, never again, anger arising,
never again, greed arising, never again, aversion arising.
That's this promise that if seven days of mindfulness,
seven days of wise mindfulness, of right mindfulness
will lead to freedom.
So the piece to me that this kind of links
in the Eightfold Path is the continuity of mindfulness there.
Continuity is concentration.
Basically, mindfulness moment after moment
is what concentration is.
We often think about concentration
as being focused on one thing,
and there is a form of concentration that is that
in the Buddhist tradition.
And there's a form of concentration
that is just the simple continuity of mindfulness
without distracted.
Non-distracted awareness is a form of concentration
and it can be for a few moments,
it can be for a longer stretch of time.
And so when we come to that non-distracted mindfulness,
that is right concentration.
So that will be the topic.
We'll start into right concentration next time
and we'll enter into that by stepping back again.
I think in this kind of conversation around
the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path,
all the factors of the Eightfold Path
have kind of been diving in deep
and then stepping back for the context.
And diving in deep and stepping back for the context.
Next week's gonna be a stepping back for context week
where explore kind of how concentration,
or so it looked like, how concentration is supported
by all of the factors of the Eightfold Path.
There's a particular teaching in the suttas
that I want to refer to
that speaks about how all the path factors,
all of the factors of the Eightfold Path,
wise view, wise intention, wise speech, wise action,
wise livelihood, wise effort, wise mindfulness,
wise concentration, how they weave together
and support each other and create the conditions
for wise concentration,
which leads to that concentrated mindfulness,
that undistracted mindfulness,
as the Buddha promised at the end of the Satipatanasuta,
that is leading in the direction
of releasing greed, aversion, and delusion.
So, comments, questions, reflections
on what I've shared
or thoughts you've had from previous sessions?
Nicholas.
With recognizing Dukha, there's been a journey for me
of like not fixating on it or being fascinated by it
or like really getting tense around it.
And for me, it's just been that slow process
of seeing it come and go
and seeing it come and go and recognizing
that like this one's not the one
that's gonna ruin my life.
Like it's here, I got stuck.
Oh, okay, and it goes.
But the edge for me now is recognizing this is not Dukha.
Not quite recognizing their rising and passing of it,
but just saying, oh, like maybe there's some Dukha here,
but also there's all of this stuff around it
that's not Dukha
and like kind of giving myself permission to rest
in that is actually quite challenging a lot of the time.
And it's a great practice to begin to recognize
when we're not suffering
because it's a kind of subtle thing sometimes actually.
Like, you know, sometimes a great place to notice that
is when it feels like nothing's happening.
Like sitting at a stop sign or sitting at a stoplight,
you know, maybe what your mind is doing
is projecting into, you know, where you need to get to
or things you need to do and you're frustrated
by the red light.
But sometimes I've seen, oh, I'm just sitting at a red light.
There's nothing to do.
I can't go anywhere.
You know, it's like, it's not a problem.
I've got plenty of time to get there.
It's like, oh, there's not suffering happening right now.
So sometimes an orientation to that,
like the orientation to looking at it through the lens
of is Dukha there?
Noticing when Dukha is not there.
I mean, it doesn't even have to be within the context of
like there's Dukha and there's other things that aren't Dukha.
But just sometimes when it feels really neutral,
not much is happening.
When it feels really neutral,
that can be a good time to check in.
It can be harder to notice and be mindful in those times.
We don't tend to notice when there's not much happening.
But if you can kind of begin to attune to that, attune to,
oh, it's kind of neutral, you know?
And that through the foundation of Vedana,
we can begin to, you know, be curious about,
oh, it's kind of neutral.
So is there suffering here?
Sometimes there can be suffering around neutral,
boredom or something, but sometimes it's just simple.
It's like, oh yeah.
And so that kind of context of seeing,
what is it like not to suffer?
Sometimes it's really subtle.
Yeah, so, but it's a great exploration.
I want to encourage the exploration.
Thanks, Charles Lee.
Hi, yes, thanks.
So yeah, Nicholas's share brings up for me.
I guess kind of that there's a difference
between dukkha and suffering.
I guess it's like the incomplete, you know,
or just there isn't really an English or American word
that directly translates dukkha.
Because I've struggled or I just find it an interesting point
where I guess being introduced to Buddhism,
kind of thinking that everything is, give me one second,
everything is kind of all of life has some amount of suffering,
like every conditioned thing, I guess has dukkha.
It's one of the, you know, it's one of the marks,
but then also with the idea that, you know,
not everything that's happening is bad.
I guess not all dukkha is bad
or kind of suffering in the sense that I think of,
you know, suffering at being tortured
or having something unpleasant happen.
Because, you know, even when pleasant things happen,
you know, they're temporary, they're not lasting,
they're, you know, ultimately, you know,
will ultimately disappear.
So, and so I've asked, you know,
I've asked monastics or I asked one monastic,
you know, does Buddhism teach that, you know,
there's, you know, everything is suffering?
And she actually said yes and thought that,
and that's what brought her to practice.
And then, you know, I've heard lots of other teachers say,
well, no, you know, that's taking it overboard.
You know, Buddhism doesn't say that, you know,
everything in life is suffering.
It just says that in life there is some suffering.
I would say, and I spoke to this last time,
I think the Tuesday class last time,
I spoke to the different definitions of dukkha.
And I would say that the Buddhist teaching does say,
I mean, in terms of the word dukkha,
using the word dukkha as unreliability,
and that's a translation for what dukkha means.
It's like, yes, because things are impermanent,
they are unreliable.
There's nothing in our world that is reliable.
And the experience of what we call suffering
comes often around that unreliability.
You know, it's like we want it to be reliable.
And it's the resistance to that truth of unreliability
that creates what we call suffering.
And so, you know, the statement,
all conditioned phenomena are dukkha.
That's in the suttas.
You know, all conditioned phenomena are dukkha.
That's everything.
Mindfulness is dukkha.
Joy is dukkha.
But not in the terms of suffering,
in the terms of this unreliability.
I can't hold on to my mindfulness.
I mean, we see that in a moment.
You know, the mind wanders and comes back.
You know, mindfulness is not reliable.
I can't control my mindfulness.
You know, so that too is dukkha.
It's unreliable as a place to say,
yep, I can hold on to that
and that's gonna do it for me.
Joy, happiness, you know, equanimity,
even all conditioned phenomena.
And from that perspective, that understanding,
I think it is the problem of using the word suffering.
You know, and so when we use the word unreliable,
I think we can begin to understand
how everything is unreliable.
And then look at, what's my relationship to unreliable?
You know, that's a truth,
that's a truth of experience.
Things are unreliable.
So what's my relationship to that?
And when we come into alignment with that truth,
there's a lot more ease in the mind.
And that's where, you know, the suffering
that we call suffering feels like it releases
when we come into alignment with that truth.
So, I mean, that's a great point.
And I think sometimes the reflection
or the looking at experience,
so looking at that first understanding, this is dukkha.
That also could be understood as,
I mean, in my case in that first example I gave
around seeing the anger,
that was the suffering of, yeah, I'm suffering.
You know, that was that kind of suffering.
But there also is the understanding of that,
oh, this is unreliable, you know,
that whatever's happening,
and I had that happen at one point
several years into practice,
I found joy arising, so much joy in the practice.
And there was like almost this little leaning towards
wanting to hold on to us, like, oh, this is it, this is it.
And then the wisdom came up,
I said, nope, that too is unreliable.
You know, can't hold on to that either.
And so that's also that understanding
of that first noble truth.
They're like, oh, right, that's unreliable.
So that's a way into understanding that insight also
is the unreliable nature.
So I think earlier in our practice,
we're really looking at or looking at a lot
of the suffering side of it,
but then as we gain some skill in the practice,
and a lot of the ordinary kinds of struggles
of our lives really smooth out,
then we start to understand the unreliability piece
a little bit more.
