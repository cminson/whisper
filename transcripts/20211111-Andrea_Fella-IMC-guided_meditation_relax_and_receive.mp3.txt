 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Connecting in a simple way with your body, with being here in this physical form. Aware of sensation through the body and connected body and mind together. In a way that can support this connection of body and mind together, in kind of a simple way to really land with ourselves, is to scan through the body, perhaps starting at the top of the head, and just checking in whether there's a possibility of relaxation. So we're using mindfulness to connect with our experience, but then also inclining towards softening. Softening the head, the face, the neck. Seeing if there can be a release of tension that's been held. Often at the end of the day we do have tension that's kind of accumulated, and so sometimes this is just gentle connecting, a kind of reminder, or a little invitation. Maybe the head can relax the face, the neck, the shoulders. Maybe there can be relaxation. Maybe the arms and the hands can relax. The chest, the upper back, all those muscles around the rib cage. Maybe a deeper breath might support the letting go or the stretching of those muscles around the rib cage and a release on the out breath. Sometimes a deeper breath can support relaxation, not only of that area around the chest, but more generally. Just taking in a deep breath, letting the oxygen in, and then releasing. And then letting their breathing return to a normal kind of breath. And continuing to explore relaxation of the body across the stomach and abdomen, middle and lower back, the hips, the legs, the feet. And then perhaps also there might be a way to invite deeper relaxation inside the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can soften, relax. Maybe the area around the heart can soften. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can soften and relax. And maybe too the mind can relax, letting go of mental tension, of worries or concerns, just kind of setting them aside perhaps for now. Just maybe that setting aside of worries and concerns can allow the mind to relax a little bit. Softening what Gil sometimes calls the thinking muscle. Softening the holding or tension to things we think should happen or beliefs we have around what shouldn't happen. This cannot be softened a little bit and just land with what is here. What's here right now? As the body relaxes, it helps the mind to relax. As the mind relaxes, quite naturally this capacity we have to be aware of the present moment can just be available. Not having to figure out how to be mindful but just relax the mind and see what's available. What's here? What's easy? What's already present? Often that sensation is in the body or the breath, maybe hearing. Allowing mindfulness, allowing this capacity, this natural capacity to meet what's happening in the present moment. To receive. Our bodies and minds are very natural receivers. When we're not lost in thought or worries or concerns, very naturally our ears will hear, our bodies will sense. Our mind can also be aware of moods, emotions. Allowing a relaxation and a receiving. Sometimes we might be receiving body sensation for a little while and then there's a shift. The attention shifts to receive sound or a thought or an emotion. As long as the curiosity and interest are staying here connected with what is now being received. Sometimes the attention might stay with one thing for a little while. It might land with the breath and just stay there for a little while. Might land with hearing and stay there for a little while. Or it may shift. Sometimes in a kind of a feeling of a flow from one thing to another. Sometimes kind of shifting rapidly between experiences, sometimes just hanging out with one. There's no right way. Just knowing, noticing, recognizing how it is for you right now. And of course the mind will get caught in some thought. It will pick up on some sensation or thought or idea and it will start thinking about it, lose touch with remembering about the present moment. That will likely happen multiple times. And at some point also very likely mindfulness will return. You'll remember, you'll recognize, oh, mindfulness is back and often we recognize, oh, I've been lost. But rather than focusing on the I've been lost part, can you recognize more clearly, oh, mindfulness is back. What's that like to have awareness return? What is awareness needing as it returns? Sometimes it's the thought that we've been thinking. Other times it might be a body sensation that has kind of come in strongly and that's what we are aware of. We're in emotion. And so just checking in what's here. What's here in this moment as mindfulness returns. And then what's in the next moment? At times it can be helpful to rather than settling back and simply receiving what's arriving, it can be helpful to choose one area out of experience and direct the attention to that. Maybe the breath, maybe the body. At times that can be helpful. But if you do choose to do that for a time, explore the possibility of receiving that experience. And let's land with the breath for a while and just see how is the breath showing up, receiving the breath that's already here. And also not holding tightly to it, trying to push other things away because even as we direct attention to the breath, sometimes we may also notice other things. Hearing is happening and the breath, body sensation and the breath. So holding the, you choose to direct the attention to a particular area of experience, holding a light touch with it. What can sometimes be like a little tether that supports us to actually be aware of other things that are happening at the same time. Relax, receive. Just this moment's experience. Thank you.
