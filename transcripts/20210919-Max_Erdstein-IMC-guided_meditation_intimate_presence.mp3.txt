 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay. Good morning. Nice to be with you. My name is Max Erstein. I'm one of the teachers at IMC. And I think this is the first time that I've joined this Sunday morning Zoom YouTube event. So happy to be here. And I know there's quite a nice community on YouTube. So not muted on YouTube. I just want to do a sound check. Are you getting any echo? No. Should be okay? We should. We sound pretty good now. Okay. Good. So we'll have a short meditation and then share a few Dharma reflections. So just taking a moment to get comfortable. Settle into the posture for sitting meditation. For the purposes of meditation, it's very helpful to give some extra special attention to the posture. What is it to sit, to arrange this body in a way that supports presence, supports gentle, kind awareness? What is it to sit in a way that embodies the qualities of cultivating? It can be helpful to take a few deep, deliberate breaths. And just with each exhalation, letting go. Enjoying this quality of letting go. We begin this period of practice remembering that our primary intention is simply to be here, be present for what's happening. There's no particular place you need to get to. There's no particular state of mind, body that's any better than this. Right here, right now, all of the Dharma is here. All of the greatest truths and permanence are interconnectedness. When I remember this, something in this body, this system, can soften you, can be at ease. This ordinary moment has everything we need. Sounds will arise and then fade. The sensations in the body just noticing. The thoughts appear and disappear. The sensations in the mind. Various feelings and emotions. Just letting everything be as it is. Bringing our attention to the body. May this body be at ease right now. Let's just rest here in the chair of the cushion. Perhaps, thinking a little bit more deeply into the chair of the cushion. Is there some place in the body that might be softened by benefit? Some softening, releasing places of tension, attraction. Sometimes the muscles behind the eyes, the jaw. Let's see the neck and the shoulders. The chest and the belly. Is it to breathe with a soft belly? Just as this body can rest, chair of the cushion. Perhaps this heart, this mind can rest. Rest right here in the flow of this moment, flow of experience. The sounds coming and going. The sensations in the body. The flow of our thinking. Images in the mind. What's the problem? In meditation, we're discovering how not to be in conflict with ourselves, our experience. How does it feel like to not be in conflict right now? We can accept this body as it is. We can accept this mind, this heart, whatever it happens to be right now. We can accept this mind, this heart, whatever it is. It could be at ease, how things are. It could be at ease with our unease, with difficulties. One of the most nourishing qualities of our practice is to cultivate an intimate presence, an intimate present with ourselves, with ourselves, all of life. We're going to let go of the need to do, to accomplish. We're going to let go of the need to do, to accomplish. We're going to let go of this intimate presence, intuitive wisdom, concerning force. We're going to let go of the need to do, intuitive wisdom, concerning force. We're going to let go of the need to do, intuitive wisdom, concerning force. We're going to let go of the need to do, intuitive wisdom, concerning force. From this place of ease, openness, openness, and presence. At some point, you may notice that this body is breathing. You may notice that this body is breathing. So gently, we invite any of the sensations of breathing come into awareness. How do I know right now that this body is breathing? You may notice the rise and fall of the body. Notice the rise and fall of the belly. You may notice the movement of the chest. You may notice the movement of the chest. Let's see if we can present the company. One complete thin breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. One complete soft breath. Meet this heart as it is. This breath, this heart, this moment is incomparably itself. There's no other breath, this breath. This breath. This moment. This moment is almost......wonder, beauty, difficulty, and human life. Moment, moment, moment. This moment is almost...
