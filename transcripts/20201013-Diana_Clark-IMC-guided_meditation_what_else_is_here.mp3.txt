The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good morning.
I guess it's, as I said yesterday, it's morning on this continent, but
if you're in another continent, I wish you a good day.
Whenever you happen to be listening to this, maybe it's good evening.
It's such a blessing if I can use that word to be able to practice together as part of a community.
So to start with a guided meditation,
I'll take a moment to
settle in.
There's so many different ways to understand that, settle in.
One is to
bring our focus, our attention, our awareness more
in to this moment as opposed to out
other moments, the past, the future.
It can be helpful to feel that
the future is there.
It can be helpful to feel the
sensations of this moment,
feeling the body, the pressure of the chair, cushion
against the body perhaps, the feeling of the feet
against the floor, ground,
feeling connected to this moment.
Perhaps there's pressure against the back
if you're sitting in a chair or of course the back side
sitting on whatever we're sitting on.
In some kind of way bringing an aliveness,
an aliveness of attention, of mindfulness
to this moment.
Inhabiting our experience,
feeling embodied and alive to the way the body
feels right now.
It's often helpful to do an easy relaxed body scan
as a way of getting connected,
as a way of creating the conditions
in which there might be a little bit more ease,
softness.
You can check in with the face,
maybe around the eyes and the mouth.
Just feeling in and relaxing,
softening.
Without forcing anything to happen.
It's okay if all the tension doesn't go,
if relaxation doesn't arise.
Just creating the conditions in which it might
make it a little more likely.
Continuing with the body scan,
bringing our attention to the shoulders,
arms, hands.
Feeling what the hands are touching.
Is it soft or rough?
Is it cool or warm?
The upper back
and lower back.
The chest
and the belly.
Now in the belly to relax.
And just being with this bodily experience right now,
allowing it, opening to it,
welcoming it,
leaving it.
And then noticing that the body is breathing.
It's feeling the sensations of breathing.
Breathing.
Feeling the chest move or the belly move.
Or perhaps the air going in and out of the nose.
Breathing.
Breathing.
And then can we set this sense of direction,
the stance, the perspective that will take
to be one of kindness, warmth towards our experience.
Practice can be a movement of kindness, a gift of kindness to ourselves.
Can we practice with that movement, that sentiment, that intention,
rather than beating ourselves up perhaps, but with some warmth, kindness and care.
Breathing.

And then as part of our exploration this week
into inquiry, questioning.
Can fold into our practice this relaxed, easy question,
this this.
Not so much looking, digging for an answer.
But more about opening to the questioning, bringing a freshness to the moment.
What is this?
Allowing the experience to show itself.
And whatever form it shows itself.

It might be that we get a little stuck trying to figure it out
or get lost in a thought train.
It might be helpful to introduce a second question.
To help broaden, open our experience.
What else is here?
It's usually the pressure against the body where we're standing or sitting, lying down.
There are usually sounds.
Can we include these neutral experiences that most often we're not aware of
as a counterbalance if we get stuck to trying to figure something out or lost?
