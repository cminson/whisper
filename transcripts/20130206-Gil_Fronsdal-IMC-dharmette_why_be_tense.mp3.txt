Dharmette: Why Be Tense?  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by

I have something a little different for you t oday. 
Rather than giving a talk, I have a question for 
you. Can you convince me that it is important to 
be tense  [laughter] ? What are the really good 
arguments for why you shouldn’t really be 
relaxed? I suspect that some of you are not 
always relaxed. Some of you occasionally get 
tense and just go along  as if that ’s the way it 
should be. You mus t have good reasons. Not 
only do I want to hear the good reasons, I want 
to hear you convince me because maybe I need 
to improve. Maybe I am missing out on an 
important part of life.  
 
Participant 1 : Because I am under attack and I 
need to protect myself. T he more tense I am, the 
more I can invest in that.  
 
That doesn’t convince me very much because I 
go to my ten -year-old son’s aikido class and I 
see them teach the kids that you respond to attack so much better when you are relaxed.  But 
thank you for offering that.  
 
Participant 2 : If you are too relaxed, you will 
forget to do something that is really important.  
 
Oh, I see. But I have been really tense in the 
distant past and forgot ten what I had to do. 
Sometimes I remembered what I had to do , but 
then I didn’t notice the really important things. 
So that doesn’t quite do it.  
 
Participant 3 : Well, when I am tense, it gives me 
the opportunity to see what is making me tense.  
 
Ahh. That ’s interesting. So I should be more 
tense so that I can learn why I am b eing tense ? 
 
Participant 3 : When I am tense, it gives me the 
opportunity to see what is happening with me.  
Since I am tense a lot, it gives me a chance to 
see what the tension is about.  
 
Ahh. If you are going to be tense anyway, then it 
is important so tha t you can study it. Get to know 
it. Don’t be quick to overcome it. Oh, I like that. 
But it doesn’t convince me to lose my relaxation. 
But next time I get tense, I will remember that.   
Participant 4 : The feeling of tension also allows 
you to know what it is like not to have tension. If 
you never felt tension, how would you know 
what relaxation is?  
 
[Laughs.] Would you need to know?  
 
Participant 4 : You might. If you are always 
relaxed, will you even k now you are relaxed? I 
think I need to know.  
 
That doesn’t convince me that I have to let go of 
my relaxed state.  
 
Participant 5 : Do you remember isometrics? It is 
a way of strengthening your muscles. You hold 
them really tight and then let them go. So that is 
a reason to be tense. You are strengthening 
your muscles.  
 
Oh. The next time I go to the gym, I will 
remember this. So now we are talking about 
physical tension for the purpose of physical 
improvement. Tense for that purpose. Ok.  
 
Participant 6 : I have a close friend in New York 
where I grew up. He claims that everybody out here is stupid. That if you relax to o much you will 
get run over by a car in the street.  
 
That sounds like people are confusing being 
relaxed with being stupid , and I don’t see that 
connection. I see that some of the most 
wonderful insights of my life have come no t 
when I was tense , but when I was relaxed. I 
have needed to be relaxed. Maybe I have been 
a little tense in working on a project, but then I 
go for a l ong walk and during that walk I relax 
and something pops up, a new understanding. I 
don’t know if I would want to give up being 
relaxed for some promise of being more 
intelligent if I were tense. Tense and unhappy 
instead of relaxed.  
 
Participant 7 : I am d rowsily relaxed and I am 
crossing the street. I look up and see that I am 
about t o be hit by a truck. Then I  experience 
instantaneous tension which will help me spring 
out of its way.  
 
But that is not tension you are doing by 
choosing. That is instinct ope rating. You are not 
thinking ahead that this is a good time to be 
tense. You don’t have time to make that choice.  
I am looking for a choice about why I should give up my relaxation.  
 
Participant 8 : If you want to be completely 
single-focused , rigid, contra cted, unaware of 
your surroundings, unable to see others’ needs, 
then I think  tension is really good.  
 
[Laughter.] And when do I want to be completely 
rigid, unaware of my surroundings and 
unconnected? And not knowing what I’m feeling 
or thinking? Is there a time for that?  
 
Participant 8 : I don’t want to do that myself , but I 
am just posing an argument.  
 
Oh, I see. One of the things I was thinking about 
for a talk was there is always a time for 
something . It’s not always one way. Maybe what 
you are saying  is sometimes appropriate . 
 
Participant 9 : I have two ideas. If you are about 
to be physically hit, like a boxer who wants to 
strengthen the abs to protect the organs, you 
want to tighten that part of you r body. And when 
kids are little and things are so emotionally 
traumatic, they want to go away so that they 
won’t be emotionally overwhelmed. It’s a way of 
protecting ourselves, coping; otherwise there might be physical or emotional harm.  
 
The idea is that with trauma or abuse, 
sometimes tightening up  or being tense  is a way 
of protecting oneself. It still doesn’t convince me 
that I should get tense, unless you are planning 
to beat me up  [laughs] .  
 
Participant 10 : This is probably a  typical 
philosophy scenario.  I am in a well -paid 
psychological experiment , where they are going 
to test me for the effects of tension on my 
physiological self , so I have good reason to be 
tense.  
 
Oh, I see. And how much are you paying me? I 
will consider it for the right pri ce. I’ll have a little 
tension.  
 
Participant 11 : Someone comes to see you and 
they are feeling so different and alone , aching to 
know that they are not the only one feeling 
tension. They want empathy. They need to know 
they are not alone in the universe  – the single 
most intense person . They want to know that 
you as the teacher have also experienced 
something like that.  
 So you are going to show them some tension. 
So you are going to muster some up. Well, it is 
one thing that in the past there was lots of 
tension. But you are telling me that it’s a reason 
to get tense now? Mus ter it so that they can feel 
met and seen , and then maybe they can relax 
because we are all in this boat together.  OK, I 
kind of like that. Sometimes teachers will change 
how they sit in order to meet a person. If the 
person is sitting upright, then the teacher will sit 
that way in order to meet t hem there. If a person 
comes in and slouches, then sometimes the 
teacher will sit back. Maybe.  
 
Participant 12 : My tension helps me to revisit my 
childhood because my mother was a very hard 
taskmaster. I go back and I recall that. It helps 
me to understand  my tension. And then, thank 
goodness , because of  the things I do now, I am 
able to relax more.  
 
I see. So when you do get tense, it’s kind of like 
what som eone said earlier about  getting tense, it 
helps you to understand the roots of the tension 
by rememb ering what happened to you when 
you were a child. It helps you then to be more 
relaxed in the future.  
 Participant 12 : I get in touch with that.  
 
So have you intentionally made yourself tense 
so that you can revisit the past?  
 
Participant 12 : No, the tens ion just happens.  
 
And then you look at it. Great. So it is not a 
reason to give up your relaxed state , but the 
idea is that when you do get tense, it is an 
opportune time to look more deep ly. One of the 
things that help  you is that it resonates with you r 
history  and your childhood.  Seeing that has 
helped you to understand the roots.  
 
Participant 13 : Seeing tension when it arises, 
either in thinking or in the body, to be aware of it, 
and then when it goes, seeing the release. You 
may not invite tension, but if you don’t 
acknowledge it and truly  see it, then there is no 
real seeing when the release happens.  
 
So this is similar to the others. If it’s already 
there, already present, then it is useful to get to 
know it, to look at it, and then you ca n see the 
release and th e difference. I like  this point of 
view.  
 But what  I was particularly interested in was if 
you are somewhat relaxed already, why would 
you give it up? Why would you take on tension if 
you don’t have to? What are the justifications or 
beliefs for that? I appreciate what everybody 
said.  
 
I think that when you find yourself tense, it is a 
useful exercise to consider what you are 
believing . I think that behind every tension  (it 
might not be conscious)  is a belief that getting 
tense is meaningful and important – that you are 
better off being tense , or that somehow you are 
taking care of yourself bett er. Otherwise , why 
would we do it? What if we question the beliefs 
behind the tension? I think that it ne ver occurs to 
many people to do that.  
 
What I hope d by asking the question today and 
getting your wonderful answers  is that you will 
be encouraged to question more deeply and to 
understand what is going on for you. What might 
cause you to sacrifice your e ase, your well -
being?
