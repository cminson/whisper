 There's a tradition in Buddhism of using your meditative calm to help you reflect deeply on certain topics. And I'll offer you a series of reflections with the aim not so much of ending with understanding, but at the end, ending with a question. It's considered very important to be able to find some essential question that comes out of the depths of your being. It's very helpful. Let your reflections be calm, unhurried. Perhaps connected to your body as you reflect, feeling your body. So the first reflection is for you to think about what is the deepest knowing or values that you organize your life around. Is there some deep spiritual truth or some understanding, some truth that your life experience has led you to? What's the deepest knowing that you know? And perhaps connected to that, or perhaps not, in your calm, intimate moments with yourself. What is your deepest intention? What is the deepest aspiration you have? Perhaps not settling for the first thing you think about, but kind of probing further, deeper down, under it, behind it. If the intention you state is in the negative, somehow are there the absence of something, you might try restating it positively. Your deepest intention. And then reflect on what gets in the way of you following through on your deepest intention. What gets in the way of living connected to your deepest knowing? What are the obstacles? And in thinking about what you most deeply know or your deepest intention, there's no need to measure yourself against some idea of the appropriate depths, just whatever is accessible available to you today, here. Your deepest intention and what gets in the way. And then reflecting on these things, your deepest knowing, your deepest intention, the obstacle, is there some question, some essential question that you have coming from that? Something you'd like to understand or know, something you'd like to resolve? Is there some question that you could pose that you would imagine would make a big difference if you could know the answer? Shortly I'll ring the bell to end the sitting. And then if any of you would like to ask your question, I will try to respond the best I can. Perhaps as briefly as you pose the question, I'll try to be respectful of where the question comes from. And see if I can respond in kind. So... So... Would anybody like to share their question or ask their question? Yes. How can it make sense of this experience? It helps if you love it. This is not a new question for me. It's not that I've cared for about five years. It came from a dream, actually. In a dream I was in the audience of a church or cathedral. And both male and female priests were setting up an altar for communion service. And the male priests brought in bread and wine. And then the female priests brought in this huge tray of every kind of luscious fruit and offered that up. And in the dream I was so joyous because I felt, yes, this is really part of the spiritual offering. But then when I woke up I felt very sad because I felt that that was not my experience of how spiritual life was enacted. So the question that I hold and that I have held is how does one offer up the luscious fruit in their spiritual practice as communion? The first thing that occurs to me is that you need to be able to offer up both. Both the simplicity of the bread and the richness of the luscious fruit. And if you can't offer one, you probably can't offer the other. And how do you offer it? Where's your altar? Where's your altar? So you have to answer that question yourself. But I encourage you to offer both sides of the dream. I'm not sure if you said in allowing it or loving. In loving it. In loving it you'll understand it. How can you love a negative experience? How can you love a negative experience? I don't know if you can love a negative experience. But a negative experience shouldn't stop you from loving. So there's a state of love that doesn't relate to an object. So when you encounter the negative experience, it shouldn't interrupt your loving. Yes? Does the concept of accepting change mean we can accept the extinction of many species within the world? What do you mean by accept? I wonder, should I be angry? Should I try and do something? Or is it okay because it's part of change that species go away? I think the answer is yes to both. Lots of species have already passed away, are extinct. And if there isn't some kind of acceptance that they're already being gone, you'll suffer. The ones that are in the process of being extinct, I think you need to have a wise relationship to that. If you can make a difference, please make a difference. How can I stop trying to prove that I'm a nice, lovable person and just know that I am? I think it helps a lot if you become really familiar with the tendency to want to be liked, to want to be a lovable person. To see the suffering of that, see the movement of that really, really well. And in seeing it really well, eventually you'll let it go. How can I see more clearly the point where I begin suffering? I don't know if you need to. Just when you do notice your suffering, whenever that is, then just relax. Because you know an alternative. So go to that alternative. And the fact that maybe it took a few minutes to realize that you're suffering, it's okay for you. Yes? One of my obstacles, my deepest potential, is my reactivity, how my feelings will bubble up before I get a chance to get in and understand. And I don't know exactly what to do with that. I'm not sure what to say in response except that your deepest intention, your deepest knowing, whatever that might be, feed it. So that it becomes really strong, grows in strength and power, so that your reactivity somehow is balanced by the strength of your intention, your deeper knowing. So whatever you can do to feed it, follow through on it. Yes? My intention to be compassionate and helpful is thwarted by my fears of engulfment and abandonment. Is thwarted, was that the word? By my fears of engulfment and abandonment. I wonder what I could do about that. Hearing you, just taking that in as you say it, I would encourage you to have a lot of compassion for yourself. Cultivate compassion. So it's not so much a matter of fixing this problem as it is holding who you are and that tension between those two things with lots of caring concern, a lot of compassion. And keep remembering that question. Some questions shouldn't be answered too directly, but rather questions that should be kept alive in the forefront. I can always be working with the question and massaging it and looking at different angles. And maintaining a question like that, I think really in the forefront with compassion for yourself, can make a difference over the long term. How does one remove the filters that color a view of the other? First you have to see them. I think it helps a lot if you can develop a mental stability, calm concentration. So in meditation practice or in some ways, the quieter you can get your mind, the more concentrated you can get it, the more likely you are to see those filters. If you see them really clearly, then you can either let go of them sometimes, or you might see them there, but in seeing them clearly, you're not going to be so influenced by them. You might be able to see around them, see the alternative. Well, I lived here in the United States to live as a husband. I have in Germany a lot of clients at work. And it's almost like I'm feeling guilty that I made a step in, so I maintain my clients over the phone and go there every two months. But it feels like there is a part of me that says you should have been there. And it's not okay to really... So my mind goes into this opposition of feeling guilty that I abandoned that part, and I know I can't have both in the full amount. And I notice that my mind has anything in the tendency to go into that opposition. And my answer is when I ask myself to love both parts, but I don't know if you have any suggestion how I can make peace, because this is kind of a cold apart, not being fully here. So it sounds like you're partly oppressed by your sense of responsibility. Is that right? Yeah, I think almost God, or whatever it is, is a good idea. I'm probably not giving what I have to give there, but it's kind of wanted. So if I imagine that that tension you're feeling probably manifests in many other areas of your life too. Just more acute here. Is that accurate? More acute. But is this a common phenomenon for you to feel this guilt around some sense of responsibility? So what you might do is look at your sense of responsibility. I always say, oh, this God is here. I know that. I always say that I need to see what's next for any pressure of peace. And my wish for you is that you could discover how to be at rest in your own psyche, in your own heart. And realize that you're not responsible for other people. One big obstacle that I struggle with is the need to make sure I get something before me, which is an opposition to my intention to give to other people. And it feels like the obstacle is a kind of self-pity of not trusting that there will be enough left for me, whether it's time or an ice cream cone, or just it could be anything big or little, but it feels like that. I guess I was looking for a word for self-pity or something, or self-protection becomes a barrier to being able to let go of that and just simply trust that it will take care of itself. If you have any suggestions for how to cultivate an ability to trust that one's needs do get that. It's like if I can remember that the giving gives me more pleasure anyways, and yet in the moment sometimes that's not where I'm at. It's more like I just want to go off and sit by the beach, and that becomes sort of... that's when I say things or do things that I don't feel skilful about. What would going to the beach do for you? Recharge me, or just give me that kind of quiet space that sometimes there's not enough of. And the tension is you don't have time for both? Yes. Nothing comes to my mind. Do you have an answer? I guess to me what feels like would help would be to try to bring the beach into the moment. It's like you don't have to necessarily go there to have that peace. But the challenge of cultivating the peace and the chaos of the kids and the phone ringing and the clamoring, that's the challenge is to sort of have to not dissolve into self-pity in that moment and instead have gratitude. For all that's great about it. It's a personality challenge. I can very well understand what you're talking about. In the times when you do have... when you can step out of your role as a mother of three children and work and all the things that you do, those moments, make sure those moments are high quality. So that at least you can get a little bit of that recharging and a little bit of that peace. Ideally, of course, you'd be able to find it. You wouldn't have such a sharp separation between personal time and interpersonal time. You'd find how to be at peace of being at the beach in the middle of screaming children, ideally. But until you can attain that ideal, and if you only have very short periods of time to kind of recharge yourself, make sure that's what you do. In answering your questions, for example, intention, and I have intention for some direction, how do I develop the faith that's going to all work? How do you nurture that part of you that five, ten, fifteen years from now, things are going to be moved in that intention? Great. Good question. So the question is, when he has an intention, deep intention, and how can he have faith that's fallen through and that intention is going to bring benefit in five, ten, fifteen years? Where does that faith come from that's worthwhile pursuing it? I think it's a very interesting question, a very important question. I do know that we are changed for the better over long periods of time, and part of the benefit of practice, we need to have the patience and the long-term vision that in five, ten, fifteen years will be changed. I can see small changes I made in my life, you know, twenty years ago, led to a certain path of development that, you know, some degree I think changed who I am. But this is kind of a personal answer for me that I think it's very important that the intention we have can also be fulfilled in the moment. That there's something deeply satisfying about the choice we make about how to encounter the next moment, that it's fulfilled in the next moment. So it feels rewarding just because doing it is rewarding. If we want to become, for example, if we want to become more peaceful, you might, you know, if you follow a particular spiritual practice in twenty years become a much more peaceful person, less afraid, and all kinds of things. But hopefully the steps there are steps of being peaceful each step. And that even though you're not that peaceful, the fact that that next step was a peaceful step, it feels right. The faith is confirmed in that step. Does that make sense? So that don't only look for it in the far future, but find out how your spiritual practice is in some way fulfilled in the present, somehow satisfying, deeply satisfying for you. So it's not an exchange. I'm going to sacrifice this, I'm going to huff and puff now so that I can get something, you know, far down the line. That's kind of the exchange model of spiritual life, I think, is the setup for a lot of suffering. But rather see if you can find some way that's really deeply satisfying while you're doing it. And so that in a year from now, the Buddha comes here and says, you know, Ken, you really followed the wrong path. That was really, you know, that path you're following, you know, you better stop because in twenty years that's going to take you, you know, some, you know. And you say, okay, you listen to the Buddha and say, okay, I guess I'll stop doing that. But I'm really glad I did that here. That was very satisfying at the time. I don't know if that's the best example. Hopefully you got the point. Yes. I don't know why. So that was a great, great observation. And exactly the question is, is that okay? When I'm left with not knowing whether it's a right thing for me to do. But so my mind tells me I don't participate in it or I don't use it. I'm happy to hear that. So your mind says, you know, you could do more, you should do more. And your heart says, this is really satisfying. Listen to your heart. And at some point if you feel, so you're saying right now there's some kind of urge, some kind of feeling that this is really satisfying to do what you're doing here. You don't quite understand it maybe, but it's really satisfying for you. At some point it might happen that you feel the same kind of inexplicable urge to do more. To do some more retreats or whatever. Meditate more, whatever more it might be for you. And until that time, maybe just be really content that you found something satisfying. And the more you trust that deep satisfaction, the more you let the satisfaction you are finding let it seep into you. The more that I think I trust that that will allow you to unfold in a way that is your unfolding. And it might lead you to going deeper into this tradition. It might lead you going deeper into your tradition of, if you have a kind of tradition of birth, that's a different spiritual tradition. It could actually lead you back there. Or it could lead you to something really different. I don't know where it will lead you, but I have a lot of faith in that heart of yours, that it's finding that deep satisfaction. If you nourish that and support that and protect it from your judgments. I feel like I am constantly fighting time. Because progressively I don't have enough time to do everything I want to do. I think the battle is in the wrong direction then. The battle shouldn't be with time, it should be with your desires. Perhaps battle is the wrong word, but you were the one who brought fighting. It doesn't mean necessarily you have to get rid of your desires, but you are going to need to get a much wiser relationship to your desires then. It's your desires which are oppressing you, not time. How can I let go of or at least develop a more skillful relationship with my self-judgment, in particular feeling undeserving? How can you develop a more healthy relationship with self-judgment and feeling as you are undeserving? What goes through my mind is to respond differently on those two different issues. One of the interesting things to do with that is to ask yourself what the function is of having self-judgment. Why is it there? What benefits are you trying to get for yourself by being self-judgmental? So reflection from others that you are okay. Why do you think you are motivated to want to get that reflection from others? Accepting yourself. And what's the suffering there? Of not holding yourself with love? What's your pain? So this is something you are familiar with, this pain of being harsh with yourself, self-judgmental, feeling you are undeserving. And if you feel that pain, is there any compassion for yourself? Feel the pain and then see if you can meet it with compassion. Certainly, certainly, I hope that certainly you can feel how important it is to have compassion for your pain, for this tendency. And the healing may be found through having some kind of self-love, there is some compassion. I'm confident you have the ability to have that compassion. And the unfortunate thing about compassion is that it arises in contact with that suffering. So don't be afraid of the pain. And what I suggest is that self-judgment are often a way of avoiding the pain. So you might feel your pain. So then as we come to the end of this session, this morning, perhaps some of you would feel okay about just going around and talking to each other. Just going around and stating your question that you had at the end of the reflection without any, I won't answer. It might be nice just to hear the range of questions. And maybe it's easier for some of you to speak your question if you know you're not going to be responded to. Many years ago, I did a period of questions and answers, a little bit different, quite different from how we did it here. I just said, are there any questions tonight? And I was going to write down the questions and then respond to a series of them in a row. But it was so interesting to hear all the questions that we spent 45 minutes having questions. And there was no answers given at all. What choice do I make when I encounter a situation where it seems that I must either cause somebody else suffering or suffer myself? Thank you. That's a good question. Why did I, why do I decide to drive an hour to find the right Sangha? Why do I need to have a question? Why do I need to have a question? What is this habit of taking exception to things? What is this habit of taking exception to things? So my question is, why should I have a question? It was the last question, right? I don't know if we need to have a question, but I think questioning is a very, very helpful spiritual practice to have some healthy sense of doubt. You're doubting what your experience is. There's a healthy way of doubting or asking, what is this? I think the vipassana question always, the sensual question of vipassana is, what is this? What is this experience? What's happening now? And to kind of keep that as a question, always wondering, not taking anything for granted, but always kind of interested in what's there. And I understand that life is always an open, life is always open system. Being an open system is always changing. And there's never any fixed understanding that's going to work. And so you have an understanding that works right now, but it's not going to work in the next moment, in the next hour, next day. So to have this sense of kind of healthy sense of doubting, a sense of questioning is very, I think, seems appropriate enough for me. And also questioning, by having the art of asking questions and then honing the question, developing the question, clarifying the question is one way of clarifying what's in our life, our spiritual life. I had a Zen teacher who didn't want to see his students very often for interviews because he wanted the students to do most of the work themselves. And otherwise people came with all their life problems and issues and for answers and solutions. And what he wanted people to do was to hang out with their issues and keep refining the issue, clarifying the question, and get down to kind of the really core, essential aspect of what's really most important in the question. So if someone came and said, you know, I'm thinking of changing my job, what do you think? He didn't want to hear that. He wanted to kind of, it's a good question, but he wanted you to kind of work with that question, see deep below that question, if you really, you know, down in the kind of, in your deepest heart, what is motivating that question? What's the source of that question? And it would take months sometimes for us to kind of stay with these kinds of issues and work with them and reflect on them and look at different angles and keep questioning them. And then we'd come to him with the core question and then he would respond and hopefully that way there'd be much more useful response. But more importantly, I think he was training us to be our own teachers, training us to find the answers for ourselves. So I think it's very helpful to question. And anyway, I hope that this was helpful for all of you. It kind of felt like a rather 45 minute meditation, hour and a half meditation this morning, sitting here with all of you. I appreciate it a lot, hearing the questions I heard. And I sense the kind of, for the most part, a sense of serious presence and listening to other people and to oneself. Maybe some of you who didn't talk, maybe were processing your own questions and concerns. And hopefully that was useful. Well, thank you all very much. And I wish you a good next couple of weeks for those of you who come on Sundays. And I'll be here in two weeks for a hot look.
