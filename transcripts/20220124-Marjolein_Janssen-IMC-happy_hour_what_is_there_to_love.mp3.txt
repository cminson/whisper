The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Yeah, welcome.
And for those who don't know me yet, my name is Marjela Janssen.
I'm originally from the Netherlands, but I now live in the Bay Area.
And I've been practicing the dharma since 2011 or so, and yeah.
I've done a number of retreats in Europe, Asia, and the US, and started teaching in 2017.
And I really appreciate teaching the dharma and being able to give back to what I've received from my teachers.
So, yeah, with that.
Yeah, it's really great to be here and to be here with these happy hour sangha again, such a lovely sangha.
I really feel the meta in this sangha.
Yeah, so delighted to be here.
I'd like to acknowledge you might have heard that Thich Nhat Hanh has passed away.
He was a great Buddhist teacher this weekend.
In his 90s, he was in his 90s.
He was already sick for a while.
And I heard that the Thich Nhat Hanh community is remembering him by creating a field of loving kindness to send loving kindness to him as remembrance.
And so maybe we can dedicate, if you feel called to that, dedicate practice of today to him and to his legacy and teachings.
I can maybe hold him in our hearts for this hour of meta and kindness.
And I'd like to share a quote by him that resonates with the theme of tonight.
He says, to be beautiful means to be yourself.
You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.
So, how can we see the beauty in ourselves and in others.
On the other day, I came across an article by someone named Ron Kurtz.
And Ron Kurtz was the founder of Hakomi Mindful Somatic Psychology.
It's a body centers therapy. It combines awareness, mindfulness of somatic experiences with all sorts of mindfulness techniques.
And one of the key principles that they use is loving presence.
And in the article I was reading, Ron Kurtz described how he came up with this principle of loving presence.
And it was when he was in a therapy session as a therapist and the client had a really complicated story and he kept on talking and trying to explain this complicated story.
But Ron couldn't really follow it and at some point he decided to just give up following the story and trying to understand it.
And at that moment he relaxed into that giving up and something interesting happened to him.
He suddenly kind of saw the humanness of the client and from that, from that seeing the humanness, a deep sense of compassion arose in him for his client.
And he describes what this experience brought him.
In that article he says, seeing beauty and humanity in the other became my therapeutic meditation.
It was my way of becoming loving and present.
I learned to avoid listening for problems, engaging in questions and explanations and in long conversations.
My first impulse now is to always find something to love, something to be inspired by, something heroic,
something recognizable as the gift and burden of the human condition, the pain and grace that's there to find in every soul you meet.
End of the quote.
So seeing the beauty and humanity in ourselves and others.
This is just a shift in perspective from living our ordinary lives, just going about our lives to intentionally start seeing the beauty in ourselves and others.
To intentionally turn our attention to that. What would that be like?
What is there to love in ourselves and others?
What beauty is there?
And how does that change our heart when we see that?
Or maybe it can open our heart, and maybe we can be in that loving presence that Ron Kurtz talks about with ourselves and the other.
And seeing the humanity in all of us, or all just humans, we are subject to this human condition of pain and grace, the gift and the burden to be human, as he says.
And we all go through difficulty in life and we all have our challenges.
And can we be with our own challenges and other people's challenges?
And also with the blessings that we all receive.
And can we see this humanness that we're all in?
We're all in the same human boat, subject to suffering, subject to peace.
And as Ron Kurtz said, like in every person, including yourself, find something to love, to be inspired by, something heroic.
The gift and burden of the human condition, the pain and grace that's in everyone.
And if we do, then we can be in loving presence with our own humanness and debt of others.
So we'll meditate now and the meditation will be in that spirit.
Oh, guide us a little bit into that spirit of seeing the beauty and the humanness as a way of also accessing this loving presence and as a way of metta as well.
And we can start with just touching into the body and really be present right here and right now.
And if it's comfortable for you, you can close your eyes.
And what is it like now in the body?
What is it like in the feet?
And then tune into the buttocks on the, on the seat or whatever it is right now.
And maybe if you sit on a chair or a couch, you can feel the contact of your back.
It's a backrest.
When else you can feel the uprightness of your back.
Maybe touching each other, maybe touching your knees or arm rests.
Being present.
For the sensations experience there in your hands.
You can touch into the body as a whole.
You can bring gentle and kind awareness to that area and invite it to relax as far as possible.
You can be lovingly present for this moment.
Tune into your heart area in the center of your chest.
Simply acknowledge what is there right now.
Whether it is something that is pleasant or unpleasant or neutral.
Maybe it can just be there just as it is.
And then you can bring someone to mind to care about.
Or maybe if it feels appropriate you can also bring to mind Thich Nhat Hanh or the Thich Nhat Hanh Sangha.
And then you can drop in the question.
What is there to love about this being or these beings?
You can see if an answer arises naturally.
You don't have to go into a whole thought process.
But more let the answer come to you. If it is there, you can hold it as a question.
What is there to love about this being?
What is there to be inspired by this being?
So this question you can just hold as a question and see if something arises.
Thank you.
Is there something heroic in this being?
Thank you.
This being is or was in the same human condition as you are.
They are or were just trying to live their life the best they can.
And their little hockey boat called the human experience.
Can you see their humanness or humanity?
Is it easy to just be lovingly present for them?
You can send them metaphors.
You can pick one that you like, but it fits this person really well.
If you cannot think of a phrase then you can use.
May you be happy.
From that space of loving presence, you can wish them this benevolent wish.
You can bring someone to mind that is a little bit more difficult.
Not your worst enemy, but someone you have some difficulty with.
I don't know if you found someone dropping the question.
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's for a more difficult person.
But even this difficult person most likely has people who love them.
Who care about them.
If you cannot find anything you can maybe love.
That they are loved.
That others see goodness in them.
You might miss it right now.
I don't know.
What is there to be inspired by this person?
Is there something heroic in this person?
What is there to be inspired by this person?
What is there to be inspired by this person?
What is there to be inspired by this person?
Can you see their humanness?
Seeing their humanness help.
Being able to be lovingly present for them.
To feel compassion.
And also for this being we can wish a good wish.
And you can pick a phrase yourself for use and you'll be happy.
And from this place of seeing their humanness, being able to be lovingly present for them.
From your heart.
You can wish this wish for them.
Now you can bring yourself and your attention.
What is there to love about yourself?
Sometimes it can be difficult.
Some of us have conditioning around not having permission to love ourselves.
Maybe you can rephrase it and what would others say that they would love about you?
Like would your dearest friend say?
Or a loved one, what would they say that they love about you?
Thank you.
What is there to be inspired by yourself?
And also for this question.
You can go and help from your loved ones.
What would they say?
You can be inspiring in you.
What is there to be inspired by yourself?
Is there something heroic in yourself?
Is there something heroic in yourself?
Maybe loving yourself is heroic.
You are in the same human condition as others.
You are just trying to live your life the best you can.
You are also in this little rocky boat that we call the human experience.
Can you see your own humanness?
Is it easier to see something that you can love in yourself?
Is it easier to see something to be inspired by?
Is it easier to be in loving presence for yourself?
You can also wish yourself a benevolent wish.
Something that's really fitting for you right now.
Self-chosen wish.
Or if you can't find a wish you can use, may I be happy?
I'm from this place of loving presence for yourself.
I'm seeing your own humanity.
You can wish this wish.
Thank you.
For the last minutes of the meditation.
You can't sense yourself this wish or other wishes.
Or sense the other beings that you've worked with while wishing.
Or you can just let go of the practice.
And just be in this present moment with loving presence.
Or just the way you are right now.
Or even if you don't feel any loving presence.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We can close this meditation by dedicating on the goodness that has arisen from our practice.
To take an atom wherever he is, and to his Sangha, to all beings who have been touched by him.
The goodness of our practice.
And may the goodness of our practice touch all beings everywhere.
The goodness of our practice.
Thank you.
We have some time for reflections or questions or comments.
Welcome to share a racial zoom hands or type something in the chat.
Yeah, go.
Thank you.
I, I have known a chicken out house since like 1985.
When I first became a resident and.
And even though I have read him a lot and known him for a long time was only this this evening I think that.
Part of part of me appreciated him more deeply.
Not as a celebrity.
Or cetera, but just how amazing it is to have an example of someone who's been so dedicated.
Through so much pain and suffering for so long.
Yeah, I just got into more of his humanity, more than his celebrity.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Powerful to realize that.
Thank you for sharing that.
I remember a few months ago, I was watching this interview with tick not on an opera.
And they were discussing his correspondence and friendship with Martin Luther King, Jr.
And there was a quote, something he said, which I was so moved by it, I wrote it down.
So I'm going to read it if that's okay.
Yeah, please.
He was, he was talking about his correspondence with Martin Luther King, Jr. in the, in the 1960s. And he said, on June 1st, 65, I wrote him a letter explaining to him why the monks in Vietnam emulated themselves by fire.
I said that this is not suicide, because in a difficult situation like Vietnam, to make your voice heard is difficult.
So sometimes we have to burn ourselves alive in order for our voice to be heard around.
So that is the act that is out of compassion that you do that. That is the act of love and not of despair.
Well, that's really powerful and beautiful.
Thank you for sharing.
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks for sharing that. I've seen that YouTube on YouTube, but I haven't watched it yet. What struck me about that is, it's worth considering that metabolism is a process of burning fuel.
So in a way we're all burning alive. And we should think about what we burn for.
That's also very beautiful and thought-provoking.
Beautiful inquiry. Thank you, Dave.
We could go into breakout groups.
But sometime afterwards to check in as well.
Let me see. Some people signing off usually. So I'm waiting a little bit.
Okay, I'm gonna be with three people and you can just check in about what feels up for you right now.
Just check in about the theme of tonight about loving ourselves and others being in loving presence.
So, you know, the team of Tick, Not Hon moved you. Yeah, what feels up and important right now.
With that, I'll send you away for about eight minutes.
Welcome back.
We have a few minutes to check in.
Maybe have some more reflections or comments or questions.
Things to share.
Gary.
You're so muted. Thank you. Thank you.
So I'm sorry I joined late, but I was like unlike sometimes I fall asleep during the longer meditation.
But I was wide awake and I was speaking in a small group that I'm in an election yet again in the field that I'm in, in medicine, but political.
It was helpful when you said in a longer meditation about seeing someone that, you know, may not be your best friend.
But so I was able to see my opponent in a, in a perhaps a life where the person's just trying to do what they're trying to do with their life.
So more equanimity way is was mentioned in a small group and it seemed that the person that came out of that is that both of us, my internal space was then warmer and less charged up and I felt better as a result of what you said so thank you.
Yeah, it's wonderful. Thanks for sharing. Yeah, that's it. Definitely something I can also experience when I do exercise like that.
It really helps to warm the heart a little bit for the person and see, see where they're coming from.
Thanks for sharing that.
Any other comments or questions or things to share.
And Diana. Yeah, I was just sharing in my group. Some of the questions were very powerful. And especially I'll just keep it simple. What is there to love. And I'm, I'm in a certain group where there's some turmoil right now.
And several people relates to behaviors and all kinds of things. And I, so just thinking about this what is there to love, because the negative can be such a default thing so when I started going through that.
The power of love is such that for each of I was doing each of three or four people. And I found like three things each or however many it was for each one.
And, but by the end of the sitting, I really wasn't thinking about the negative at all. I mean, I was really sort of in wonder about, gee, you know, these are kind of lovable people, but I think it was the power of the embodiment of it and feeling it and understanding
and all of that. So that's something that I'm going to carry forward. It's easy to do.
Yeah, that's wonderful. Indeed, you have to remember. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's the key, but it's easy to do and easy to warm up the heart a little bit for people. Yeah.
Thanks for sharing.
Yeah, well, got a minute left.
Last, last comments.
We were talking in the meditation about may you find dot dot dot my daughter's having extremely hard time with somebody who she finds to be absolutely detestable.
She told me there's not a single thing she can find a redeeming quality about this person.
What can you do with that pops.
And I have to admit, I told her yet, we might have to table this and dad might have to grok this a bit to come back with something but a little insight from what you said tonight, which was, and I think maybe my answer to her at this point, not all of it yet but the formative pieces
would be, well, if you can't find anything about her redeeming, maybe you can at least say a little prayer for her repetitively that something along the lines of, may you, may you find some insight.
There's no way to not be such an asshole. Maybe they've made you find your way in this world to to be a support to other people and to pray that for her.
Yeah, extend some sense of loving kindness and compassion to release.
I'm thinking about it now and that came from your suggestions tonight so thank you for that. Awesome. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for sharing that that's a very good insight.
When I have someone really difficult I usually wish for them may you may you develop wisdom, because then they won't be as, you know, it's difficult anymore once they have some wisdom.
It's a little bit of a workaround indeed and it really works. So, yeah, great. Well, thanks everyone for your comments also a few in the chat that everyone can read things.
Yeah, see you all next time and then tomorrow and Diana again I think. So, yeah, have a wonderful rest of your evening or day or night, whatever time it is free.
