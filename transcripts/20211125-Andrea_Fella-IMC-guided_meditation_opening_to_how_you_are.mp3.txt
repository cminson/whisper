 For me, this is a receptive kind of question, not like looking for something, but more just settling back and allowing how I am to show up, to show itself. That's where I can be surprised. Oh, I didn't know that was there. So starting with this receptive and allowing exploration. How are you? And rather than trying to answer with words, letting our hearts and minds and bodies respond with the experience of how you are. Especially if you can find your way with that kind of exploration. Just how is this being in this moment and keep with that exploration that is a way into our practice, a way into being with ourselves, exploring, understanding our bodies, hearts and minds. How are you? I'm letting the body, heart and mind show us, show you how you are. There can be a sense of allowing how you are to evolve and change, to shift as the moments pass, new conditions arise. We might notice that as we allow our experience to be as it is to kind of come into itself, to show itself, that the very way that we explore that with an allowing, receptive attitude, that that itself is a condition that might create a new experience, a shift, something we might initially resist or struggle with. We can find, oh, it's okay. It's okay for this to be here. Resting back and receiving. Resting back and receiving. Resting back and receiving. Resting back and receiving. Resting back and receiving.
