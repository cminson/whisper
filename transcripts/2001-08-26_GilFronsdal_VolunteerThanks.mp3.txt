 Since I had my tonsillectomy about eight, nine, ten days ago, we can go Thursday. So it's been a rough road, boy. The doctors told me, they kept telling me over and over again, they kept being very reassuring, saying, this is going to hurt. They weren't offering any kind of, you know, we'll give you pain medicine or whatever. It's going to hurt. It's really going to hurt a lot. It was a lot harder as an adult, they kept saying. So it was hard. I was really surprised, though I really depended on the Vicodin. I tried to take as little as I could, and so I kind of pushed the limits. And it would take about 10, 20 minutes for it to kick in once I'd taken the pill. And I would actually kind of crumble under the pain when I finally wore off until a new pill took in. It was quite intense. I still have some of it. I'm still dealing with all kinds of bodily stuff and relationship to it, but I feel pretty good. And it seems like I've come to the other end of this one. So, yes, I made it here today. And I didn't know whether I'd either make it or have a voice to speak. And the idea of today was to somehow express appreciation, mutual appreciation, for the many people who volunteer for our community. About a year and a half ago, Cheryl Hilton and Cheryl Gassner, and maybe some other people, counted up how many volunteers we had in our community. And I knew we depended on volunteers, and I'd been very grateful for that for many years. And when they came back, they listed all the things we'd done, all the names of people who did things. And they came back with, depending how you counted, between 50 and 75 people. And I was astounded. I had no idea that there were that many people involved in doing all the things that we, that take to organize our community. Some of the things were small things, and some things were huge things. But maybe some people didn't even feel they were particularly doing something that's significant. And so I ended up to this whole kind of creation, this whole community we have and the way we have it. And that everyone else participates in creating it. And we've been talking for a long time about having some kind of volunteer appreciation event. And so we thought of today, with the idea that I would give some kind of talk that seemed appropriate. And then after the talk, to have a little bit, everybody's welcome to stay for another 20 minutes or 30 minutes. But in particular, the people who have volunteered over the years, they come kind of forward and sit kind of in the front. And they will have something a little bit special for the volunteers. And then we'll have our potluck. So potluck will happen a little bit later than usual, because we'll extend a little bit because of this volunteer thing. So it all seems very nice and wonderful when we thought about it. And I was very inspired because I feel very grateful for all the volunteers and everything. But now that I'm sitting here, I'm going to speak to you about this topic. I'm not sure what to say. You know, it seemed the appropriate thing to do is to come down here and give a very inspiring talk and heartwarming talk about how wonderful volunteering is and our volunteers are. And everyone left leave with kind of very good feeling. So but I don't know what the word should be to say that exactly. I don't know. Thinking about it, I'm not sure how I understand the whole thing of volunteering. I could say various kind of things kind of. It's very simply kind of obvious things about it. But as I've been thinking about it the last week, I've actually kind of found myself kind of with less and less understanding of what I might say today. So it feels a little bit awkward to come down here with that kind of contrast between the appropriateness of giving a rousing, inspiring talk and wondering, you know, what do I say? Each day it goes along. I wonder more and more. What do I say about this topic? So I apologize ahead of time for that. But let me say a few things that has occurred to me. One is that the idea of volunteering is that it's voluntary. And the volunteering giving of oneself is a very central aspect, kind of key element of Buddhist spirituality. And perhaps that's why it's a little bit hard for me to know what to say because it's like the air we breathe. It's such a central part of the whole culture that embarrassingly enough, maybe I haven't actually looked at the air that's invisible. So it's clearly as maybe as I should have. But the idea of volunteering, voluntary offerings. And voluntary means literally that it's completely voluntary with no expectation or requirement that things be given. And down through the centuries, Buddhism has survived or continued and been propagated and transmitted by people's voluntary efforts. Is this working okay for everyone? Does everybody hears me fine? And in many of the ways, many of my times in Asia, I was very moved by the level of volunteer participation in the communities, in the temples, and the teaching centers that I was at. And certainly it was the obvious ways in which people gave money. And giving money was a popular thing to do. And they treated money giving, money donations, a little bit differently than they do here in America, especially in Burma. Here in America, I'm not sure exactly, maybe I should generalize, but I won't generalize, but there was a way in which it was handled in Burma that made the Westerners very uncomfortable. Maybe because of the kind of attitude we have about giving here in this country. It was very popular in Burma for people to donate the food for the main meal of the day. So people would come in, either donate the food or offer money so the monastery can go out and buy food and cook the food for all the monastics, the monks, the nuns, the lay people practicing there. And there were sometimes 500,000, 2,000 people to cook for in the monastery. So it certainly was a big event to have enough food and to cook and prepare it all. And so for the Burmese, which is a very poor country, people are very poor, any kind of donation to the monastery was often to stretch their finances quite a bit. But any people did. And every day we showed up for lunch and there'd be food for us. In the entryway to the cafeteria or the dining hall, there was a very, very big blackboard. And on the blackboard they had written on the blackboard the names of the people who had donated the money for that day's meals and then bought the money they gave. And mostly it was Burmese, but every once in a while you see a Westerners name and they wrote that in kind of Roman letters or whatever it's called in our kind of script so you can see, you know, who made the donation. And this was very embarrassing for us Westerners that our name should be up there because it felt a little bit maybe selfish or self-centered or a little bit like you didn't want to advertise the fact that you made this donation. Somehow it was more private affairs, kind of anonymous or something. And over and over again the Westerners commented how awkward it was. But in Asia it was actually something people were in a sense, I think in a healthy way, happy to do and proud to do. And it was just kind of part of the culture to let it be known. So there's certainly people making donations of money, but there was tremendous amount of people who donated their effort and their times, all the abilities they had. I was very touched by the medical care Westerners got when we were in the monasteries in Burma because seemingly the best medical practitioners, doctors, medical schools in Burma would come to the monastery to help us if we were sick. I remember I was sitting very peacefully one day meditating, minding my own business, not doing anything to get in trouble. And suddenly in the middle of my meditation session my filming fell down. It was very odd and maybe it was kind of hot there, so maybe things expanded and got hotter through the day. I don't know, just sitting there, we might be not moving and not talking. So I went to my teacher and described what happened in my meditation. And so he went and the next day Dennis came to the monastery to check my tooth. He said, it's fine. He said, you don't have to do anything. It's just part of the cavity fell out. So people came and offered their services. Many people offered their time to cook the meals, to take care of the grounds, to take care of the administrations of the monastery. The monastery was quite large, it was kind of like a junior college campus size built in the 1950s, with long kind of walkways and wide walkways and big meditation halls. And I was really struck by all the number of people who were contributing and supporting through their volunteer efforts. And I always felt that the teachers that I had in Asia were also volunteering their time and efforts. They always seemed people to be very busy. They had a lot of responsibilities. Usually they were the abbots of a place, of a monastery. And being an abbot, they had responsibility not only of the temple itself, but they had responsibility of the local community. It was kind of a community center and people come from local community for all kinds of needs. And the abbot would just say they were kind of usually in his little house, usually a one room house or two room house. And taking care of all these needs would also then be available for us Westerners. And I often felt that this was really kind of their efforts, they were kind of extending themselves in their kind of volunteer efforts to help us. Without ever any expectation that we were supposed to give anything in return. There was never any hint by any of the people in any of the monasteries I practice in Asia that we were supposed to make donations. No eyebrows raised if we had by were leaving now after eight months of sitting in the monastery eating their food and we had not given anything. They were so happy that we were practicing and that they felt that if we practice sincerely that was our biggest gift in return. But again the point is that it was this volunteer effort of the community, of the people living there that made the whole monastery function. And this is the way it's been I believe since the time of the Buddha. And tremendous amount of people offering themselves and built into Indian Buddhism, maybe much of Indian culture, is the idea of offering. There's appears most dramatically in the Hindu word Bhakti, Sanskrit word Bhakti. And Bhakti has kind of this fervent devotionalism that can be quite filled with love and passion. But this kind of faith driven devotion of Bhakti is often expressed through acts of service and acts of offering to the object of worship. And Indian culture is built up very much on this notion of making offerings, not only to the guru but in the Buddhist tradition to the Sangha. And one of the very central aspects of Buddhism from the time of the Buddha is that people can make offerings to the Sangha, to the community. Rather than having to do it to one particular person or the monk or whatever. I'm not sure about this but I believe actually the Buddha encouraged people to make donations to the community more than to some one illustrious monk in the monastery. Because if there are many monks in the monastery, if the one who was most wise or most charismatic or whatever, received all the donations then all the other monks would starve. They could be lopsided. So there was a system set up of making donations to the monastery. And the monastery was responsible for distributing them appropriately. So the volunteering is a central aspect and it's continued down through the ages. There would be no Buddhism today unless there was some aspect of people volunteering their time, their money, their efforts. So that's one thing on one hand. When I was in Japan, I stayed in Zen monasteries. And sometimes I'd go visit a Zen monastery, I would live in town and go visit a Zen monastery for the morning meditation. And one of the things that struck me was that when I went to these Zen temples in the morning to sit, there was an expectation that it was as thick as the air. No one ever said it but it was obvious that this was the system. You couldn't just show up just to meditate. If you should have just came to meditate and then left, it just was not good. You felt it. This was not appropriate. It was kind of like you were spiritually bereft or you were misunderstood or you just felt wrong. You did something terrible. You did like a faux pas. What you expected to do if you came to meditation, which you came expected to come to meditate, and then to do the morning service, which was 10, 15, 20 minutes of chanting usually, and followed that, you're expected to participate in what's called soji, which is the temple cleaning, which also took about 10, 15 minutes. And those three things made one unit and were somehow considered indivisible by the Zen teachers and the Zen communities there. You come and you do all three. They're meant as a package together. If your spiritual life was only about sitting by yourself, sitting meditating, your spiritual life was myopic, lopsided, threw something off about it. And part of it should also be some act of faith or devotion, which was a chanting, a service. And also a very important part of it was this act of work, soji, at the end of this segment of time. And it was often very much fun to do this morning work. In the Zen kind of spirit, you're supposed to do it quite vigorously. And the Pasana students would often have some adjustments to do it because they showed up wanting to do things really slowly and methodically and thoughtfully. And in Zen, you're supposed to kind of just, you know, top speed, as fast as you could, kind of just race around. And the important thing was to work. It was not so important what you got done. Does that make sense? What was important was the activity of offering. So there was always odd things about that, where sometimes they would give too many people to clean a particular area. But you had to work until the bell rang. So you'd have people kind of redoing the same thing. You know, I remember many times, you know, I was assigned to one big hall where they had a lot of columns. And after a while, we'd kind of dusted off with damp cloths, all the columns, once. And then someone would come along and dust them a second time, sometimes three times. They were really clean. Or we were sent out to rake the pathways. Very common. That's one of the most common things to do in the temples, is to rake the pathways. You know, leaves, you know, clear leaves and stuff. But often, sometimes there were no leaves. It didn't matter. You had to rake. The important was the activity. So it seemed a little bit absurd at times. But the spirit of it was this kind of offering part of yourself in supporting the temple, contributing to make the whole temple thing happen. And that this was considered to be a unit, your meditation, your act of devotion, and your act of service or work in return. I don't know exactly if return is the right way of talking about it. And there was never any discussion about responsibility. There was never any discussion about why you do this. It was just kind of, this is what was expected. When I, so I came to our sitting group in 1990, and our sitting group preceded me. I was invited in, in 1990, to kind of be the teacher of the group. And when I first started as a teacher, I very much felt and took the attitude that I was here under invitation. And I wouldn't do anything unless the group invited me to do something. And so eventually someone thought it would be a good idea to have me do a one day sitting. So I said, okay, I'll do that. And, but, you know, it was a group that pre-existed me. And after a while, the group kept growing and growing. And I was certainly kind of a focal point for the group. And after a while, it felt like it just didn't make sense to live by this illusion that I was just here on invitation. Because, I don't know, just that wasn't, you know, what was happening anymore. But as it grew and developed back there on Calper Street in Palo Alto, there became a need, I don't know if need, but we started to grow. We were maybe 15 people, then 20, 30, we got to about 40 people in the Calper Street Presbyterian Church. And as we grew, one of the important understandings that I had is that it's very important for a community of spiritual practitioners to share in taking responsibility for the community. And I felt that as people developed in their spiritual practice, it was important to give some people, give people the opportunity to grow personally, spiritually, whatever, through acts of service to the community itself. And that if people simply just showed up to meditate and then went home, which is a fine thing to do, but if that's all we offered, we were truncating, limiting the possibility of growth for people who are ready for more to grow in other ways. And one of the ways to keep growing is to begin taking responsibility for the spiritual community that you're part of. So I felt it was very important to begin offering opportunities for people to take responsibility, but always in the kind of volunteer spirit that is part of Buddhist tradition. So there were things, you know, we didn't really need, a lot of things I could have done easily, but I felt as soon as we started, I could see there were opportunities for people to help. I asked, you know, does anybody want to help with this? Does anybody want to help with this? So Spirit Rock would send me all this literature. Who wants to help with the literature? You know, take it back and forth. It was always helpful for me not to have to do it, but you know, who wants to have the key and open and close? Who wants to do this and that? And it felt very important to pass on some of the responsibilities to other people. And so at some point, basically I kind of invented, I kind of told someone, okay, you're now the president of our sitting group. And, oh, and so you're kind of, you know, your job, you know, if you want to do this, your job is to kind of keep an overview of the whole thing that we're doing, which wasn't much at that point. And now a couple of things happened as people volunteered in this way. One is that it tended to create community because the more people who took responsibility, the more people who were visible in those kinds of roles, the more they related to the wider community and were stood out in the community. And the more they were people related to each other, it was actually very helpful in creating a stronger sense of community, people knowing each other, being familiar with each other. And having a strong sense of community is a very important part of a spiritual life. We learned from others by knowing them, by being in relationship to them, by having them mirror us. So as we started having more volunteers, I started to notice we also started to have more community, which was very nice. Also, as people got engaged in some of the volunteer work, sometimes friction would arise between people. And rather than thinking that friction was a bad thing, I thought, great, what a, this is a great, I couldn't think of a better community to have friction in it. Because if you have that tendency to, all of us have tendencies to get in conflict with each other, this would be a great community to have it occur in because we're all, listen, very dedicated to being mindful and compassionate and to hang in there and try to see each other in a kind way as we work through these things. And now they kind of dismiss people or just kind of whatever, kind of dismiss them in ways that doesn't really take care of the conflict. Our community is dedicated, I hope, to really working with conflict and using conflict as part of the spiritual practice itself. So this would be a great community for conflict. So you're welcome to have some. And one of the ways to have opportunity for this to arise is to, you know, volunteer. And some of you have had to deal with me. And, you know, it's great. So, so the community then becomes a mirror and a mirror for ourselves. It becomes a vehicle for learning all kinds of useful skills, I hope, and how to work with conflict and be with other people. One of the opportunities in volunteering I've also noticed is that in volunteering, people can create something new. And in a small group like ours, one person's efforts, inspiration, can go a long, long way. And one of the things I've learned in my adult life is actually how much one individual can do with their own efforts. And I'm kind of in the school that individuals actually are quite powerful. They put their mind to something, their hearts to something, and put a time to create it. And individuals can do phenomenal change for our society. When I started college, I went to UC Santa Barbara. My father, who's a professor at UCLA, took me aside. He was going to give me some insider's advice about how to deal with the UC system. And he said, just remember, Gil, that all the rules were made by people, so people can change them. So don't feel limited by any of the rules. And that, when I was, when I was trying to graduate four years later, not four years, but six years later, I dropped out for a couple of years. That piece of advice worked really well because there were all these requirements I hadn't taken. So I went to my advisor and gave him other reasons why I shouldn't do these requirements. And he said, okay. But the more important lesson for my father was that, at least the UC system, was that I felt actually somehow empowered to make a difference. I eventually went to UC Davis, and I got involved with, I was studying agriculture, alternative agriculture, organic farming and things. And together with a handful of others interested in organic farming, we organized ourselves as the political agricultural activists on campus. And I was actually quite amazed by how much this very small handful of students were able to accomplish by just kind of plugging away and working the system and made a huge difference. The things that we did, except in motion, we started in mid-late 70s, continues at UC Davis today. The cleverest thing we did was we wanted to start a student farm, an alternative ecological farm on campus. UC Davis is the great agribusiness center of California, of the world. And we'd done various things. We started teaching classes. We got permission to teach our own classes. But we're in a valid class. People got credit for taking them. And we wanted to start this farm, so we organized ourselves for that. And then during the summer of 1970, I think it was probably 1978, we petitioned to the state legislature to grant us several hundred thousand dollars in money, and a certain plot of 40 acres or something of UC Davis land, so we could start an alternative farm, a research center on campus. And the person who actually did the work of approaching the legislature, maybe he was kind of savvy to these kinds of things, and he noticed that this was going to come up. He wanted to actually arrange it to our suggested legislation, came up at the same time as a piece of legislation in favor of the California farm workers. It's a little bit sad, the story, which wasn't going to go anywhere. It wasn't going to win, this thing about the farm workers. There was not enough support for it. But it was also very embarrassing for the legislatures to vote against it. So by offering ours at the same time, it gave the legislature a way of saving face. So they voted. $200,000 is something we got in 40 acres of land. Suddenly we were at this bunch of undergraduates at UC Davis with this big budget and this big plot of land. We had to hire a full-time farm manager and figure out what to do. And that farm still continues to stay, and they have farm managers and activities and stuff. One person can make a big difference. A group of people can make a phenomenal difference. I'm amazed at what we've managed to do here in Palo Alto and in the peninsula with our sitting group. I would never have imagined 10 years ago, 11 years ago, that the group of 15 of us would have ended up being 11 years later at the brink of perhaps having our own center, our own building, and being able to offer so much to the wider community. I think that we have a big impact. I don't know how big. I don't want to get it, you know, be too... grand joists about it. But we have an impact, a very important, wholesome impact on our wider community that we're part of here in the peninsula. There's a lot of people who benefit from coming through here. A lot of people come through just a few times and will come back 7 years later and say, that made a big difference for me. I didn't come regularly, I couldn't, but those few times made a big difference. There's a lot of benefit that kind of spreads out from our community into the wider community. A lot of people in our community have tremendous benefit from their involvement with the community, with our practice, with our teachings. One of the privileges of being in my role as a teacher is that people will come and talk to me about the impact that the practice, the teachings, the community have that many of you don't get the opportunity to hear. Sometimes they feel maybe kind of private or whatever and they come to me and sometimes people open their hearts in very, kind of very full ways. And so I get to hear the impact that we have. And I'm actually in awe of the tremendous impact on people's lives that this practice has. I know for myself how powerful it is, but to see that this community of ours and the practice we offer and the activities we offer here, offer so much to so many people. I couldn't have imagined 11 years ago it was going to be like this. And now that we've come this far, now I can imagine much more. And I'm really inspired by the possibility of getting a center, whether we get this place in Redwood City or we get some other place. And one of the things that inspires me is not the building so much, but is that the building becomes an opportunity for more people to practice and more people to channel their inspiration, their joy, their volunteers and their offering back to the community. One of the reasons why people volunteer is they feel so grateful that they want to somehow, it doesn't feel right somehow to keep it just for oneself. And they want to return what they feel the gift that they've been given. And I feel that way profoundly that the gift that I got from my teachers and the communities I practiced with here in America and in Asia, you know, were probably the most precious gifts of my life. And it doesn't make sense to kind of keep them kind of bottled up inside of me. It's like, you know, someone who sits, you know, on a treasure, you know, and has all this wealth and they just kind of put their wealth under the mattress and sit there for years and years until I die. I'm very happy to have all this wealth. What good does it do? So you want to share it with other people and give back. And I feel part of what I do as a teacher is offering back the best I can of what I feel I was given. So that's another reason why people volunteer, is to offer back. So one of the things I was uncertain about in giving this talk was how to reconcile the idea of volunteering, being a voluntary activity with the notion of responsibility, of taking responsibility, being responsible for a community that you're part of, whether it's the local community, their sitting group, their community, their community. Or the wider community, whatever. Because when you use the word responsibility, it's a much heavier word than volunteering. It has a feeling, a little bit of being obligatory when you're your responsibility. And I don't want to have anyone to ever feel this obligation to volunteer or to be involved in our community. I think it's become the death of part of our spirit in which we do things, if that becomes part of it. But I don't want to say there's no role for responsibility. I think responsibility is very important. So I'm not sure how to reconcile these things. But hopefully, maybe some of you can come up with ideas, how to reconcile them. But certainly I feel that the responsibility that we take should be voluntary and come from the kind of joy and inspiration that volunteerism, I hope, is an expression of. Part of the beauty of the day of volunteerism is that it's voluntary and people can offer whatever they can, whatever their circumstances allow. The sense of responsibility kind of feels more like everyone has this responsibility. I have to extend myself now. And it's hard for me. I think everyone is in different circumstances. It's very important to realize that we all have different circumstances. Some people have big families, some people have health difficulties, some people have other places they volunteer that are very important for them or other activities they do. People's lives are very different from each other. And so I don't want to be – there's no need for anyone to measure what is their appropriate way of being involved in our community. There are some people who come for years and never in a sense volunteer their time and their efforts in any way. And that's completely fine. There's no problem with that. There are other people who come for years and just come and sit in the same way and never volunteer. And actually there's something off about it. There's something quite right to come for years and years and not to offer something of yourself in return. What's the difference between those two people? For those people who it's fine not to do that and those people who it seems a little bit odd not to give something in return. I don't know exactly the details of their lives, but I'm very conscious of how different people's lives are and some people don't have the ability or the time or whatever. In our community I hope very much that people feel completely comfortable to come as they are and with no sense of obligation at all to participate in any volunteer efforts at all. But if you feel inspired for all the different reasons a person might be inspired to volunteer, that the channels for volunteering, the opportunities, the doors for volunteering are wide open for you. And if you find the opportunities easily available and fun and really enjoyable and rewarding. So that's about all I have to say. It's a little bit awkward for me again, the whole talk. Awkward now at the end because in giving a talk about how wonderful volunteering is, the aspects of it, I don't want to leave lingering feelings in people's minds that, oh, maybe I'm supposed to be volunteering. That's not what I have in mind. So those are my thoughts. And if we had more time it would have been nice to hear from all of you about your thoughts about this also. But what I'd like to do is switch now. And those people who would like to leave now can leave. It's almost time 10.45. Those people who in any kind of way, even as the most minuscule small way you can imagine, have volunteered in our community. If you would stay and come up and kind of sit close to the front. And those of you who haven't volunteered, would like to stay and be part of the next part, it would be really neat if you stayed. Just to listen and hear what's going to happen next. And no one's going to look over their shoulders and kind of whatever. Think about why isn't that person volunteering? Is that okay with folks? So why don't we kind of rearrange the room a little bit if that works. And those of you who would like to go home can go. Or some of you who can also set up for our potluck if you want to do that instead. So one of the things I try to, do I have more people? Do you want to say their names? One of the reasons, I tried to give my talk, give some of the reasons why a person might volunteer. And one of the reasons I left out was I think that volunteering or helping create community is an expression of love. And that as our hearts become more open and more friendly and more sensitive to others, it becomes almost a natural instinct to offer ourselves, to offer help, to offer to volunteer in many ways. And I think it's also an expression of love. And one of the things that also I've been struck by over the years as our community has grown is we've also grown, I feel, as a community of friendly people, of loving people. I feel a tremendous amount of kindness flowing within our community, all kinds of different directions and angles and ways. And it takes many different expressions. Just very small ones, just caring about people and smiling and asking how people are, getting to know each other. Sometimes when people come new to the community, it takes a while to meet people because we spend so much time in silence or listening to a speaker. But slowly if you come, people get familiar with you and slowly people, you know, you get to know people. And it becomes, I feel, a very powerful sense of kindness or love at times in our community. And I'm very grateful for it. I'm very grateful to be part of this community. It's become one of the more important things of my life. And a very central aspect of my own practice is to be involved in this community. Slowly as, you know, when I first came here 11 years ago, I had no thought about hanging around. I mean, I came to be a graduate student at Stanford. And it was just like, you know, and I was supposed to, I was being trained to be the impassana teacher. And part of the training was to kind of lead a sitting group. And I was wondering, well, how is that going to happen? You can't just kind of materialize a sitting group. But then, but then there happened to be one in Palo Alto that was looking for a teacher. And so they're connected to me and they asked me to come. And so I was doing it partly because it's wonderful to offer what I love to teach. And partly because it's a homework assignment. That's part of the training. And being trained as a impassana teacher, I thought that what I was being trained for was to be a retreat teacher. You know, that's really what I thought the harder the practice was to teach longer retreats, the longer, the better. And what happened over the years of being here, that I came to slowly more and more appreciate the value and profundity of this kind of practice, this kind of way of having a community. So that now, I still think it's very important to teach retreats. But it's as important for me to be involved in a community like this, is this to go off and teach retreats or sit retreats. That the level of personal change and transformation that happens when a community arises out of people's daily lives is very, very essential to one's overall spiritual development. If one only goes and does retreat practice and goes deeper and deeper and practice and retreat, it's very easy for that practice to become lopsided. But if our spiritual life, our understanding, our psychological hang-ups and everything bump into people in the spiritual community, we get purified. We find ourselves, we work on ourselves. And it gives an avenue for expression of our love, our devotion, our caring for each other, which without an avenue of expression will sometimes stagnate. Sometimes horrible things happen to you if what's inside... I feel like ending by saying, kind of echoing what Courtney said, sometimes it feels a little bit like magic. Though that shouldn't be the last word because magic is kind of like a generalization of all these individual little people's good intentions and choices and involvements. But somehow the synergy of it all, how it all comes together and how it all makes our community seemingly run so smoothly. I am also in awe of it and quite appreciative. And so if I step back and look from a distance, it just seems like magic. And so may the magic continue. So I just again express my tremendous, heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for everyone who comes to our community, those people who volunteer in what's called volunteer positions. But actually anyone who comes and sits with us is volunteering. And just simply the act of coming and practicing in our community is a gift that you give to others. You don't have to look for any more activities. You don't have to look for just the kind of regular commitment or just any kind of involvement with practice encourages people around you. You might not think that. You might be sitting inside your own mind and think, this mind is out of control. But the fact that you're sitting there trying to do your best or trying to deal with it means that someone else might be coming in and they open their eyes up and look around and say, wow, these people are sitting here with, oh, still, maybe I can do it too. They close their eyes and lo and behold, they managed to get to the sitting. They got through it because there were other people to get through it with. So even just sitting with us is a volunteer phenomena and it's a gift. So I'm very grateful to everyone. And now I'm very grateful that we're going to have lunch. And please, I hope that as many of you as possible can stay and whether you brought something or not, we'll enjoy our company outside here. And then at 1230, it happens to be somewhat of a coincidence, but that this church kind of to a head that we also have a second meeting at 1230. Thank you.
