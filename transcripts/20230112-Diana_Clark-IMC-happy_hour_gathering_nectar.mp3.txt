 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome to Happy Hour. And for those of you who receive an end of year letter from IMC, every year there's a bookmark that goes out with it, and then there's a quote. And there's a little bit of a discussion, what is the quote going to be, what's the image going to be, and all this kind of stuff every year. And this year I wasn't involved with it. In the past years I have been, and this year I wasn't. And you guys probably can't see this, but I just want to show that it's like a flower. And there's some green and there's some words, and I'm going to read the words. So the idea is just a flower. And in the back, probably is it backwards for you guys? It might say, may all beings be free from suffering, and that it just has IMC and IRC kind of our information. So whatever I talk about a little bit, are these words down here. So this is a quote from the Dhammapada. Dhammapada is this probably the most, in fact I think it is, it's the most commonly translated Buddhist text. So it's a collection of verses. And it's really meaningful for a lot of people and it's been translated, I don't know, 20, 25 different translators have done it so they all have like different flavors to it. And many of you know that Gil van Stoll is kind of the founder of IMC. He translated it, and it's one of the main ones that gets sold on Amazon now is his translation. And he's just now going through and tweaking some of his translations and making little adjustments. So, so this verse is from what the Dhammapada, and it goes like this. As a bee gathers nectar and moves on without harming the flower, its color or its fragrance. So a sage walks through the world. I'll say it again. As a bee gathers nectar and moves on without harming, without harming the flower, its color or its fragrance. So a sage walks through the world. I love this idea, like, starting with, as a bee gathers nectar. But sometimes we might have this idea like we should just give, we should just give, or, you know, we have to, somehow we're not allowed to gather nectar, we're not allowed to gather things that are sweet and nourishing and pleasant and helpful. And for a bee, right, certainly it's nutritious and maybe helps them keep them alive. But then the emphasis is here that, and then moves on without harming the flower, its color or its fragrance. There's something very sweet for me about, we could say without harming the flower. But we're also talking about the color and the fragrance. Like, this is not the same thing as nectar. It's something else that's beautiful about flowers. There's more to flowers than just nectar. So it's like, like kind of allowing ourselves to be nourished, to be sword supported, to taste this sweetness, to gather, gather what's helpful without harming. Maybe that's what we say is kind of this practice, maybe is a big part of this practice. And so I would say that loving kindness practice is a way in which helps us to move through the world, to not, without harming, as well as allows us to move through the world and gather nectar, those things that are be helpful. Right, with an open heart, and a more spacious heart, and warm heart, we're able to receive, and we're also able to not harm. And I think both of these are important. It's certainly not harming is important but also receiving sometimes we tend to neglect that and think that receiving is not spiritual or something like this or that we should do it or something like this, I don't know, but I'm going to say this first one more time. As a bee gathers nectar and moves on without harming the flower, its color or its fragrance. So, a sage walks through the world. Because I was saying that I occurred to me, oh, funny, in English, the word sage right it's a herb, as well as a wise person so the stuff about plants and wisdom, I don't I guess probably herbs don't walk through the world but there's just something nice kind of like orienting to herbs, maybe add spice to our food or something like this. There's just for me as some sweetness and tenderness without being sappy and sentimental. Okay, so with that as an introduction, let's do some practice. So we'll take a bright hmm, settling into the moment, settling into this experience. And just feeling what it feels like at this moment. Would it be too much of a stretch. If I suggested that just as it be gathers nectar, we can gather this feeling of being supported and connected to the chair cushion, a couch, and whatever we're sitting and allow ourselves to feel supported, literally gentle body scan, seeing if there are any tightness or obvious areas of tension. And if so, just resting the awareness there. Without insisting that it be different or be otherwise but sometimes just by bringing our attention, those body to relax a little to soften to open. Sometimes it can be helpful to do just tiny really small postural adjustments. Just as, especially with the spine, I meant to be in alignment, one vertebrae on top of the next. Just feeling the attention on the sensations of breathing, feeling how the body moves with the breath. Just staying here with the breath. Right now there's nothing else to do. Just hanging out with the sensations of breathing. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Just to mind a lovable pain. Someone for whom it's easy, simple, uncomplicated. To connect with and a feeling of warm heartedness. Imaginary being, being currently in your life, by being formerly in your life. Never. Connecting with this lovable being. And as a support for that connection, we can say these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Connecting with this lovable being. And checking in with the body. There might be, it's okay if there isn't, but there might be a sense of ease or openness or warmth or softness in the body. When feeling connected to this lovable being. If there is that experience, allow it to be a support for you. Maybe allowing the experience, that sensation to get as big as it would like. And then expanding our loving kindness. To include a good friend, close family member. Somebody with whom we have a relationship currently. Or maybe a memory. Someone with whom we have this close relationship. Different than the lovable being, recognizing that sometimes there's little bumps in the road. Doesn't mean we don't care about them. Just means that sometimes humans aren't always on the same page. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Safety. And then to extend our loving kindness even further. To include ourselves. So important to include ourselves. And the most difficult category or person or being. So imagining ourselves, whether an image or tuning into the felt experience. May you be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. Nourishing. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I can't be helpful if there's a particular individual that we don't know, as opposed to just that generic category of people we don't know that. So it might be somebody here on the zoom call and name. Maybe somebody you see occasionally in the neighborhood. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Again this first goes. As a bee gathers nectar. And moves on. That harming the flower its color or its fragrance. So a sage walks through the world. Is there a way that loving kindness well wishing good will towards even people you don't know. Is a way in which we're gathering nectar without harming. It's a beautiful thing to wish others well. And we feel that. Thank you. Thank you. And I think to end with some equanimity practice, such a support. This idea of non harming. And equanimity practice bring into mind somebody that you care about. And a little bit of friction sometimes. Maybe a little frustrated or annoyed. Not the most difficult person you know. Maybe a little bit of a two or a three. I mean this person to mind. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for your support. happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. There's a way in which practicing equanimity in this way, this particular way, supports equanimity arising in other arenas in one's life. So even though we're practicing it just in this one type of situation, makes it more likely equanimity will arise in other types of situations. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. Thank you. So this idea of a bee gathering nectar without harming others, just a reminder that we could really stretch this analogy and thinking that well bees also sting when they're feeling threatened. So this isn't like a just a passive sweetness ooey gooey. It's like, you know, there's limits too that they are setting. They're just not harming. Except maybe when they feel like they're under mortal threat and maybe they are when they feel like they are when they sting us humans. So I'd like to put you into some breakout groups and you'll have an opportunity to talk about this idea of the bee gathering nectar without harming the flower, its fragrance, or its petals, its color or its fragrance. These different aspects of these things that kind of support make a flower be a flower. So put you into groups of three or four. And it's really nice to just make one point at a time and then let it go to the next point. Next person and they make one point and then it goes to the next person and then they make one point. So in this way kind of like levels the playing field between all the introverts and the extroverts and allows everybody to have an opportunity to say something as well as make it so that one person doesn't end up doing a tremendous amount of speaking and then there's just, you know, 40 seconds at the end for the last person. Nobody likes that. So for the purpose of this little breakout group to make the circle in which you'll go around, why don't we do it in reverse alphabetical order? So I think it's easiest to just figure out alphabetical order and then just go the opposite order rather. If you're like me, I can't remember like notice X, is that before Y after Y, you know, just go to alphabetical and then do the opposite. So guys will be in a group in for 14 minutes, I think. And here we go. Uh oh, my video did this earlier today. I'm just going to turn off my video. Yeah, me and my computer just not. That's just I don't know, it's been one of those days. So welcome back from the breakout rooms. Does anybody have a comment or something they'd like to share? Nope. Yes, Jerry. Thank you first of all for the, I always appreciate some of your quotes at the beginning. And I guess what it reminded me of both the, about the B and then about equanimity was of course the B is benefiting and plant benefits. But you don't want, it's like a balance. You don't want to like take too much and be greedy, otherwise you could harm things. And at the same time, you want to allow space. So it reminded me of both in life, the simplicity, the complexity and you know, the potential for harm in relationships. So thank you. It was quite helpful. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Jerry. Yeah, with this idea of moderation or that we have to be sensitive to, well, what is harmful to this flower, quote unquote, you know, and yeah, how can we gather nectar in a way that's supportive without causing harm and with equanimity? Thank you. And I want to make a big shout out of thanks for all of your generosity and kindness and helpfulness over these years of particularly of COVID. It's been extraordinarily helpful. Thank you. Thank you, Jerry. Yeah, a few people have sent me some chats and I was feeling a little sad, like, oh, I'm not going to be doing this, but I'll still be here. And I wish my camera worked. Does it work again? Oh, it's working again. Excellent. Yeah, so I'll be here next week. And then then I'm off sitting in retreat. I'll be gone for a number of weeks. Okay, so we're at the top of the hour. And so I'll see you guys all on Tuesday. So I wish you a wonderful rest of the week and weekend. And if you'd like to unmute, we can all say goodbye together. Bye bye. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. You're welcome. So, I have a quick question for you. Yes. I'm new to the group. Thank you.
