The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So many of you know me. I'm Kim Allen and I saw one comment asking about Gil
because apparently he had to cancel the meditation yesterday just to let you know
he is fine. That was just a complication where he wasn't able to be there but
everything is okay. So I'll be here with you this week. So as you likely know
there are a lot of lists in Buddhism and I think they're quite helpful. But I was
recently reminded of some items from a different set of lists in the 12 days of
Christmas. And the last set goes like this. Five gold rings, four calling birds,
three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree. It's an
interesting list. And it turns out that Buddhism has some unusual lists also. So
I was inspired to consider some of the less well-known lists in the Buddhist
teachings and that is going to be the theme for this week. So today we'll have
a list of five, tomorrow a list of four, and so on down to one item on Friday. And
we'll see that there is some deep Dharma in these somewhat less common
teachings. And I also chose them to apply to this year-end time when some of us
are in the midst of family. And maybe others of us might be having a more
reflective or contemplative time. Or maybe some of us are doing both.
That's good. So I hope you'll indulge me in this exploration this week. So today's
list of five might be called five ways of ascertaining truth and then also how we
can preserve that truth while we're talking. So somewhat like what I alluded
to in the meditation, how is it that you know something? How is it that you know
something? And I mean that as a sort of a question to explore. So consider how do
you know your dog's name? Or how to drive a car? Or what to say to your child's
teacher the first time you meet them? Or what about more spiritual truths? How do
you know the deeper movements of the heart or the more universal qualities of
a human life? So without attempting in a whole epistemological catalog, we can
observe. I think that it's that we have many different modes of knowing. We have
facts that are memorized and stored in our brains. We have emotional
understanding. We have cultural norms. We have logical deductions. I used to work
long ago at a lab where I was running complex machines and I would I hadn't
used one for a while. I would go to use it and sometimes I would remember how to
use it because my hand would move toward a certain knob. I had some kind of a body
memory about how to use that machine. And then you know the kinds of knowing where
we can't quite pin down what it is we tend to just call intuition. So we have a
lot of different ways of knowing. Why is this interesting or important? Well, how
we know does matter because some types of knowing are more reliable than others.
Right? So the Buddha in one of the suttas, Madhya Manikaya 95, he talks about how we
know spiritual or religious truth. The reason he's giving this teaching is
that he comments that very often people will make assertions about this kind of
truth that amount to saying only this is true, everything else is wrong. So we
have an idea where we're asserting a certain thing as fact and that
everything else must be wrong. But then he gives a little more nuance to
how it is that we know things. And he points out five common ways of knowing
that are not actually fully reliable. So he lists the five. So he says faith or
yeah, faith or trust in something. The second one is liking something.
Gil translates it as it is pleasing. So we like something, sounds good,
feels right. And then the third one is oral or cultural tradition, something
that our culture has just always known as true. The fourth one is logical reasoning,
something where we've deduced it for ourselves by thinking about it. And the
fifth one is called reflective acceptance of a view. So that means we've heard
from somebody else, we've thought it through and decided that that's correct
assessment. So those are the five. The Buddha says that each one of these, the
way the sutta says is that they can turn out in two different ways. So that
means that we could have faith in something, complete faith in it, but
it's actually false. Or we could not have faith in something, but it is actually
true. And the same for all the others. We could reason something out very
carefully, but we come to the wrong conclusion. Or we could not accept the
logic of something, but it is actually correct. So it's interesting to consider
that, yes, it's true. I can't really say that any one of these five is
absolutely 100% reliable all the time. Now, of course, we use all five of these
throughout the day. And we might notice also that the first two are in the
emotional realm. So having faith in something or finding it pleasing, kind
of in the affective realm. The middle one is in the cultural realm, what
society tells us. And then the last two, the reasoning or the reflective
acceptance are logical, cognitive. So then one might ask also what's left. So
he's eliminated large swaths of our realm of experience as not totally
reliable ways of knowing. So the Buddha doesn't say in this Sutta to just throw
out any of these ways of knowing. He just says to be clearly aware that
they're not definitive. And what is reliable, according to this teaching, is
to know something through direct experience. That's kind of, remember,
he's talking mostly about religious or spiritual truth. So instead of asserting
things, or deducing them, or just having blind faith in them, we should
actually experience things through our practice. So it's pretty interesting
list, right? So then he goes on after this to describe a path for discovering
spiritual truth that actually makes use of several of these unreliable methods
along the way. So that gives at least some assurance that it's okay to be using
them. He suggests that we should have some kind of faith in it in a teacher or in
the teachings in order to be able to walk the path. And he also says that we
should use reflective acceptance of what we've learned. When you hear
teachings like this one that I'm giving, don't just believe what I say.
Please think about it. Does that make sense? Have I seen that in my life?
Yeah. And so he considers that those are actually good and reliable and
helpful ways to approach the path. And so with care, we can use these ways of
knowing skillfully in order to get to the place where we can directly know
things through our own experience, like what I pointed to in the meditation
where we have bodily knowledge is quite direct. So then he focuses then on how
we can know, how we can talk about what it is that we know. And this is now
practical for our holiday time. If we're discussing ideas and facts and views
and opinions with relatives, for example. So the Buddha talks in the Sutta
about preserving or safeguarding the truth by clearly stating how it is that
we know something. So we have to notice then how we know it. And so then when
we make declarative statements, we can say from what basis we're speaking. So
for example, if you've thought something through logically, you can say, I've
reasoned my way through this, and I think such and such. Or because of XYZ, it
follows that such and such. So you're being clear about the fact that this is
coming from logic. Or if you have faith in something, you can say, my faith is
that such and such is true, or I trust that such and such is true. So this
provides some honesty and clarity around the statements that we're putting out
into the world. And so what we don't want to slip into is only this is true,
everything else is wrong. That doesn't usually land very well for other
people. So we have to be careful about making declarative statements. You
might find that this helps in conversations with others in order not to
get into so many disputes. So maybe I'll just give an example of the difference
between these typical ways of knowing and the more reliable experiential one. I
was trying to kind of discern if I had one experience where I could show
several of them. And I thought about one time that I went on a ropes course. I
don't know if you've been on one of those, there are various ropes and
suspended planks and nets and other things meaning sort of gaps between
platforms and they're all about 50 feet up over the ground. So you're
moving on ropes and nets and logs and other things that have been constructed
high up and you wear a harness so that you can't actually fall. But it's
as if you're climbing around on these things and of course they're constructed
so that they swing and sway and they're generally unstable. So I can say that
the intellectual knowledge that I couldn't fall wasn't very useful to me.
I had the harness on and so I suspended securely by a cable. But it
didn't really help. My body's visceral reaction was, wow, I'm 50 feet off the
ground. I'm afraid of moving on these unstable things. But I sort of
picked my way across a number of these gaps, walked along some of the ropes and
so forth. And I used mindfulness to feel okay, fear, not sure about
doing this and that was okay. I gained some measure of confidence because I
actually learned that I could negotiate my way through this and I could be with
the fear and that was fine. But so the emotional realm and the
logical realm were operating but still not completely assuring my
being. But what reduced the fear most effectively was when I actually fell off
and then I was caught by the harness. And so I knew actually I had a direct
experience that I actually wouldn't fall. And after that I became much more
confident walking around on the nets and swaying logs and so forth. And
interestingly, I didn't fall again after that because I somehow had enough
confidence that I could actually do it physically. So it's an interesting
experience. So maybe you've had something similar, you know, where you've
worried about it, thought about it, been mindful of the fear. But what actually
worked was to do it and have the direct understanding. And the Buddha is pointing
toward that in more subtle ways in this Sutta where we, you know, we might
talk logically about what we know about the teachings or we might have an
emotional feeling about them. But in the end, when we have a direct
understanding in our own body and our own being, and it becomes kind of
incorporated into how we are, somebody once said about visiting their
relatives, they don't like it when I'm a Buddhist, but they love it when I'm a
Buddha. So maybe this will help in some way. So then also just to exercise how
we talk about it, I'm teaching you from this Sutta. Why am I making these
statements from coming from this teaching? It's because of a combination of
experiential understanding that I know from my years of practice that these
teachings do point toward what is true. And also out of faith or confidence that
the things that I haven't verified yet for myself are likely also to be true. So
speaking from a combination of experience and faith and also the fact that
I've logically thought through them. So I'm preserving or safeguarding the truth
by telling you about how I'm relating to this Sutta and then passing it on to
you. So I hope that that gives you some sense, this list of five ways of knowing.
I'll repeat them. Faith, finding something pleasing, cultural tradition, logical
reasoning, and reflective acceptance of a view. I hope you might consider how it is
that you use these five to negotiate your life, how it is that you know things,
that you are confident in doing things, and also what things you know directly
from your own experience. And maybe finding ways to talk about those with
other people such that we aren't making declarative statements that aren't
backed up by how it is that we know them. So hopefully that was interesting. And
tomorrow we'll be on to a list of four and so forth down through the week. So
wishing you very well. And see you again tomorrow if you can come in. Thank you.
