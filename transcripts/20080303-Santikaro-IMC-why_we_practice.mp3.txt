The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Hello. Good evening. Okay.
Before I begin the talk, just a small corrective.
I live in Wisconsin now.
So I used to live outside Chicago, but we moved our center to 70 acres of a little valley
in southwest Wisconsin.
It's called the Driftless Region, which has to do with glaciers and geology, not our lifestyle.
Well, maybe it does, I'm not sure.
So Gil and I had a walk in the hills somewhere around here,
and along the way, some ideas for a talk tonight emerged.
At least to start off, I'd like to begin reflecting on why we practice,
or at least start with that.
And as a response to that, I'd like to borrow some thoughts from Ajahn Buddhadasa,
and I'll elaborate on them.
So it's my own understanding, but my understanding of Dhamma was strongly influenced by him,
so I'll borrow and pilfer as I go.
So why do we practice?
It's usually a good idea for us to reflect on this pretty regularly,
and not settle too much for the old answers,
though as I say that, I realize I'm going to give you an old answer in a moment.
But at least to kind of keep those old answers,
or if we respond using the old teachings,
we keep rejuvenating them so that it's alive each day, each time we practice.
At one period, it might have been back in the 70s,
Ajahn Buddhadasa, a theme he liked to run with
in response to the question of why we practice and what Buddhism is about.
He would get at it by asking people the question,
why were we born, or why were you born?
In Thai, you don't actually need the pronoun, so it was why born,
which doesn't sound so good in English, so why were we born?
And I'm going to respond to that,
and hopefully you'll kind of ponder it in your own way as I go,
and see where you get from that.
The classic perspective on this in early Buddhism is
we practice for the end of suffering,
and we were born in Ajahn Buddhadasa's perspective in order to end suffering.
Now, if you know the background of sort of mainstream, normative,
orthodox, Theravada Buddhism, that might sound a little funny
because for some Theravadans in Asia, to some extent here in the U.S.,
the fact that we're born is why we suffer.
And so, what Ajahn Buddhadasa is kind of turning the tables on an orthodoxy
that he thought had become kind of dogmatic and maybe ran out of steam
and always makes sense because it had some inconsistencies,
not just logical inconsistencies but some practical ones.
I'm not going to try to go into all that tonight,
but why were we born? What's our purpose here?
And for him, and perhaps for all of us, it's the same reason that we practice.
We practice to realize the purpose of our lives.
And one way to look at that is we're practicing to realize
that Ajahn Buddhadasa like to call the best thing that human beings can receive.
In Thailand, sometimes Buddhism gets turned into things that don't sound very appealing to people.
So now, often, we have to kind of make it a little more appealing.
One way Ajahn Buddhadasa would do it, that there's something that is the best possible whatever.
I'm not sure. I won't call it an experience.
I might call it a realization, maybe a liberation.
There's something quite wonderful that's possible in human life,
and it's available to all of us, and that's why we're born.
Most often in early Buddhism, this is framed in terms of the end of suffering,
the end of the greed, the anger and hatred, the fear, the loneliness, the boredom, the envy, the egoism.
That keeps us immersed in suffering.
Of course, there's stuff, there's misunderstandings and misguided thinking
and the kind of clinging that rebirths, keeps recreating, greed, anger, fear, loneliness, pride, envy and confusion.
That's at least a kind of answer to why we practice and why we are born.
Now, that's not actually what I want to do the whole talk on. It's more of a lead-in.
I'm assuming that most of you have heard a fair number of dhamma talks, and so you're familiar with these teachings,
how the Buddha said in the past as well as now, I teach suffering and the end of suffering.
That was the frame of what he was about. And if we dig into the Four Noble Truths and the teachings on how suffering happens,
how we get free of suffering, that's the direction of practice.
And somebody who commits themselves to exploring these teachings, that becomes the direction of our lives.
But for many of us, if we start to give serious consideration to the end of suffering, that often raises some questions or problems.
One that seems to happen to most of us is we kind of look at our daily lives.
Sometimes there's a lot of talk, you know, we're laypeople, we have jobs, we have families, we have mortgages, cars, bills, computers, dogs, cats,
hobbies, internet addictions, whatever it is.
And it seems that we could actually realize or achieve, or however you want to think of it, the end of suffering in the short term,
or even in this life, that seems rather remote to a lot of people.
Some people, it's like, oh sure, yeah. I remember people coming on retreats when I used to leave them in Thailand.
We lived near some beaches in the south, so a lot of people who had no experience in Buddhism had never done any meditation before,
would show up for a 10-day retreat, not really know what they were getting into, and kind of figure, oh yeah, 10 days I should be able to get enlightened.
And I would get that question, are you enlightened? You know, when were you enlightened?
I didn't quite know how to answer. I didn't want to sound too stupid, you know, well, never.
I'm kind of hopeless or whatever.
But at some point, most of us, we start sitting, we start practicing, we start looking at our lifestyles,
start facing some of the ethical issues of modern life.
We start watching our minds and, you know, start noticing a lot of the weirdness and craziness.
And unfortunately, a fair amount of self-centeredness that goes on.
And often the possibility of ending suffering seems like, maybe it'll happen, but,
and maybe we'd hope it happens soon, but often it seems like it might take a while,
and maybe a long while.
And it seems a lot of people figure it may not even happen in this life.
Now notice when we do this, we're thinking in terms of time.
Because most of us live in time, and I don't just mean, you know, how busy we are in America,
and we're checking our watches, and we're trying to fit stuff in.
It goes a lot more deeper and subtle than that.
But we tend to perceive ourselves as beings, or persons, or creatures, or agents,
moving through the world doing this, doing that.
We remember, or think we remember, a past.
We imagine a future, and we believe there's a future. We believe there's a past.
And in the middle is now, or this, you know, the, what we like to call the present.
And so it's pretty common that if we think about something like the end of suffering, we think of it in terms of time.
And when we're more hopeful, the time frame might be a quicker one.
Other times we're a little more despairing, and it's a long one.
And then we come across, you know, some versions of Buddhism will say,
oh, you know, a couple hundred thousand lifetimes, it might happen.
And of course, we often think of that in a literal way.
You know, lifetimes, 20, 30, 80, 90 years, if we're human.
Of course, if we're grasshoppers or bacteria, it might be quicker for tortoises, it might be a little longer.
But we tend to frame it in terms of time.
And then, if we happen to be modern people, especially modern Americans,
in a society that's highly individualized and where, to a large extent,
community has receded in importance, at least traditional forms of community.
And to a large extent, we live as individuals.
And our ancestors, our communities have less importance.
That has usually been the case in human history.
And the question I hear fairly often is, well, if the end of suffering,
or liberation, or enlightenment, awakening, however we term it,
might not happen in this lifetime, what's the point?
Because not all of many of us find the belief in future lifetimes not so plausible.
Some people think it's great and really take to it.
Others of us, often if we've grown up secular or influenced by science,
and I'm in this category, it just doesn't make always immediate sense to me
that after this life there will be another one.
I'm open to the possibility, but I have yet to experience any direct evidence.
I've read plenty of the Buddhist books on that.
The Buddhist books, not the Buddhist books.
And, you know, I've read the arguments, I'm not thoroughly convinced.
But I'm not going to follow that train tonight.
But this question, what's the point if, you know, why should I practice hard
and, you know, going these retreats and give up things that I may not want to give up?
And, of course, nobody's really telling anybody you have to give up this and this and this,
but our minds, you know, often frame it that way.
But if I'm not assured of liberation or enlightenment in this life,
and nor am I assured that I'm going to be around for another one,
well, why bother?
One thing about Ajahn Buddhadasa that was unique in Asian Buddhism in Thailand especially,
but most of the Theravada and even Mahayana Buddhist world was,
he didn't base his teachings in the traditional beliefs in rebirth that will be back.
And therefore, that we can sort of put things off till next time,
or if we don't finish this time, you know, you've got more lifetimes to work on it.
He didn't necessarily deny that that could happen,
but he didn't base his understanding of Buddhism in that.
So his take, and this is where I'd like to go now in this talk,
his perspective on why practice is meaningful, whether or not individually
any one person is thoroughly liberated is one I quite like.
Now, of course, one very useful response is,
even if there's not, you know, some complete final enlightenment, awakening thing,
if we practice while suffering diminishes,
and we're happier, more loving, healthy beings in this world.
So for many of us, that's good enough.
But some of us are still nagged by the question,
because, you know, if the goal is awakening or liberation,
then we'd like to get there.
And it's kind of a drag if, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50 years, and we don't make it.
The perspective that Ajahn Buddhadasa had on this, which I quite like, is,
and it's helpful on many layers, levels, is,
well, if we kind of look behind us, not physically so much,
but all of us who are practicing and are benefiting from somebody's teaching,
that person we sometimes is called an ancestor.
And whoever, and many of us, you know, we read books by different teachers,
we hear talks from various teachers,
and they had teachers who had teachers who had teachers.
And we believe that in some ways this goes back to the Buddha.
Some people care a lot about that, some not as much.
So there's this, all these ancestors, and then not only that,
the teachers could only teach because there were students.
You know, the teachers didn't just, you know, pass on these teachings,
so, you know, you could get it.
There were people all along through the years asking questions,
trying to live the dharma in their lives,
meditating, exploring, and working with these teachers.
And then also, because many of the teachers were monastics,
there were people feeding the teachers.
There were people building the temples, or nowadays,
the people who maintain communities like IMC and volunteer and do all the stuff.
So if you begin to imagine, I find this inspiring, I don't know about you,
but if you, we begin to start to picture all the human beings,
or if you like, like the monastery I used to live in,
it wasn't just human beings, we had chickens to eat the caterpillars
that if they got out of control would kill all the trees.
So, you know, the chickens had a role, and we had dogs, and they had their role.
And if you've lived in a subtropical forest,
you appreciate the lizards because they keep the mosquito population from getting out of control.
So, and then there's, you know, the rice fields, where the food comes from.
And so be, where we are right now in this moment of time,
there are all these people and beings behind us that are supporting our practice
in that flow of time and history.
If we look at things in this way, well, that keeps flowing, you know,
and we're sort of, so we're in this flow, and it's no longer us practicing just as individuals.
Of course, practice is very personal, very intimate in ways,
and yet there's Sangha, there's Sangha here, and there's, you know, different networks of Sangha,
and these connecting with Sanghas around the country, around the world,
and they go back in history, and that moves forward.
And so our practice from this perspective isn't just me doing it.
How many of us are supported, inspired, or benefit in some way by having companions?
Even the people that we maybe never or seldom talk to, but we see them,
or we just feel their presence, or even sometimes you're at home meditating alone,
and it helps to think of, you know, some of the faces you see practicing,
and you think of them, you know, when you'd rather go to sleep,
or go have a coffee and read the newspaper, and you imagine some other people sitting,
and that helps you, or when you're dealing with a difficult situation,
and you know this person who you see around here who's pretty calm and steady,
and you see them dealing with situations well,
and that kind of helps you find a more skillful way to deal with a problematic colleague,
or an overly pushy, demanding boss, or whatever it is.
So if we begin to see our practice as not just me practicing for my liberation,
and this was Ajahn Buddhadasa's take, our practice is just to practice,
and to do whatever we can to study, to practice, to serve, to help,
so that we move this whole thing forward, or maybe in some time periods,
keep it from sliding backwards very far.
But let's stay kind of hopeful and positive that rather than thinking what we're here for is,
you know, to get to whatever that goal is.
And of course maybe some of you aren't so crazy about having goals,
but we're American, many of us, you know, goals matter.
And if our minds work that way, if our minds spend a lot of time in time,
which is common, and we have goals, we're trying to get somewhere,
instead of seeing it as me and my liberation, or my end of suffering,
to see ourselves in this larger movement.
And you don't even have to see that in terms of Buddhism, it can be all of humanity,
or all beings, that we just do what we can, we figure out the parts we can figure out,
we let go of the stuff we can let go of, we cultivate what we can cultivate,
and participate in this hopeful, kind of Ajambuddhasasada, kind of evolutionary,
you know, humanity can evolve towards the end of suffering,
or we can devolve, or whatever the word is, towards more suffering.
And that's what we can do.
So to me, that's at times inspiring a different perspective to help me see practice
as not so individual.
And also when, like I do translations, and occasionally I worry I won't get enough stuff translated.
And perspective like this helps me to relax and, you know, do what I can do.
And also when I relax that way, it helps me, I'm still in time,
which is more or less an illusion, but we spend a lot of time there.
But it sort of relaxes it and helps us come back to more the now,
even if we're not fully here and now, we're more here and now.
So I'd like to offer that as a perspective on why we're here,
that we're here for the end of suffering, but it's not necessarily that I'll get there.
Maybe I will, although in a way if I'm here then I'll never get there.
Now there's another piece that kind of comes at these issues from an opposite angle
and I'd like to discuss that a little bit and then wrap things up.
It was very common in Thailand and I think it's common enough here
that if people hear the end of suffering or what I call the E word,
I don't like that word, awakening is my preferred term,
that it's the final, you know, the no more suffering,
just the complete absolute total termination of suffering.
And again that seems a ways off.
And it's possible then to start using that to make excuses.
That's not uncommon in Asia.
Or people can lose hope if, you know, we're following a path or a set of teachings
that seem to have a goal.
I'm not sure it's really supposed to be a goal, but again we often see things that way.
And if the goal seems too difficult, too far off, too hard to attain,
we get frustrated, especially if we're kind of achievement oriented,
if the meaning of our life is about doing and getting and achieving and all that.
So another response to this that I'd like to mention here is something
Ajahn Buddhadasa called little nibhanas.
He's sometimes called these free samples as well, so I'll come at it from that angle first.
And there is a scriptural basis for this, by the way, but I won't go into the details.
His perspective was, you know, how you get little things in the mail,
like he was thinking of toothpaste or something.
And the idea is if you try it out, you'll like it and you'll go buy some more.
Well, he thought nibhanas was kind of like that, that just the way things work,
for example, take fear.
I challenge you to sit here and stay afraid for a full hour, or anger, or loneliness.
You know, maybe you can be pretty angry for an hour,
but I bet you won't have enough concentration to stay angry for every second of the hour.
Now you might get bored with anger and try greed for a while, or envy, or, you know, judgment,
but that's kind of connected with anger or whatever.
But if you notice when we watch our minds how it'll spin around in this way,
then it'll spin around in that way.
But between spinning one way and the other, there's a pause.
And he called them the free samples, that he pointed out if you were really greedy, angry,
frightened, confused, deluded, selfish all the time, you'd go crazy.
Some of you might know, some people like to think of it,
if a friend of mine in Berkeley was talking about this yesterday,
you know, when all that's going on, all these nasty chemicals are getting dumped into the system.
So we're kind of not only mentally, emotionally, but we're also physically poisoning ourselves.
We just can't take it.
So there's kind of a natural mechanism that it'll take a break.
We're not smart enough to take long breaks much of the time,
but there's some natural just kind of escape, release valve, or shutdown mechanism
that we can't sustain our greed, hatred, etc., constantly.
And those little releases or shutdowns,
maybe not the most appealing word for it,
but those letting goes are what he called little nibanas.
By the way, in the early teachings, nibana is not really defined,
but it's usually spoken of either as the end of suffering or the end of greed, hatred, delusion.
Sometimes the word is cessation, I prefer quenching, sometimes it's end.
And again, if we go off into time with this,
we get into that kind of finality thing.
But if we loosen time and the end of greed is just,
if greed is spinning and it ends, that's a nibana.
If fear gets stirred up and it releases, that's a nibana.
It's a coolness, it's a peace, it's a freedom.
Right then, it's not about the future,
which by the way, we never get to the future anyway,
so if nibana is out there, it's hopeless.
It's one of the problems with time, it kind of traps us.
And it keeps us stuck in craving and actually egoism,
because somebody has to be in time and somebody is somebody who suffers.
Ajahn Buddhadasa's one way to look at it is,
you can just kind of forget about the big one
and start paying attention to the little ones.
And the little ones that matter are just the little ones that are right now.
If right now our mind is focused, present,
we're not confused, we're not angry, we're not judging, we're not blaming, we're not worried.
Maybe it's free.
There's a place in this suttas, it's not literally about nibana,
it's about some other words that are often synonyms for nibana,
like viraga, fading away, niroda, quenching, and some others.
Where there are three levels to this.
One is tadanga, which means more or less coincidental or accidental.
So that's kind of what I've talked about.
If like you're starting to get angry at somebody and you get distracted,
maybe the phone rings.
And so you drop the anger because now you're going to pick up the phone.
That's an accidental nibana.
You don't get to claim much wisdom on that one.
But those are helpful.
I do that sometimes with people.
If they're too angry, I just make a loud noise and they, what happens?
And sometimes it helps people just get out of whatever was spinning around.
A second term is vikambana, which more or less means through practice.
It's not a literal meaning, but the basic meaning is as we develop a practice,
both the ethical level, the mind training, and the wisdom piece, or the insight piece,
there are letting go. We learn to let go.
We're meditating or we're walking down the street and the mind starts to go somewhere.
There's enough mindfulness to relax, kind of come back, let go,
and there's a little nibana, in this case, through practice.
And then there's one samu-ceta, which means more or less the final cutting through,
where in the most little nibanas, the momentary reactivity is dropped,
but still the habits of reactivity are still going, and they momentarily subside,
and then they get stimulated or provoked again.
The third level, or samu-ceta, refers to when those patterns have been cut through,
and then there's nothing left to be stimulated.
So that might be the big one.
The Buddha symbolizes that, but I think the Buddha and the arahants also symbolize
the little nibanas from moment to moment.
So I'll stop, leave you with those perspectives,
and hopefully they'll be worth pondering a bit and you'll give them some consideration.
And be careful about time, it confuses things a lot.
