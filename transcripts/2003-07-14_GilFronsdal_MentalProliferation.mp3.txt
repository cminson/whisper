 So, I would like today to talk on a concept which is quite important in the teachings of the Buddha. And the problem with talking about it is that the Pali word, the word that he used in his language, doesn't very easily translate into anything in English. And the word is Papansha. And maybe some of you know of this word. And one of the reasons I wanted to talk about it is that, or it came to my mind, is in a couple of weeks I'm doing a four-day workshop at Tassahara, kind of a retreat, centered around the Buddha's teachings on nonviolence and violence. And it turns out that this word Papansha is very central to his teachings about the causes of violence. He says, one famous passage, he says that the primary causes of violence and conflict in society has to do with people who are assailed by Papansha. So, kind of lost in Papansha, attacked by Papansha. So what is Papansha? My favorite kind of way of translating it is to say it's when the imagination has gone riot, run riot. It's when our thinking has lost any kind of grounding in reality. And we're often our fantasies, we're often our imaginations, and we're kind of lost in abstractions, thinking about what ifs and what ifs and what ifs and what's this. My son asks this question a lot, you know, what if we miss the bus? What if? And then you tell him, what if that, you know, what are we doing tomorrow? What are we doing the next day? But you know, living in the imagination, living in the abstractions, but not just simply in a kind of simple way, we all have to live in abstractions and concepts and in the imagination to some degree. But when it runs riot, when it becomes outrageous, when it loses any touch with reality, we're still trying to live in reality. And we're relating to reality as if, or relating to our Papansha, these proliferated thoughts, as if they are reality. Some people translate the word Papansha as a proliferation. So the proliferation of, so you have this image of these thoughts spawning themselves, one after the other, and you get lost in them. And so it's a source of violence. It's also another passage where the Buddha says that it's the source for tanna, another very important Pali word, tanna, which usually translates into English as desire. It's the second noble truth. But it's probably more accurately translated as, it literally means thirst. And it's more accurately translated, I think, as clinging rather than desire. Because we don't want to problematize all desire. But Buddhism does problematize all clinging. The clinging is a source of suffering. So it says that Papansha is a source of tanna, and tanna is a source of suffering. So not only is Papansha the source of violence in society and conflict, but it's also a source of our suffering, which can be understood as kind of an inner conflict that goes on. It's a source of our clinging, our craving. So it has a very important role. And so it's very interesting to think about how is our suffering, how is our thirst and our clinging, how is our conflict with other people based on Papansha, based on maybe fantasy or maybe imagination run riot, to some way of losing touch with the world around us and what's going on. And we find in modern psychology, words like projection. And I suspect that projection is a form of Papansha. Projection is when we have some kind of idea, imaginary idea, we have some kind of, that we project onto another person, onto a situation. And we see the situation through the filter of those concepts and ideas, these abstractions that we have. We see ourselves through that. One of the teachings of the Buddha is that Papansha is a source of the sense of self. The concept or the idea of identity that we have is a form of Papansha. So it's actually kind of a critique. It's what it's saying is that the concepts and ideas we have about who we are are concepts and ideas that have run a little bit riot, a little bit outrageous, a little bit beyond what's really necessary. If we just keep ourselves grounded in reality as it's lived and experienced. I remember when I was living at Tassajara in the early 80s. And I was a relatively young man and I was needing to think about what I was going to do with my life. And I had been accepted to UC Berkeley graduate program there and I had that option of going back to Berkeley to school. And I also had the option of staying at Tassajara for longer, becoming ordained as a Zen monk. And I spent a year thinking about what my choices were and what I should do. And one of the conclusions after that year was that of Papansha was I was increasingly losing touch with anything that was real. All these imaginations about UC Berkeley, which was a few hundred miles away, and graduate school and all of that. And I decided, for better or worse, that I would somehow step out of Papansha, step out of all the abstractions about my life and what I could do and all that. And just based the decision of where I was going to go in my life by where the next step was, where the next, you know, something much more immediate. What was really true in immediate now and world around me as I saw it and lived it. And I thought, well, maybe I'll lead you back to Berkeley or lead me someplace. I'm allowed to lead me all kinds of places, but let's start as if I'm starting my life over again in a sense today and see what's real, what's direct, immediate, and the decisions that arise out of that. And so all kinds of things arose and developed and here I am sitting in front of you today wondering where it's going to go next. Advertisers I think love Papansha. I think they're in the business of selling Papansha because, and they understand the connection to Papansha and desire because they're not simply selling you what, anything, right? Better tooth, your toothpicks, you know, so you want to sell toothpicks, right? So they could just say, selling toothpicks, you know, one sense of toothpick, you know, on sale or whatever, and you come and buy them. But they show you, you know, someone, you know, some really glamorous person or beautiful, you know, really sexy person with a toothpick. And maybe the way they have it in their mouth was also very suggestive. And so the idea you get is that, you know, it isn't just simply a toothpick you're getting, but you're actually buying into a fantasy. You're buying into a story about what it is to, you know, have a toothpick and have it in your mouth. And so you're going to start living the story. So that's Papansha, that's living in this world of imagination, of abstractions that has no, you know, that's separate from the immediacy and simplicity of what it means to clean your teeth with a toothpick. And we find, you know, so sometimes, you know, you can go really out of hand. And I imagine paranoia when it's a psychological problem is a form of people living excessively in the world of their imagination where they project and see fear or dangers or threats in all kinds of situations. There's an extreme form of Papansha. But I think that the extreme forms of Papansha is something that assails. It's a powerful word that Buddha used. We are sailed by Papansha. And when we are sailed by it, when we are attacked by it, that's a source of violence. So somehow our own ability to get lost and caught and the power, the strength of our thinking and the wanting and desiring and imagining and gets the upper hand to such a degree that it begins, has its own momentum and power that is even hard to let go of it and stop it. And you can see that sometimes when it's so painful to have these thoughts and ideas churning and churning and churning and it won't stop. And it can be so painful, please, you know, just anything to stop it. And so sometimes people will drug themselves or take alcohol or do more healthy things like go for a run or take a nap or quit their job. There's all kinds of things people do, just partly just, you know, please, you know, stop me from all these thoughts that are, you know, running me crazy. That happens occasionally. Maybe some of you have had that experience occasionally in your life. If you sit down to meditate, you probably have that experience more often. Not that meditation causes this to happen, but rather meditation highlights that it's happening because the panchas sometimes has this ability to mask itself, to hide itself, where we're kind of caught up in the loops and turns and preoccupations of our thoughts and we're so focused on those preoccupations, we're not aware of the cost it has to the system, the way that it's actually painful and the way we're being assailed and actually hurts to have these, to be caught and be pulled around by these thoughts. But you do something that makes you quiet and leaves you alone and not distracted from yourself and sometimes you can see this, you know, is going on and part of the function of meditation is meant to be a healthy way to cut through that and bring us back to a grounding, a centering in our life, in the reality as is actually lived by moment by moment to bring a balance. It isn't that our thoughts are being, thoughts themselves are not being criticized or not being, not expected to stop thinking necessarily, but you're supposed to be able to learn slowly to bring an end to the panchay of thoughts, the proliferation of thoughts, the being lost in thoughts, the being caught by the thoughts, the deliberations of thoughts. One who is mature in their practice is said by the Buddha to delight in the word is nipapancha, which means delight in non-proliferation, to delight in a mind that's not cut up in this run of the imagination of abstractions of preoccupations. To actually take delight in it, to find joy in it, because there's something about that mind which is peaceful and quiet, which is very satisfying and delighting in itself. So part of the function of meditation is one of those ways to begin, certainly become very aware of how our mind works, to see it very clearly when the mind has the upper hand, when our thinking mind has the upper hand and we're lost in it, and then to learn how to step outside of it, to get a bigger picture of it, to not be identified with it so strongly, to not believe it as much as we normally would believe it, to realize that there's another alternative to how to live your life that may be more healthy for you and more realistic or more useful for you than the loops and turns that our thinking mind can take when it gets lost in itself and it kind of folds in on itself and folds in on itself on and on and on. Someone once said that the epitome of the human condition is a traffic jam of discursive thought. Maybe Papansha can also mean discursive thought, excessive discursive thinking. So, this happens to me sometimes. I find myself caught in my thoughts and my thoughts won't just let go so easily. They're just kind of churning and moving quite strongly. And it does sometimes feel like I'm being assailed. It feels like someone who's uninvited, some uninvited visitor is there talking nonstop, not leaving you alone, not leaving me alone. So then how do I relate to that? What do I do about that? And there's a variety of strategies of how I might relate to that kind of phenomena. One is not to take it too personally, not to use it as another reason to judge myself or be upset. It's easy enough to add more Papansha to it. For example, this means that I'm a terrible person or a terrible meditator or whatever. And that's just more of this kind of abstractions and thoughts. Then we make conclusions about that. This means I'm a terrible person. Therefore, what I should do is I should go take a class at a local junior college in computer skills. And if I get really good at the computer, then I can learn to do this and that. And then people, you know, I feel more satisfied in my life and I'm more satisfied in my life. Then of course, people will like me a lot more and I'll get more dates. And so the mind kind of wanders off, you know, it's in the world of a punch, a punchline and thinking, you know, it's lost touch with reality. So one way is not to take these things too personally, just to kind of see it as the mind doing its thing. It doesn't have to reflect on who you are, say a thing about you as a person, just the mind. You don't have to take the mind personally. You don't have to assume that the mind defines who you are. The mind does things. And so this is one of the things the mind does. So not taking it personally, just, oh, it helps if you have some level of humor about it. And if you don't take it personally, it's a lot easier to take it humorously, even sometimes when it's kind of painful. Oh, wow, isn't that amazing? You know, it's like finally I've discovered the perpetual motion machine. I don't have to put any energy into the system, right? It just keeps generating its own energy. It feels that way. And another way is to realize very clearly, as clearly as you can, that whatever thoughts you're having are occurring in the present moment and are not about the thing in the future or the past or within your imagining or thinking about. So to kind of see, oh, this is a present moment phenomena. And for me, that sometimes really helps me step outside of its realm, of its kind of grip. Oh. And sometimes I'll even use the mental label to it, something like, here, I'm here right now. Here, right now, here. This is where I am here, here, here. And to remind myself that I'm here. There's a technique in psychotherapeutic circles in some places that if someone has a panic attack or has some very strong reaction of fear or something like that, and they're sitting in the therapist's office or someplace, you know, it's a relatively safe place, the doors are closed, and the therapist will tell the person, okay, just look around. And is there any danger right here, right now? And oh, no, right here, right now, there's no danger. I'm here right now. Because sometimes these panic attacks arise out of a punchline. And so if you get the person to step outside of the proliferation of thoughts and see, you know, this is what's happening here. There's not much happening here. That's not happening right now. What I'm afraid about, all the ideas about what's going to happen, you know, at this presentation, I have to make it work in a week. All the thoughts I have about it, the imaginations about it, and the what-ifs about it. Those are for Pancha. What's happening right now? So it's a very simple thing now. Oh, and what's happening now? The mind is proliferating. That's what's happening now. And that's one way sometimes of stepping outside of the grip of those kinds of thoughts. And another thing which maybe is not so easy to do, it can be easy if you get a hang of it or have some sense of it. And I don't know how to convey it to you, the sense. It's too well. But it's to make the awareness larger than the Pancha, larger than the thinking mind. The analogy I sometimes use for the intro class is if you're in a crowded, if you're in a small elevator, a small elevator, and there's four people in the elevator, and you're one of them, and they're like 6'6", you know, and it's really big in other directions also. And maybe there's slobs, they have ketchup all over their shirts, and you sit down. And you can kind of imagine the worst-case scenario of these people. And you feel a little bit claustrophobic, and your thoughts about them maybe are beginning to border up a Pancha also. But then the same, you know, four people are in a giant cathedral, some big, big, open, vaulted space. And you're spread out, you know, quite distanced from each other. And you see them way over there. And then you can, you know, love humanity quite easily. At a distance, right? And when the spaciousness of the mind, we're not caught so much, and it's easier to kind of be more at ease in it. So the mind sometimes is claustrophobic. And part of the difficulty of Pancha is that it makes the mind more and more claustrophobic, more and more ingrown and tight in itself, it folds in on itself, tighter and tighter and tighter, until you get a headache. But sometimes it's possible to step out of that and use awareness to create space in the mind, to create room in the mind, to make the mind like a big cathedral or big vaulted space, make it spacious. Maybe it's a little bit of an act of imagination or an act of kind of way of kind of looking a certain way. But there's a way of kind of sensing a wider sense of presence, a wider sense of what the mind is or what awareness is than simply those thoughts. One way that people have approached that kind of sense or experience is by sometimes listening to sounds. And you might take five minutes or ten minutes to listen to sounds around you, especially sounds that are kind of distant from you. And as a dual, the mind kind of gets stretched and pulled and more kind of feeling and sense of the mind or the domain of the mind or the range of the mind is much larger than just the skull here. And the mind kind of goes out into space to feel kind of the spaciousness from where the sounds are coming from. And then from that kind of sense of spaciousness that sometimes comes from listening to sounds, then when you pay attention to this thinking mind again, there's all a spacer on the thinking mind and you're not so caught by it. If you have the sense of spaciousness around your thoughts, then the, you know, fueling it by the clinging, by the, by the, by the velcroing that happens and we're really caught by our thoughts. But probably one of the most useful little things to do when you have Papanshaying, one of the things that can be very useful is it kind of has to do with some evaluation, evaluating what's going on and convincing yourself in a realistic way, hopefully, convincing you really seeing clearly that it's not to your own self-interest to be caught up in these kinds of churning of the minds. There's not a useful place to be. And sometimes when you can very clearly make that evaluation, then it can become a lot easier to let the mind be pulled away from it. But part of the power of the Papansha is that some place in our psyche, maybe some somewhat unconscious place, we think that what we're thinking about is super important. It's crucial. It's the most important thing. Like, you're not going to exist or be alive or to survive or whatever, unless you engage in this. So to do that evaluation and really see, is this really true? Is it really true? How necessary is this? How true is the evaluation? How grounded is it in reality? Future thinking is a great place for Papansha. And one of the little sources of wisdom that I've received painfully acquired is from all the times in my life where I imagined how something was going to be. Tomorrow in a week. Tomorrow comes, a week comes, and it's nothing like how I imagined it to be. And the reason it was painful was that how I suffered because of how I imagined it was going to be. And then after the fact, gee, that was a wasted suffering. I didn't have to suffer about that because it didn't even happen. The whole thing was canceled that day. Or things always turn out a little bit different than imagination to some degree. And so over and over and over again, I saw this wasted suffering. I saw this suffered and suffered and suffered. Realize after a while, I don't know what's going to happen in the future. And I can imagine, to some degree, we have to imagine a little bit so we can prepare a little bit. But to be caught in the imagination and suffer because of it is not necessary. So a person who is mature in the Buddha's practice, as he taught it, is someone who takes the light in nipapancha. Someone who is immature is caught in papancha. And to stretch a little bit an image that's used in the suttas, someone who is not mature in practice is someone who paints reality, who paints the world with their concepts and their imaginations. Someone who has, who delights in nipapancha, has the ability not to live in this lost and abstraction world, is someone who doesn't paint reality with their projections and ideas of what's out there. And you can see more clearly what's there. And that's a whole training in itself, a training to learn how to drop out of this, to separate ourselves from it, to stop it, a training to ground ourselves in reality more and more, to choose reality over the abstractions, what's happening right now, to find value in doing that, that's useful to do that, that's where we find our life in a sense. And then I'll end my part of the talk and then give you a chance to say what you'd like to say or ask questions by telling you a little piece of papancha of mine that arose on one particular meditation session so many years ago. I should be embarrassed to say this, but maybe I am, but anyway. And that is, now that you've heard about how powerful papancha is and how papancha is such an important source of suffering in the world and such an important source of conflict and strife and violence in the world and how people coat the world with our papanchaing. So the little thing that came up was, and I can't sing very well so you'll of course forgive me, but it's kind of borrowing from England, the English song, papancha, papancha, papancha rules the world. And so it does. So what are your thoughts? What's your, been your papancha tonight? Your questions? Yes? Would you make a distinction between papancha and delusion? Maybe not. I guess there's degrees of papancha, degrees of separation from reality. I think what happens, the Buddha laid out a kind of description of the arising of a papancha from raw sense experience. There's raw sense experience. Actually he said, first there's contact basically with some experience in the world. And he had the first thing that happens after contact is that we become aware of whether that contact was either pleasant contact, unpleasant contact or neither. And that's any kind of sense experience at all. Sight, ears, hearing, smelling, tasting. So there's contact with the senses. And the next thing that happens is that we're aware, somehow we're aware of the pleasantness or unpleasantness of that experience. What follows next is the perception of what that experience is, which is a concept. So, you know, I don't know why this is coming to my mind, but you shake someone's hand, you have the contact and maybe you feel the pleasantness of that. And the next thing you do, you're aware of, oh, this is a handshake. I'm touching someone's hand. Very simple, very simple concept. From that concept then becomes reasoning, becomes a kind of little bit then beginning of abstraction, beginning of putting broader concepts around what that means. Oh, this means that this person is being friendly to me. We used to have a huge argument and this person is now shaking hands, meaning it's all forgotten or whatever, we'll be friends now. So there's meaning that's assigned to this. And it might be wrong meaning, but it's probably, you could probably have a good sense of when that is an accurate interpretation. And then, so then based on that reasoning, and that is the foundation, then there's a possibility of the continuation of that into Papansha. You cross a line into, oh, the person's now my friend. I bet that person would like to marry me. You know, and we can live a happy life after, you know, and oh, yeah. And then, oh, you know, I think that if we got married, I'm sure this person wants to marry me, then I think that, you know, we'll be happy ever more. You know, there's a fairy trails are true, they live happily ever after. So when it's a lot, when you have a punch of slides, it goes from, you know, I don't know, just being caught in preoccupations that have some basis in reality to when they become delusion. It's probably a, you know, a graded thing. That's my guess. Yeah. I've been full of obsessive thoughts. I think it's from Pranjana, but I got myself into some trouble. I just got back from Guatemala, and I was robbed. And there was a lot of things I thought about afterwards. I could have done differently, I should have done differently. I shouldn't have gone there, I should have been more careful, and so on. But since then, I've been really obsessing, just coming back, why didn't I do this, what could I have done then, next time, you know, what should I have done to the guy, and this and that, you know, all these things. I think it's from Pranjana, but I think my mind is also sort of trying to make sure it doesn't happen again, warning me, you know, trying to build it up so the next time I'm more careful somehow, whatever. But it's basically a lot of it's wasted effort. I mean, if I let it go, it goes way, way off into this huge fantasy, which never happened and never will happen. I think it's from Pranjana in some way. I think it's my mind just trying to say, listen, you were asleep before that happened, you should be trying to wake me up next time. It's possible. But then, the fact is possible. But what I imagine is that the fact that you're still obsessing, so being caught by that, you haven't gotten a lesson. If you mind, you might be trying to tell you something. And so maybe what you need to do is to stop and actually deliberate in a very clear and conscious way, reflect deeply, spend some time in deep reflection, and think about, you know, what is it I need to learn from this? What was really going on here? What were the emotions that happened then? What are the emotions that linger? Is there fear? Is there concern? And to really learn from that lesson in a powerful way, if you don't stop and do that deliberation, which maybe what's being called from, then the inner issues which are not being dealt with, then become fuel for Papansha. They keep calling for attention and they can get lost in them. I'm going to get, you know... Yes? One thing you said reminded me of the experience I had at certain times in the last few weeks. I've been involved in some of the obvious and the business transactions, much more intensely in a long time. And in my morning aerobic walks, I tend to, I'll use the word dandy, to obsess, to just drive in thoughts, which I think are very much what you're talking about. And I remembered something from a creative thinking class that I took years and years ago about the innovation theory, when you're trying to solve a problem. And that's what my obsessing was usually about, trying to take into consideration all the contingencies of these business transactions. And I remembered that if I simply can drop out of that obsessing with some means, and I used my breath, something creative might come out of that. And I simply tried it more and more often, as every time I did it, I found a creative thought or two coming out of my mind. And I could see if I'm given over 5, 10, 15 minutes sometimes, to pretty much set inside that obsessing and really staying with my breath. I don't do it perfectly for 15 minutes, but much more so. And it really was a terrific learning. And something you said in that quiet mind, there's going to be something coming out, but circulating obsessing doesn't usually move forward at all. Yes, exactly. That's beautiful. And I don't know if... So I think it's beautiful what you said, I completely agree. But it reminded me of something, my experience, and that is, sometimes I felt that some of the most important decisions I've made in my life happened that way, that somehow when I wasn't engaged in it, something happened. But I felt that it was necessary to have spent psychic time thinking deeply and exploring and working on it. And because of doing the homework, in a sense, of really being engaged in some kind of deliberation, deliberate kind of way for a while, that set the seed for some deeper rumblings, the deeper movement to happen once I made space for it. And so, is it papancia or is it careful deliberation? And sometimes it's not so... the line is not so clear. But sometimes I had the sense that it's very useful for me to kind of go and ruminate and let things come up in bubble and be with things, and not to let go of them too quickly. That was very much part of this creative thinking. The image that I remember was, if you're working on something that you can't solve, really think about it very intensely and then take a walk. And then maybe even go to sleep in the morning and re-reify a knock. You had something worth it. Beautiful. Yeah, beautiful. Yes. Meg. I just lost a dear friend yesterday and he really sad circumstances and of course my wife has been going to that of a... I was wondering, is it possible to leave without papancia? That's a good point. Maybe we have to kind of take into account the wider context, the wider ecology of what's going on. When I said you don't take papancia personally, just as something of the mind does, then to understand that part of the ecology may be grieving, it might be letting these things run riot for a while. But with grieving, if we're lost in those thoughts, if we're lost in that, what ifs and all kinds of possible scenarios, I don't know if it's even helpful for you, but to let those thoughts move through you as they do, but be mindful while it's happening, then maybe it's a necessary part of that process for you. I know for myself sometimes, again, I find sometimes I do, my mind does move very powerfully through certain kinds of thoughts and patterns and seems to have sometimes a life of its own. And it seems a respectful thing to let it have a life of its own. But I try to stay present while it's happening. And I know where it's like to get lost in it. And I've come to the conclusion that it's not useful for me to be lost in those concerns. But I don't necessarily have to stop them. This teaching about papancia is not necessarily a teaching you're supposed to stop. The mind's thinking and deliberations and concerns. I'd rather try to be awake to it. Yes? With the analogy of what you just said, I mean, to me one of the most startling things in meditation is when you're meditating on thought, and you're there experiencing the arising of thought. And in the middle of that, your mind goes off into the tangent that you're not connected to at all. The difference in that experience is just so startling. And if you look at it one way, they're just false. But the disconnection from the arising in the process and the direct contact with it is very, very different than just that automatic thing. So is that in a way an analogy here that this thought process that the mind goes through seems to have its own direction, flow without you being connected to it, or you're lost, there's no mindfulness there? Yeah, I didn't follow the last part of your question, but what I understood, if I may go with it, is that there's such a radical difference between when there's presence and mindfulness and what's going on with thoughts, versus when the thoughts are taking over and there's no presence and mindfulness, but it's almost like there's two minds, two bodies, two selves. And one hopefully is somewhat satisfying to be in, maybe not always pleasant, but when you're present. And one, when you're disconnected, it's like living in virtual reality. And when you come back, I find myself, that difference very interesting, and how unsatisfying it is to realize that, where was I? I was not really here. And I'm content enough to use some of the more dramatic language that the Buddha used, where he said that, basically he said, people who are lost in Papansha are already as if dead. Because it's such a radical different way of being. Yes? You started the talk by saying, you guys put in some extroversion for Papansha and Moalu. May I look at my own personal practice? I don't want to make else that's very disconcerting, and seems to be much more close to violence. And it's thoughts, but it's not discursive thoughts, but they're very negative, short negative judgments. And they rarely happen when I'm in meditation, but they happen in response to stimulus, social stimulus, usually. And it's very stark, and it's becoming very clear, the kind of judgments that arise, and I cannot believe that it's coming from me. And I'm usually able to be present to at least put a stop to it. And sometimes the judgment happens, arises from it against me. Now I want to see that often, but it seems this is where there's a real pull towards negative action. There's a real pull towards it. But it could easily slip into, and I probably give cues, bodily cues to people, and it doesn't have people in hammers or in their head. But just not that open, spacious, kind, present that I would like it to be, you know, clinging and judging all the time. So what does the minute just say about it, and all of this when it's getting to me? Well, probably a lot of things could be said, or in a whole range of ways to approach, which is a very important issue you raised. The simple thing is, you know, just as your mindfulness becomes stronger, I think you'll see how this operates more clearly. And so you find more freedom from it, or with it, or in the midst of it, by having stronger mindfulness. But the other thing that occurs to me to say is that prior to the judgment, what's there already? So something happens in the world, and it hits something inside of you. What is it that's hitting so that there's judgment that arises? I think it's just a conditioned habit. You think so? Yeah, and so, you know, sense of self and sense of like mind and... Oh, that's... This is how it should be and, you know... Yeah, so... A lot of tightness. There you go, yeah. I'd say a lot of tightness, but it... It hits before the judgment starts. So to bring your attention, spend some time attending to that tightness. And include it in your consciousness, be aware of the tightness that's there before. Kind of... And I think that as you attend to it and resolve it and work with it, and also include it in your awareness, then it's easier to take responsibility, easier to be responsive, so that maybe the judgments won't be as powerful or strong or you'll be caught by them so much. So I'd encourage you to step behind the judgments to what's prior and explore that. Last one, yes. Do you think that it's always a lesson that you're supposed to be learning, like what you said to him, or sometimes is it just nonsense? Oh, sometimes just nonsense. So it's not always like... Well, I should answer maybe too quickly. I have a suspicion that everything that arises, if you brought careful mindfulness to it, could be traced back where you can find your freedom. There's a way of bringing attention to everything. So you don't want to dismiss anything as being kind of... I like to think of mindfulness as being a form of respect. If you bring mindfulness to something, you're bringing respect to everything. Respect is beautiful because it means to respect, to look again. So you're looking more carefully with some respect. So to say it's nonsense, it could be nonsense, but it also might be more dismissive of something. The words might be nonsense, but what's generating the nonsense? You may be a person's board, or maybe there's some other feeling underneath it that's generating it. So there's an art to learning how to turn into things, in a sense, pay attention to things. And so I suspect that everything deserves our respect and we'll find, by bringing mindfulness to everything, some deeper aspect of self, some deeper freedom. So it could be nonsense, but I wouldn't dismiss it. By saying it's nonsense, saying, oh, but that's just baloney. There's probably something there too. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's something there for us to learn. That seems a little bit too much of a burden to put in everything, some great life lesson. But I believe that everything, I suspect that everything that arises is a gate to freedom. Sometimes you can keep it going by trying to understand it. Yeah, oh yeah. That was great. Thank you all. And I'll see you next week.
