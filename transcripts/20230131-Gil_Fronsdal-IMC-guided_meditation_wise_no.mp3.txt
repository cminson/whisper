 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hello everyone. Hello everyone. Hello everyone. And aware that in one way many of you are spread out throughout the globe participating. In another way, you are here in IMC at Redwood City, California, here in our meditation hall. And I'm happy to have you along and to share this practice and this teaching and this community together with all of us. So, one of the things that classically, the classic Buddhism, and I think we do plenty enough in the modern world, is we associate, we sometimes treat the mind as almost like another person. Sometimes we certainly identify with our mind as being, this is who I am. But sometimes we kind of relate to the mind as if it's another person almost. It's not us any more than maybe, I don't know if this is a good analogy, but after you cut off your fingernail clippings, those clippings are not quite you anymore. So there's kind of a freedom, kind of an independence from the mind, with which we can look upon the mind. We can see it. We can relate to it. We can be wiser than certainly parts of the mind that get us into trouble. And so in that regard, sometimes it might be helpful to think of the mind as a child. And sometimes children, in order to feel safe, need to have clear boundaries set. No. Usually with some kind of hopefully compassionate but very clear statement of no. So certainly one of our sons, he was I think much more aware and understanding of the world than we ever imagined when he was young, before he was verbal or when he was just a toddler. And he was somewhat afraid quite a bit. I think because he was so smart, he kind of understood much more of what was going on or much more of maybe the dangers or something. But sometimes he would push against the limits of what was appropriate behavior. And it was necessary to say no. And now you have to stop or that we don't do that here or something. And sometimes it had to be said very clearly, definitively. And sometimes when we, it wasn't exactly my character to do that. So I had to kind of learn to be able to say that. And the remarkable thing that I saw was that for a moment he would look very frustrated and angry. But just a moment. Immediately afterwards he became much more settled and happy. It's like now he knew how far he could go. He could know what he was supposed to do. It was understandable now, something about the world he didn't understand. And maybe he was pushing the limits of things to see to understand better how does this world work. And then this no would tell him and then he would just relax. So in the same way, our mind is that way sometimes. Sometimes practicing acceptance of it or being compassionate to it. And in ways that just allow it to continue the way it's doing. Sometimes that's exactly the right thing to do. And sometimes it's not the right thing. And sometimes what's appropriate is to say no. Not that. Stop. We're not going there. We're not doing that. We've had those thoughts, those feelings, those fantasies. Thousands of times. And thinking about it, ruminating about it, doesn't help. It doesn't lead anywhere. Maybe it's kind of a waste of time to do it now and thousands in one time. Or this train of thought, this train of ideas and desires or versions, doesn't help anyone. It's not supportive. Maybe even makes things worse. And so the mind needs to hear a very clear line. No, we don't do that. And how we tell the mind this, how we establish a strong no in practice that's not harsh, not punitive, not judgmental, not aversive, no hostility involved, just a clarity. A clarity and a definitiveness. No, we don't stand behind this. This is not what we do. Sometimes it's phenomenally helpful in meditation, especially if what you're thinking about is nonsense or is just simply not just an old habit to continue ruminating about something. So the wise use of no and the wise use of saying no and then averting the gaze, attention from what is not wise to what is wise. And for the purpose of meditation here is to focus on breathing with the present moment. So maybe for this meditation, if you'd like, you can experiment as I guide you with finding a way to appropriately, in a healthy way, to say no to things which are not appropriate, not healthy. So assuming your meditation posture. And if it's comfortable closing your eyes and begin with saying yes, yes to being here in this body at this time. Maybe taking a few long, slow, deep breaths and the exhale can be a long yes. Here I am. This is the place. A clear reminder here now. Letting your breathing return to normal and scanning through your body to see where you can relax. The face, the shoulders, the belly. And you might gently, softly say yes to each little movement of relaxation. A yes where you are allowed to appreciate and enjoy the benefit of relaxing. So letting your breathing return to normal and scanning through your body to see where you can relax. And then also maybe relaxing a thinking mind. Stepping away from thinking and ruminating. First with a gentle yes to relaxing, softening, quieting the thinking mind. Maybe with each exhale. And then settling down on your breathing. Gently, ever so softly. Maybe a gentle yes or a gentle, almost like a silent acknowledgement. Say yes to the inhale, yes to the exhale. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. And if you find yourself wondering often thought frequently, experiment with saying no. Or enough. Stop. Or if it feels nicer to do so, you could say more politely, this is not helpful. Let's stop. Enough now. We have something else to do. Something very brief. And you might try experimenting as you say the no to the thinking mind. To do so at the top of the inhale, before you exhale, it might take me in holding your breath slightly. So the shorter the statement is, the better. And after you've made your statement of no, then relax. Let go with the exhale. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Saying no to thinking at the top of the inhale. And maybe enjoying a quiet surfing on the exhale. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Gently, ever so softly. Anything at this moment that it would be useful, even compassionate, to say no to. No to your involvement with. No to your involvement with. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to turn your attention outward to this suffering world, to the people that you care for, to the world you care for. And consider your love, your care, your kindness, your capacity to serve this world better. Is there anything that you have within you that you could compassionately say no to that reduces obstacles to your love, to your care, to your kindness for this world? And in saying no to it, it makes more room for goodwill, for well-wishing, for kindness, for friendliness. And may it be that this meditation we do supports us to be a friend of others, friend of the world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may each of us contribute to this possibility as friends of the world. Thank you.
