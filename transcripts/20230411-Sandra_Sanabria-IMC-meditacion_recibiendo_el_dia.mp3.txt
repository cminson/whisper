Thank you very much.
When we sit in meditation, we always want to leave all the worries,
everything that has happened in the bottom of our mind and bring this full awareness to the front.
And sometimes it's complicated.
I think we have realized that the actions, the experiences of the day leave a mark.
And maybe little by little these marks disappear.
So today I'm going to invite you to take a tour of the day, of today.
Not with the intention of going to fix what didn't work for us,
but bringing an attitude of interest, of curiosity.
It's like it was my day.
Bringing without judging or criticizing, without feeling bad about what I know.
The days are always full of ups and downs.
Without wanting to cling to what you liked so much during the day,
but more so with calm, with curiosity,
like going out for a walk and observing the flowers.
Oh, look, look how beautiful.
Oh, it's getting a little cold.
And closing the eyes or lowering the gaze.
Starting from the head to the feet.
Inviting presence.
Inviting our heart to soften into our mind, to open up.
And I invite you to remember maybe tomorrow.
If you can remember that moment as soon as you woke up and before leaving the bed.
Maybe feeling the warmth, the comfort of being in the bed.
Or maybe the discomfort in the body, hunger, the need to go to the bathroom to get you out of bed.
And what was the attitude you had when you were running with a fan?
Or maybe with calm?
Or there was anticipation? Or concern?
How did the body feel the mind of the heart?
Or maybe looking if there was something pleasant or unpleasant?
Or neither of the two, the tone of the feeling?
I invite you to reflect on how you know it was pleasant or unpleasant.
What happens in the body, in the mind?
What makes you feel that pleasant or unpleasant experience?
As the day goes by, there are sensations or emotions that you remember.
The encounters with other people.
And recognizing the tone of the experience.
And again, recognizing how I know it was pleasant or unpleasant or neither of the two.
Maybe that which informs you is what you are feeling at this moment.
Maybe being related to your ideas or your beliefs, customs, habits.
And maybe an experience that neither is pleasant or unpleasant.
We turn it into something once we begin to analyze, to bring ideas, to create connections.
I invite you to consider if it is possible to look at this.
Some of the experiences of the day, from another point of view, take another perspective.
Thank you.
Arriving at this moment.
Allow me to recognize how the experiences of the day impact how you feel at this moment.
What you are thinking.
The stories you are telling.
Those rehearsals that we do in our mind.
Sorry or keep a story.
Maybe with a little more clarity.
We invite you to be here now.
At this moment we cannot change what happened.
Maybe we can make the list of predictions of what is going to happen tomorrow.
Tonight.
And allowing us to release or loosen the past and the future.
And be here.
With what is happening at this moment.
Maybe it is possible to appreciate this moment without so many filters.
Without expectations.
I invite you to start listening to the sounds around you.
I invite you to start listening to the sounds around you.
Receiving the sounds.
The sounds close.
Silence.
Silence.
Silence.
Feel your body.
Feel your presence and the space you are in.
Silence.
Silence.
Silence.
Letting the attention move to the sensations, the breathing.
The air that enters and comes out through the bones does not come out.
The throat, the chest, the diaphragm, the abdomen.
Silence.
Letting the attention move to the sensations, the breathing.
Silence.
That intimacy with the breathing.
Maybe in this unexpected way, open space in our interior.
Silence.
Letting the attention move to the sensations, the breathing.
Silence.

Letting the attention move to the sensations, the breathing.
