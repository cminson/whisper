The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Back, looks like most of you are back here. It's always nice to see people coming back
from breaks. So, by this time, you've heard several different flavors of equanimity that
we've been introducing in this class related to upeca, right? And so the wisdom factor,
awakening factor, equanimity shows up in there, which we shared in the first class.
And then the second class, we shared this heart quality equanimity. And today you've heard
there's a third quality that's related to Samadhi collectedness. So we thought maybe
it is worthwhile to maybe tie this together in this part of teaching and sharing.
Maybe using this capstone idea. And so I'm going to share a screen to show this picture
again, just as a way to review this. So you're able to see this picture, hopefully.
And so you can see the capstone as this rock sitting at the top. Maybe just kind of use
very soft gaze to look at this a little bit. See, what's some of the felt sense of this
capstone sitting where it's at in this structure? You get some felt sense of it. And for me,
a couple of things jump out. The first one is that of a balance. I think we've heard
this from some of the reports you shared. And in the last few days of teaching, we've
also talked about equanimity can be thought of as a balancing agent in our practice.
And balance is out of too much pressure or striving versus lack of effort. Balancing out
in the realm of Brahma viharas, providing a source and ground from which the other Brahma
viharas can come from. And similarly in the realm of Samadhi. And so that's one flavor.
The other thing that jumped out in this picture for me as a capstone is the overarching impact
of this capstone and the whole structure. Do you notice this? If you take this capstone
out, the whole structure might collapse. And so equanimity is in all these different
flavors, maybe in subtle ways or strong ways. And when it's mature, it may look kind of
almost fragile, sitting on top and barely balancing there. Yet it has such a potent and
important dimension in this whole structure. And that is true in terms of equanimity in
our practice as well. So now, I'm going to bring up this image in which David shared
a couple of days ago. And so there's three flavors we've been talking about. And they're
the seven factors of awakening. Brahma viharas and Samadhi are also kind of known as the
three lists showing up repeatedly in the Pali Canon. They are in the picture, they are
ordered and they're often spoken about, are talked about in the Canon in this order,
Pali Canon in this order. But I would say, you know, we can look at this in different
ways. So let's review these three flavors a little bit. And I'll just remind you where
they show up and then some of the similes that we've been reading from the suttas.
The first one is equanimity being an awakening factor or a wisdom factor. And the words in
the sutta in the text and that used to describe this form of equanimity from MN140, it's a
purified and bright, malleable, willy and radiant. And that's the quality of this flavor
of equanimity. And then last time when we spoke about this, we didn't read the simile related
to this, which is a Goldsmith simile. And so we'll read this simile today. And it is in
the shared document as well in case you wanted to read that yourself. Otherwise, you can
just listen to it almost like a meditatively. How does it feel like? What is this quality
like? Suppose skilled Goldsmith or his or her apprentice were to prepare a furnace, heat
up the crucible, take some gold with the tongs and put it into the crucible from time to
time. The practitioner would blow on it from time to time. The practitioner would sprinkle
water over it. And from time to time the practitioner would just look on. That gold would become
refined, well refined, completely refined, faultless, rid of dross, malleable, willy
and radiant. Then whatever kind of ornament he or she wished to make from it, whether
a golden chain or earrings or a necklace or a golden garland, it would serve his or her
purpose. So too, then there remains only equanimity, purified and bright, malleable, willy and
radiant. So the sense that evokes in me when I read this is a very awake, alive, responsive
form of equanimity and that is ripe for leading to clear seeing and for the inside and wisdom
to come from it. And so that's the quality of being an awakening factor. And then as
a hard quality in Brahma Viharas and the Upaka equanimity evokes a sense of wide open
heart. I think Kim mentioned this last time in the teaching as well. And Diana also mentioned
this. And the other dimension of this is for this wide open, boundless forms of Upaka,
it does not exclude anything. I think some of you report this. The experience can just
come in and out from this experience. There's no exclusion from this. And the Sutta in
Manikaya number seven, I think David guided us to read and has this kind of statement to
review this. When abides pervading the all encompassing world with a mind imbued with
equanimity, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will. What
a potent of state being. And last time when Diana talked about the relationships of the
four Brahma Viharas, you can see if love, compassion and joy comes from a source of
equanimity. You can really trust it. And so that's the sense as a hard quality and how
it gets expressed. And then today, David shared some teaching around how Upaka show up in
the state of Samadhi, being collected, deep and profound sense of a well being and
contentment and peace. So since we just shared the Sutta, we won't go there again. But I
just want to say a few words. Maybe I'll stop sharing now. Say a few words about this
different flavors. And the first thing to say is that even though this are often times
depicted as lists, lists of the seven factors, lists of the four Brahma Viharas, the four
Jhanas, sometimes I think of them as beautiful mandalas of the heart and mind and the body.
And the mandalas in the sense of immense beauty in all of this. And each of these different
flavors could be cultivated explicitly by dedicating practices in their own domain.
And they also blend into each other. They support each other. As you probably have already
found that in the bubbles, a concentration show up not only in Samadhi but also in the
seven factors of awakening. And the Brahma Vihara is often considered as Samadhi practice
as well. And similarly, a joy shows up in all those different lists. And so we don't have
to kind of rigidly separate this. They are really wholesome qualities that kind of intermingle
with each other. And sometimes through our skillful or wise discernment, we may discern
certain qualities that are present more prominent than otherwise. But however they might show
up for the in you, allow them to kind of really nourish you and deepen inside of you.
And the other thing I would say is also maybe with the notion of a mandala, even though the
lists are in certain orders, but we know that our practice is not linear or even orderly
or neat. So we don't have to be very uptight by the order. It's one particular form and
sequence and a map that can be helpful from time to time when we look into that. But just
know our practice, where are we are? That's where we began. And it can be in a different
dimensions of the factors or the dwellings. It could be that nowhere starting from the
beginning. And so skillfully finding our practice in all of these different territories will
be really, really supportive of our practice. And the last couple of words I'll say is
that even though equanimity in our picture is seen as a capstone in the picture, kind
of somehow sitting at the top, but there is really no limit to the beautiful qualities
of a heart and mind in all of this different mandalas. There is no boundaries to the quality
of love. No boundaries limits to the qualities of joy. And the reason I say that is a way
of finding our practice, not just for our own well-being, but also for the well-beings
of all beings, for the world. And so these qualities that we're cultivating as we began
to hold them with a boundless heart, we can allow this to really mature and grow in just
boundless ways, limitless ways. And that allows us to hold the 10,000 sorrows and joys all
around us and within us. Yeah, so I just end to say that may the practice of equanimity
really be a benefit for all beings. Okay, so.
