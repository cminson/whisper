 Tonight our speaker is Bridgette Jelaine. She's been practicing meditation since 1986, first with four years of Zen practice and then following with Vipassana. She's been a student of Gil's since he began teaching in 1990. She coordinates the San Jose Sangha and teaches there regularly. She's a graduate of the community Dharma Leaders program at Spirit Rock and the Sati Center chaplaincy training. She teaches meditation weekly at the Elmwood Women's Correctional Facility in Nalpitas and as a psychotherapist and private practice for many years she incorporates mindfulness and the understandings of Buddhist practice in her work with clients. Thank you Jim. And one more little announcement I have, beginning on Wednesday in San Jose I'll be teaching a class called Basic Buddhist Practice. It's six weeks and it's just the basic principles of Buddhist practice. So if you know anybody down that way that might be interested you can let them know. I invite any of you that might like to to come in closer for a small group tonight and feels like you're way out here. Well welcome everybody. On this July 4th I wasn't sure whether we'd have two or three or so it's a very nice very nice group. And as this is July 4th this is Independence Day in our country. So what I'd like to talk about is interdependence. Many years ago in 1991 actually after a Thich Nhat Hanh retreat several people planned an event at Spirit Rock on July 4th and I wasn't part of the planning but I did go it was a wonderful afternoon and I've always wished that somebody would plan another one since then. It was a wonderful way to spend the day and on that day we were given I'm not sure who created it but this declaration of interdependence. So when Inez asked me if I would talk today I knew immediately what I was going to talk about and later I'll pass these out and then we can read it. Interdependence, interconnectedness, interrelatedness, interbeing or inter-are is what Thich Nhat Hanh calls it. And I think it's such a beautiful description of our relatedness of how we are all interrelated. How we're not isolated, we're not islands unto ourselves. We actually are part of this whole web of life. Martin Luther King said, in a real sense all life is interrelated. All persons are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be and you can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of reality. I really like that. I think that says it so beautifully. We don't stand alone. None of us is self-made or self-sufficient. We like to think so I think in this country. We like to think that we're self-made or that we're self-sufficient. But the reality is even those that are extremely successful or at the top have had lots of support, lots of help, breaks, whatever along the way and are in fact dependent on those under them to support them. I think we see this very clearly whenever there's a disaster. We're very good at responding to a disaster and it seems like we really recognize, we're really aware of our interdependence at that time. Of course the two major ones that I can think of are the earthquake in 89 and I remember clearly neighbors that I never talked to, never see. We all gathered together in one person's living room. There was such a need to be together and then of course we offered each other batteries or food or whatever and it was a wonderful feeling. I think nobody wanted to be alone that night. We all wanted to be with someone else and we wanted to talk. We needed to talk and so we did that for a while and then as happens you know things settle down. We go about our normal life again and there develops or there seems to we seem to fall back into this feeling of separateness of individuality. Then 9-11 is the next big disaster that comes to mind where the same thing happened. Everybody came together and everybody supported each other and you know everybody was magnanimous it seems like offering to help and to be together and it lasted for quite some time. But then again eventually you know as things quiet down we go about our individual lives and again comes over this feeling of separateness or of independence. So it seems to be important that we remind ourselves that we remember the truth of our interrelatedness. I recently read this book Creating a World that Works for All. It's just fortuitous that I came to have it but it's a wonderful book and I'm sure the man who wrote it Sharif Abdullah if not a Buddhist practitioner certainly is very familiar with Buddhist principles but he says about this. We live in a world that works for only a few. The problem he asserts is exclusivity the fundamental belief that we are separate from one another. By practicing exclusivity we have created a soul starved society. We suffer both personally and as a society from complex interlocking problems so intense that they create a deep sense of emptiness in all of us. We can change our world by changing our consciousness. We can actually put an end to these complex problems by embracing inclusivity the realization that all of our lives are inextricably linked. When we do a food blessing often what we do is remember where the food that we're about to eat comes from and all the elements the people all the work that it took to bring that food to us. Almost none of us grow our own food anymore. We may grow some but I don't know anybody that that grows all of their own food so we are dependent on the farmers and the farmers of course are dependent on the elements the sun the soil the rain the moon etc. We're dependent on the farm workers that pick the food the truck drivers that bring it to the supermarket warehouses the store clerks the owners of the stores etc. etc. And it can be a nice reminder as we sit down to an abundant meal that we remember this whole chain of people and events that has brought this food to us. I drive to Monterey quite often and I try always to you know in my car bow to all the farm workers as we drive through the agriculture you know there is so much of course down in that area and I see those farm workers you know in rain or in sweltering heat doing this back bending work so that I can have my fresh strawberries or broccoli or whatever it is that I have and I want to I want to be sensitive to them and to remember that when I go to farmers market or whole foods or whatever you know it's because of them that I can buy this basket of strawberries. So Tich Nhat Hanh talks a lot about this fundamental inter relatedness interconnectedness interbeing he says and he talks about paper and the non paper elements that are in paper. So when we see when we look at this piece of paper he suggests that we see not just paper but we see clouds and rain and trees and forests and the lumbermen I guess that harvest the trees and on and on. So I'd like to read just a bit a little bit long but very poetic from the heart of understanding. If you are a poet you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper without a cloud there will be no rain without rain the trees cannot grow and without trees we cannot make paper the cloud is essential for the paper to exist if the cloud is not here the sheet of paper cannot be here either so we can say that the cloud and the paper enter are. Interbeing is a word that is not in the dictionary yet but if we combine the prefix inter with the verb to be we have a new verb inter be without a cloud we cannot have paper so we can say that the cloud and the sheet of paper enter are. If we look into this sheet of paper even more deeply we can see the sunshine in it if the sunshine is not there the forest cannot grow in fact nothing can grow even we cannot grow without sunshine and so we know that the sunshine is also in this sheet of paper the paper and the sunshine enter are and if we continue to look we can see the logger who cut the tree and brought it to the mill to be transformed into paper and we see the wheat we know that the logger cannot exist without his daily bread and therefore the wheat that became his bread is also in this sheet of paper and the logger's father and mother are in it too when we look in this way we see that without all of these things this sheet of paper cannot exist looking even more deeply we can see we are in it too this is not difficult to see because when we look at a sheet of paper the sheet of paper is part of our perception your mind is in here and mine is also so we can say that everything is in here with this sheet of paper you cannot point out one thing that is not here time space the earth the rain the river the heat everything co-exists with this sheet of paper that is why i think the word inter-b should be in the dictionary to be is to inter-be you cannot just be by yourself alone you have to inter-be with everything else this shade of paper is because everything else is suppose we try to return one of the elements to its source suppose we return the sunshine to the sun do you think that this sheet of paper will be possible no without sunshine nothing can be and if we return the logger to his mother then we have no sheet of paper either the fact is that this sheet of paper is made up only of non-paper elements and if we return these non-paper elements to their sources then there can be no paper at all without non-paper elements like mind logger sunshine and so on there will be no paper as thin as this sheet of paper is it contains everything in the universe in it just let that sink in everything is in this sheet of paper what do i have seen things so i'd like to suggest for just a moment that you look at your life we all look at our lives and see how are you interconnected what are the ways in which you are interdependent inter are i think of a few things in my own life i'm sitting here tonight teaching without students i couldn't be teaching without a teacher you wouldn't be sitting here i'm a grandmother but of course i'm a grandmother because i have a daughter who has a son i have a grandson i'm a therapist but i can't be a therapist without clients and clients can't be clients without a therapist ram das likes to say so tonight i'm sitting in this position tomorrow i may be sitting out there today i play therapist tomorrow i may be the client and you're the therapist i find it really inspiring and um i don't know uplifting i guess to recognize all of our interconnection all of our interdependencies i think actually it helps me feel not so alone and not such a heavy sense of responsibility that i have to manage everything alone or i have to do everything i'm part of this web of life and i do my part i contribute what i can and other people contribute in ways that they can and it seems important um it's certainly it certainly makes me happier the less i compare and the more i just appreciate all the different ways that we serve each other we serve each other in so many different ways and there's no one way to be i for many years i thought there was i thought there was a way to be a good person and i was constantly striving you know to find or to be that way what a relief and what joy to find out that it's more like a kaleidoscope right we all have something to contribute and the beauty is in each of us contributing to each other and therefore none of us feeling alone we do forget however don't we we do forget that we're so interconnected and think that we must stand alone or that we must do everything alone uh a couple of pertinent readings this is a daily book of readings that as you can see is so well used it's so rich and full of wonderful readings and this is the one for january first a woman can't survive by her own breath alone she must know the voices of mountains she must recognize the foreverness of blue she must flow with the elusive bodies of night wind woman who will take her into her own self look at me i am not a separate woman look at me i am not a separate woman i am a continuance of blue sky i am the throat of the sandia mountains a night wind woman who burns with every breath she takes yes jorana macy has written a book called world as lover world as self and she talks about many things but one thing that stands out is that if we see the world as ourselves then we can't harm we can't harm it if the world is not separate from us the world is us and we are the world and if we see that with each other then we can't harm we can't harm each other because to do so would only harm ourselves her words having nothing to do with this bird except as she breathes in the air this bird flies through as the grass needs the body of the bird to pass its seeds as the earth needs the grass as we are made from this earth and the sunlight in the grass enters the body of the bird enters us this is susan griffin we could not live without the air we breathe the air that all creatures breathe the air through which the bird flies we are not separate from the soil in which our food grows nor from the farmer who plants and harvests the food the farmer could not be here without parents to give her birth no one could survive without the air and the water and the sun if the sun didn't shine and the rain didn't fall the trees couldn't grow the lumber from the trees made the paper on which these words are printed had i not been born i could not have written them and had you not been born you could not be reading them is any one of us truly separate does any one of us exist alone so i'm reminded that the buddha said and jesus said you know be an island unto yourself be a lamp unto yourself and it occurred to me you know is this contradictory we're talking about how interrelated interdependent we are and yet at the same time be an island unto yourself and upon this i think it seems to me it's not a contradiction really we're talking about two different things it is important that we turn inward it is important that we touch the divine the buddha nature within ourselves it is important that that we remain centered and that we speak our truth that that we truly know who we are and that does not negate our interconnectedness our interrelatedness we speak from that deep source within but that in no way contradicts the fact that we are all interrelated so i suppose we could say in one way we stand alone but in other or another way of looking at it is we don't stand alone at all maybe a paradox but for me it makes perfect sense perfect sense as i was thinking about this i ran across an article by andy olenzky at the berry center for buddhist studies who comes out here once a year or so to teach and in i think it's the most recent issue of the insight journal spring this year he wrote an article entitled interconnected or not and i understand he's he's on sort of a kick right now about the use of this word interconnected because for him he hears it as being attached bound at the hip he says bound by conditioned phenomena and he argues that perhaps a better word would be inter non-attachedness and i thought okay that's fine inter non-attached i think he's talking about something different than at least what i'm talking about i think it's very possible for us to see clearly our interrelatedness and interdependentness without being attached at the hip without being bound to conditioned phenomena but it's kind of fun to to play with it a little bit to to think about it and i think the question you know does any of us exist alone is a good one to hold a good one to to contemplate perhaps tick not han talks about there's no difference between the perpetrator and the victim you know in his poem call me by my true name because the reality is all of us have both within us we're all the perpetrator we're all the victim and we you know we play the role at different times and the more we recognize that the more we see the perpetrator and victim within ourselves then i think the more compassion we have for others for other victims for other perpetrators and then compassion can bring us together so i'd like to pass these out and i thought it might be it's a little bit long it takes about 10 minutes i think to read but it's pretty powerful are there enough i don't honestly know who this was written by it was what we used as i said at spirit rock in 1991 i believe it was the committee that put the afternoon together that wrote it but i'm i'm not absolutely sure of that thank you i made many copies so i'll leave some out on the table later if other people want them that's okay i'll i'll read it but there is a chorus in between it's it's taken from the from our declaration of independence and of course reworked reworded but the chorus goes we hold these truths to be self-evident i am therefore you are you are therefore i am so i'll read the stanza and then i'll let you repeat the verse within the unfolding of time our world and our awareness express their fundamental nature which is to change our concepts of self both individual and collective necessarily shift as well to fit better with the emerging reality now the time has come for interdependence to supplant independence in the fundamental self-concept of americans and other citizens of the world and the court choose to be self-evident i am therefore you are you are therefore i am with this declaration we hereby affirm that the suffering of other beings is the same thing as our own suffering when our bombs fall on a culture we do not understand they fall on our own homes and families because we either either we ignore their pain and lose our compassion or we embrace their pain and admit that our brothers and sisters have died eventually our own bombs fall on us a second time on the hatred as i think these glasses aren't strong enough as the hatred and resentment engendered by our actions circle the globe endlessly until they find us and affect us in every imaginable way we roll these truths to be self-evident i am therefore you are you are therefore i am with this declaration we denounce the celebration of war including victory in so-called just wars because war itself represents a colossal failure of communication to be mourned regardless of the outcome the winners in war may actually lose the most how can we know anything when we can no longer look into our hearts because of the pain of what we became on the road to victory thank you jim with this declaration we hereby affirm our oneness with the british people and all other people against whom our country has made war since july 4th 1776 through the present including but not limited to the people of canada tribal nations of western africa mexico philippines spain the confederate south nikoragwa germany austria turkey the soviet union italy japan palestine china north korea bikini islands cuba vietnam lao cambodia congo zimbabwe mozenbik namibia liberia libya lebanon el salvador honduras chili guatemala peru granada panama columbia iran iraq and native american nations including apache Cherokee Comanche Iroquois Miwok Mohican Navajo and Sioux and countless groups within our own country such as poor people people of color women homosexuals artists atheists intellectuals communists and their acquaintances non-traditional healers and members of various religious ethnic and political political communities and organizations i am therefore you are you are with this declaration we penetrate the quality of victim and perpetrator and redefine all beings affiliated with violence as victims desperately needing compassion understanding and care not more violence we see a hundred thousand dead enemy soldiers as a hundred thousand dead children which is often what they are we see that ignoring dead and grieving soldiers makes it easier to ignore dead and grieving mothers and children therefore we declare our oneness with the soldiers ours and theirs living and dead who committed uncountable and unspeakable atrocities in the aforementioned wars and who have suffered more than we will ever know we vow to honor their pain and their sacrifices even as we struggle to direct their energy and repair the damage they have done we all know these truths each other with this declaration we acknowledge our own anger and ignorance and the ways we as individuals unconsciously nurture the spirit of violence in our world by projecting onto others the responsibility for our pain we vow to embrace our anger and ignorance as if they were our children in order to understand them and know their needs with this declaration we acknowledge the subtle interconnectedness of war the cruel exploitation of animals and the destruction of the environment the same illusion of separateness that makes possible the violence of one person or group against another also makes possible the casual destruction of other species and their habitats in particular we recognize the amazon and the oceans as the two great lungs of our planet as important and as much a part of ourselves as our own lungs with this declaration we vow not to be seduced by the political process which festers the illusion of social engagement while minimizing the risk of actual change regardless of whether or how we vote in elections we we vow to vote every day with our hearts and minds our hands and feet our mouths our money and our meditation we hold these truths to be self-evident that all beings are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of emptiness as well as breathing smiling playing with dogs being in nature expressing oneself and living and dying in peace and miyumi oda says spirituality is not a very difficult thing it is just an understanding of how we are interconnected if we are interconnected then we cannot damage the earth and we can't damage or kill each other we have to take care of each other because that is just taking care of ourselves so i think we have about five minutes i also think it's interesting and i hope you noticed you know that the words from what four five six different sources basically are saying the same thing and they're not all necessarily buddhist you know several of course many are but not all there is there is this recognition i don't think it's mainstream particularly but there certainly is this recognition of our interdependence i like that word interdependence you know if andy doesn't like interconnectedness that's okay i think interdependence probably or interrelatedness i think probably says it better anyway yeah um i was reading the the list of all the all the people that we have been at war with i i feel that another group needs to be included um and i'll just say we're going to visit some old friends from college who are both conservatives and we're liberals and we're going to be spending a number of days with them and i think somehow the conservatives need to be listed here too that we need to try to understand the conservatives to take them into account uh in reading uh george lakehoff and others they understand they believe what they are doing is absolutely right many of them yeah and i have tried to say how how do i relate to them how do i understand the way they think and and understand their humanity and their hurts and so on and still not believe what they believe and so i i would like to add somehow to that so they're not the enemy that once again we're at war with right right it is a very good point i think though um i was so aware that they took great care not to mention any political group but i see them here i mean i mean the list here that people of color women homosexuals artists atheists intellectuals communists community and so on yeah yeah i just sensed the omission of the opposite political party because this list sounds very liberal to me maybe i'm wrong yes yes if we don't have time now but but um sometime maybe we can have a conversation about this because it doesn't say that these are liberal no the hate can be there all i'm saying is the hate and the war right but i think you know the important point is that whether we're conservative or liberal or any other thing that we not not persecute or denigrate or whatever anybody who's different from us anybody yeah you want to say well um just um just to kind of say this for myself um i don't know if it mentioned children or those with who were disabled i don't think disabled it mentioned children but not not in that context not in that context yeah i'm sure everyone probably thinking of their own yeah and and i think as you're suggesting that that it is important and and i think they were very careful in writing this to make sure that it that it that it gave the idea of inclusivity without making this the liberal position or any other position you know that that it is in a way it's not a position it just describes the in what it is inclusivity but but it is um that that one paragraph with all the groups that we have been at war with all the countries it is isn't it i mean good question amazing amazing some of these countries in the long list are not necessarily countries that we ever had a a war declared with so we've gotten into this wonderful business of having a war but not declaring it a war double speak or something well it's a few minutes after so i think we probably should formally stop have a safe drive home and happy fourth
