The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Well, a warm welcome to everyone who's joining us for an open house from hosted by IMC's Asian Dharma Circle.
And so I'm aware that there may be people who are seeing this on YouTube as well, a warm welcome there as well.
And so we are going to start with just about 10 minutes of meditation and to allow ourselves to ground and settle before we open to our event today.
So we'll just sit quietly and I will ring bell when we end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
