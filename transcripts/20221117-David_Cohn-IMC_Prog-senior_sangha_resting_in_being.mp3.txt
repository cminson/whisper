 Good morning, Becky. So, what's ripening in you? What's ripening in your elderhood? I'm reminded of this story that I've told before about, but with a bit of a different slant, different take on it about this beloved rabbi, Zuzia, and he was such a good person, such a renunciate. He gave everything away. He lived in poverty. People would give him money. He came into quite a bit of money at one point, and he gave it all away, had a family, and they were all happy to live with him in kind of a poverty that... a very kind and giving person, and had many, many people that followed him, that had faith in him, that trusted him, that loved him. And when he was dying, as the story goes, he was crying, and people asked him that they were around him, why were you crying, Zuzia? And he said, I'm crying because I'm afraid to meet God. And they said, Zuzia, why would you, of all people, be afraid to meet God? You have such great kindness, like the kindness of Abraham, and you have such wisdom, like the wisdom of Moses. And Zuzia said, I'm not afraid that God will ask me, Zuzia, why were you not more like Moses? Why were you not more like Abraham? I'm afraid he will ask me, Zuzia, why were you not more like Zuzia? So, coming into our own being is something I think can happen in our elderhood. We tend to identify ourselves with what's out there. And as we age, we realize more and more that what's out there arises and passes, arises and passes. But what doesn't arise and passes, something, something within us, some kind of home that we can return to. And unveiling this home of ours may be something we can gently do in our elderhood, not achieving something or becoming something special like Moses or Abraham. That's kind of been, that was my practice earlier in my life, was trying to become something, trying to become a certain state of mind, trying to become enlightened, I suppose. Nothing happened to you, David. I can't hear you anymore. Can people hear me? Yeah. Yeah? Okay. Can you hear me, Jeannie? There we go. That was the other Jeannie that asked about that. So anyhow, let's meditate for a little while and maybe something around this theme of ripening into who we truly are. Having a somewhat erect, comfortable posture. Maybe taking a couple of deep breaths. And I recommend this as a relaxation. Sometimes, even before bed. I don't know. To take a couple of very deep inhales, and then on the exhale, just let all the tension, all the holding release. And that releasing exhale tends to kick in the sympathetic nervous system and helps us relax even more. And relaxing the shoulders, relaxing the neck, the throat, letting the muscles of the face melt, letting the brain soften, and letting the heart melt. And dropping into the body, aware of the arms, the upper arms and lower arms and hands, aware of your strong upright back, aware of your hips and your seat being pulled down by gravity, your thighs, legs, calves, feet on the floor, and the rise and the fall of the breath. Pulling you in to the body, pulling you into yourself. And just relaxing, just being yourself. Not trying to impress anybody, become anything special. Being defined by anything that's out there. We've had so many years of experience of seeing how what's out there arises in our minds, remains in our minds, and then dissolves into our minds. It happens all the time. Every aspect of our experience, throughout our history, and even right now in this present moment, the sensations of the body that you've just experienced, where are they now? What you were feeling a little while ago. Where is it now? What you were feeling yesterday? Maybe some affliction arose in you. Some doubt, fear, anger, jealousy, something that is pretty unpleasant, but where is it now? These afflictions that arise from our, what we call the Alaya Vinyana, it's like a consciousness, a self-consciousness that holds all the seeds of our karma. Something waters a seed of low self-esteem and it sprouts. But then it may remain for a little while, but then it's gone. Dissolves back into the ocean of being. The wide, vast, shoreless ocean where thoughts arrive like ripples in the water and dissolve back into the water. All of our experience tells us we are not our thoughts, we're not our feelings, we're not even our bodies, we're not our sense perceptions. All these come and go, come and go, rising and dissolving into the ocean of being. We don't have to do anything, be anything. There's no place to go. Just be yourself. How nice. Be what is always here. This presence is always here. This open awareness that knows what is here. It's within us and it's always been here with us. It's just, well the Buddha said when he was enlightened, he described it as luminous. This clarity, he described it as natural, this natural being. He said it is profound, peaceful. So have thoughts arise, maybe distract you from what is here. Don't worry about it, it just ripples in the ocean of your being on the surface of the mind. And then relax and return to what's truly here. That's truly warm, truly accepting, truly kind, allowing, open. This awareness doesn't turn anything away. There may be some aversion on the surface of the mind to some experience, to some feeling, to some affection that the awareness is aware of the aversion. Like a mother holding all our experiences with kindness and love and compassion. This love is intrinsic to us, it's innate, it's a quality of awareness. It's part of our riches that we can experience in our elderhood more fully when we're not grasping so much, trying so hard, just content to be. This isn't a meditation where we're trying to become something. It's not meditating at all, just being ordinary, home. This is a meditation where we're trying to become something. This is the time of our lives where we can just relax and be less bothered knowing how these illusions of self always dissolve and we can always choose to remain in this. Okay, thank you. Dolphin, our connection to people and friends and that kind of thing, more so than material things. Beautiful, thank you. I didn't talk about this in our group, but what the gentleman just said raises for me how much letting go there is in this time of life. And I, you know, he mentioned friends, but there's so much else, the physical capacities that we've had, the identities that we've had in our work or in our families or whatever. It does seem to me that those things dissolve little by little by little all the time. And how is that for you, that dissolving process? How does that feel for you? Sometimes it's okay and sometimes I really grieve the loss. I'm trying to school myself to accept the changes and that while they feel like losses, all these things, life is a movement and a process and one just must be part of it. Thank you, Becky. Thank you. Someone else? I think our work group, several things came up around this time of life, mentioning, you know, sensing loss, and how to be with that, you know, maybe cultivating patience, you know, how inner patience and also the gift of the inner practices, you know, just really connecting, going back to, you know, being present and aware of what's here. And also that sense in ripening doesn't happen quickly often, unless it's, you know, a banana on the counter. It's too warm, but generally it's a slower, quiet inner process and it comes sort of being with it. So, you know, looking at patience and openness and sort of kindness around this time. Yeah, great. To be patient with this, it takes time. And I think that, yeah, two things that came up in our group that really resonated with me, one's a little humorous, but I liked it. And that is the bucket list has changed from maybe travel and doing stuff to relationships and having more meaningful relationships. And I really liked that. I thought that was very powerful. And then the other one was the different lives that we have lived, like when we were, you know, young and then maybe in our 20s, we were one kind of a person. In our 30s, we changed into someone else in the 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s, just. And what I read, I realized too is, you know, I'm maybe not done. Maybe there's even more of me to come yet, which is kind of exciting, right? Because I feel so much more grounded now, more wisdom. You know, I care about people more now. And I just, I think that's just really exciting and very beautiful. Yeah. It makes sense that there is so much more, so much more to come. Exciting. So I shared with my group that what is really up for me right now is just yesterday, the husband of a very dear friend, one of my former coworkers who I've, I've known her for over 40 years, but her husband just died yesterday after a very short illness. And so for me, it's what is up right now is just really a sense of love and compassion and in one way, a desire of being able to be close to her when she's in another state right now and having a lot to do. So as I age, it just, it feels like the relationships become a lot more important, just certain close relationships. And in our group, we also talked about how these days, it seems like we're going to more funerals than weddings. But I, I love these small groups, they're, they're very rich and it's always wonderful to hear other people's perspectives. So I hear love and everybody, everybody's, and how, you know, losses happen. There's grief, there's always love and how healing, how pervasive in our being and in our, in our, in every cell this love can be and how healing and how we can grow more and more into love. But not trying to be a certain conceptual love, but just the allowing, the accepting, the openness, the awareness that has a kind of a love or kindness that can heal us. We touched on that, that aspect of just having a simpler life that, you know, being older made possible that we had more time to, just more time and more space in our life to be present, to do what we really felt was valuable and gave us time to cultivate our practice and enjoy, enjoy being present and enjoy the simple, simple things in life instead of having to rush around and take care of our career and our family so much. And I think that was something we all felt was a wonderful aspect of getting older and also to be learning things about ourselves, about, you know, forgiving ourselves and developing a self-compassion which helped to lead to compassion for other people is something that we were not necessarily familiar with until we had this opportunity at this point in our life to develop. Great. Yeah. I would also mention one thing that I've experienced, I don't, it wasn't really mentioned in the group, but I've noticed there'll be periods where I feel the sense of being bored. And I think I was really curious because we have all this rich experience and then sometimes I'll just feel like so bored and I'm thinking about, yeah, there were days, you know, when I didn't have time to do things, you know, and when I was working and, you know, the schedule jammed and everything and now it feels like, I feel like self-criticism of like the idea that I could be bored, I feel like I'm not proud of that. But it's that sense of like, that it's kind of scary to feel that, yeah, that you could waste your time being bored and life would offer you, you know, not offer you enough entertainment or whatever. But I think it's just something to work with, that sense of you need to be entertained or you need your life cluttered or you need, you know, stuff in your life. And so that's what I'm kind of working with. Artem is a luxury now. I don't know if this is exactly what we're trying to express during our group session, but one of the things that's occurred to me as a result of listening to you all during this time is that I find myself less perfectionistic, less judgmental. I say less intentionally because I don't mean to suggest that I'm totally judgmental. But it has to do with acceptance, acceptance of the way things are, the way people are, the way and not having to judge other people in the sense of, you know, the sense of, correct, the sense of, yeah, it opens, it just opens up things. It makes the world and my experience much broader, much more satisfying and enriches relationships to not have that kind of judging to be part of relationships to the extent possible. And it really, fundamentally, it's attached to the idea of radical acceptance, trying to really think about accepting things of art and living in a present place. That came up in our group a lot to that point of acceptance and being aware of judgment from just letting them go. And I'm finding, too, that allowing time, some of you have been talking about that, is just so important for exploring my own self judgments and valuing mindfulness, just more and more awareness to the point of just contacting uncomfortable feelings, which sometimes takes a while. Yesterday I reached the point where I just was finally able to see, feel what I was clinging to, which was, in a word, approval. And just being able to feel that to the point of tears of what it was leading me to. And how important it is to have compassion arise, which it does more easily when I'm really contacting that emotion. And then spreading to others as part of that process. Because I think a lot of us go through just wanting to be seen in a certain way. In order to let that go, I can see, I really need to feel it. And it seems like a luxury to have the time to explore these things more. There's tears of self compassion. Yeah. I want to be free from this. Yeah. Chaunty David said that we should look on all human beings with loving eyes. Big order, tall order. That's something that Bill was saying. Yeah. Excuse me. No, no, go ahead. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Go ahead, Steve, please. Oh, I was just going to add in the conversation. For me, it's a daily practice of attention. I don't want to go around distracted. I want to be, I want to experience my life force. You know, be, be. And what helps me is just kind of repeat, repeat, repeat. Come back to it when I'm away from it, just kind of open up. It's like in my meditation, I start thinking about something. Just let it go and come back into the reality of the day, you know, reality of the moment. And it gets discouraging sometimes. But then if I just keep at it, keep at it, it's kind of like meditation. After a while, there's a higher level of living there, higher level of appreciation. So my practice isn't just a sitting practice. It's throughout the day, try to be, be used by attention, you know, in a disciplined manner. Yeah. Our practice on the cushion won't do us a bit of good unless we take it into our lives. That's the point, taking it into our lives. Reality. I'm sorry, there's a delay. I can't think, my words aren't reality, but I can surely connect with it, you know, holistically. Yeah. Non-dualistically, yes. Great. Well, this is a wonderful discussion. I'm sure everyone here has something beautiful to say. The Buddha of the future is Maitreya Buddha in the lower. And Maitreya Buddha is the Buddha of love. So maybe that's something we could hope for, that we didn't hope for before, that we could become, each of us could become a girl into a Maitreya Buddha. So let's take a break now. And then we've gone a long time, but I can't wait to hear what Fiona, Fiona always has such beautiful, beautiful heart and such beautiful words come out of her beautiful heart. So she'll be talking with us when we return. And it's 12, 11. How about aim for 1220? Is that okay? Please try to arrive back at 1220 so we have time to, you know, there's a lot more to be accomplished here today. I remember that image as I sat with it, how it got more and more beautiful. The simplicity of this form, simplicity. It wasn't flamboyant. It wasn't eye-catching. There was no fragrance. It was just its very simple self. So I think that's what arose for me in this idea of ripening. And what that allows, I was mentioning today, but you know, we are all now moving into this coming week of Thanksgiving and gratitude and all the different forms and the commercial forms of expressing gratitude or not. How to look at this time of our life, this ripening of our inner lives, of what this allows us to feel in gratitude, what kind of gratitude arises out of this time, this ripening in our lives. Sort of a deeper sense of gratitude because simplicity of things. Someone mentioned earlier, not the things that one needs to accumulate. But the gratitude of what we can see, I thought maybe we could just spend time very quietly in our small groups, really looking deeply. What is it that we can truly, deeply, authentically feel grateful for in our hearts and how we can share, express that in this day or with the people that we'll be meeting and spending time with. Maybe it's just our presence, but I think it's worth taking the time now, maybe for 15 minutes in a small group to just deeply look at what is this that we are in this ripeness of our elderhood as we cultivate it. What can we authentically, deeply heartfelt gratitude? How can we feel and express this? So David, would you like to put us into small groups for 15 minutes and then we'll be with Michael and his final. David, how do I join your group? Did I miss it? You're muted, David. I'll let you go into groups. I'll do that. Thank you, David. And this is your show. Okay, let's see. Thank you. Hi, David. I was all of a sudden alone in the room. I didn't know. Okay. Let me move you. Okay. Let's see. I don't know what's going on here. Christine, you're not showing up. That's strange. Yeah, because there was a couple there when I had tuned in and then they left suddenly and then the other people that were with me. Yeah. Yeah, there was a group there. We were groups. It was a man and a woman and then a single woman and they're all gone. So I don't know exactly what happened. I'm sorry. I can't do it. I just never. That's strange. So what happened to the couple that I was saying is they said, Oh, we're only three of us. Was it a man and wife? Yes. Yeah, I see. I got you now. Okay. Okay, there you go. Okay. Let me just hold on just a second. Okay.
