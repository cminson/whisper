 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello again. Hello, dear Sangha. It makes me happy to see you all and to practice together and for the Sangha to be assembled here on Zoom, on YouTube, and actually if you wanted to put Zoom for those who are on Zoom to use gallery view to see each other, to get a sense of the Sangha here assembled, it's quite sweet, the Sangha from all over the world, all over the country and the world. So it's just heartwarming to sit and practice with friends. So for the practice today, I'd like to invite us to practice. So in the past few sessions, I think maybe last week, one of the sessions, the one theme that I invited us to work with was listening, listening with our hearts, listening with our hearts. And the sense of opening, and some of you shared that that was like open awareness practice, but with a sense of warmth, with a sense of care, settling into our bodies, settling into our awareness, with a sense of warmth and care. And also, I remember at the end with the reflections, some Sangha members who have tinnitus, for some it became better, easier to work with the tinnitus, since it was all about listening, but not listening with the ears, listening with the heart, but the tinnitus, for some it got better, and for some it became more prominent. So I wanted to lean into that a little more actually, lean into that and whether you have tinnitus, tinnitus also pronounced, and those who don't know what that is, that's ringing in the ears. That can happen for a period of time or for a long time, and the sense of hearing a sound that is not there, and yet, and yet, what I want to also invite us to consider is something else that many practitioners or some practitioners work with, which is called the Nada sound. So the Nada sound, I think it's Ajahn Suchitta, if I remember correctly, yes, Ajahn Suchitta, who is a well practiced, well respected monk in the Ajahn Chah forest tradition. And for an object of awareness, we can use the breath, breath in breath, out breath, in breath, out breath as a stabilizer, as an anchor, as a support, or we can use the sensations in the body. There's also so many different objects, the Visuddhi Maga, which is this book called The Path of Purification. It's about a thousand page meditation instruction from 500 years after the Buddha's death. So it's an ancient, 2000 year old, roughly, I think 2000 roughly, maybe I'm getting the 30 years old mixed up, 1500, 2000 year old manual lists a lot of different ways for our mind to get still for objects, for objects to, various objects to bring our awareness to. So Nada sound, what is Nada sound? Nada sound is the sound of silence, is listening to silence, is the sound of silence. So listening to the sound of silence, and when you listen to the sound of silence, actually, after a while you can hear, it's almost like you can hear a buzzing, it's like an echo that is easily available to those who have tinnitus, tinnitus, and for those who don't hear that stimulus, that sound readily available. If you really listen to silence, you start to hear a sound, you start to hear the sound that's always present. And actually, that sound can be a very comforting, depending on how we see it, how we relate to it, it can seem like, oh, this sound that helps, that's pervasive, that's everywhere, and can support the mind to get very still, very open, very quiet, this 360 degree soundscape, this Nada sound, the sound of silence, which again, we're calling it the sound of silence, but after a while you can hear it. So in some ways, it's actually, it's tinnitus, it's tinnitus, but when you really lower the threshold of hearing, of listening, and you listen very, very intently. So, why may this be helpful? Why am I bringing this in? Both to support those members in the Sangha who do have tinnitus and work with tinnitus, and also for those who don't, to open our hearts, our minds to this other object of concentration, of the mind settling with appreciation, and it can shift one's perspective if one has tinnitus in this way, perhaps for some, to open up to it as a pervasive object of sound that's present and non-threatening, the same way that the sound of silence is actually always present. To share with you that for a period of my practice, I actually worked with the sound of silence as my object of concentration, and it was lovely, it was just lovely, I could just relax, it was like surround sound, I could relax into this sound, this ambient sound that was always present, was always present, and felt calming, felt soothing, felt as if I was tuning into this ever-present sound that's always there that I didn't notice before, which again I can only imagine not having had tinnitus, again inviting, inviting this shift in perspective that might be helpful for working with tinnitus for those who have it, and again if there is resistance here it's okay too, notice if there is resistance, well not a sound is different, well is it? Maybe not, so inviting, if we get inviting some exploration for all of us with this with not a sound, with the sound of silence hearing this reverberation, the sound that is ever-present, ever-present, and can help us relax, settle, open our hearts to all the sounds in the universe, and all the sounds in our life, present and un-present that we don't always hear, it's all like listening to the cries of the world, and in compassion we open our heart to the cries of the world, so listening to not a sound is a symbolism, is a symbolic way to listen to, to open up to the cries of the world, the ten thousand joys and ten thousand sorrows of the world, to open up to listen with our hearts to the sounds we usually do not hear, to make our hearing with our hearts, again when I say hearing, the hearing with our of our hearts, so attuned, so sensitive that we can hear the sounds we usually don't hear, the cries of the world both internally and externally, so that's how I would like to relate the not a sound to our practice of metta and compassion, okay, that is the invitation tonight, and again working with however it works for you, you're always welcome to be your inner Dharma coach, your own inner Dharma coach, and changing the invitations so that they work for you, so that they work for you, okay, all right I've spoken a lot tonight to set up the frame, it's a bit of a different frame than usual, so let us begin, let us begin our practice together, so let's land, let's land in our bodies first and foremost become embodied, letting go of all the words, letting go of everything that has come before, tuning in, tuning inward to this body, what does this body need in this moment, how can I take care of this body in this moment, do I need to sit up straighter to give myself more energy, to perk up, do I need to relax and soften the muscles, landing, landing at the body, and let us start as always with the breath and the body first to get embodied, feeling our bottom and the cushion, our feet on the floor, contact points, our hands on our lap are touching each other, the weight of our body, the whole weight of our body, the odd breath relaxing, letting go of the weight of our forehead, our head, our eyes, our jaw, the chin, the neck, the hands, the arms, the torso, our bottom, with the next out breath, letting go of the weight of the legs, the entire body. Bringing the awareness internally, I think the awareness being the belly now, receiving the movement of the breath in the abdomen. If thoughts arise, you notice you're resting now in a thought awareness, it's no longer with the breath, it's okay, this is what minds do, smilingly smile at this thought, memory, plan. Thank you, thank you but not now, please come back later. I'm inviting, inviting awareness to rest, to receive the breath in the abdomen, calming, soothing, one breath at a time. So calming and soothing just to be with the breath. Opening, opening the awareness with ease, with receptivity, just this in breath, the entirety of the in breath, the entirety of the out breath. Thank you. Thank you. Now let yourself receive the breath with the heart center and the heart center, middle of the chest. So if the breath is coming in, coming out from the proverbial heart center, center of emotions in the chest. Hello breath, hello dear breath, life giving breath. See if there can be a sense of appreciation and the sense of awareness of each breath. Now imagine that the breath is filling your heart, as if your heart is the area that the breath is filling, coming into and exiting, is larger within you and all around you, circular form. Don't try too hard, don't push it, let it just be kind of, oh, easy, it's just here. Surrounding, air surrounding me, inside me, outside me, entering the heart. Let it be a light imagination, not too hard, don't push it. One that doesn't bring strain but makes your heart relax, your mind relax, soften, feel supported. Safety all around, breath coming in on its own, exiting on its own. There's not much for us to do, then to just hold witness with our hearts, peaceful, peaceful, easy. As you land, relax more, fully into your body, into your sit bones. Open up your heart, not your ears in your head, no. Open your heart to all the sounds. Again, it's not effortful listening, and if you're listening with your ears straining, let it go. You're landing, relaxedly, as if loving all the sounds, the soundscape of being human in this moment. Listen with your heart, maybe even if you notice you're listening with your ears, put your hand, your heart center in the middle of your chest, listening with your heart, listening with your body, resonating with your whole body, and your heart center in the middle of your chest. All the sounds, inviting your heart also to open up to, lovingly listen to, the not a sound, the sound of silence, which at some point might present itself as a buzzing or hissing, or not, each person's experience is different. Don't try too hard, just be open to all the sound with your heart. No sound is a problem. No noise is a problem, just what is in this moment, and this being human. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. No sound is a problem. I'd like to invite you to lean in more to heartful listening, as if you're listening to the most beautiful music, your favorite music. The heart can soar with the amazing, the fascinating notes of sound silence reverberations. Thank you. Thank you. Be delicious, joyful, notes and silence. Thank you. Leaning more into the heart, listening to all the sounds, as if 10,000 joys and 10,000 sorrows. Ours, that of the world, listening with our heart. Thank you. One last invitation. What if every sound you hear, every noise, should we take for granted, is really an expression of the divine? Of beauty and grace. The music, the mysterious music of life. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your practice, everyone. Listening with our hearts a different way of approaching this practice. Sounds, sounds, sound of silence, sounds internally, externally, but not a sound. Sounds as an expression of grace, beauty, divinity of being human. All that we take for granted. I'd love to hear anything you'd like to share. But you noticed what came up for you, what insights might have arisen. What would you like to share? Oh, Mark says, angels singing. Thank you, Mark. Beautiful. It's lovely. I have to say that feeling that came up for me also, as I was leading this. Can you see your hand, please? Well, I can't say there were angels singing. That's, that's something like to aspire to, but certainly to the degree to which I understood the direction, and I'm not really sure I do. I'm not quite sure I could find the register right where my heart is to open up. But in any case, whatever was listening. Certainly neutralize the the irritating quality of my tinnitus. And then as a comparison outside the door, somebody had their horn to their car was was blaring rhythmically, which was actually much more annoying than what was in my head. So, thank you. And I really I really appreciate again you, you bring in our direction to this. And I really, I really feel your generosity and do that and I thank you. Thank you, Fred. Thank you so much for sharing your practice and. And I and I'm touched I'm delighted I'm absolutely delighted to hear your practice report. I'm very happy to hear your direction that that is my hope that with a shift in perspective as you were experiencing that it didn't seem that annoying quote unquote this tinnitus that's always present that you shared a few weeks ago is really a lot of suffering and pain and it is difficult tinnitus tends to be very hard so thank you for that gift of your practice that you're sharing with others, because also many others, both in this song and listening to this audio. Your practice can be inspiring for them with the way you're working with your tinnitus. Thank you. Deborah says I noticed it felt very intimate and I felt safe with your guidance feeling of intimacy. Lovely. Marie Christine says felt deep into my concentration. Beautiful. Yes, it does that this practice doesn't it sense of settling. Jerry says calmness and peace arose in the context of lethal fear. Wow, beautiful sense of fear lethal fear being met with calmness and peace. That's profound Jerry. Thank you. Thanks for bringing that in. Thank you. Violet says, I like the invitation there is nothing wrong with what I'm hearing. Thank you, Violet. Beautiful realization inside reflection. I'll share something from my own practice tonight besides what the sound of angels that set seem to be coming up as Mark said, another one was the ambient sounds the sound of a motorcycle speeding outside and the horns and washing machine or whatever the sounds the sounds are. They all actually they start to sound delightful. I was inviting you to perhaps see if it's possible to see them for them to arise as a sound of divinity I'm alive. Isn't it amazing. There is this sound there's these way sounds. There's these waves and my ear can hear them and make sense of it just all this amazement the sense of. Wow, the sense of amazement in the midst of settling in the concentration which also Mark Christine talked about so Maria says, I hope I'm saying your name right when I learned when I leaned into my heart and listening when I leaned into my heart and listening. I noticed I had a smile at the corners of my mouth. Oh, that is so lovely. Yeah, sense of joy. Beautiful. So dear ones with this practice, this practice light it and violence now, especially as for those of you who have some trepidation sometimes with with being in small groups. What if tonight you stretch yourself again if you have to go if you have a meeting, etc, or something you have to go is perfectly fine, no judgment and yet if it's just that trepidation of other human beings, what if, what if you listen to them with your heart with your heart open as if it's the sound of angels and if you listen to yourself as if it's a an angel singing and say as little or as much as you want, just listen to sit together in silence, sit together in silence, that's okay too. So the invitation is we start with 15 seconds of silence in the breakout group, the breakout room, and then sharing as little or as much as you like with each other about your practice. So I'm making the rooms now. Here we go. They are open. Take care of yourselves take care of each other. Okay, welcome back everyone. So we have a couple minutes left. If anybody likes to share any reflections that came up from the group or before your practice. Please don't be shy, especially if you haven't shared your selections for a while for the benefit of the Sangha. Questions, comments, complaints. It's all welcome. Are you trying to raise your hand. Was a thumbs up. I was trying to raise my hand. All right, that worked. Well, I kind of saw you but anyway so please. Oops. Lost you again here. Okay, wait here. You can unmute yourself you want to share. Well thank you for, I have a lovely meditation. I missed you know I was a little bit late, getting here and I missed the first three or four minutes. So, but Jamie told me that you had asked us to imagine ourselves in a place that was perfectly silence was absolutely quiet, and to tune in to what sound we could hear there. And when Jamie said that I remember that years ago I wondered about that so I went to the sensory deprivation chamber to find a space that was perfectly silent to see, you know, what I could hear. And in there in the dark floating in warm water. I could only hear, I could hear two sounds. I could hear the sound of my heart beating. I could hear kind of very faint, high humming sound that I interpreted, I imagined it to be the sound of my central nervous system working. Since then I have developed tonight is like other members of the singer, and the song is not at all like the sound I'm talking about. It's a different thing. Right, right. Yeah, yeah I appreciate you sharing that. Yeah, so, so I might be, you might find it of interest later when this becomes available I mean in a little bit, I'll upload it into audio drama to go back and listen to the minutes. And, and it's in some ways, the, the not a sound the silent sound of silence could be the one that you hear when there's absolutely no other sound and it's completely quiet, but not necessarily, not necessarily so that wasn't. It's one version of the invitation perhaps one could hear that I said but not, that's not exactly the invitation is a little different so yes when you hear in the sensory deprivation could be one version of that, but not a sound actually after you start to hear it. It's kind of a vibration it's everywhere. It's, it's not just what you hear in a sensory deprivation tank or when there's absolutely no other sound. So, it's, it's a little different. So, I just want to invite that curiosity into the another layer of nuance I'm trying to invite here. Great, great. Thank you. Thank you so much and also thank you to Jamie to give you a version of that to tune into. Yeah. It's great. So thank you all. Thank you so much for your practice for your heart for listening with your heart to yourselves to each other to the world may all beings be well may all beings be free, including ourselves. Thank you.
