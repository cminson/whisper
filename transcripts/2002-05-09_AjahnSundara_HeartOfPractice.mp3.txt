 Since I don't come here very often, maybe the last time, life is uncertain, as you know, I'll say a little bit about practice and I thought it would be maybe good for you to have a time if you want to ask me any questions about practice, other than me giving you a whole talk, and then do you think that's a good idea? Yes? No? Come on, wake up. Meditation is not to put you to sleep, eh? Give your discontinuity faculties alert. There's a lot of mystique about meditation, is there not? What do we think meditation is? Is it to become really peaceful and calm and look like an enlightened spiritual person? Is it to be more successful in one's life so we can just get more money and a bigger car and a bigger house and a better job and have more people envying us and jealous or whatever? Is it people think sometimes meditation is to meditate and maybe one day they'll be able to multiply. Being one place, they can be in two places, being two places can be in three, or walking through walls or walking on water, or the miracles are associated with the practice of meditation. Won't it be nice to stop having to drive a car and just kind of zoom through the street of Palo Alto in full lotus? You certainly would attract some people for attention. And so there's a lot of misconceptions and wrong views about what the Buddhist practice is, what you just practiced, spiritual paths and so on. One can be very confused by all the informations one is exposed to when you think about what meditation is. Before Buddhism came to the west, the word meditation had a particular connotation, didn't it? It was the ability to contemplate, to be quiet and just to contemplate life, to open oneself to life, to go to a quiet place perhaps and maybe read something or think about some particular maybe philosophical problem or some existential question and ponder about them and let the heart go silent and relax and deepen, to deepen one's understanding of things. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, I think, is a French writer who wrote a number of texts called meditation. My memory is good. It's one of those French, I'm French, I should know it quite well, but one of those French writers of the past using the word meditation. And so I think it's always good to come back to, even before Buddhism came here, what this word meditation actually meant, because it's not very far from meditation practice. One aspect of meditation is, it's what we call in Pali, it's called Uniso Manasikara, it's wisely reflecting on things, why is it reflecting, what does that mean? You know, you think, oh, meditation is just sitting in full load, just sitting in my hands in the right place, my knees in the right place, my feet in the right place and just sit quietly, and every sound that buzzes me, I want to kill them. I want to kill whoever is opposed to my disturbances right now. That's not meditation, that's stupidity, that's being really dumb. And that's what many people think meditation is, shut everything out. I've got the right to be angry on my cushion, if anybody disturbs my silence and my peace of mind, this is being totally dumb, because that's not what meditation is about. That's one aspect of meditation, to be quiet and to concentrate. But really, the heart of practice is to investigate the nature of reality, to investigate. But what I didn't ask is to go into one of those sensory deprivation tanks, lie there and be enlightened after a few years. That was not the path that he was pointing to. He was showing us a way that brought the mind, focused the mind in such a way that you would be able to deepen your contemplation of the nature of reality. And he made this task very easy for us, because we have a field of reality which is always with us, which we call me, Joe, Harry, Josephine, Mary, me. The reality that we are always living with, which most of the time we just drag ourselves around, don't we? We just are in the way most of the time. This person here, the reality I am confronted with all day long, is just a hindrance. For most people, it becomes just a thing, just an appendage kind of thing that just is in the way. How many of us want to get rid of the body altogether? In fact, we do meditation a lot of the time just to get rid of everything. Not just the body, but the mind, friends, parents, mum and dad. We hope you don't think about them anymore. We hope all your problems will go away. All your difficult children will just be at bay once you meditate in your cushion in your room. And of course the dogs start barking, the children start playing music, and the car breaks down, and the boss tells you you have been fired, and your meditation tells you you are hopeless, your meditation teacher tells you you are hopeless. Oh my God, I have lost it all. What a terrible catastrophe. Can you at that moment be a true meditator? What is to meditate in those times? Is it to start feeling so sorry for oneself that you suddenly fall apart altogether? We are not in the right sense. I was talking to you about Monday, letting the assumption we have fall apart, yes, but how do we respond when life is not the way we expect it to be? Do we use our meditation to make sure that life is in control? That life is going to be just the way we always wanted to be, or we hope it will be one day. Don't we assume a lot, don't we? And many people use their meditation in the same way, a lot of assumptions. And this is not a judgment, by the way. It is very natural. We bring to our cushion, or we bring to the present moment, whatever we are. So if we have a mind that is running at 120 miles an hour, well, 200 miles an hour, really, in America, and then at 20 miles it's not that fast, is it? 200 miles an hour, and the desire that's just kind of rushing, gushing through our chitta, through our mind, what are we going to sit on? You're going to be sitting on the quiet part of peace and quiet and emptiness and serenity. You'll be sitting on this. You'll be sitting with this, with this energy that's just got gushing and rushing and wanting and desiring. And lo and behold, you will be really surprised how many people just sit there hoping everything to be quiet, push it down, press it down, or press it, repress it, suppress it, whatever. Do something. Do not experience oneself. Not experience the life that we are here. So a lot of meditation practices, so actually it's another form of, I wouldn't want to hear the words suicide. No, don't quote me on that. Please. But it's a way, sometimes, of just getting rid of all the things we don't like, isn't it? Instead of opening ourselves to the realities of the nature of the reality, right here, right now, in this very moment. Now, of course, if we're going to live in a reality, in a particular reality, we want it to be really pleasant, don't we? I mean, who wants something unpleasant and difficult and painful and boring and uninteresting? And so on. I mean, we're all here to, hopefully, it was an interest in living a life that is a bit more harmonized, a bit more whole, a bit more, a bit less motivated by fears to become fearless in the face of difficulties. You look at the world nowadays, and what are we confronted with? You turn right, left, up or down. It's all fraught with a lot of problems, isn't it? A lot of dukkha, suffering, dukkha. A lot of dukkha, one of the meaning of dukkha, by the way, is that which is difficult to bear. We can understand that easily, can't we? We are confronted, surrounded by many things that are difficult to bear. We don't have to wait for the 11th of September to start thinking, wow, life is really heavy. I think we've had 20 of 11th of September within, at some level, sometime in our life, a crisis of some sort. Something dies, a person, a loved one. Our cherished identity maybe dies, we get laid off. Our world crumbles, doesn't it? So where are we in those moments? Who are we to, you know, where is life in those moments, where suddenly we lose something and we feel so identified with the loss that we just fall apart altogether? You know, mothers at some point lose their children, they go off to university, people separate, people lose their loved ones, dogs, cats, husbands, wives, partners, mother and so on. So wherever you turn, there is some sort of a realm of pain, is there not? Well, if it's not in your family, maybe it's your neighbour. If it's not your neighbour, maybe it's around the world, it's all over, isn't it? It's all over. And we can be so incredibly weighed down by this pain that the world is exposing us all the time. It's not the world, it's the media that keeps exposing us to all this sort of mass of suffering that is at the heart of the Buddha's message. What do we do? Is it confusing? Should I go and help, you know, the, whatever people is in need right now? Should I go to Afghanistan or should I go and help the Israeli or should I go, you know, fight with the Palestinian or should I go and march for peace, should I go and just go and get drunk instead or should I go and save the wells or should I go and whatever. Some, you know, we want maybe to help the world. And then the other side of oneself is that you just want to sort of bury your head in the sand and get drunk and forget everything. We don't have any alternatives. Have you noticed how your mind, I mean, how many alternatives the mind conjures up? Are there, you want to go out and do everything or, you know, if you're very positive and life is, you know, if your life is very manageable and you can go and help and so on or so there's, you know, the backlash is when we attach to this and also we get very depressed and very down, very feeling really lost. So what is missing most in the human realm, in this world as human, is a foundation of trust, a foundation of what do we trust, you know, where do we turn to actually feel the sense of faith and trust, confidence in oneself, in life, you know, where do we turn to contact that sense, that strength that comes from trusting that deep down whatever happens, life doesn't have to be shattered, life doesn't have to turn against me, you know, life doesn't have to diminish me, you know, handicap me, I don't have to feel disempowered, undermined by life, do I? And yet how many times do we let ourselves be that, you know, be rid of strength, of confidence, of power, of trust in our own potential, in the potential we have as human beings, you know. It's very sad, life is a really sad story because most of us don't have a refuge, don't have anything to turn to. Maybe in the old days God was, you know, for Christians anyway, there was a refuge for those great agnostics, we're not even agnostic, we just don't, it's neither, maybe you're not, it's just so many people just don't, anyway in Europe, I don't know about America, whether you're more Christian or more inclined spiritually, but there's not very little to turn to except just material satisfaction and successes and so on. So this refuge is a very important aspect of practice, I often talk about this because it's, I can't speak too long about it unfortunately, but what I was saying, the Buddhist teaching is telling us yes, there is a lot of suffering in life, there's no doubt, you don't need to have a major crisis to suffer, you don't need to be on death bed to suffer. Just right here, right now, you're all intrigued that there is something that is missing, you think it's a partner, maybe we think, oh I need a pet, maybe I need a degree, or I need a PhD, or maybe I need a better car to impress people really, or I need more money so I can get a better girlfriend or boyfriend, or I need to go on holiday, that's quite fair enough, I need more money to go on holiday, it's missing, I like to go to Hawaii, you say, maybe, I can't go, because I have to work and I have to earn my living, and so on, my children need me, so life is never turned off the way we want it to be. And the, you know, long before we are interested in Buddhism or meditation, all of us have the potential to become aware of what's happening and to open ourselves to new perspectives. Often our perspectives are very narrow, me, me, what I want, me, me, me, what is in this for me, what can I get out of this for me, poor me, what's going to happen to me one day, how can people make me happy, what can they do to me, what can they give me, give, give for me, I'm so important, I'm so special, I'm so unique, me, you know, so from that perspective life is an utter misery, do you agree, you don't have to, it's pretty miserable, but we don't notice that until something really happens to me, have you noticed? When me becomes sick or is threatened somehow, we begin to realize that maybe at that moment we have a very important lesson there, because we begin to, perhaps for the first time, to realize that that little me, that little cocoon in which we've been living all these years is totally unsatisfactory. It's not the place to identify with, it's not what you want to identify, it's not what you want to think you are, but we don't, you know, for me before I started meditation I was encouraged to meditate, I used to say you must be mad, me meditate, what's the point, you know, I've got things to do, I'm busy, this is for the grannies, this is for people that are just totally hopeless, you know, they meditate, they've got nothing else to do, you know, it might as well meditate, me meditate, you must be joking. This is the kind of conceit that we carry in our mind, you know, we don't think we are, rather we think we are above all this, you know, we are above this capacity to be aware of our limitations. So a refuge in this practice means understanding that within each one of us we have the capacity to transform ourselves beyond all external conditions. External conditions can be helpful, but when they are not helpful it doesn't mean you're losing that refuge. So in Buddhism we have three refuges, you become homeless as a monk or nun, but you get a good deal really, because you get three refuges instead, they're very safe, they don't have any roof, they don't have any walls, they don't have any central heating, nothing in fact. But they are right here in your heart, you can carry them around, it costs nothing, so it's a pretty good deal, no rent, you don't have to buy them. You notice it's all mandana here, even the external refuge, this is a refuge here, the centre is a refuge. So, you know, Buddha speaks about the swing refuge. Buddha, refuge in Buddha means to be awake, refuge in wisdom, the wisdom of the Buddha, the wisdom of the awakened mind, refuge in Dhamma, the truth, the teaching, the way that is shown by the Buddha. And refuge in Sangha, Sangha is refuge in the community, Sangha means a group of people, it's a community. And it's also a symbol for the purity that this community symbolises, not purity in the sense of clean, pure pure, what we imagine, puritanical. No, I'm talking about the purity of the wisdom and the compassion, and the yearning, the aspiration to free one's heart from all that is hindering it, from manifesting fully the compassion and the wisdom that is really right in it, right there, resting in it. So when you go home and you have, maybe feel weighed down in your heart, you feel depressed, maybe, life is really not that fun at some level. If you look deeply, I mean, if each one of us look in our heart, we won't, and we don't lie to ourselves anymore, we feel there's a lot of pain there, a lot of unsatisfied things and a lot of suffering. A lot of loneliness, sadness, a lot of feeling of wanting to be with somebody, wanting to commune, wanting to be part of something. And there's also the side of us that just say, no, I don't want anybody, I'm on my own, I'm independent, I don't want to heal all that stuff, I don't want to teach her, I want to be me. So we have many sides to ourselves, as you know. And we tend to identify with everything, and we get very confused because the messages are so many. One day we can be a wonderful bodhisattva, want to give everything to the world, the next day we might be depressed and feel down and just want to write to all our friends who annoy us at some point, get even. And then the next day we feel maybe doubtful about everything, seeing that the world is coming to an end and we have, we think, and of course this is attracting all our memory of failures and confusion and so on. Your mind attracts exactly what's in it, remember that. So if you're full of fear and you identify with fear, you will attract fear. And if you're full of doubt and you really identify with your doubt, you will attract all the doubts that have been there with you for the last many years. You will remember, oh yes, I questioned this and I wasn't sure of this and I was, you know, say, oh my God, I'm a terrible person, I keep doubting, I don't know anything about anything. So you tend to attract what you identify with. This is why it's a sense of urgency, rises in the heart very naturally. I want to attract love, compassion, happiness, well-being, you know. And it's great, it's a great incentive. If you're really going to be creatures of happiness and this country is definitely bent on it deeply, you know, not going to do anything unless it's going to make you happy, well, it's good, you know, then you can really, it's an incentive to actually fill your heart with the necessary conditions to make you happy truly, while as I'm unhappy. So those three refuges, of course, at first they're very strange, you know, they're just words, what does that mean? Buddha and Vasanga being awake, the truth and the, you know, and the community, the Sangha. You know, some of you have seen the Buddha, the statue of a Buddha, haven't you? This one doesn't have one, this is a Western Buddha, you see. It doesn't have that lotus foundation that most Asian Buddha have. Have you seen Buddha? They have a, usually they're standing on the lotus flower. Well, you could say the symbol of the Sangha is that lotus flower, it's the purity of the lotus. The lotus has its roots in the mud and grows, so the outer water. So we're like the lotus, we are in the mud, this is a mud. And our heart is through the practice, rising, not above the mud, we're not trying to get rid of this body, but it's getting to know little by little that we are not this body, we are not this mind, this conditioned mind, we are not this. And I'm not here to convince you of this, but this is the, if you are able to let go of your complete conviction, total conviction that happiness is a way to go, if you can let go of this completely, then you might find true happiness, which true happiness comes from actually bearing with suffering. And you don't need to look for suffering, don't worry, you don't need to look for it, you don't need to go anywhere. It's right here, right under your nose, this body and this mind, the Buddha said, he said an interesting, he said something interesting, he said, somebody was asking him, how do you go to the end of the world, is it by walking? And he said, no, you don't go to the end of the world by walking, you never go to the end of the world by walking. But I teach that there is no, it's a complicated logical thing, I have to think a little bit, you don't go, there is no ending, you don't go to the end of the world unless there is the ending of suffering. You don't go to the end of the world unless there is ending of suffering. And the world in Buddhism, remember, it's not mountains, river, hills and butterflies, it's a world that you create in your mind, it's a world of suffering, that's what the world, that's a world of delusion, it's a world that comes from the mind of the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha comes out of delusion, that comes out of attachment, comes out of greed, hatred and delusion. This is what we add and this is what we impose on ourselves without knowing a world which is very painful, which is preventing us from this knowing, knowing of the inner freedom that's already there within ourselves. So, whenever you have difficulties in your life, whenever things really get heavy, gets really difficult, unbearable, when you have a true refuge in your heart, when you really trust the awakened mind, you trust really the truth, there is a truth, there is a dhamma, there is ultimate truth and you have, you trust there is also a connection with the heart which is awake and compassionate and wise, then those unbearable moments instead of being, you know, the time of complete total disaster and complete crushing experience are the very gateway to deepen your paths of practice, to transform, to deepen the paths of transformation, to deepen your potential to transform yourself and I'm not trying to be poetical or anything, you know, trying to inspire you in a particular way, but it is true that those moments very often are totally missed. We are so far ahead of our difficulty that we miss right there and then the very moment that is going to transform you and make you more whole, make you more much stronger, much more a beautiful being, a beautiful person. I read recently a book which I think probably many of you must know called Tuesday with Maury. Maury, okay, it's a lovely book because it's without being a Buddhist or without being anything, you can see that this person had in a way used his life right to the end to go into the mystery of his own being, of his own heart and we don't need to be sick, you know, to be bedridden to start there, but we have to know that a path of practice is leading you to that place, you know, and maybe you don't want to be here. It's leading you to that deep, profound sense of peace that allows you to actually function much better in life, don't think that you become dysfunctional and to function without fear and without, you know, without the limitations of what we think we are a lot of the time. So for those who are a little bit new on this practice, you know, even though you don't know what those three refuges means because it's a deepening of experience, you know, it's like the more you are awake to your life, the more you endeavor to practice, to practice away, the way shown by the Buddhist teaching and the more you, you know, the more you realize that within yourself there is a friend, you know, there is, you have a good friend within yourself to help you, you know, not alone. And this is manifest just by the symbol of the Sangha, the externally, you have these friends, but internally there is also a great compassionate heart here, a great compassionate and wise heart, but you need to give it a little bit of room so it can speak and express itself. And to do that, you do have to go into that mode where you become, you know, you are allowing yourself to be in that meditative state, contemplative states. In your daily life you might not be able to get into the eighth jhana or deep concentration practice, you might not be able to do that, driving your car is sure way to get you to the symmetry, you know, you might not be able to develop a lot of formal practice, but there are times just during the day where you can let your mind open and relax and just breathe in and out and let go of the, you know, for a few minutes, even for a few minutes of the entanglement that one is part of a lot of one's daily life. Okay, I've probably said a lot already, and please if you have any question, it can be really, I don't mind being challenged, it is fine, up to a certain point. It was in my precepts. And it can be really silly question, it is all right, they don't have to be sick or intelligent or clever or... What did you do to the buddhist? Why? Yeah, why? Did I became a buddhist? Well, because I thought there was a very, a very, a teaching that was very practical and could be, you know, I felt the good result from this just immediate teaching very quickly, you know, I could see that just by being aware and mindful, you could decondition your mind, because I realized my mind was very conditioned by certain things, prejudices, ideas, views, opinions and so on, fears, anxiety, worry, love, hate, jealousy, envy, the whole lot. I don't think I'm the only one, am I? Yeah, no? Am I alone like this? No? So, you know, I saw that mindfulness was able, I was able to let go just by not moving away from the experience. Most of the time we tend to, you know, whenever something is unpleasant, the mind immediately moves away from it. It just will do anything to distract itself from the experience because it's unpleasant. And yet, it's that very moment of unpleasantness that you need to really be with to let it go. It's very mature teaching. It doesn't get your, you can't get away with anything in a way, you know? So I find that very interesting. I personally was really keen on it. I thought that was really an intelligent teaching. That's fun. You don't have to run away from anything. You can actually face and get transformed. That's pretty good. And let it go in that moment. Of course, it's not as easy always as that. Don't worry. It's pretty, pretty dense sometimes and tough and difficult. But I felt it was very practical. I did not need to believe in anything. I did not need to have dogmas of some sort that I had to read and so on. It was just here and now. There's suffering, there is the ending of suffering. How do you get there? That's what I was interested in. How do you get to the end of suffering? So that was really a motivating factor for me. And it's not like a big intense suffering. You just look into your heart and you can feel the pettiness of your own heart, don't you? In everyday life. You like somebody, you want to grab them. You don't like somebody, you want to get rid of them. Somebody says something a little bit nasty, you wish they could be dead sometimes, don't you? Or you want to confront them. You're not very nice, not very nice feeling in the heart. So, let's answer your question. Do you understand why I speak by the way? Is it too fast with my French accent and English, British term? No? I don't think I'll ever get an American accent. In fact, yesterday I lost all hope of ever getting an American accent because there was a gentleman who was here in one of the meetings we had here. And he came from London, he's been here for about 25 years and he had a thick Cockney London accent, really thick. That's amazing, 25 years in America and he hasn't lost one vowels, you know, the Cockney accent. So, I probably will never get it. I've mixed between French, English now and... So, you have no question at all, I'm really disappointed. Completely disappointed. Yes, I'll work with it. One of the things that's come up from practice lately is seeing that there's sometimes, when I just feel a sense of resignation, that there is that feeling that whatever it is that I'm missing and I'm looking for, I just will never find. That resignation just feels soft, it feels like it's been with these lines, I can remember this line. And there's a lot of sadness associated with this. And I'm really interested in knowing how humans suggest working with that. It's not difficult. But it's so close to you that you can't actually get it. Simply, I mean it's so simple, you're going to say, well, I want something more expensive than that. It's very simple, it's just, can you really go into that sense of resignation, that feeling of resignation and just let it, give it a lot of space. Without thinking, without trying to do anything, just be totally resigned and totally sad consciously for a little while, just work with it. And then you'll find that it's not as thick as it used to be once you've done it a few times. Just be really fully consciously, fully resigned to everything. Think of being absolutely resigned. And deeply sad. Because there's suddenly a feeling in the heart, but if it's not seen for what it is, it takes over the mind. It takes over the whole mind. So maybe it's been deeply with you for so long, it will take a while maybe just for you not to, for one thing, to recognise that feeling. And you only recognise something, like if, let's say, if this clock was a whole room, was as big as a room, and I didn't know what this clock was, I didn't have a name, I couldn't recognise what it is. Imagine the clock is big as this room, it takes the whole space. And I didn't know there was a clock. And somebody says, you know, you are the clock. I say, me? Well, where is the clock? Where is the clock? I don't know where it is. But then if I give a little bit of space and that clock shrinks a bit, and I see a little bit of space around it, I say, oh, there is something there. And somebody says, this is the clock. It's got a name, clock. You've got a name already, it's called resignation and sadness. But you need to give it space to be able to see it. If it fills your whole psyche, and you've believed it for so long maybe, then it's going to take a while, patience. But it's wonderful, because Kanti, or patience, is one of the supreme, supreme practices in the Buddhist teaching. Do you know that when he was teaching, he had 1250 arahants during his lifetime. The first teaching he gave to those 1250 arahants, and they were not dummies, obviously, you can imagine. They finished the work, they're not sort of, you know, they're all kind of waifs. The first line of the teaching he gave on that day, which was a full moon of February, became the Maga Puja, Maga Puja Day, was, patience and endurance are the highest austerities. Now, austerities, I know it's not a word that's very liked in our society. We don't want to be a steer, we just want to have fun, okay. But what he meant, it's like a discipline. And what he means, it's really, how can I make it nice for you? A discipline. You know, it's the highest level of practice, patience. You don't know that, because in our society, in our culture, patience means nothing. It doesn't have any connotation with anything intelligent, patience. Have you noticed? Am I right or wrong? Maybe I'm deluded, I don't know. But usually, patience, when I was younger, you know, patience was just what Granny did because they had Alzheimer's, or it could not be anything else with patience, being patient, because they just, they couldn't do anything else. But if you go to Thailand, for example, in the Buddhist country, it's very interesting to actually get, be part of a culture where the concepts have different associations than ours. And in Thailand, kanti, or patience, is highly praised. Highly, it's like a symbol of intelligence and a symbol of wisdom. When you're patient, it means you're wise, you're intelligent, you are strong, you are, you know, a wonderful person. So, sorry to have, I'm sort of deviated a little bit, but for you to realize that it will take patience to actually give the space, breathe in and out through these feelings, and just put yourself in a position where you really go in to look at it as if you were in the microscope, and you're looking at it, it's not you anymore, okay? You're looking, and you're seeing for what it is. Very simple. It won't take very long, you'll see it quickly enough. And then you realize, oh, I'm not the resigned person, and then you come back again, well that's all right. I'm the resigned, oh my God, you know, what is this asunder effect? Okay. That's how we can use the teaching, you know, you kind of fall back into the old traps and out, and this is what strengthens us, you know, when you fall back into it, that's the moment where you can get strong. If you didn't have any desire, as I just said, you would never be able to let go of desires. I mean, the reason why you practice letting go is because you have desires. The reason why you practice is because you have these things, you know, this sense of being stuck with a feeling of resignation and so on. So it's not bad, it's very good, it's a good teacher. Do you ever do anything like chanting maybe to raise a vibrational energy? Because a lot of times it's just community. Yeah, I feel good, I feel kind of relaxed. But I know sometimes you go to a church or a song and there will be some kind of singing or something, which I think the vibration kind of raises my energy level or my personal vibration. I feel a little high, I know it's temporary, but I just wanted to... Do some Buddhist traditions actually kind of offer the roles, the roles of singing to that kind of roles and it's very vibrational sometimes. Do you ever do anything like that? Do you ever do anything like that? Do you mean that sort of thing? Yeah. Well, we do a lot of chanting, we do plenty of chanting. We chant in the morning, we chant in the evening, we chant 20 minutes before we meditate ourselves. No? No, no, well that's monastic culture as I say in America. We are culture in ourselves. I never heard this in Europe that we are culture, but... In monastery we chant every morning, 20 minutes. And every evening, 20 minutes. And you can chant in your little meditation heart to the top of your voice all day if you like to. Some people do chanting quite a bit, yes. It does, I mean, when you concentrate on something good, you will always do that, you know. You will raise your energy to the heart, yes. Oh yeah, some of the nouns do even what are they called, it's kind of... I can't remember the name... It's kind of making a sound that comes from... Do you know this technique where you produce a sound that naturally... I don't have the word, I can't remember the... Anyway, she uses that one of the nouns to bring up energy because she's not very well sometimes. But it's not in the sutta, I mean in our scriptures you never find that anywhere, you know. No, because there are other techniques to raise the energy. You wouldn't believe that for example restraint can actually raise your energy. Ooh, don't like restraint. Yes, restraint, you know, challenging your energy in a good way can actually raise your energy enormously. When you stop destroying life, when you stop taking things that don't belong to you, when you stop, you know, sexual misconduct, when you stop unskillful speech, when you stop taking drugs and intoxicants that confuse your mind, then you gather a lot of energy. And if you know how to handle that energy, then it can raise... It can come up into the heart. But you need to practice. Meditation is what transforms this energy. Most of the time we don't have much energy, it's dissipated, completely dissipated through the six senses, through the eyes and nose, tongue, body, you know. We are thinking and talking, dissipate the energy enormously. Talking particularly. It really is, it's like a gateway for losing all one's strengths. You notice for those who have done a retreat sometimes, you have a lot of energy on retreat and then of course when you haven't spoken for ten days, what happened on the eleventh days? You know, it's like people just chat all day long, chock-a-block, you know, non-stop, day and night for about two days, you know, trying to convince other people how wonderful it has been. But, you know, on the third day they're completely exhausted. The high, the energy, the momentum of energy that's been kind of produced during the retreat suddenly, you know, it's become exhausted after a while. So, this is just to encourage you to keep the precepts. But I'm not joking, I mean the precepts are not just, you know, a set of little do's and don't kind of thing. They are, you remember, it's the mind, the precepts are the mind. You know, what I mean by that is that they're pointing to the mind and they're guiding the mind. They're channeling the energy of the mind. They are transforming the energy of the mind, they're helping to let go of the habits of the mind and so on. So, when you talk about precepts, you're talking about mind, remember that. You're not talking about being a good girl or a good boy, you know, not drinking, you know, so I'll be a good, you know, not having too many girlfriends or boyfriends, I'll be good, be a good boy. To my mummy, she'll be proud of me. You know, it's not that precepts are not about this. Even though you would have said that, you know, having the reason why, he spoke about this ethical standards as a foundation of practice. Do you know why? Because the result of committing oneself to skillful behavior by body, speech and mind, the result of that is that you don't have remorse. You don't have regrets in your heart all the time. That's simple as this. Your heart is not filled with regret and remorse. And that's very important, isn't it? A lot of our heart is, much of our experience is one of regret and feeling remorseful about what we've done. But there are also, it's also a path of compassion, so whatever you do wrong is not to be, you know, you don't need to pile it up with guilt and blame, self blame. You just need to pick yourself up with compassion to start again, begin again, beginning again, always beginning again. We fall, we crash, we do it all wrong, we begin again, we fall again, we begin again. Hundreds time we fall, hundreds time we begin again. And your strength is not about falling or not falling, it's beginning again. That's the real strength. That's what will get you through everything. No matter how many times you get it wrong in your practice or in your life, you begin again. And of course it's an act of faith, and you know, undoubtedly it's an act of, you know, we won't call it faith because that doesn't mean so much for us, you know. But it's trusting that by beginning again you're on the right track. Do you know what I mean? Yes, Jill? In the last five minutes we had to teach you some chant. Teach you, oh, the chant, chant. Okay. Glass of water would be good, but okay, well we can just repeat after me, I suppose, chant. Do you have the chant somewhere on the sheet then? There was a meter chant somewhere. Oh, I think we only have five minutes, so maybe a short chant. I had this idea that I'm going to talk to Jill about it, but it's probably, it's going to be, probably disagree with me, but this is my, this is my devilish mind. I think you should have a completely new format every time you come here. Totally you don't know what's going to happen. That would be great, wouldn't it? No idea. Every time you come here you have no idea what's going to happen. I mean, of course, you know, it would be meditation, sitting at a talk, but you don't know how it's going to take place.
