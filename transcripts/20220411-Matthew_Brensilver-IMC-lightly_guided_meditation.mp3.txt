 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome, welcome all. Nice to get the chats streaming on the side. Nice to see your names. Welcome. Thanks for the warm greetings to the substitute teacher. Yeah, happy to be here this week and look forward to exploring together. So, yeah, we'll have the same format as Gil usually practices and kind of lightly guided sit for half hour and then some reflections until a quarter or two. So, yeah, just settling into a posture. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to begin paying attention. It's almost like we imagine the spotlight of attention being shown from the direction of our own head, from our eyes, the perspective of looking down into our body. Just another thought, actually. So, let's begin with the image of your body pervaded by awareness, porous to awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Sometimes it's supportive to feel our body is the kind of Earth element of our body, the groundedness the weightiness, the force of gravity, the downward pull of the earth. And sometimes it's supportive to know our body as vibrating space. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To be present is to be an intimidated by the flow of pleasant and unpleasant. To relinquish our preoccupation with control, molding ourselves and molding the moment. Thank you. Thank you. kind of invitation more deeply into the present. you you you you you you you whatever narratives accumulated about this sit how it's going how you're doing just put it down make yourself radically available to this moment you you you you you you there's a palpable sense that moment by moment life is softening rather than hardening our hearts you we actually leverage the imperfection of the moment for our freedom so rather than trying to extract something from the moment from our practice we let ourselves be softened by it you you you you you you you you you you you letting go is not a job we reluctantly perform but an utter delight and joy and so we develop a kind of confidence of faith in letting go you and it doesn't solve the complexities of being human the demands on any life but it does resolve suffering of this moment and that's something you you you you you you you you you you you
