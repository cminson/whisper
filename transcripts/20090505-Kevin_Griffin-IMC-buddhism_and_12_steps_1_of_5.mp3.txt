I'm Kevin Griffin. 
I'm an alcoholic and an addict, among other things. 
For our purposes, I'm an alcoholic and an addict. 
And I say that so that you know that I'm not teaching out of a book, although I do have a book as we all know. 
In fact, I can never remember what's in there, so it's one of the perils of either aging or smoking pot for too many years. 
And I've been teaching on this topic for probably about six years that it's been a regular thing. 
And I'm easily bored, so to teach the same thing over and over is not acceptable for me. 
So that's why I was just writing down some notes, because there were some thoughts about how I wanted to teach tonight. 
Are there more chairs in here? Bring those chairs in here. 
You're way too far out. 
You'll be taking my inventory the whole time if you're sitting there. 
It's terrible. 
There's really a lot of space here, but anyway. 
So this class series will be five weeks. 
I was calculating that I'll have to, if I'm going to cover the 12 steps, that'll be two and five seventh steps. 
No, it's not quite right. 
Somebody better with the math than I am, but it's between two and three steps a night. 
So we'll see how that goes. 
There are certainly steps that I will be emphasizing. 
My plan right now, as far as I'm going to plan, is that the first two weeks I'm going to cover steps one through three. 
And there could be some bleed in there. 
And we'll also be teaching really introductory meditation instructions, which are pretty much the only meditation instructions there are, because it's really just starting at the beginning each time anyway. 
Much like a writer or painter with a blank canvas, each time we sit down to meditate, we are faced with the same problem. 
Certainly it's helpful if we've done it before, because we remember how we solved our last problem, because it's the same problem only it's different. 
Did I mention that? So we'll have plenty of time to meditate and have questions about meditation. 
Typically an evening will be something like we'll meditate for half an hour. 
We'll have questions until you run out of questions. 
We'll have a little break. 
Then I'll talk about a step for a while. 
Then we'll either do an interactive exercise where you guys talk to each other, or we'll do more kind of just focus discussion about the step. 
So just out of curiosity, how many people are here at IMC for the first time? Okay, that's actually a lower number than we often get. 
So welcome to all of you. 
This is a wonderful spiritual home if you choose to make it such. 
The founder, Gil Fransdale, is a great teacher. 
I've practiced and studied with him, and always have learned a lot from being with him. 
It's also a remarkable place because it is completely supported by dhana, by generosity. 
Dhana is the Buddhist word. 
It's from the Pali language, which is the language of the ancient Buddhist scriptures. 
There's Pali and there's dhana, and I always think it's like some kind of song or something. 
I know there's odhana. 
I actually have written a song doing a shtick on that. 
But Pali, I guess there's like some old folk song, Pali. 
Somebody probably remembers it anyway. 
But they're not that, dhana and Pali. 
See, this is a problem with getting bored easily. 
So I digress a lot. 
So a center that depends totally on dhana, very few centers do that. 
Most of them will charge you a fee to come that will cover the expenses of the center. 
And then we'll ask you to just give dhana for the teachers. 
That's the way it's done at Spirit Rock and many other centers. 
The fact that Gil and this community have been able to support themselves and really quite comfortably on just generosity is a great testament to both him as a teacher and the community's sincerity of practice. 
So I would like to begin with some meditation. 
If you're sitting in a chair, best if you can sit with both feet on the floor or on something. 
So that you're not crossing your legs. 
What's more important than the way you have your legs is the back. 
And to sit in a way that you can be alert and the back can be straight without creating tension or rigidity in the body. 
This is the first kind of balance that we have to achieve in meditation is to be both alert and relaxed. 
I guess actually before we get too far into this I'll just recommend that if anyone has a telephone with them they might want to turn it off or silence it. 
Easy to forget to do that. 
And so gently closing your eyes. 
This practice is based on mindfulness, just being aware of what is as the fundamental tool. 
So it can be helpful to notice right now what you're feeling. 
What's your mood as you start the evening. 
Is there anything you brought with you, any concerns or stresses from the day. 
Rested. 
Is your body tense or just asking yourself how you feel right now. 
You can come up with a word or words or just feel into that. 
Open to that. 
Meditation isn't some special activity that removes us from ourselves. 
In fact it's just the opposite, it brings us closer to ourselves. 
If we try to ignore how we feel, it will only undermine our attempts at becoming quiet or present. 
Now doing some conscious relaxation. 
Relaxing the muscles in the face, the jaw, the eyes in the forehead. 
Relaxing the shoulders, arms and hands. 
Relaxing the shoulders. 
Notice if the mind is drawn to sounds. 
You can just notice sound. 
Whatever becomes dominant in mindfulness, meditation, return ourselves to. 
Turn towards it rather than trying to shut it out. 
Open to that. 
Let it move through. 
And coming back to the body. 
Softening the belly. 
A place where a lot of emotions can get stuck. 
And relaxing the legs and feet. 
Having a sense of the whole body sitting here in the cushion or in the chair. 
Just sitting. 
Can you feel the body as one thing? This one object. 
Within that single object are a whole myriad of sensations. 
We can experience the body as one thing and many things at the same time. 
Now starting to focus on the breath. 
First just noticing the whole of the breath. 
Feeling the breath at the nostrils as it enters the body. 
Then the chest and belly as they expand and contract and the air leaves the body. 
And after feeling a few breaths like this. 
See where it's easiest for you to feel the breath. 
What single point. 
Either the nostrils or the belly. 
Perhaps the chest. 
And let that spot become your main focal point. 
You might feel the air at the nostrils moving in and out. 
With the movement of the belly or chest. 
Not controlling the breath itself. 
Just breathing naturally. 
And then seeing what that feels like. 
And not trying to create some special experience or waiting for something to happen. 
Just relaxing into this present moment of breathing, of breath. 
It can be helpful to use some anchoring words to help you stay with the breath. 
If you're following the breath at the nostrils, you can stay to yourself in, out as the air moves in and out. 
Or if you're feeling the breath at the chest or belly rising, falling with the movement. 
Or you can find your own words. 
Letting the words be in the background as the sensations are in the foreground of your awareness. 
Letting the words be in the background of your awareness. 
As you try to stay with the breath. 
It's completely natural that the mind will wander. 
That you'll drift into thinking thoughts or images appear in the mind. 
Take us away. 
And whenever you wake up and realize that you're not paying attention to the breath, that you're lost in thought. 
Acknowledge that. 
You can make a mental note thinking, thinking, or just silently acknowledge to yourself that you're thinking. 
And then gently come back to the breath, trying not to add a judgment or commentary. 
And then starting again by focusing on the sensations of breathing. 
Relaxing, settling back into the present moment. 
Starting again. 
And again. 
And again. 
And again. 
In the same way if the attention is caught by sound or some sensations in the body. 
Acknowledge that. 
You don't have to push anything away. 
Just come back to the breath. 
It's helpful to also notice your reaction to your experiences. 
How you react to sound or sensations. 
How you react to an emotion or a thought. 
Just seeing these automatic and habitual ways of reacting to the world. 
That's the key aspect of mindfulness.

With mindfulness we try to be present with that change. 
Noticing the uniqueness of each moment. 
That's the key aspect of mindfulness.

Open your eyes if you become sleepy.

Are there any questions about meditation practice? You're welcome to come sit up front here. 
There's actually quite a lot of room on the floor. 
Do you have to be sitting straight up in a chair? You can meditate lying down. 
There's a tendency to fall asleep, which isn't helpful. 
It's one of the four postures. 
The traditional four postures are sitting, standing, walking, and lying down. 
That the Buddha taught mindfulness in, or said we could be mindful in those postures. 
It's something to experiment with, but it's challenging to stay away. 
It's the main problem other than that. 
Well, I don't believe you. 
You can grab the microphone. 
Could you tell me for a beginner how long the minimum would be? Minimum one breath. 
What is most important is to take the time to set aside some time. 
Certainly, if it's difficult for you to sit still, if you feel very challenged by it, it's better to sit for a short amount of time than to set some model of what it should be, and then not do it because you can't achieve that. 
That being said, 20 minutes is a typical kind of baseline, because it takes about 20 minutes to really settle in. 
From there, you just keep expanding until you go on a three-month retreat. 
I just taught in Los Angeles this weekend. 
I've just been noticing the different cultures, because I was in Sacramento a couple of weeks ago. 
Everybody here is just really polite. 
I can tell you don't want to ask me questions. 
In LA, it was like, I came here because I wanted to get this out of this day today, and I want to know how I'm going to get that from you. 
I was like, well, good luck with that. 
I heard this funny thing where it's real easy for me to meditate in trees. 
What's up with that? Are there any other questions? What posture do you use in the trees? Do you have a tree house? Amongst trees. 
What was that woman's name? I'm talking about going out in the forest and having a seat. 
That's what the Buddha taught. 
He said, go sit under a tree. 
You're probably a reincarnated monk. 
There's definitely a different energy to sitting in nature. 
If you're comfortable there, that's great. 
It's not very quiet. 
It's surprisingly, right? You think nature is quiet? It's not quiet at all. 
It's really loud. 
Then there's creepy crawly things. 
Then there's crunchy, crunchy things. 
After about two minutes, I go back to my house. 
I'm not a nature boy, but that's great if you're comfortable. 
The only thing I would say is, don't be like, I can't meditate because there's no trees around. 
Other than that, that's great. 
Very nice. 
Enjoy. 
Maybe that's why people don't want to. 
It's because they're recording them. 
Then people can listen on the Internet. 
They won't know who you are when you ask a stupid question. 
It will be like nothing. 
Or an intelligent question. 
You won't get anything either way. 
I wanted to ask about the tension that I sometimes feel at the beginning of a meditation in my shoulders. 
I'm just holding my body still. 
I've practiced isometrics in beginning yoga where you tense up each muscle and then relax. 
Do you advise that in this kind of meditation? It's not something that I do, but certainly if that's helpful for you to get started, that sounds like it could be helpful. 
If it works for you, not to spend the whole time doing that, but if that's a good way for you to settle in, that sounds great. 
Certainly one of the hardest things is to get into those first few minutes of meditation. 
In a way, that relaxation or that softening sort of happens naturally just by sitting and breathing and being present. 
But if you want to kind of awaken it and encourage it, that's helpful. 
That's great. 
I just noticed that when I slouch my shoulders, I have a tendency to do that. 
But if I try putting them back, then it feels like I'm trying to figure out how to get comfortable. 
Yeah. 
The body is a problem. 
One of the things we can get the idea that the body is getting in the way of our meditation, but really if the body is calling to you, or if that's where there's a strong experience happening, strong sensations, then that can become your meditation. 
So that's the thing about mindfulness. 
Mindfulness isn't about creating an experience. 
When we hear the word meditation, it kind of sounds like, oh, I'm going to be really relaxed and peaceful and maybe even blissful. 
And then you sit down and your thoughts spin out and your body is all uncomfortable and you're going, oh, I must be doing this wrong or I've got the wrong. 
I should go to that other meditation center down the street. 
They promised me this. 
But it's really, you're just, when we come out of our thoughts, out of our minds for a moment, we discover what the Buddha called dukkha or suffering. 
The kind of inherent unsatisfactoriness of existence, which was really what he was trying to solve. 
And sometimes it's very subtle. 
Sometimes it's very obvious. 
And it's not that we're always uncomfortable or that we never have a nice good time or that we're never happy. 
That's not the point at all. 
But certainly when we sit down and try to sit still, when we begin that process, we discovered that there's a lot going on. 
And the approach of mindfulness is not to try to push that aside and get to something else, but it's to say, wow, this is what's going on. 
Can I just be present with this? And can I be present with this without either trying to fix it or running away from it? And it's very much related to me to the impulse to addiction because we find that as soon as there's discomfort, we want to do something about it. 
We don't want to feel discomfort, which is one of the underlying drives, not even underlying. 
One of the main drives that causes addiction is our unwillingness, ability to just be present with the unpleasant. 
The other one, the other main piece of addiction is the craving to feel good. 
So there's aversion to the uncomfortable and then there's the desire for the pleasant. 
And you'll find that as you sit in meditation that both of those energies will appear both emotionally, both mentally in your thoughts and just as an impulse. 
So the place we're kind of aiming for is the place of just being able to be centered and balanced and accepting with whatever comes. 
And this is the real skill that we are developing that has to be developed in meditation. 
The first reaction is naturally like, oh, my body hurts. 
What am I supposed to do about that? How do I make that go away? I'm thinking too much. 
How do I make my thoughts go away? And those are the kind of natural responses to this experience, but mindfulness, we don't offer a solution to that, exactly. 
The solution really is the way out is through. 
And the power of mindfulness is that when we engage in that way, it's not that it stays like, oh, I'm just sitting here for half an hour just feeling lousier, you know, being anxious or whatever the thing is that's going on for you, that the mindfulness itself has a healing quality. 
And if we trust in that, then we find that we move through the experience by allowing it in. 
And we allow, it's just our presence that engaged presence that allows the experience to be kind of self-healing. 
If there's any magic to this practice, that's it. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Thank you. 
During this mindful meditation, are you going to be speaking and guiding us the whole time? Would you like me to shut up? Well, I like Blisting Out, actually, which is probably what I shouldn't be doing, I guess. 
If you're really Blisting Out, then my voice shouldn't be a problem. 
No, it's not, but, you know, it's just not used to it. 
Just a question? No. 
Different times I'll be guiding different amounts. 
Tonight, being the first night, I wanted to really stay with people. 
I mean, I feel the same way in terms of my own practice. 
So let's take about eight minutes of eight. 
Let's take an eight-minute break. 
We'll ring a bell in seven minutes. 
I was asked if I would talk about my experiences in India and Nepal, but I've never been to Asia, so. 
. 
. 
Why would that stop you? Really, you know, I was too busy with other things to be traveling around. 
I was traveling around, like, upstate New York, playing in Hall day-ins when other people were going to Asia, I guess. 
So it kind of occurred to me that maybe there were some things that people wanted to cover, so, you know, I'll just, well, we'll have time for questions later. 
But if at some point, you know, you feel like something isn't getting addressed that you really wanted to get into over these couple of weeks, please let me know. 
Speak to me, write to me, send me a telegram, I don't know. 
So I wanted to begin at the beginning, step one, and see if we can talk a little bit about how we can connect this process with Buddhist teachings and with meditation. 
And also, partly, to kind of just talk about the steps. 
So I, you know, I got sober and alcohol is anonymous, and so my version of the step, or the alcohol is anonymous version of the step is we admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives become unmanageable. 
And I say that because this isn't an AA meeting, and it's not a 12-step, it's not affiliated with any 12-step program. 
And I hope that there are people from many programs, usually people from all kinds of different programs come. 
And it seems to be, for one thing, a lot of people from food programs come to my groups. 
So the question of the substance isn't really, or the behavior, isn't really the point, and it's not so much what I'll talk about. 
And I'll also say that sometimes I will refer to alcoholics, or usually addicts and alcoholics, or sometimes addicts. 
I prefer the word addict to cover kind of everything. 
And so if you are in some program like Alanon, or something that doesn't sort of identify as being an addict, I hope you will kind of translate for yourself. 
It's just a matter of shorthand because if I list every substance and program every time I say that, it just gets tedious. 
So one of the ways to look at step one from a Buddhist viewpoint is to think of it as awakening to right view, which is the first step in the eight-fold path, which is the Buddhist sort of path of freedom comparable to the twelve steps. 
And with right view we see the Dharma, we see the truth of the way things are, and the fundamental aspect of right view is seeing the truth of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of suffering is the starting point. 
And this obviously parallels what step one is seeing. 
We talk about being in denial. 
So before we have right view, our eyes are closed or clouded. 
Before we admit that we're powerless, we were in this state of not seeing our addiction in some way. 
And I was thinking about that word denial today and feeling like it's not quite how I see that. 
I think there are times when people, because the word denial implies something intentional, I deny that. 
Like, hey, you're an alcoholic, I deny it. 
And so there's sort of an intentional rejection. 
And certainly that's the case for some people. 
But I think what's more common is a lack of awareness. 
And maybe after we become aware, then we deny it. 
But first there's this lack of awareness, which in Buddhism we call it ignorance or delusion. 
It's one of the three poisons, greed, hatred and delusion. 
So in delusion, we just don't see the way things are. 
And we live in this, living this lie and this confusion. 
So it's not really intentional. 
And it's very difficult to come out of delusion or ignorance. 
In the same way, it's very difficult when you're meditating to come out of a thought. 
You're spacing out. 
I mean, what allows you to stop spacing out when you're spacing out? It's kind of mysterious. 
That's one of the things about meditation. 
Like, how is it that I just woke up and realized, oh, I was thinking? I don't have an answer to that question. 
But the only thing we know in Buddhist terms is that everything comes as the result of some cause. 
So there is a cause for it. 
And so we could go back and say, well, we've developed some amount of mindfulness and concentration, and that allows that to happen. 
And the same can kind of be said about how do we wake up to the fact that we're addicts or alcoholics, that people often say, well, it was just through the grace of God that I didn't do it. 
And I can certainly understand that I feel that way myself. 
But because of that, I really believe in the teachings of Buddhism which say that everything has a cause. 
I'm not willing to accept the idea that some external magical force intervened in my life, because I don't believe in external magical forces. 
So that means that I actually got sober because there were causes for it. 
And so I've kind of gone back and realized that one of the ways that recovery is portrayed, at least in the meetings that I've been in, is one of the ways, is sober good, before sober bad. 
And then I crossed this line, I went from bad to good. 
And there was just this sort of magical thing that happened. 
But again, in Buddhist terms, that's not an acceptable explanation. 
There had to have been something good mixed in with that bad. 
And indeed, I think for most of us, if we go back and look at the whole of our lives, leading up to the time when we came into recovery, when right view revealed itself, when we admitted we were powerless, there were positive things. 
We weren't just horrible people doing stupid, horrible things all the time. 
For most of us, I would say for all of us, there were competing forces within us, good and bad forces competing with us. 
At a certain point, the kind of good finally overcame that negative stuff enough for us to take that step. 
That's important for me, too, in terms of my self-esteem, in terms of how I think about myself. 
Because there is a way in which you can get this very negative feeling about yourself being an addict. 
And God forbid you should slip, then you're bad again. 
I was good for a while, then I went back to being bad. 
And how do I get to be good again? I don't know how, because I'm bad. 
As funny as it sounds, there's some truth to it. 
This is one of the reasons why it can be very hard for people to get sober again after slipping. 
So this waking up, this right view is a moment of insight. 
The word insight in our culture I think is mostly associated with having a good idea, or having a clear idea of something. 
But in the meditation practice that we talk about as mindfulness nowadays is really insight meditation. 
This place is called the Insight Meditation Center, by the way. 
What that insight really is, is not so much a thought, but a realization. 
The first step is a realization. 
It's not, hmm, I just figured out that I'm an alcoholic. 
It isn't quite like that, right? It's like a light goes on. 
And it's a transforming insight, which is the most powerful kind of insight, actually. 
There are insights when you see something, you go, wow, I really get that now. 
But you can't really necessarily change your behavior right away, or maybe at all. 
But it might not be that kind of insight. 
But the insight into addiction is a transforming insight, very powerful. 
And in fact, I would say that it is a spiritual awakening. 
Which, you know, is interesting because at the last step says that having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps. 
Well, I always used to think that that meant you had to go through all 11 steps before that, and then you would have a spiritual awakening. 
But I don't believe that anymore. 
I believe that the first step and every step involves a spiritual awakening. 
And the spiritual awakening of the first step is awakening to your addiction. 
And the transforming insight is that the awakening is not only seeing it, but it's a letting go. 
And that's what the difference between a transforming insight and a regular insight is. 
A transforming insight, there's a complete uprooting, a complete letting go. 
So it's interesting that, you know, this step, you know, many of the steps have controversial words in them. 
And a lot of my work has been around those words. 
And the controversial word in step one is the word powerless, I would say. 
Many people resist this word. 
And there seems, there's a lot of confusion around the word. 
I think there's a lot of misunderstanding of the word. 
That's my opinion, of course. 
So I'd like to talk about the word powerless. 
So first of all, I think it's the wrong word for what they were talking about. 
But I think that one of the things that the people who wrote the 12-step literature were doing were using words that were very powerful and really got your attention. 
And shook you up in a way. 
And also trying to make something succinct so that the steps didn't go on for like 10 or 15 pages. 
You know, they're very, we admitted we were powerless over alcohol. 
And, you know, in a way, you know, so the way that I think they are literally accurate is when they're talking about someone who, once they take a drink, can't control, can't stop necessarily. 
And I wasn't a daily drunk. 
I was a daily drug and alcohol taker. 
But I didn't get drunk every day. 
So I wasn't like totally powerless over alcohol where if I had a sip of alcohol, I just went on a run. 
I was powerless over alcohol in that sometimes I went on a run. 
And sometimes I wouldn't know I was going to. 
And sometimes I wouldn't know. 
And the fact that I didn't know and that I couldn't control it to me means that I didn't have that. 
That's how I define my powerlessness. 
But I think what a more accurate word is control is that I couldn't control alcohol. 
I couldn't control my use of alcohol. 
And that's, you know, I don't mean to open up like a debate about whether that's right or not, but get more at the point that if we're resisting this idea that we have no power, if we can say, well, can you control it? Well, no, I can't control it. 
That doesn't mean I don't have any power. 
Okay, then you can do this step. 
Now this word powerless doesn't really show up in Buddhist teachings, but it's implied in some of the fundamental teachings. 
The Buddha recommended that each day we contemplate the inevitability of change in the form of sickness, old age and death and loss. 
And the fact that these things are inevitable means that we are powerless over them. 
And really if we look at a lot of the key teachings in Buddhism, the teaching on suffering, the teaching on impermanence, these are things that we don't have control over, that in fact have control over us. 
And that's something I'll talk about more in step two and step three. 
But this larger issue, sometimes people say, oh, well, I'm powerless over everything. 
And they kind of go, well, I don't think that's true. 
And that sort of implies a helplessness or no responsibility. 
And that's very much against both Buddhist and 12-step teachings. 
I mean, the 12 steps are very much about being responsible. 
So I think that's really not quite getting it. 
But the thing is, the problem that I think we have as addicts is that we want to control the things that we can't control, but we don't want to be responsible for the things that we're responsible for. 
So we don't want to control the things that we are and do something. 
Acceptance, which is obviously a very important quote in the big book about acceptance, the importance of acceptance, is really key to both accepting our disease and accepting sickness, old age and death, accepting impermanence, accepting suffering, all of that. 
And this is all under this greater realm of powerlessness. 
And the kind of spiritual approach to that is called surrender, just letting go, surrendering to the inevitable, to what is true. 
And so when we sit down to meditate, to get more into the specifics of this practice, one thing we can say about that or one way of describing what we're doing is we're sitting down and just being with the way things are and sitting down with an attitude that I'm going to see if I can be with whatever is without trying to change it, without trying to control it and just be present with it. 
So my responsibility is to try to be present. 
What I don't have control over is thoughts that might come through my mind, the emotions that might come through me, the sensations that might appear in my body, all of that or the noises that come from outside. 
So we're kind of sitting down with an attitude of practicing powerlessness. 
This is in some ways what we are doing in meditation, practicing powerlessness, just saying I'm going to sit here and not try to fix anything and what happens. 
And so practicing powerlessness is also practicing acceptance. 
But again, finding out what can I do something about when Buddhism we talk about right effort. 
So it's not that meditation is a passive activity, anything but. 
It's kind of another one of those mistaken impressions people get. 
Well, you see people sitting so quietly, just sitting still, they're doing nothing. 
But when you sit down and try to do nothing, of course, a lot happens. 
A lot goes on and you have a role in that. 
How to make an effort to stay present. 
How to come back from spacing out. 
How do we do that? Well, what we do is we just over and over every time we notice we're spacing out, we come back over and over. 
And we're gradually training ourselves to just stay, just as Jack cornfield's analogy with the puppy. 
Just bring him back, stay. 
He runs off, bring him back, stay. 
And gradually the puppy learns. 
And our minds are about as smart as a puppy, you know. 
I mean, we're, you know, we're. 
You would think with all our intelligence, we would just be able to say to ourselves once, stay. 
That should be enough. 
But now, in fact, puppies actually learn faster now that I think of it. 
So another aspect of powerlessness that I think is implicit, and I think we kind of all know, but I think it's good to make explicit is what happens before the powerlessness. 
Before, before we succumb to the power of the alcohol and the drugs and sex or the gambling, the food. 
And that is the obsession and the compulsion. 
These are more difficult to manage in some ways than substances because with a substance you can. 
It's very obvious you're picking it up, you know, and you can more easily, if you're not obsessed, not pick it up. 
It's an action. 
Thoughts, as we know, are much harder to control. 
So obsession, I would say is not certainly not original, but obsession is the mind getting caught on an idea and not being able to let go of it. 
And then compulsion is the craving or really the need to act out of that obsession, which is the undeniable need to act out of that obsession. 
So it seems to me that once you get to the level of compulsion, it's really, really tough to turn back. 
That's when you're supposed to call your sponsor, you know, and rarely does it happen. 
So let's go back to obsession. 
Another very tough place to get out of because, as we know, it's very hard to realize that you are thinking when you are caught up in thinking. 
And when you are caught up in that kind of thinking, obsession has the quality, obsessive desire, has the quality of focusing the mind. 
Actually, it's a very concentrated state. 
Unfortunately, it's concentrated on a destructive thing. 
And it has a focus that there's only one thing that I care about. 
There's only one thing I want. 
There's only one thing I'm going to do. 
In fact, it's not even, there's only one thing that I can do. 
That's the feeling with obsession. 
I must do this. 
There's no choice. 
And this is why mindfulness is an antidote. 
Because mindfulness has this quality of opening up our experience to see the whole of a situation and to see that there are choices. 
And immediately with mindfulness, as soon as we're mindful, we go, oh, I can turn left or right. 
I can go straight. 
I can go back. 
I realize that with obsession, it's just I must keep going in this direction. 
And it's interesting that I read an article about, it was actually about when John Kennedy Jr. 
crashed his airplane. 
It was an article about panic in the New Yorker some years ago. 
And it said that in the state of panic, people have, the reason people kind of mess up is that they get focused on one thing. 
They can't think of anything else. 
So someone who's flying a plane will start to think, I've got to pull this lever. 
This is the solution. 
Not realizing, like, no, there's a light flashing over there that's telling you push me, you know, and sorry. 
And that, you know, it just strikes me how similar that is to alcoholic or addictive obsession. 
So there's some kind of connection in there. 
I'm not sure what it is, but panic, you know, panic is a survival mechanism. 
And I think that our addiction is kind of a misguided kind of survival, an attempt at survival. 
It's kind of a really confused reaction to some feeling that we're going to die if we don't do this. 
So as I look at this process of obsession and then compulsion, what my experience is that there are triggers for obsession. 
And that's what the hungry, angry, lonely, tired halt acronym is about. 
It's about things that trigger us for our addiction. 
You know, I get tired and then I start kind of thinking about a nice warm martini or, I don't know, never drank martini. 
A warm martini, that sounds horrible. 
A martini sounds horrible anyway to me, but my mother loved him. 
Maybe that's why it sounds horrible to me. 
But we, you know, our defenses come down when we're tired or we're, you know, lonely and we're trying to fill ourselves up. 
We go to the refrigerator and start, you know, grab the half gallon of ice cream. 
So the halt is supposed to, of course, remind us it's supposed to snap us out of the obsession or is to actually, I think, to help us to avoid the obsession. 
To realize, wow, I'm lonely, I should make a phone call because otherwise I'm going to go in a bad direction. 
But I've found, in my experience, I think most of you will probably agree that there are many other triggers. 
And one of the keys to staying sober and to working with really any kind of destructive behaviors is to avoid the triggers. 
And this is the first aspect of the Buddha's four great efforts. 
The first great effort is to avoid those things that arouse negative mind states. 
And so avoiding triggers is a way to not set off the obsession. 
And this is the place where I think we can actually get some work done. 
I think, as I say, once the obsession starts very hard to get out of that, once you're into the compulsion, you know, it might be a long time to come back until you wake up. 
So I'd like to actually do an exercise around triggers. 
And this will be something we'll do some of the evenings. 
And so I'm going to teach you a little bit more about mindful speaking because I'm going to ask you to talk to each other. 
I'm going to teach you a little bit more about that tonight and then hope that you will remember the basics of it the other nights. 
And I'll remind you, but I'll give more extensive instruction tonight. 
So mindful listening and mindful speaking is the two things that we do. 
Mindful listening is a little easier to explain, probably a little easier to do, although it depends on the individual. 
With mindful listening, you are simply making the person who's speaking to you the object of your meditation. 
Instead of paying attention to your breath, you're paying attention to them and to what they're saying. 
And as you listen to them, you drop anything that interrupts. 
So any thoughts that appear as you're listening, any judgments or comments, sort of your mind going off rehearsing for your turn, just as soon as you notice it, you just drop it and you just come back to listening, just drop it, come back. 
And it's an interesting, that in itself is an interesting process. 
If you haven't done this before, I think you'll find it interesting, if not at least valuable. 
It can be helpful to keep some attention in the body as you're listening and as you're speaking. 
So you can do that in whatever way, you can kind of experiment with that. 
Some people find it helpful to pay attention to their limbs because they're more neutral emotionally. 
Other people rather connect with their emotions and kind of feel the kind of viscera as they're listening, the belly, the chest. 
You might feel your breath as you're listening if that's where you're drawn. 
But having some, grounding some attention in the body kind of just helps you to stay present. 
And you find that there's kind of this spectrum of awareness that you can be quite aware of your body and listen without missing a word. 
In the same way that you can be thinking and listening without missing a word, but it's not with the same depth of hearing. 
So to play with that with your listening, with mindful speaking is more challenging really because the words are kind of the currency of ego. 
So when you open the mouth, ego tends to come out. 
The story, how you want to portray yourself, your memories as you've constructed them, who you want to be, how you want to appear. 
So as much as possible to try to go below that, to go into the heart, the deeper truth. 
And people who are used to sharing in meetings know about this place, about speaking from the heart. 
So you can draw from that kind of depth of honesty and also really trying to stay in your body, so staying present as you're doing it. 
So you're not going too much into the head. 
Some people find it helpful to actually put a hand on their heart as they speak. 
It kind of grounds you and you'll notice that you'll actually speak a little bit differently. 
The Buddhist instructions were to say what is true and what's helpful at the right time. 
And this is the right time, because I'm telling you it is. 
For whatever depth of sharing you want to share. 
Obviously, first of all, I would say please maintain confidentiality. 
And really that should be an agreement amongst us anyway in this group. 
Because by being here, there's kind of an implicit statement that you're in a program and those are supposed to be anonymous. 
So kind of respecting that. 
But to say what is true is that's a very subtle question. 
What is true? How do I know that this is true? What I'm saying? Well, I remember it. 
Well, how do you know that your memories are true? And our language tends to toward kind of making absolute statements like I always do this or I never do that. 
And I should do this. 
I shouldn't do that. 
So really watching just your use of language so that you're being more precise. 
This is a good tool to use just in speech anyway. 
It's a good tool to use for right speech. 
So to modulate your language in the ways that so that you can say it seems like I always or I feel as though I usually or it seems like I should, you know, kind of framing things just so that it's true. 
Well, it seems that way to me because then you're expressing just how you feel. 
You're not saying this is an absolute truth or an absolute fact. 
Finally, about speech to try to pause and wait for the full truth to kind of come up rather than feeling like you've got to speak. 
You're not going to be interrupted because your partner is going to be silent when they're when you're speaking. 
So you can kind of take your time and let the thoughts come up and really just before you speak. 
You always know what you're about to say, even though usually we don't notice that. 
But if you when you slow down a little bit, you realize, oh, the thought is formed in the mind before it's spoken. 
And so in that split second, you can kind of see does this need to be kind of modified. 
And I don't mean editing it for, you know, to make it PG or something, you know, but editing it for, you know, truth. 
So that's a lot. 
And I don't expect you to remember everything I'm saying, but I hope you get the spirit of that. 
And what I'm going to ask you to do in a moment is to pair off. 
And then I'm going to then I'm going to suggest that you talk about what triggers you have either for your identified addiction or for just kind of the negative places that you go. 
They could be emotional states. 
They could be other behaviors that are not identified as addictions or could be identified as addictions. 
But you haven't decided to yet, you know, and to just look at the things that set you off. 
And they could be, you know, what sets you off into anger, what sets you off into sadness, into anxiety. 
But just noticing what are the triggers you have. 
And they could be, you know, the whole range. 
It could be halt. 
They could be many, many different things. 
It could be your mother, you know, could be the weather, you know, it could be the winter, could be a holiday. 
Who knows. 
So any questions before we go into the pairing? What? So I'll I'll ring a bell, but I'm just going to give each person about three or four minutes, probably maybe four or five minutes, but somewhere in there. 
And and each person will. 
So in the beginning, you'll decide who's going to speak first. 
And then I'll ring a bell and then after a few minutes, I'll ring the bell will come to silence and then you just switch roles. 
Yeah. 
And you don't know that's not necessary. 
I mean, I would suggest if we are with your partner that you not do it with them necessarily, you know, you could, but just in terms of kind of making it fresh. 
So but it's OK if you know them. 
Did you have a question back there? OK, well, I'll just say two things. 
One is you don't have to share on any share anything that you're not comfortable with. 
And two, if you don't want to do the exercise, that's fine, but you don't have that doesn't mean you have to leave because it's only going to be about 10 minutes. 
And I'd much prefer that you got to stay for the closing and think as we wrap things up. 
OK, yeah. 
Good. 
So so there's a lot of people in this fall space. 
So I want you to sit very close to your partner so that you don't have to speak too loud. 
If someone is listening, you can you can there are two levels. 
You can do the normal level, which can involve nodding or nonverbal responses, or you can do the upgrade, which involves the not no response at all, which is just a practice. 
It's not something we recommend doing outside of here. 
So so find somebody to work with get close together. 
And I'll ring a bell in about five minutes. 
So if you can wrap that up, that one up. 
Hang on one minute, Jim. 
Thank you. 
So let's just come close your eyes for a moment. 
Take a breath. 
And just notice all the energy that comes from speaking and from listening. 
And this is why we have silent retreats. 
It's very stimulating to talk and to listen. 
And now you'll switch roles. 
The speaker becomes the listener and the listener becomes the speaker and talking about your triggers. 
You can thank your partner and come back into the group. 
Thank you for trying that exercise. 
Any comments or anything anyone would like to share on? Yes. 
Here it comes. 
Three, two, one. 
I think the thing that surprised me is in my ego fashion, I've always thought I was a good listener. 
I was listening. 
I couldn't believe the commentary that I had going and how much I wanted to participate as I was supposed to be listening. 
It was almost talk about a compulsion. 
It was overwhelming and to stay in a place where I was actively listening and not responding, I found really difficult. 
That's seeing the powerlessness. 
That's your first step and that's revealing something to you that you can do something about. 
When you practice this, after a while you get better at it. 
It's really powerful to be able to just drop your thoughts and listen to someone. 
It actually allows our own wisdom to come forth because what that commentary stuff is, again, is our ego wanting to jump in. 
I'm going to tell you my story. 
It covers over the deeper wisdom that's in us that we can share that is valuable to give us feedback in a normal conversation. 
To learn to let go of that surface noise is the way we get to the real wisdom. 
It's a practice. 
Just like any kind of meditation is a practice. 
You have to do it repeatedly to be able to get comfortable with it. 
Thank you for sharing. 
I realized when I was listening to my partner, I always thought that listening would be easier, but it was actually harder for me. 
I'd lick into her eyes and I'd start giggling. 
I'd start thinking crazy things. 
I'm out here trying to listen, but I'm giggling and I'm thinking about my thoughts. 
I'm thinking of commentary. 
Then as I'm talking, I could lick her straight in the eyes and keep on going, and that one was easier for me to talk and lick someone in the eyes and just listen. 
I get kind of all crazy and start thinking. 
It's much like when we sit down to meditate and sometimes we become very self-conscious about the breath, and all of a sudden we find ourselves breathing too deeply or too shallow. 
I think that's just sort of an initial thing of like, this is very unnatural, and your mind does can get like, what am I going to do with this? But yeah, I think it's worth working with and kind of getting through that to the place of really being present there. 
Thank you. 
Did you have something? I think when speaking, one, putting your hand on your heart definitely helps for truth. 
But using the buzzwords, like you said, like I feel like, or I think sometimes I'm this way, really opens up your heart to really speak truly. 
Because when you say it like that, I always say, I always do this way, or I'm always, this is the way I think, and it's so definitive. 
I think when you say it like that, it changes the way that you talk. 
Yeah, and when we use those absolute terms, we are defining ourselves, and we're creating something more solid about who we are, and we're giving ourselves less opportunity for change. 
And so there's a way in which we're then creating our own reality through our word, through our language. 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
I had a question about eye contact. 
I noticed with both myself and my partner that when we were talking, we had a harder time keeping eye contact, and when we were listening, both of us were able to keep eye contact much more easily. 
Do you have a comment about that? Well, I think it's just cultural. 
That's the way we do it in our culture. 
The person who's listening typically just keeps looking at the person. 
The person who's speaking will look away and then look back. 
I'm not sure if it's cultural or whatever. 
I mean, I don't know what they do in other cultures. 
It's the only one I've been in, but I mean, that I've lived in extensively. 
But I think it's just a form, a culturally imposed form. 
I mean, you could interpret it. 
You could say why it's that way, but I'm not sure. 
I don't know how important it is. 
I haven't thought through why that is that way, but I could come up with something for next week if you want. 
I just noticed when I was looking away, it was because I was needing to think. 
And having the eye contact, it almost made it harder to think in my own head. 
There's that self-consciousness there. 
And the person who's listening, if they look away, that's an indication that they're not listening. 
That's how we know they're listening. 
Whereas if somebody's speaking to you, there's words coming out of their mouth, so you know they're speaking to you. 
They don't have to look at you. 
There was a hand up back there. 
Go ahead. 
I noticed it was a lot harder for me when it was my turn to speak. 
And I felt very self-critical that it wasn't making sense. 
And I kept trying to think, is it true? Well, I don't know if it's true. 
I haven't had time to think about if it's true. 
And I just got all caught up. 
I found it much easier when my task was just to be there. 
And when I was having to produce this, I just found it much, much more difficult. 
And I wish I had remembered actually that I had to put my hand on my heart. 
It's like I was really struggling to find something to hold on to. 
Because you said that we sort of know what we were before we actually go to speak. 
I didn't know what I was going to do before I spoke. 
Anyway, that's what I noticed. 
This kind of exercise does, I think, and meditation does this too. 
But this is very in your face. 
It makes you do something slightly unnatural. 
And through doing that, it reveals things about us. 
Like I said about you, about us. 
That we might not see in our normal grooves that we live in. 
So it's an insight practice. 
We get insights about ourselves through this, about our habitual ways of being. 
And when we have insights, then we have the opportunity, if we are mindful, to make choices about that or say, oh, I see that about myself. 
There's different things about those kinds of insights. 
One is that you first have to kind of just see it. 
And we have to accept it too. 
We don't have to, but it's a lot easier if we accept it. 
And then we can say, is there something I can do about this? Not necessarily I need to change. 
Or maybe there's nothing I can do about it. 
Or maybe it's okay. 
I forgive myself for being that way. 
Or maybe I just felt that way right there. 
We don't have to necessarily fix it, but it gives us that opportunity. 
It reveals something to us. 
But then we can say, oh, do I want to do something about this? And what do I need to do? Do I need to accept this? Do I want to change it? And all of that. 
So that's the value of these exercises for us. 
The first effect of it can be, oh my god, I'm so this and I'm so that. 
And it's the same thing that happens when you sit down and try to follow your breath. 
Oh my god, I'm always thinking about shopping or whatever. 
I thought I was so spiritual. 
I mean, I spend a lot of time packing suitcases in my mind. 
Because I travel a lot. 
And that's the one thing. 
When you travel, there's not much you can control except what's in your suitcase. 
So that's my reaction. 
Oh, that T-shirt. 
No, I'm not sure that one. 
You only have room for two T-shirts. 
What if it gets cold? Maybe I should get a long sleep. 
And it's like, wow. 
I haven't done much about that in terms of insight, but I haven't had a transformative insight. 
Unfortunately, I've just had the insight. 
So I really want to end on time, which means we're going to have to end in, well, now. 
So just two things before we close. 
One is I want to let you know, I just opened up my notes and realized, oh, there's a nice thing. 
I have one of these flyers. 
I'm teaching a seven day Dharma of recovery retreat at Spirit Rock at the end of this month with John Travis and Heather Sundberg. 
It'd be a pretty great retreat. 
It'll be the first time at Spirit Rock. 
Well, no, Noah Levine taught a similar retreat last year, but this will be the first time they've had me do it. 
They've had Upgrade. 
Noah is a good friend of mine. 
So if you're interested in that, there's one flyer. 
Of course, it's on Spirit Rock's website and there may be some flyers here. 
I don't know. 
And the other thing is I want to give you some homework so that you know that you're taking a class. 
Absolutely. 
You can give yourself all the credit you want. 
Self-accrediting. 
Self-accredited. 
But since there's no self, you're in trouble anyway. 
So we will start to look at, we'll get into step two and step three next week and what I'd like you to just contemplate this week. 
Sometimes I do it as an exercise and maybe we will do it as an exercise, but if not, you will have already contemplated it. 
Your spiritual history. 
So step two says we came to believe that a power greater than ourselves. 
So what are the things that led you up to right now in your beliefs? What are your beliefs now and how did you get here? So that can involve looking back over your life. 
And you can write it down. 
That's one way to do it. 
If you want to do that, you can share it with someone. 
You want to just think about it when you're driving or whatever. 
And kind of go through your life. 
The major stages of spiritual or non-spiritual experiences and things that kind of shaped you. 
And the purpose of that is to kind of see how conditioned our beliefs are. 
We think of our beliefs as being true. 
That's why we believe them. 
But when we see that they're conditioned, we realize that they're just thoughts. 
So to look at that, if you so choose. 
So let's just do a moment of offering merit. 
This is the way that we give away the work we do in Buddhist practice. 
We've made the work we've done tonight trying to penetrate to the truth. 
Trying to cultivate mindfulness and compassion and wisdom. 
May this work be of benefit to all beings. 
May all beings be free from addiction and the obsession and compulsion to act on addiction. 
May all beings be free from suffering. 
May all beings experience the joy of liberating insight. 
Thank you, and I hope you will all come back next week.
