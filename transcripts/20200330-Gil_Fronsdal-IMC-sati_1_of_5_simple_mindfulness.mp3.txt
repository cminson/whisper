Sati (1 of 5) Simple Mindfulness  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

Good morning. Thank you for the sitting together and 
for this opportunity to share with you a little about the 
Dharma. Today begins the third week of a five -part 
series on the Five Faculties  – the five capacities or 
abilities we all have. These are so special in Buddhism 
that they are called the five indriyas, translated as 
“divine qualities .” It’s nice that we have these divine 
qualities inside ourselves.  
 
Today’s faculty emphasizes mindfulne ss: sati. The first 
thing to appreciate is that sati – as awareness or 
mindfulness – is a faculty, a functioning ability of the 
mind or inner life. It’s important to say that because , 
distinct from mindfulness as a faculty, there is also 
mindfulness practi ce. Mindfulness practice takes the 
faculty we have – the simple capacity for awareness – 
and unites it with other supportive factors. The faculty of 
mindfulness itself then grows , develops , and gets 
stronger.  
 
Classically , sati is connected to ardency and clear 
comprehension. There is a certain kind of enthusiasm for being aware. We use awareness to clearly 
recognize what is happening in the present moment. 
That recognizing or clear comprehension then is the 
feedback loop that sup ports more awareness . It 
supports the  growth , stability , and strengthening of 
mindfulness .  
 
But in and of itself, sati is the basic human capacity for 
attention, for awareness. We are using this very basic 
capacity we all have , and we are developing and 
strengthening it  – highlighting it, purifying it, clarifying it, 
letting it become broader, letting it become a basis of 
trust, a place of rest, a place of abiding in the field of 
awareness.  
 
We begin with the very simple act of just being aware , 
and then as the practice deepens, the simple thing 
remains simple – but it becomes more and more 
powerful, unique, and special  – more and more a 
treasure. For the uninitiated, it might seem that being 
aware of things is boring, nothing special.  
 
But as mindfulness keeps growing and developing, it 
becomes quite special, quite wonderful. I just delight in 
having spent my adult lifetime  exploring, developing, 
playing, and struggling with awareness and mindfulness  
– exploring the ins and outs, and  all th at is revealed and 
clarified  – all of the challenges it exposes , the parts of 
myself that need more work or attention  – or places I get caught , or places I can become free.  I can’t imagine 
ever coming to a time when I no longer want to be 
mindful. It’s one of the best things going. I trust 
mindfulness so much. Life seems to go so much better 
with mindfulness.  
 
In the teachings of the Buddha, he often begins his 
instructions on developing mindfulness and awareness 
with the simple instruction to establish mindfu lness to 
the forefront. Establish oneself in the present moment 
with attention. To do that uses the support of the first 
two faculties, which we have talked about over the last 
two weeks. There is faith or confidence that it’s 
worthwhile. There is trust th at it’s worthwhile to be in the 
present moment with an awareness that keeps coming 
back to the present.  
 
Then there is initiating effort. Many times in life, either 
because we are a beginner in practice , or because 
we’ve been involved with many concerns, it’s not so 
easy to be rooted in the present moment. So , we begin 
exploring how we can arrive in the present. This arrival 
in the present is kind of synonymous with becoming 
aware in a more sustained way. When we are keenly 
aware, we are aware of what is h appening in the 
present.  
 
If we are really in the present moment, then chances 
are there is a fair amount of awareness and attention , especially if we are at rest  in the present moment . If we 
have a sense of ease and well -being, then the ability to 
be awa re is just a natural functioning of the mind.  
 
Initiating and establishing mindfulness has a number of 
supportive features. One is to be intentional about it 
with a sense of , “This is what I want to do. This is what I 
am committed or devoted to doing. ” It has become 
really clear that to be present with awareness in the 
present is what I am going to try to do. I trust that more 
than being swept away in thoughts , concerns , feelings, 
and activities . There’s n othing is wrong with thoughts , 
feelings , and activities – but when we are doing 
mindfulness meditation, we are cultivating the capacity 
to be in the present moment.  
 
Then, it’s supportive to do something that is a little bit of 
a ritual of arriving. Here I am. Classically in Buddhism , 
there are  people who chant the refuges  or the precepts , 
as a way of bringing forth their intention or sense of 
purpose. Going through a ritual pulls them into the 
present moment. It takes intention to chant. For a 
number of years, I would do some walking meditation  
before the sitting meditation. That little bit of walking 
was like a ritual of being in my body, getting settled, 
letting go of the things of the day . Then I would go and 
sit down with a clearer sense of presence.  
 
If you have an altar, you may bow to the altar before you sit. You might go and look out of the window , or go 
and have a cup of tea first , or go for a walk around the 
block. Shift things a little bit , so that you aren’t rushing 
along in daily life and then plopping down to sit.  
 
It could be that when you first sit down, you are not 
going to hurry  to start being present . You might use 
deep breathing , movements of your body, rocking back 
and forth  – something to remind you  of arriving here, 
being here. So, in tentionality, a little ritual, the process 
of arriving, giving yourself time to arrive can be 
supportive.  
 
Then, awareness practice is helped a lot by relaxation. 
Not too much, but j ust some relaxing. Relax the 
tensions of the body  – that which is easy to relax and 
soften. Some parts of the body  you may not be able to 
relax , but there can be a softening.  
 
And also softening the mind. I talk a lot about the 
thinking muscle. What I mean by that is the tension, the 
pressure, hardness, pulling, contractions, or swirling 
energy connected to thinking. Sometimes that energy 
around thinking needs to relax. If we don’t  do this , if the 
mind just keeps  being tense and pressured – no matter 
how much we let go of our thoughts, we’ll just keep 
pumping up more.  
 
It’s like a tube of  toothpaste. You can keep wiping off the toothpaste , but if you keep squeezing , it will keep 
coming out. You have to stop squee zing the tube to 
stop the tooth paste from coming out. S o, soften the 
thinking muscle.  
 
Then, the next thing about initiating mindfulness and 
establishing mindfulness here is to remember that 
mindfulness i s very, very simple. If it’s not simple, it 
probably  isn’t mindfulness. It’s a simple recognition and 
awareness  of the present moment. Just this. Just this. 
Sometimes , I’ll actually use the phrase, “Just this ,” to 
remind myself of the simplicity. Just be present for this. 
Just be aware of this.  
 
Sometimes I use the word here for this initiating 
mindfulness. I just say here in a very kind way. H -E-R-
E. It is a way of opening my attention to recognize what 
is here , without any preference for one thing over 
another. Just whatever is happening here. If it’s a busy 
mind, then I recognize a busy mind. If there are a lot of 
sounds, then there are a lot of sounds. If there are a lot  
of body sensation s, then here are sensa tions. If I’m 
tired, then here is tiredness. Nothing more complicated 
than that. I’ll just do this in a nice rhythm. Here. Just 
this.  
 
It’s a way for me to settle in and arrive, beginning to let 
go of the energy and focus on thoughts , ideas, 
concerns, pas t, future. Rather than fueling those by staying involved with them , the energy – the fuel of 
attention – begins going someplace  in the present 
moment, in the simplicity of Here. Mindfulness in its 
simplest form is just being aware , and then discovering 
what is here. Being more connected  and aware of 
what’s here . Not having a sharp line between inside and 
outside , especially in mindfulness of daily life. But to be 
relaxed and open , and just be established here. To be 
established here with mindfulness in the forefront.  
 
I understand this to mean mindfulness in the center of it 
all. It’s where we abide  – established here and now. As 
that initiating effort begins to take root, then mi ndfulness 
begins to have other capacities. Mindfulness practice 
has a chance to come into play where the practice of 
mindfulness is not just the awareness , but it bring s in 
associated mental qualities that begin to enhance th e 
capacity for awareness.  
 
I hope you will spend this next day being curious , and 
interested in the nature of your awareness , and how 
simple it is. See what happens when you stay very 
simple , and recognize “Oh, this is what is happening 
now. ” Establishing mindfulness throughout the day .  
 
Thank you for being here, and I look forward to sharing 
more of this with you tomorrow.
