 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. According. So welcome, welcome everybody. Nice to see you all. So in some of the happy hours I've been doing, I've been introducing this new phrase for the difficult people that I've been appreciating. And we've kind of been exploring whether to use this alternative phrase for everybody or when they use it in certain situations. So that is if you haven't been for the last three times I've been teaching for difficult individuals. And I've been suggesting this phrase that I got from Tinistro Biku. That is this phrase of, may you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. And I think that's a shift from what is the conflict the classic ones Sharon Salzberg often says, says these phrases where Nikki and I got them I don't know if Nikki's kind of drifted away from them but initially we were based this on Sharon Salzberg work with the people that were there and they said, say, May you be happy. May you be healthy and may you live with ease. And of course there's a big difference between the tone, what's being pointed to, and these two different sets of phrases. First of all, it's really helpful to find phrases that resonate for us. So I'm offering these two different sets. But they are of course you're welcome to modify them to find words that I like this word resonates that vibrate or seem like something you can get behind that you don't have hesitation. But some guidelines if you do want to modify them phrases should be simple. They should be clear, you know, not complicated or convoluted. Have some kindness in them of course, maybe that goes without saying, and also have some authenticity behind them. Authenticity being that you are have some like sincerely wishing this for another or for yourself, which isn't the same, the same that you are having that emotion at that moment, like that you're that you're completely behind authentically at that. I'm using this word authentically there but the sense of maybe I'll back up and I'll say it this way. We're not using the phrases to make a particular emotional state arise in ourselves. The purpose of practice is not to make some emotional state arise where it's to support the cultivation of goodwill is to support the cultivation of loving kindness or whatever word you want to use from Matta. Benevolence goodwill kindness care. But the, if we have this idea that we have to have this particular emotion that then you know we were most often, very often feel frustrated, or will feel like it's not working or something like this. So instead, just this recognition that there may be some dryness there may be some sometimes in which it feels a little bit stiff, I like this word dry feels, there isn't some juiciness behind it there isn't some a lot of emotionality behind it. And that's okay. If we could always manufacture some particular emotion we would not need to be cultivating loving kindness, you're not to have this practice we would just bring to mind, may you be happy and then we would just have this feeling of wishing them to be happy. And instead there's this, you know, maybe a respect and a care for the neuroplasticity of the mind. That is, that which we think often becomes a little bit easier to access in our minds and in our hearts and that's whether all the good things as well as all the bad things that we often think about. So, the phrases you're welcome to modify them encouragement to keep them simple and clear, you know, not too complicated and not too specific if they can be a little bit more generalized, maybe happy, as opposed to, may you get good news from the doctor next Wednesday at three o'clock and if that doesn't happen, may you have this, you know, that tends to get too much and just thinking thinking, but we're trying to kind of like allow the kind of thinking mind just to drop in and support kind of the heart and maybe there's a somatic element to this, an opening or free a sense of spaciousness. And maybe something else I'll say about the phrases is that they begin with, may you. And maybe this sounds like a request we would perhaps might use the same language for that or maybe even a supplication. But it's the phrases, they're not so much about wishing, you know, just having a good wishes. It's more about using language that is make space for things to unfold it makes space for some unlocking some awakening maybe have some goodwill that's already in our hearts but we're making room for it. So we're trying to like have an attitude or encourage some loving kindness. So maybe there's some language for you maybe this language of may you doesn't work for you. So there's a real encouragement to investigate. And then there's a little bit of a sense of what that is. So the encouragement is to find some words that you can feel comfortable enough. And it might be that as you're practicing it just naturally happens that an alternative word arises. So, just an encouragement to miss your own practice, of course, so all of us have our own histories with different words. And some of us are maybe more inclined to investigate investigate and try to figure out how it's perfect. So watch if you have those kind of tendencies. So with these all kind of caveats and guidelines maybe just an invitation to make this practice your own. And I'll continue using these phrases. And maybe you'll be modifying for yourself. And the last thing I'll say is that sometimes we might fall into thinking like oh there's something magical about these particular phrases. I think if it's not so much magic, it's more about what allows the heart to soften to open to relax. And if it's not magic I would say that's what it is. It's that which allows the softening is easing, opening, that kind of thing, rather than particular words. Okay, so with that as an introduction. Let's do a little bit of practice. Taking another and comfortable practice, sorry posture. And just feeling into the posture. What does it feel like to be the body in this particular formation at this particular time. Maybe tuning in to where the body meets the chair and the cushion, feeling that pressure. Tuning into where the feet are touching the ground or the zabutan or whatever it might be. Feeling grounded, feeling connected. And tuning into the sensations of breathing. The stretching, the release of the stretch, the movements of the chest or the belly, maybe the sensations of the nose. Tuning into this body is breathing at this time. Okay. Tuning into the in breaths. Noticing the beginning, middle and... Tuning into the out breath. Noticing the beginning, middle and end of the exhales. And then to start our loving kindness practice, starting where it's easy with a lovable being. Just bringing to mind the lovable being, whether it's an imaginary one or somebody you know or somebody you know about. When you connect with this lovable being, visually bringing them to mind, imagining them, or collecting them perhaps. And then to support our cultivating loving kindness, you can say these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Thank you. Thank you. May you be safe. May you be healthy. And then, which is... Can you connect with this lovable being in a way that's supportive for you without straining or struggling, or struggling, but to connect in a soft, gentle way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then to extend our loving kindness to ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. Connecting to our sense of self, whether it's visually bringing to mind a photograph we've seen of ourselves or maybe our self view on Zoom. Or maybe the photo we've seen in a time when we were really happy, no matter what age we were in the photo. Maybe connecting with the felt experience, the bodily experience of this moment. Whatever feels the most supportive or culturally loving kindness. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. And then can we extend it to somebody we don't know. A neutral person somebody we don't have any particular feelings about. Somebody on this Zoom call that you don't know. Somebody you see in the neighborhood occasionally. Maybe for this person, we'll use a different phrase. Understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. Or you can use the phrases we were using earlier. Sometimes it's difficult to connect. A neutral person might take a little bit more effort. Or you can use the phrase you understand the causes of true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. Or you can use the phrase you understand the causes of true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. And then can we extend this to a troubling person or somebody who's a little bit difficult for us but not the most difficult person. Be a bothersome person. Bringing them to mind. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. May you understand the causes for true happiness and be willing and able to act on those causes. True happiness cannot involve harming others. So wishing the difficult person to know the causes for true happiness. And to be able and willing to act on those causes. Thank you. We'll linger here just a little bit longer with a mildly difficult person. If it feels appropriate, maybe a little somebody who's more difficult but no pressure. There is no timeline. We're not in any hurry. And if it feels too much of a strain, you're always welcome to go back to the lovable being and soak. And where it's easier, be nourished, supported, roll around in. That feeling, that's always an option. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To this idea of the phrases, we can make them work for us in a way that supports us and maybe in a way that doesn't cause struggle or strife or problems. So maybe some of you have already adopted some of the phrases or changed some of the words. And then as I'm teaching these days is to use different phrases for different people and maybe it's maybe that feels too complicated and it's better to just keep it simple same phrases for everybody. Maybe you feel like you need some support for these other, the neutral person, the difficult person and to switch the words feels like you can show up for that. So, they'll be different for different people. And maybe they'll be different times in your practice when it feels different also. Like one way may work for a while and then another way would be better. So, just an encouragement. Maybe you can share and talk about this, these ideas with others about modifying the phrases or whether or not to use the same phrases for all categories or people. It can be helpful to hear some of other people's ideas and to learn from them. So I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms where you'll have an opportunity to talk about this. There's groups of three or four and describe maybe this experience of just this last meditation that we did, or maybe share something that's worked for you or whatever you think might be helpful. So, without giving advice to each other. The last thing we want to be doing is like, we don't want to be hearing advice right none of us has to be fixed or needs to hear anything right but you might share like what has worked for us, or something. And if you know that that type of an approach. So, let's see here. Okay, okay. So, it's helpful to just say one thing and then go to the next person and they say one thing and then goes to the next person. And that way, you know, kind of the introverts and the extroverts all everybody gets a chance to speak and can kind of like learn from one another and maybe create something together, allowing yourself to be influenced by what you hear. And let's go in the order of the last digit of your phone number. So, if your last digit of your phone number is zero, you would go first. Okay, here we go. Okay, welcome back. Welcome back everybody. There any comments or questions. Yes, Jesse. I appreciate you talking about phrases in general today, and I just had some kind of trivia questions I may be curious about your thoughts but yesterday Dan or Nikki was talking about the importance of safety. So, I was wondering, well why not just use one phrase, may I be safe. My question would be, do you have any thoughts on why we use four phrases, or that's generally taught that way versus maybe three phrases or five phrases. And then, you know, what about just saying, may I be safe over and over again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, there's nothing magical about for. Why not just do why safe just the recognition you may be safe and that you may be miserable. You may be in a bunker or something like this with sterilized food or I don't know what it is exactly right but you may be miserable so just this recognition of that there's more to one's life but we do put safe as the very first phrase this recognition that it's safe. It's hard. Everything else is hard that healthy happy and having ease is more difficult. And then, why we talked about healthy and happy. Another way to understand that is to like bodily well being and mental well being are kind of like the two general categories or what we're are being pointed to there. And then the fourth one, may you live with ease. I'm often entering that like without oppression, you know, without some like being without these terrible social injustices or things like this right is just some bigger aspects of one's life so that's why we have these four just acknowledge the different aspects of our lives, but there's just doesn't need to be four it could just be one, but I just like how we're using just one phrase for the difficult person when I'm saying may you understand the causes of true happiness and be willing to, that's just you know one phrase so if you feel like that's sufficient and resonates with you, then you can do that. I guess maybe I'll just say I was trained with four phrases and so for me that's kind of what feels comfortable and that's why brother why I'm teaching it with four phrases. This does that answer your questions Jesse. Yeah, that's really helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Marie Christine. But it could also be, you know, when we say may you be happy you may like, don't, you know, get your life together that you're not happy I don't know right there. Yeah, I found it easier for change causes to the nature of happiness. Nice. Nice. Nice. Thank you. Yeah, I think I'm which Mr. Obik helping people understand that they can make themselves happy when I say making people understand I mean, both the person who's wishing this for them. And the difficult person quote unquote just everybody understanding that, you know, just because we wish people to be happy doesn't mean they are going to be happy but if people understand what makes them happy, then it enables them to take responsibility and to hopefully do what they are able to do to be happy but I appreciate Marie Christine this this kind of final better attitude. Yeah, I can see that might sneak in there. So we're two minutes after I'm happy to stay and I will stay but I'm just acknowledging that. After Jamie Oh Jamie. I still here. Yes, do you want to ask your question. I didn't know the time. It's okay. And Bob, would you do you have a question you'd like to ask. Can you unmute yourself please. Yeah, so you know you're still muted right. There we go. I got it. I got it. Man, sometimes this phone doesn't work very well. So, I think your point about not getting put off by the words, but using the words that you might find more palatable, or the intention maybe, maybe the intention will kind of guide you through that part so that the words don't become a hindrance. And so I, I was struggling with that. I've been struggling with that for, for many times that my practice meta. I'm beginning to understand that the intentions don't have to necessarily have the words attached but the words are helpful and can be helpful. And so, um, I just think keeping an eye on that is good. Thank you. Thank you for bringing in this word intentions. Yeah, it's all it's really kind of to support our intentions. And our intentions are right to cultivate loving kindness, as well as, you know, to kind of open our hearts and have some goodwill. And just like with my philosophy breathing and the mind wanders we just come back to the breath, and we just do this however many times we have to. The same way using the phrases is a way which we come back to our intention, when we are find ourselves drifting with the phrases helps us to come back. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So, thank you all. And if you like we can unmute and say goodbye. Thank you. Bye bye.
