 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodharma.org. Greetings, friends. Greetings from wherever in the world you're joining. So today we come to the fifth and final day of our exploration of the Satipatthana Sutta's refrain together. And the refrain, the part that we have come to today is really the last part, the last sentence, the last couple of sentences. And I'll review the entire refrain at the end, the Dharmet, but maybe what I will read is just the refrain, the last part we're exploring today, which is, one abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how in regard to the body, one contemplates the body. But really the sentence here is one abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world, two aspects here, abiding independently and not clinging to anything in the world. So the different aspects that we have practiced and mentioned culminate to this internal, external, contemplating the body internally, externally, both internally and externally, as well as contemplating the nature of arising and passing away, knowing that there is a body, this lexical use, the skillful use of lexical noting, there is a body, there is a body. All culminating to abiding independently, independently, not clinging to anything in the world. So, so without further ado, let's practice in meditation together because life can be practiced or a practice can be practicing right now, listening and sitting with kindness and awareness. So not to make practice only limited to closing our eyes and meditating, but let's meditate together. Let's meditate together. So arriving, arriving in our seat, arriving here. Letting go, letting go, not clinging to anything in the world, letting go in this moment in time. Not clinging, not clinging to thoughts, not clinging to memories of the past, our preoccupations with the future. Not even clinging to the present. As the sitta says, not clinging to anything in the world. You are not clinging to anything in the world. You are not clinging to anything in the world. You are not clinging to anything in the world. You are not clinging to anything in the world. As entanglements perhaps arise, not clinging, releasing. Abiding, abiding independently, abiding. Can there be a moment of spaciousness? Not needing, not needing anything, not lusting after this or that or wanting any particular experience. Abiding, abiding independently, not clinging to anything in the entire world. You are not clinging to anything in the world. You are not clinging to anything in the world. You are not clinging to anything in the world. You are not clinging to anything in the world. You are not clinging to anything. See if this sentence, this phrase from the refrain of the Satipatthana Sutta, as you drop it into your body, not thinking about it, don't try to analyze, but drop it in. Let it resonate, let it open up, let it enter your heart. I, for one, have fallen in love with this sentence, with this phrase as an instruction, abiding independently, not clinging to anything in the world. One abides independence, not clinging to anything in the world. So much ease, so much freedom is possible. One abides independence, not clinging to anything in the world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. One abides independence, not clinging to anything in the world. Drop it into your heart, let it resonate, find its way through you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He doesn't know that Arabic. Agreed. Amazing. If anyone's. in the mind. Not clinging. Independent of Brudges independent of greed, hatred, abiding independently. Of the usual habit patterns of the mind and heart, can we abide independently, independent of those? How do we bring this practice period together, giving thanks, giving thanks for this opportunity, this privilege to come together, if not in space but in time, to cultivate to cultivate our hearts, our minds, in kindness, in goodwill, in wisdom, in non-reactivity, in letting go, in non-clinging to greed and hatred, to give thanks for this opportunity that we have come together, even if for a moment there was a sense of independence from the typical patterns, if there was a moment of freedom, a moment of letting go, peace, ease, celebrating that moment, and even if it wasn't that moment, whether there was a lot of delusion, confusion, trusting we have planted seeds that will flower in the future, if we align our intention with goodness and offering this collective cultivation, no matter how shoddy we deem it to be, offering the goodness of ourselves together with the community, offering it to the world, to others as a gift. Here, I've done my best. If I could have done any better or differently, I would have. Here's the best offering I have in this limited time on Earth, my best offering, and sharing, giving generously this gift for the benefit of all beings everywhere, especially those in war zones. Giving witness, wishing safety and ease for all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
