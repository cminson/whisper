 So, what I'd like to talk about today is a description or discussion of one of the more important discourses of the Buddha called the Anapana Sati Sutta. Sutta means discourse, Sati means mindfulness, and Anapana means breathing in and out. So it's the discourse, the Buddha's discourse on mindfulness of breathing in and out. In the tradition of mindfulness that our center comes from, it's mostly from the Burmese tradition which the primary foundation of background for the kind of practice is a different discourse of the Buddha called the Discourse in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And that's basically what I teach and some little variations of it, but that's kind of the background for it is that discourse. And there's no other, a whole other way of practicing mindfulness taught by the Buddha that's offered through this discourse called the Anapana Sati Sutta. And there are some teachers who emphasize this technique as being, you know, their specialty and what they offer. The great forest teacher, Buddha Dasa, who died a few years ago, that was his primary practice was doing this Anapana Sati. And then of course, Buddhists, to some degree, I don't know if they love, but they end up often being in conflict with each other in my way is better than your way and this way and all that. And it's quite lovely that in the discourse itself, in the Anapana Sati Sutta discourse, after it describes the practice of mindfulness of breathing, it then offers a wonderful way of just understanding how the two different practices are harmonized, how they work together, how by doing the breath meditation practice, you're actually fulfilling the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. So right at the very beginning, there's an attempt to harmonize the differences. I love it. So breath meditation is very important in Buddhism. Almost all forms of meditative Buddhism emphasize, have some emphasis on breath meditation. My teacher in Japan said that all of Buddhism can be fulfilled through meditating on the breath. And in fact, if you read the Anapana Sati Sutta, it says the same, basically says the same thing, that the whole path of Buddhism right up to enlightenment can be fulfilled through emphasizing the breath, making the breath a primary focus on what's meditative practice. And then the discourse then describes how you would use the breath, how it would work with the breath in order for it to have that kind of great benefit. The discourse starts out with the context for which the Buddha is going to give his teachings. And the context is quite beautiful, I think. And the Buddha is staying outside of Varanasi in India in a palace park that he was given. And he was given this palace, Mhigara's mother's palace, it says. And that became the monastery for him and his monastics. And he was staying there. And there were a lot of monastics around him. It was an occasion where a lot of his senior disciples had gathered around him and were there also. And you can imagine the Buddha kind of sitting there in his grounds. And then there was around him and orbiting around him a sense with some of his senior disciples who were already enlightened and practiced a lot. And they had their disciples around them. So you have this circle of, and what he had with the describes in the discourse is that the Buddha then, around the Buddha, all his senior disciples were teaching their students. And some of them were teaching five students, some were teaching 10, and some were teaching 30. And you had these orbits of, you know, kind of around. And mostly the Buddha didn't teach, it seems. He just, I don't know what Buddha does usually when other people teach. But he was, it was wonderful, he was relying on his disciples to do the teaching. But then on the full moon, they had a gathering. And they met outside, the Buddha sat under a tree, and they met outside. And all the monastics there came together. And the Buddha said, this is great. It's really wonderful to have all these people together and practicing. And I'm very pleased with this practice they're doing. I'm very pleased with the practice and the progress all these different monastics are making in their spiritual life. And this is great. And I decided to stay here one more month in this location. That news spread through the countryside. And more of the Buddha's disciples, the monastic disciples, gathered then outside of Aranasi in this Megara's mother's palace, this monastery. And during that month to be there, and there was even more teaching activity. It was kind of these feelings, teaching factory, they're going on. And as people were teaching, people were practicing. After a month, the Buddha gathers his disciples one more time, this full moon again, which is just traditional time for everybody to gather, all the monastics to gather together. And he says, how pleased he is. And he says, in this assembly, there is no idle chatter. There's no idle prattle. I love that little description. There's no idle chatter. And sometimes I get a feeling there's a little bit too much idle chatter. But nothing wrong with idle chatter, perhaps. But sometimes you get this kind of gathering of people that are quite intent in a beautiful way, quite engaged in some sincere endeavor. And that's kind of like their focus is on this serious endeavor. And they're not kind of being distracted by a lot of idle talk. So it's not idle chatter. It's kind of an intentness in the group, intentness in the practice and what they're doing. And he says again, how pleased he is with how it's going. And he describes the assembly. Here in this assembly, there's a certain number of people who are fully enlightened. And here in the assembly, there's people who have attained different stages of enlightenment, different stages of spiritual maturity. Here in this assembly, there are people who are practicing the four foundations of mindfulness. Here in this assembly, there are people who are practicing the seven factors of awakening. Here in this assembly, there are people who are practicing loving kindness meditation. There are those who are practicing sympathetic joy. Those are practicing compassion. Those who are practicing equanimity. And he goes through a whole series of practices that the people are doing in that monastery. And I love this description because it describes how at the time of the Buddha, there was this diversity of practices that people are doing, even in his presence. You find in history of Buddhism, teachers will emphasize this is the true way, this is the one way, my way, or the highway kind of thing. But right at the beginning, you have this great offering of diversity of practice. And you find other discourses of the Buddha where he describes his great respect for the diversity of people who are in his audience, how different they each are from each other and how they're not expected to be different. It's kind of like people are deeply respected for their differences. And because people are different, in a sense, there's also differences in practices, maybe different phases of their spiritual life or because of different dispositions, there are different practices for people. So he draws it out, lays it out. And then he says, there are some people who are practicing mindfulness of breathing. And let me describe to you now how to practice mindfulness of breathing. And then he's going to describe it. And this is the core of this discourse. And what he describes is kind of like bullet points, a PowerPoint. If the Buddha had PowerPoint, he would be that way. But it's 16 stages, 16 points. And these 16 are divided into four categories. So they're called the four tetraads. And it can seem a bit daunting to hear about 16 stages. It seems like a lot to keep track of. But there is a kind of natural order to this in that as practice deepens, it kind of follows, you know, there's a deepening process that goes on. And that deepening process sometimes has a kind of lawful order, has kind of order it takes. Sometimes people are all over the map and they're jumping around in that order. Sometimes they go backwards. And sometimes it's spiral-like where there's, you know, you go through the 16 in a sense and then you go another, go do it again. Or you go through the first eight and you go back again to the first and do it again. But there's a kind of pattern that's going on there. Some teachers will emphasize, be very careful and practice the first one really thoroughly, maybe spend months, you know, on one, the first and then do the months in the second or go on retreat and spend days on the first and days on the second and kind of go through systematically until you come to the 16. There are different ways of doing it. It can be understood as being going from coarse to refined and that's the pattern. It's kind of like if you're using sandpaper and your wood is really rough. At first you need to use really coarse sandpaper to make a difference in that coarse wood. But at some point you're not going to get the wood any more smooth from the coarse sandpaper and you have to let go of that and bring more refined sandpaper. And you use that until you can't get any more benefits from that refined sandpaper. And then you do the next more refined sandpaper and you might go through four or five different grades of sandpaper until finally all you have is you're using a very fine soft piece of cotton cloth in order to kind of just do the last little polish. So same thing with the meditation practice or with the mind, the inner life, is that it goes from the kind of coarse experience as a meditation. And as the meditation deepens you go to more and more refined experiences and then you need to kind of shift the kind of practice you do to correspond with the fineness or the roughness of where you're at at any given time. So the first stage then is very simple. Actually the first two stages maybe should be set together. Sometimes the person understands, discerns, knows that in breathing in a short breath, this is a short breath. In breathing out a long breath, this is a long breath. In breathing out a short breath, knowing they should know it's a short breath. In breathing out a short breath, they should know it's a short breath. In breathing in a long breath, they should know it's a long breath. In breathing out a long breath, they should know they're breathing out a long breath. That is pretty basic, pretty simple. Some people can say, forget this Buddhism, this is too simple. How I understand this is that beginning of practice is you begin tuning in to your breathing and you're asked simply to start noticing what your breath is like, your own breath. You're not asked to change it, you're not asked to judge it, you're not asked to have a better breath. In California, you're supposed to have a long deep breath. No. In certain circles, that's kind of the ideal that people come out and burden themselves with, a certain kind of way of breathing. Forget about it. The instructions is simply pay attention to how your breath, get to know what it's like, become a connoisseur of it. Just get to know it really well. Get to know your breath in different circumstances. Sometimes you'll feel short, sometimes long. Get to know how it is. Study it. Hang out with it. It has two benefits, many benefits. One is that you simply get to know your breath. There's a lot of understanding, a lot of, the breath can reveal so much about our life. Someone told me yesterday that in Taoism, there's an expression that something like, the breath is the bridge between the body and the mind. The breath is a phenomenally sensitive instrument, activity that is affected by the environment, affected by our inner life, by our emotions, by our reactions, by all kinds of things. You can learn a lot by tuning into the breath. For example, for me, sometimes I tune into my breath when I come to a red light. Lo and behold, the way I've been driving has affected my breathing. I take the opportunity of the red light to relax my breath. Usually, I relax my belly because sometimes I drive a little bit, want to get some place, leaning forward, a little bit contracted. When you want to get some place, you check in and you learn. This is shorthand for these first two stages. It's getting to know your breath as it is. For some people, a lot of the benefits from this, the training of it, is simply learning the tremendously powerful art of not judging your breathing, just learning to be with something in a non-evaluative way without criticizing, judging, being embarrassed, being angry, just learning how to be with something in a kind of neutral way. For some people, that's a phenomenally difficult thing to do. It might take a long time in meditation to learn to be with a breath in a friendly, neutral way like that. Being with a breath that way also has the benefit that the breath itself is a calming. All of the breathing is calming, so it tends to bring concentration, calm, ease. The third stage, the language changes. The first two stages, just simply the language is notice. The next one, it says, the monastic trains him or herself. Here a training begins. Earlier, there's kind of a training, but here there's an active training. Now we're getting actively involved in your meditative experience. Before it's kind of a passivity, kind of receiving the breath, being with the breath, knowing how it actually is, learning how to interfere. That is a kind of a training, but it's more of a passive training, getting out of your own way. Now you're asked to kind of be more active. One trains oneself, and one trains oneself in the following way, to become sensitive, the word is sensitive, to one's body. So the first one becomes sensitive to one's breath, and now one trains oneself to become sensitive to tune in to one's bodily experience, the physical experience. It's so important, the body in Buddhist practice, that without really becoming embodied, without learning how to live in your body with your body, being in your lived experience, it's very difficult and not as safe to go into the deeper, more subtle experiences of Buddhist spirituality. Then the next stage of practice is learning to become sensitive to your physical body. Many people are in their heads all the time, or in their activities, and it takes a lot to sometimes people to be in their bodies and notice what's going on. Some kind of slow people, it has to be the red lights. And then, oh, we might as well do something here, I'll pay attention. But in focusing on, especially if you're very busy, or very stressed, busy and stressed with your business, they're not synonymous, not necessarily, but tend to help people be outside their bodies, not in their bodies. So we train ourselves to become sensitive to our body. It's not choice with awareness here, but it's actually choosing to tune in to our body. However, the instructions are a little bit different. Because as the person breathes in, as the person breathes out, one trains oneself to be sensitive to the body. So the person continues being with the breath, breathing in, breathing out, working with the breath, tuning in to the breath, massaging the breath, being massaged by the breath, plunging into the breath, rubbing the breath, surrendering to the breath, abandoning oneself to the breath, becoming one with the breath, just really working with the breath. And then there's kind of like a dual track going on at this point. Multitracking is perfect for Silicon Valley. Buddhist multitracking. And you start tuning in, you start trying to be with your breath, you be with your breath, but then you also at the same time, you become aware of what goes on in your body, you start becoming sensitive to your body. It can be just kind of globally aware of your body. But one way that's very beautiful of combining these two is you become aware of what's called the breath body. The experience of breathing, the physical, how your body does as you breathe is not just move your diaphragm, but there's a kind of a ripple of expansion and contraction of sensations of pressure and release of pressure in much of your body as you breathe. The stiller you get, the more sensitive you become to the body, the more you become aware of how much the simple activity of breathing ripples out in sensations in much of your body. For example, you could be aware not just of your diaphragm or your chest moving, but you can be aware of your belly moving, you can be aware of your back rib cage moving, you can be aware of maybe subtle sensations in the lower back, pressure and release of pressure, you can be aware of your shoulders moving and sometimes a little ripple of sensations going down your arms. Down into the pelvic cavity you can feel alternating pressure sometimes and release of pressure or more weight and less weight. You can feel expansion and contraction there sometimes. You can sometimes feel it going down into your thighs if you're very, very sensitive. People have told me you can feel the breath kind of effecting, kind of ripple throughout your body. I haven't actually experienced it all my body and kind of physically. Sometimes I have the sense of kind of a wave of energy, a wave of something more amorphous that's connected to the breath that kind of travels throughout the body and actually at some point it becomes larger than the body, kind of a presence that expands beyond the physical body and then contracts again. It may be an artifice of the mind that happens, but some sense of energy field or field. In this third stage one becomes aware of sensitive to the body and some teachers emphasize becoming aware of the breath body. Rather than focusing on the breath in one particular place as is sometimes instructed in your belly or in your chest or in your nostrils, you're actually becoming sensitive to the whole experience of your breathing, kind of like a big bellows. It arises and passes. Your whole body is a bellow. The fourth stage is still all the following stages after the first two. It starts off when one trains oneself. So the next one is when one trains oneself while breathing in, while breathing out to relax the bodily formation. So here you're actually being much more active involved. You're actually actively doing something, you begin to relax, calm, what's called the bodily formation. How I understand the bodily formation here is that part of our physical experience in our body which is an artifact of our mind. It's a formation that's formed or created, constructed out of the activities of our minds. You can say it's all activity of the mind, but in short-hand maybe we can say it's the reactive activity of the mind, the egotistical activity of the mind, the self-centered activity of the mind. They're all inadequate ways of talking about it, but that part of the mind where we're reactive and judgmental and criticism and kind of, and you know, we get, for example, that part of the mind, the egotistical part of the mind translates into our body, becoming tense or tight or holding our posture in certain ways. So as we tune in, become sensitive to our body as it is, first you do it non-judgmentally, just being there with the tension, with the body as it is, and you might spend months or a long time just being with it in a non-reactive way to your own, the physical consequences of having been reactive in the past. Just tune into it, be with it. The fourth stage is you begin to relax it. You're like, oh, you relax. You actually take time to relax those tensions in your body. And you can do it systematically, you can do it haphazardly, but you can go through your body and find where the tensions and the holding are and then relax. I find it very useful to do it as I exhale, because exhaling is kind of letting go, but you can actually do it on the in-breath or the out-breath. I find it very helpful for me to relax my belly when I meditate. And I don't carry as much tension there as I used to, but I often find it still valuable to relax. Even when I give Dharma talks, I remind myself sometimes to relax here because as I'm talking I get kind of wound up, whatever. So I relax. And then sometimes I relax my chest or sometimes I can't relax it if I've been stressed for some reason, but as I breathe, I'm aware of the tension there and as I breathe in and the chest expands, I breathe into that tension. It's kind of stretch like a massage from the inside. And that massage going back and forth works that tension, begins to kind of loosen it. Sometimes the shoulders, sometimes tension in the face, in the forehead or the jaws or the cheeks or the eyes, and I kind of just relax it. Sometimes I'm aware of it in my hands or my arms. The more subtle and sensitive you are, the more subtle and sensitive you can tune into the subtle tensions we carry in our body. Sometimes I kind of relax the whole body, kind of treat the whole body as a muscle kind of. Sometimes I relate to my mind, that mind we think is in here, the brain, I relate to the brain as a muscle. And sometimes I feel pressure there and sometimes as I breathe out, I relieve that pressure. So in this kind of training, you're not doing choiceless awareness, you're not allowing things to be, you're not just doing accepting things as they are, which is a very important practice in our tradition. You're actually doing something with the experience, you're relaxing it, calming that bodily formation. That's the first tetrad. The second tetrad begins by as you're breathing out, as you're breathing in, experiencing joy. And so here, becoming sensitive to joy. So here, again, it's not choiceless awareness, you're now instructed to tune in to that part of your experience, which is joyful, if it's there. And if it's not there, then you go back to the first four stages and keep working on the staying with the breath, working the breath, massaging the breath, abandoning yourself with the breath, becoming sensitive to your body, relaxing attention to your body. It's a wonderful feedback loop as you relax your body and you're kind of working the breath, being with a rhythm of breathing, breathing in and breathing out, letting yourself being held by that rhythm, being supported by that rhythm, sooner or later, and later might be much later, you become sensitive to some level of joy in your psychophysical experience. It might be very, very subtle joy. You might actually feel a lot of other things, they're stronger and that's okay. You might feel depressed also, but if you start feeling little inklings of joy, you're instructed to tune in to that joy. It's great for people who are always focusing on the negative. Some people have a magnetic mind to their pain and we need to respect our pain, but to have its magnet is kind of unfortunate. So we're trying to encourage you to then gravitate a little bit towards the joy, to the delight that might be there. As you're working and massaging the breath while you're sensitive to the joy, there can be a feedback loop, by feedback loop, where massaging and working that breath, being with the rhythm of the breath, actually can reinforce or strengthen that joy that you're tuning into. As you tune in to the joy, you realize that that's actually from being concentrated, working with the breath, so it encourages you to work the breath more. It's kind of like shepherding you to stay on the breath. So you work the breath more. It's kind of this wonderful feedback. Because the more you stay with the breath, the more joy you feel, the more you tune into the joy while you're with the breath, the more you can kind of feel more joy. And so sometimes the word here becomes rapture. You can actually feel rapture at this point. Quite strong. Once you've gone through this stage enough, then you go to the sixth stage, where now you tune in to that part of your experience. As you're breathing in, breathing out, you're always being with the rhythm of your breath. You're always staying with that rhythm, working the rhythm. Yours has got rhythm. And then you tune in to happiness. And happiness is considered... It's a little bit hard for some people to distinguish joy from happiness from just the vocabulary of it. But the happiness, this next stage, is to tune in to some kind of happiness which is more sublime than joy. It's always understood to be somewhat energetic compared to what's more sublime or more settled, a form of happiness. So you tune in to that part. The joy might be there, the rapture might be there. But in the corners of it and the cracks of it, you tune in to that part of your experience that's more sublime, more settled. You feel more at home and more comfortable, more comforting. Rapture can be very uncomfortable when it's quite intense. And even if it's not intense, people get into some kind of rapture state and meditation at times. And at first it's like being in... It's like, great, finally, all this huffing and puffing. Finally I experience some reward of all this work. And after a while, feeling this kind of rapture is like, enough already, this is enough. People get tired of rapture, can you believe it? So you tune in to the subtlety of... In a more subtle aspect of what's called happiness. It's more subtle, it tends to be more deeply subtle than the body. Rapture for some people is a little more... It certainly has a strong physical aspect, but it's a little more energized in the mind also. The mind is kind of excited a little bit. The mind gets quieter and still. There's more stillness with happiness. And as you tune into that, the rapture begins to fade away in favor of this more sublime, more satisfying happiness. Still working with a breath, working with a breath. But sensitive to this also, to the happiness. Then the instructions are, working with a breath some more. One trains oneself to become sensitive to the mental formation. Earlier it was the bodily formation. The body is a more coarse experience in the mind. So here it becomes sensitive to... You're very sensitive to what's going on in the mind. The mind, the mental formation. And here I understand the mental formation to be that part of the mind that involves our being actively using our mental faculties. The activity of the mind, again in short 10, inadequately, the egotistical mind, the reactive mind, the thinking mind which is always reacting and planning, or that part of the mind which is involved in perceiving things in funny ways. Perceptive mind, perceiving and judging. Our feelings about how things are, that reactive. Here the instructions are just to tune into this mental formations, the mental activities. Instructions are only tune into it, be sensitive to it. It doesn't say be sensitive to your mind and then beat yourself up for it. Someone said self-knowledge is seldom good news. So sometimes that's the case. So you're not instructed to pay attention to what goes on in the mind and then judge it and be criticized. Actually a beautiful thing is that you start tuning into the subtlety of what goes on in the mind after you experience all this happiness. So you have this background of joy and happiness to do this work. And for people who are obsessed with their difficult negative inner life, sometimes it's kind of like a dead end to do mindfulness practice and just speak if that's where the mind gravitates all the time. Sometimes people should be told to forget about mindfulness, get concentrated first, get some joy going. And once you have some joy going and you're kind of happy, then tune into what's going on in your mind. But that doesn't work for some people. So there's many ways of practicing and listening to this, please don't burden yourself that this has to be the way of practicing. But this is kind of a description and maybe some people, you know, it might be years and years of practice, it's kind of encapsulated in this short little PowerPoint presentation. So you want to tune oneself in, you want to get sensitive to the mental activity, the activity of the mind, what goes on there. The eighth stage is once you become sensitive and establish that sensitivity to the mind, breathing in and breathing out, staying with that rhythm, staying with that, working that breath, keep working on it, trying to get more into the breath, more present for it, and then relaxes, one calms the mental activity. So again, you're doing something here, you're relaxing that activity, all that extra activity, all that preoccupation concern, you begin relaxing the judgments. So see if you can relax it, put it to rest. Not so easy. Sometimes people do psychoanalysis or psychotherapy to help them put certain things to rest. But there's, you know, whatever you can do, you may be in meditation, just put that activity to rest. The ninth stage is now you're still breathing in and out, but you become sensitive to the mind. Now, this is different than the mental formation. The mind, sometimes the rachitta is translated as heart. It's something larger than their mental activity. That part of our psyche, the heart, the mind, the heart-mind, which is larger than the little mental activity we have, the egotistical mind, the big mind, some people call, the clarity of the mind, the luminosity of the mind, sometimes the commentaries we talk about, the nature of the mind, which is bigger than any particular thought we have, ideas we have, reactions we have, we turn into the quality of the mind. And the quality of the mind is something that's very precious. And if you get a sense through meditation or through some other way of how to improve the quality of your mind, then I'd encourage you to safeguard that quality of the mind. It's probably one of the most precious resources you have, is the quality of your own mind and how to work it and take care of it. And so you start tuning into the quality of the mind, the larger field of the mind, what your mind feels like. And there's many different aspects of how the mind feels like. It's a whole exploration in itself. Breathing in and breathing out, you become sensitive to the mind. Breathing in and breathing out, then in the tenth stage, you become sensitive. Let's see. Did pretty well. Up to now. The wording is, one trains oneself, here it's the translation, is satisfying the mind. Breathing in and out. Other translations are gladdening the mind, delighting the mind. And this is not a technical word, the joy and the happiness are technical words in meditation. But this is more in the kind of just generic, just general kind of feeling delight or satisfaction in the mind. Sometimes described as kind of, you had enough benefit, enough success in the practice that you see the practice works. You see the Dharma actually is true. You start learning the quality of the mind, the wonderful, precious resource in your own heart. And you start feeling some delight and satisfaction with this practice, with the Dharma, with yourself, with your own mind, this beautiful part of yourself. So it's kind of, you allow yourself to feel satisfaction or feel delight in the Dharma, in the practice, in yourself, in this inner quality of yourself. So you tune into that part of you and you're allowed to have it, you're allowed to become stronger. The next stage, breathing in and breathing out, is you focus on steadying the mind, concentrating the mind further. And so it's really great that the instructions to really develop deep concentration beyond already the concentration you have, arises out of a field or out of a situation where you're having this delight and joy in the practice and in the Dharma. So you don't want to be ahead of the game and try to kind of in a tight, brittle way, kind of try to get concentrated. You have this softness, relaxed joy, as a foundation for doing a deeper concentration as possible. So you steady the mind, you focus the mind. And here, you might not want to stop doing kind of the breath body, the global body, that's what you're doing. We really take one particular point of focus for the breath. And for me, when I sit, it's often a little spot. I've just been there to put all my navel, my belly button. And it was really wonderful, and my Zen teachers taught me that. And when I went to Burma, my Burmese teacher told me the same place. It was wonderful, kind of. And other teachers' emphasis will tell you to do the nostrils. It's a very traditional place in Buddhism to feel the breath, the sensations of breath going in and out through the nostrils. Other times, people can do the chest. Sometimes I do a little point in my chest. Sometimes it moves around my point. But I stay with a little point. And it's a very small little kind of spot, my little spot. And I just kind of get really still. I can't concentrate. I can hang on to that spot. I can focus on it. I can fixate on it. I massage. I work my spot. I kind of try to develop kind of more one-pointedness on that spot. And it's there with the breathing. And it gets very, very subtle. Sometimes I don't feel any movement of breath at all. So as the breath comes to a stop, it's just a little spot of pressure or sensitivity that I still feel. I work that sensitivity, stay there with it. That's for me. It's different for different people. So in this stage, you're actually working the breath still, but you're trying to steady, stabilize, focus, fixate, to really get a one-pointedness of the mind. The next stage is called still working the breath. You liberate the mind. And it's not completely clear what this means. The commentaries say this means liberating the mind from the hindrances. You start liberating the mind from its clinging. So as the mind gets more concentrated, you liberate, you free the mind from that which keeps it from getting concentrated. The five hindrances are classic obscurations to concentrations. And so you're beginning a sense of the quality of the mind. You just have to delight in the practice. You're starting to focus the mind, concentrate it. Maybe these two stages go hand in hand. As you concentrate more, you're also letting go of the things that get in the way of further concentration. Concentration actually frees the mind. It doesn't limit the mind or tie it down. It actually frees it from the kind of preoccupations it has. It's very hard to free the mind from its preoccupations, especially when you get into the deep depths of the psyche where there's a very subtle attachment to, for example, a sense of self. And so sometimes you need, it's very helpful to get concentrated because concentration is a counter force to the force of preoccupation. So as you get more concentrated, the mind gets more liberated from those forces. As you liberate the mind from those forces, it gets more concentrated. The fifteenth, no, no, no, we're at the thirteenth stage, the last tetrad. And this is where some people say you really come back to Vipassana practice in its most technical definition of Vipassana. And now you start tuning in with the mind concentrated. You tune in to that aspect of your experience which is impermanent, the impermanent, inconstant, changing aspect of experience. In the Burmese tradition that I practiced in, the approach was from the Satipatanasu to the other way of practicing. And there was no attempt to tell you what your experience should be and no attempt to train and try to manipulate your experience or relax it and do anything. There was more choice of awareness and there was more spirit of revelation. As you do the mindfulness practice, you just allow things to reveal themselves. And sometimes the teachers have this attitude that they don't want to tell you anything and what you can expect in practice because of the tremendous power of suggestion. And you know, you kind of get the idea of this is what's supposed to happen and then the mind is so tricky and it'll make, you know, it'll construct it artificially. It's not really going on in practice. Or you're told to experience joy and it's not really deep meditative joy but you kind of just tune in to enjoy and you come back to the teacher and say, oh, I'm at the stage joy. I don't know if that made sense but the power of suggestion. So that's one school is you don't suggest anything. You don't let the students read any of the books. My first teacher I had in Thailand, he had this great big library and all these books in Thai and as Thai people do, they had a big picture of the king in the library and it was a big picture. And behind the picture of the king were all the books in English. And they were being hidden there because they didn't want the Americans to see those books. You know, you'd read them after your practice, after you finished your course of practice, not before. So anyway, but this Anapanasati technique is not this revelatory, just a lot of things that reveal themselves but it's actually, you know, you're actually training yourself in a particular way being directed. So one way is to experience impermanence. The revelatory way is to let impermanence reveal itself in its due course. This way, another way of practicing is some point the teacher will tell you, now tune in to impermanence in your experience. Tune in to that part of your experience which is changing. When you're very deeply concentrated, you'll start experiencing a lot of change in your psychophysical experience. In fact, the argument is that the idea that things are constant, that things are kind of unchanging, you know, even just a matter of one hour or two hours, that things don't change much, is a kind of a misunderstanding of the mind because the mind is experiencing life through its concepts and concepts see things as being constant. But as you get concentrated enough to let go of those kinds of thinking about things, you actually start seeing that things are actually arising and passing very, very fast. You might feel happy. When I was 20, I naively said, I was so blissed out after doing something that I said, I'll never be depressed again. Well, pretty soon I was never as depressed as I'd ever been. I got more depressed than I'd ever been in my life. And I swung. But, you know, you start seeing the momentary arising and passing of things. And so now I realize I've talked late, I'm talking over, and if anybody wants to leave while I'm talking, I'm going to finish this. I'm going to get to the climax. But if you want to, if you need to leave or something, I apologize and you can quietly leave and I'll carry on. So you tune into the impermanent, that changing aspect of your experience. As you do that, you then tune into, you then become sensitive to, let's see what it exactly says, when trains oneself, focusing on dispassion is the word here. Instead of becoming really familiar with the impermanent aspect of experience, one focuses on cultivating dispassion. Dispassion is a word that doesn't work very well in an English audience, for various reasons. I'm going to it now. My preferred word is disenchantment. The literal word in Pali means fading. One focuses on fading, one's clinging to the world of impermanence. So we have these attachments, we have this kind of passionate attachments to things. And as we see the impermanence of stuff, impermanence helps us to begin, soften and lessen, the way we're enchanted with the things of the world. Enchanted is, what's wrong with enchanted, you might say? But the enchanted is to be in a spell. You don't really see things as they actually are when you're enchanted. And Buddhism focuses on becoming free by seeing things in their clarity. So after the experience of impermanence, there's a movement then of the mind, it's not really even a training, to begin fading its clinging, weakening the waning of clinging. So you focus on that waning, that dispassion, movement towards disenchantment. You're still breathing in and out, staying with the rhythm of breathing out. The 15th stage, and these last two stages maybe kind of go hand in hand. As you focus on this dispassion that happens, this fading, this letting go, this softening of your deepest clingings, one or two things can happen. And this is the 15th and 16th stage. On one hand you might see the cessation of your clinging. It might just happen on its own. Things self liberate. Or you focus on relinquishment, letting go. You can see how you let go, how you can let go of something. You see the clinging, you see the last remnants of clinging, oh I'll let go of this. Sometimes you can let go, sometimes all your attempts to let go are hopeless, but the letting go happens by itself, the cessation happens by itself. The deepest enlightenment of Buddhism, most people say, will happen through no will of your own. The cessation happens on its own. The bottom of the bucket just kind of drops and you fall through. But it can happen either way. Focus on relinquishment, relinquishing your clinging, letting go of your clinging. The enlightenment of the Buddha is that freedom that comes when there's every single last remnant of clinging in the heart, shackles of the heart, limitations on the heart, have been released. It's a form of release. So that's the 16 stages of Anapanasati. The discourse then goes on and describes how each of those four tetrads corresponds to each of the four foundations of mindfulness. And then it goes on to describe how if you do these 16 stages, you're also cultivating the seven factors of awakening. So these wonderful lists in Buddhism, they're very important for practitioners, all kind of come together, all kind of get actualized or fulfilled through breathing in, breathing out, breathing in, breathing out, something we all do all the time. And you just work with that. Work with it. You work it, you work it, you hang in there with it. And you keep developing yourself with the breath. The discourse then ends with the following words. That is what the Buddha said. At heart, the monastics delighted in the Buddha's words. So I hope you were delighted. Now, there is some other discourses of the Buddha where the Buddha, it's not like fairy tale where they all lived, they were at labor after these kinds of stories because there's one discourse where at the end of the discourse, the monks and nuns say, the monastics did not delight in the Buddha's words. They were not happy with the news. And this time they were happy. So that is the Anapanasati Suta. And some of you might be interested in pursuing it further. And if you are, I'd be happy to talk with you about it sometime on retreat or one day sitting or some other way. And for some of you, Anapanasati is not your way. And it's more the four foundations of mindfulness way, the usual way that we teach here. And I also delighted to talk with you about that and work with that. Yes. Can you find them written down somewhere? I'll give you this book. Come up here at the end. Actually, these books are available for free. And we have this collection of them here. They're underneath a table. They're not outs. Maybe someone who knows where they are can put them out. They're also in the Bhikkhobodi's translation of the Middle-Length Discourses, which we have in the library, a different translation of it. So Larry Rosenberg has a book called Breath by Breath, which is his Dharma talks on this 16 stages. I was going to mention Larry Rosenberg's book. It's really good. He also has a whole translation of the Sattva Sutra. Yeah. The Buddha Dasa, this wonderful Thai teacher, he has actually two books. One of them maybe. I don't know how easy they are to find. Easy enough? I don't know. But he has Santikaro, who is one of his main American disciples, translated some of this and published it. It's a marvelous little book, except near the end where he comes down, Buddha also comes down, so he's very critical. It always seems to me an uncharacteristic Buddhist way of people who practice mindfulness other ways. It seems odd to me, but Santikaro then explained, oh, he doesn't really mean that. It's just kind of a rhetorical way of saying, you know, get to work, you guys. Amazon has it. Amazon. Because you check Buddha Dasa, it'll come up on Amazon. Great. Enjoy your breathing.
