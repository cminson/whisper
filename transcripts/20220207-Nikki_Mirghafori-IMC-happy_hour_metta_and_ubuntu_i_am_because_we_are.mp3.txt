So hello, formerly hello and welcome to Happy Hour.
Lovely to see you, lovely to be with you.
I have missed you.
Delighted to see you all in the Sangha.
So for our practice for today, I'd like to invite us to sit with and reflect on, and
of course, as always, I'll offer a few words and then a guided meditation on the theme
of interbeing.
So interbeing is one word that the late Thich Nhat Hanh used a lot in his teachings, the
sense of interbeing that our being, that my existence depends on you, depends on so many
causes and conditions.
So it's not as if I'm an independent being going around in the world as we perceive often
or wrongly perceive it to be, it's an interbeing and interconnectedness, interdependence, that
if we stop and pay attention, we get to appreciate, appreciate and really be in awe.
This concept of interbeing is also related to another concept that I want to bring in
tonight, which is the teaching of the concept of Ubuntu, which is, I am because we are,
I am because you are, and the concept of Ubuntu is one from Africa, it's a beautiful concept
in Africa.
And in fact, there are a series of articles that showed up recently on Lion's Roar, the
leading Buddhist magazine, one of the leading Buddhist magazines, and in fact, tell you what,
I will put the pointer to the articles a little later, tell you what, when we come back from,
you don't have to look for them right now, I'll provide them, but the idea here is similarly
is this sense of, I am because you are, and also as in many African countries, it's part
of the greeting, part of the greeting, which is how are you, for example, the question
to how are you, is I am well if you are, I am well if you are, and wow, what a beautiful
way of, yes, my well-being is interdependent with yours.
And another greeting also, as you will see these articles, beautifully talk about the
sense of Ubuntu, I am because we are.
Is this greeting of when people greet each other, now I'm scaping on which country it
was, but I'll remember later.
The greeting is, I see you, and the answer to that is, I am seen, I am seen.
What a beautiful greeting, what a beautiful way to have this sense of, oh yes, my, you
seeing me is dependent on me being seen, is another consciousness that's holding me,
the sense of interbeing, I am because we are sort of the sense of independence that we
often have in the culture, it's in the Zulu culture, thank you now, in the Zulu culture.
So with these as themes, I am because we are, and let's actually think about it, bring it
home.
Right now, I am because we are, I wouldn't be here if you were not here, happy hour.
My being here is dependent on your being here, and your being here is dependent on me and
others being here, I am because we are.
It's as simple as that, it's not independent, but it's dependently co-arisen, how we are
is dependently co-arisen, and we often forget that.
It's this perception that we have, it's this delusion of independence, it's this delusion,
and what, how beautiful to lose this delusion now and then, and realize how interdependent
we truly, truly are, there is a tenderness, there is a beauty to this interdependence
of all beings, not just us humans, but all animals, and the planet Earth, and beyond.
And when I say beyond, it's like, wow, blows my mind to think of all the galaxies and stars,
and yet it is true, I am because we are, we, this all, all of this, all of this, I am stardust,
I am because we are, because the Big Bang happened at some point.
So, so many directions, this contemplation can go, and yet there's a particular way that
I would like to invite us tonight to sit with it, and let our heart to open to this interdependence
with care, with mental, with love, with appreciation, of holding, because you are not alone, even
if you think you're not alone, you are not alone, you are being, because everything else
and everyone else is, so to bring that in our consciousness, to bring that.
So without further ado, I'd like to invite us now to start meditating together, so, so
let us, let us land, let us land in our bodies, let us land, in this body, in this moment,
letting go of all the words that have come for the purpose of arriving, for the purpose
of settling, here, here, here, just simply here, this breath, sensations of the body,
not complicated, just here, inviting the body to land, to arrive, to relax, to relax,
to give its way to the earth, tilling the soil of awareness, by arriving, settling, connecting
with the in-breath, connecting with the out-breath, and with the ease in the breath, and especially
out-breath, ah, releasing, ah, to the body, to the seclusion of this moment, into the
seclusion of this moment, this mind-heart, moment of refuge, ah, to the body, to the
body, to the mind, to the heart, to the body, to the heart, to the heart, to the heart.
And if thoughts arise as they will arise, it's okay.
No need to chastise yourself or yell at yourself, it's okay, simply, simply notice what the
beloved puppy of the mind has gone after, it's okay, it's alright sweetie, it's okay.
Ah, I'm smilingly, smilingly, smilingly petting, maybe even petting as if you're petting.
Wondering mind, okay sweetie, let it release, let it release the juicy bone, let it release
the juicy bone, ah, noticing that being here with the breath, with the body, taking refuge
is juiciest of all.
A lot of gift here, no, this breath, this body.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm smilingly, smilingly, petting, maybe even petting as if you're petting.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just this breath.
This body, here, here and now.
Now I would like to invite you.
If you wish, you can stay if it feels calming soothing.
Stay with the breath and the body.
If you wish.
Consider to open your heart, not so much your head, your thinking,
but drop in this contemplation as if dropping a pebble in a pond.
The person you are, how you are, everything you have done and do.
In the past, let's say in this moment, it is codependently arising
with so many other factors, other beings, so many other beings, your life.
In this moment, is intertwined, is completely intertwined
with so many other beings' lives that it could boggle the mind.
Be one of the imponderables as the Buddha shared.
You really contemplated it.
So we don't want to get too lost in thought, but just to touch into.
Touch into this contemplation.
Maybe bring one aspect, maybe the fact that you are here right now,
back to saying, listening.
Intertwined, intertwined, deeply embedded.
So many other beings' actions.
You don't exist or feel or do independently, not possible.
Just letting your breath to breathe in this contemplation into your heart, into your heart center.
A few breaths, a sense of awe without words.
It might help for a moment to see.
It might help for a moment to step out of yourself and see yourself from a third person perspective
as being who is you, their life so intertwined with so many other beings.
Let's start with this moment, the present moment.
If you are watching the movie of your life, yes, you seem to be the protagonist, the star of the movie,
yet there are so many plot lines, so many, yours is not an independent one.
Let yourself appreciate the richness of the tapestry, the tapestry of all these threads.
Interwoven, yours is just one, interwoven, see your thread, deeply.
Interwoven.
Each breath, interwoven, each thought, interwoven, each emotion, each sensation, two interwoven.
It's not an independent.
It's allowing your heart, allowing there to be, appreciation, gratitude, awe, meta, whatever flavor shows up for you.
Goodwill for all these threads, all these threads interwoven with yours in this tapestry of being human, of life.
As you wish well for your thread, may all the threads be well, may all the threads travel in safety,
in happiness, in health, in ease.
Knowing that as you wish well being for all the threads, you're wishing well being for yourself.
Inextricably connected your thread to the others.
So, there is no difference really, you wishing well for others and wishing well for yourself.
At the ultimate level, they're one and the same, one and the same.
I am because we are.
May all beings be well, I am because we are.
Thank you.
May all beings be well, even have a sense for the threads of those you care about, those near and dear in this tapestry.
And the threads of those you don't know, so many threads and the threads of those with whom you have or have had challenges interbeing.
I am because we are, all of us.
Opening your heart to care, to love with the entire cloth, even if you don't understand it, you don't have to understand it.
And it's possible to share, to spread our goodwill, our appreciation for the vastness of this interconnection.
May all beings be well.
I am because we are, all of us, because all of us are, I am, I'm part of the cloth, I am not independent, I'm not alone.
I am, I am because we are.
With power and humility in this.
With power and humility in this.
This body is, this being is, this here, I am, here now, because we are.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And maybe if you wish for the last few minutes of the practice, can fill your heart with those who have touched your path, you are because they are, they have been with appreciation and metta, with each breath.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Notice what arises when you bring a few of these beings to your mind, to your heart, to your mind heart. I am because we are.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
May all of us, may all of us practitioners, all beings everywhere.
May we awaken to the grace, the magnitude, the beauty, the awe of our interbeing, our interdependence.
But we are not alone. We are deeply, deeply embedded with and for each other.
May all beings everywhere, be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice.
I am because you are.
So we have some time for reflections, comments, questions, reports from the field for the benefit of the Sangha.
And you're welcome to type in chat. If you type to me alone, I want to read your name. It will be private. If you type the chat to everyone, I will read both the chat.
And I also see a reflection here. Oh, yes, this is a quote. Let me share this first. This is from Martin Luther King, Jr., from a letter from a Birmingham jail.
We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.
Beautiful. Thanks for sharing that. I'll read it one more time. Such a beautiful quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. The garment, yes, the garment, the cloth, whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.
Can I see your hand, please?
Hi, Nikki. I've noticed for a long time that when I try to send loving kindness out to other beings, that I end up sitting in a puddle of loving kindness.
Whereas this time, having the connections out there already, just feeling loving kindness just automatically went out those strings to other beings. That was very nice. Thank you.
That's lovely. Thank you for that report from the field. That's lovely. Let me reflect that back. You were saying in the past, as you were sending loving kindness to other beings, your heart, yourself would be filled with loving kindness.
Here, what you noticed was with this practice automatically, with bringing to mind this sense of interconnection with all beings already this thread, bringing the sense of metta, loving kindness already became shared.
It already went out through all these networks, so it's just a different way of being. It's lovely to experience a practice in different ways.
Beautiful. Thank you so much. That's lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Ken. Any other reflections, please?
Hi, so I think that so right now I'm in the process of applying for jobs and like waiting to hear back.
And so it struck me, as we were meditating, that part of what feels so hard is kind of just like this vulnerability that it's other people's decision, like whether I'm going to get a job and what my life is going to be like.
And I noticed that you said that this practice sort of brings like both humility and power. And I was able to feel the humility with more ease, so I really appreciated that.
And I wonder if you could talk just a little bit more about like the power that you see coming from this.
Yeah, thank you so much for sharing, Kristen. And also your question, this and also where you are in your life right now with looking for a job applying, which can feel vulnerable, of course, it is vulnerable.
And yet, and yet to feel that actually the places you're applying, they depend on you, right? There is a dependence on your skills, on your gift, on what you give to the world.
And so the sense of humility comes from, wow, yes, as you experience, there is such a sense of, oh yes, interdependence, and then there's a sense of power is the sense of agency that you are part of this cloth, you're an important thread in this cloth.
And everybody else is because you are because of what you offer and finding, giving your gift to the world in whatever ways might be appropriate and show up.
But you may not know, you may not see right now, you might be attached to one idea, but maybe life has another idea for you how to show up and share your gifts, your agency, your beauty, your goodness.
So that is the sense of power, I am part of this cloth, yes, I am part of this cloth of humanity, I am, I am, wow.
How amazing is that?
Yes, and you're welcome to comment or you can let it go as you wish.
Yeah, helpful.
Thank you.
Thank you, Kristen.
And Jamie, please, let this be the last comment.
Thank you. I think we all know that trauma can radiate out now lasting effects on ourselves and others. I'm thinking, especially about adverse childhood experiences where there's just really great research that's been done on the long term mental and physical health impacts.
And, you know, there's growing research about those being transmitted down generations.
So I was just thinking about that. So a lot of compassion during that exercise too.
Yeah, yeah. I appreciate you bringing that in. Yes, there are so many causes and conditions and interdependence.
And I also really appreciate how your mind is holding all of that with compassion.
It's not a way to be distraught like, oh, so much trauma, it's intergenerational, etc. radiating out. But yes, trusting in the power of goodness that is bigger in humanity, the power of compassion and wisdom to hold all the, all the traumas as, as we navigate this human being human together.
So towards, towards more wisdom and compassion.
Yeah, I'm reminded of, of the book.
I think it's called the better angels of our nature. It's the author is scaping me. If any of you know, it's, it'll come to me.
This research, this idea that actually humanity has become Steven Pinker. Thank you, Melanie. Yes, that, that humanity has become so much kinder and less cruel over, over ages and ages.
And that's the direction we're going. So that gives me hope. That gives me hope.
Share a couple of reflections in chat before we turn. Co says even Donald is one of the threads in the tapestry of my life.
Now how to be matter of fact about this compassion, compassion, compassion.
We are, yes, because we all are. There's so many reasons why every being is the way they are.
Jerry says it was very helpful to see your power and agency coming from everyone, including yourself.
I am because you are. Yes, power and agency. Exactly. Beautiful.
So, so we have time now to turn and, and have the sense of interbeing in small groups with one another small groups and, and here's the greeting I like to invite us to, to share with one another and the greeting.
And when you get into groups together tonight to share the greeting, I see you. And there will be three of you. So you can, you know, one person says it and the other two people will say it back and then maybe you take turns.
I see you. And then I am seen or we are seen. I see you. We are seen and let yourself actually be seen, be held by the other being and see how powerful it could be to see someone and let yourself be seen by them.
And then take, take turns and maybe the first person with alphabetically just to make it simple. First name closest to the beginning of the alphabet start and go around and do this and do it as a practice.
See how it feels. And then of course you can share as much as little about your practice. These groups, these small conversations can be so precious.
We already know this. This is Sangha. This is a special Sangha. So I'm going to create the rooms now and here we go.
Okay. All right. So take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Be kind. And here we go. Opening all the rooms.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's dedicate the merit of our practice together.
May, oh yes, John says such joy. Oh, that's lovely. What a lovely note to end on. Such joy. May, may our practice together be a cause and condition for freedom, ease, joy, for ourselves, for all those whose lives are our touches and all beings everywhere.
May all beings be free. May all beings be happy.
Thanks everyone. Be well.
Now, nice.
