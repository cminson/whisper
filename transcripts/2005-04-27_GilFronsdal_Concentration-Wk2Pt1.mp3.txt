 Welcome back to our second class of our concentration series. I'm feeling somewhat happy to be with you and that some of you came back. It's very nice. I didn't know what to expect. Our capacity to get concentrated is meant to be a happy capacity. Sometimes in distinguishing the path of concentration from the path of mindfulness, or vipassana, mindfulness is called a dry path. And concentration is called the wet path. Mindfulness is dry because it doesn't have the joy and the happiness of concentration as its partners comes along with it. Whereas concentration is wet in that it's saturated with experiences of joy, happiness, well-being. Sometimes rapture, ecstasy can be quite strong. And so we're talking about developing a capacity that involves happiness and well-being. It's both the result of concentration practice, at least temporary happiness, while you're concentrated, but also it's the foundation for concentration practice. One of the conditions for getting concentrated, one of the aids it supports, is feeling happy. And some people feel that's a little bit of a hazard backwards because the reason that we're wanting to meditate is to get happy because we're so unhappy. So then you're told you have to be happy first to get concentrated. Don't worry about it. But as you do the practice, there's purification forces, there's forces of change that happen, and the sense of well-being will come. Every human being has the capacity for concentration. And what we're doing in this Buddhist practice is taking and developing a very common human capacity. And Buddhists find it very useful to do that, and it's beneficial for the Buddhist path. Many people are interested in concentration because it helps them in their daily lives. Usually we notice the absence of concentration is a source of difficulty in our lives of some sort or other. Some people who have scattered minds in daily life need to look at their life and see if their life isn't too fragmented in order for the mind to get settled enough or concentrated. And to add concentration meditation on top of a very fragmented life maybe just makes things worse. Sometimes doing one more Dharma activity is un-Dharmic because you're filling up more and more activities. Even though it's supposed to be good for you, if you just do too much, it's not healthy. So anyway, concentration practice is a path that involves happiness and well-being. It's nice for me to be reminded of that and sit here with you and think about that as what we're addressing and looking at here. One of the descriptions of the joy or the happiness of concentration is that it's a happiness which is very different from many places, many of the ways people normally get happy or associate with happiness or what they seek for in order to get happy. So for example, the happiness of concentration practice is said not to be the same happiness as happiness of sensual pleasures. So getting a massage or eating good food or all the things that can be sensual pleasures. Sometimes scientists, I know, thinkers have great wonderful ideas. And part of the attraction for that for them is the joy, the delight they feel in the mind, the kind of sensual pleasure that comes from seeing or figuring out or negotiating these wonderful ideas. And sometimes it involves mental kind of sensual pleasure. So the pleasure of concentration doesn't come out of sensual pleasure. The senses are not being stimulated, in other words, by something external that makes us happy. It's also not the happiness of ego, in the sense that our ego or our sense of self isn't being pumped up in some way, or praised or validated in some way that makes us happy. The happiness of concentration is a happiness that in a sense arises, some people say it arises with no cause at all. It doesn't, in a sense, normal causes. It's nothing external, no good events or a good situation that's stimulated. But rather it's a product of concentration itself. It's a product of the mind itself settled on itself. As the mind gets quieter, more relaxed and settled on itself, composed on itself, it seems to generate a sense of feelings of well-being, of happiness and joy. And that sense of having a capacity for happiness, which is independent of what happens in the world around us, independence of things we normally seek for to get that of happiness, is very educational for the mind. And so concentration practice is described as a re-education of the mind, where the mind breaks its habit, sometimes its addiction, of looking externally outside of itself for happiness as reliable happiness, as the only place we know that happiness is available. And if we only think that happiness is available externally by things in the world, kind of organize themselves in a certain way or from sensual pleasure, then you're at the kind of whims of the world and the changes of the world, and that's quite fragile at times. But if you have some sense of happiness that can be born from inside, that in a sense is natural or kind of inherent or just arises from the deep integration of the mind, the concentration does, then a person doesn't feel so much at the whims or at the mercy of all the different forces of the world as they go up and down. So in talking about happiness as being an element of concentration practice or a sense of well-being or joy, I say that now at the beginning to remind you that in order to become happy or feel a sense of well-being, you can't be grim. And I've known some people who try to get concentrated by being grim. They take it really seriously. The concentration practice is so serious, this is so important, and sometimes they judge other people, someone comes in and it's really noisy, they sit down next to them, they get so upset, how could you disturb my samadhi? And they're just so wrapped in themselves and wrapped in the grimness of their endeavors. And it turns out that it's a lot easier to develop a healthy sense of concentration if you're kind of light-hearted about it. Maybe it's really, you can be really serious in a certain sense, really intent, really see this as extremely important and significant, be highly motivated to get concentrated, to develop concentration, but without any sense of heaviness or grimness or, you know, like, you know, got to do it. You can be very light about it. Serious and light at the same time is a nice way. And then also I want to say underscore, nine parts out of the ten things you need to do to develop concentration, nine parts of your whatever, nine parts of concentration, is patience. Now, maybe it would be more useful to have a five-week class on patience as a way of getting concentrated, but just to tell you patience is really essential. And if you're getting impatient, lighten up. It's a sign that maybe you could take it too seriously, lighten up. And it takes a lot of patience in order to work with the mind and develop. Really important skills, spiritual skills, is learning to listen to silence. So if you could turn that up, the silence up, please. Yeah, really loud. Is that any better? Okay. Did anybody memorize the metasuta this week? Would you like to volunteer to recite it? One of you? You would like to try? Okay, please. Maybe if you don't mind using this, and the way to use it, those of you who use this, is you hold it kind of vertically this way, because somehow that goes into the microphone better than this. And the reason to use it is primarily for the people on the hearing assistant devices, and also other people to everybody here, but some people wouldn't hear otherwise. Metasuta, to reach the state of peace, one skilled in the good should be capable and upright, straightforward and easy to speak to, gentle and not proud, contented and easily supported, living lightly and with few duties, wise and with senses calmed, not arrogant and without greed for supporters, and should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize. One should reflect. May all be happy and secure. May all beings be happy of heart, all living beings, whether weak or strong, tall, large, medium or short, tiny or big, seen or unseen, near or distant, born or to be born. May they all be happy. Let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere. Let no one, through anger or aversion, wish for anyone to suffer. As a mother who would risk her own life to rescue her child, her only child, so toward all beings should one cultivate a boundless heart. With loving kindness for the whole world should one cultivate a boundless heart. Without obstruction, without hate and without ill will, standing or walking, sitting or lying down, whenever one is awake, may one remember this recollection. This is called a sublime abiding here and now. One who is virtuous, endowed with vision, not taken by views, and having overcome all greed for sensual pleasure, will not be reborn again. I need to tie those various lines together. Did you learn anything about your mind and how it works in memorizing that? Well, I learned I need to tie those various lines together. What did it require mentally of you to hold that in the mind, to learn that in the mind, to bring it into the mind so it stays there? Well, I really had to focus on each line and then figure out how to tie them together, so I wouldn't forget. Thank you. Anybody else has any comments about what they learned about their mind, how they use their mind in order to develop, memorize a text like this? Someone over here? Is that someone? A super-air girl. Okay. Do I hear you? Anybody want to say anything? I'm not particularly good with concentration, so for me it just takes sheer repetition. So I tape it, I make a tape of it, and then I play it in the car over and over and over, and then I start saying it with the tape, and then I get to where I can say it without the tape, and then I just keep saying it over and over and over, 500 times. So nine parts patience, repetition. Perseverance. Over here. I decided to take it slowly, and so I found out if I do about three lines a day, then it sticks, and it's true, you have to tie it together, you have to tie the last line with the next first line. But I did find as the week went by, it got easier. It didn't take as many, it didn't take 500 repetitions, maybe it only took, you know, 50. But, and I also found there's a great pleasure in memorizing something, which I had forgotten about. Okay, so speak more about that pleasure. Well, I actually began to experience it in Shyla Catherine's Udonna class, because she asked us to memorize a shorter verse, usually four to eight lines. And just as you said the last time, I found that what I had memorized would pop up in some appropriate situation, and I could, I'll never forget the ones I've memorized because they apply so well. And I expect the same will happen with this one, and certainly when I first began memorizing it, I began to think, well, you know, you could aspire to be this way. It's not just a lovely description, it could be an aspiration, and so it does work down through levels. And there is something, I don't know what the magic about memorizing is, but it does become a part of your thinking rather than just a rote piece. It begins to sort of inform your thinking. And in that way, I could sense it could inform your behavior also. Beautiful, thank you. So I think we should be careful what we memorize. Any other comments about Halloween in the back? Straight back. I found it easy if I wrote it out over and over again, and I found that my visual memory, it's a little easier for me to do it visually than mentally, you know, when it's spoken. And I also thought it was very enjoyable experience. Great, thank you. I'm so glad you asked us to memorize this. With my 63-year-old brain, I have thought for a while I couldn't do this anymore. And I've gotten to the place where I factor in stupid time, you know, for what I can't do cognitively that I used to be able to do. And I was utterly amazed that I could do this. And so that was very, very wonderful. The way that it worked for me was I found that I could remember what the words looked like on the line. And as I walked or ran or just, you know, did daily things, I would repeat and just did it stanza by stanza. And it made sense. I mean, I would memorize because, be able to memorize because certain things fit together. Like, well, if I live lightly and had few duties, maybe I would be wise, you know, that sort of thing. So thank you for the assignment. Thank you. So did you notice that you needed to be somewhat intent in order to memorize? Has to be some intentness in the mind? Did you notice that? Did you notice that there had to be perseverance to memorize? Anybody memorize without some degree of perseverance? Did you notice that there had to be effort? Did you have to make effort? Did you notice that, maybe a little bit different than perseverance, that you had to kind of apply yourself first to what you were going to do, the phrases. And then you had to somehow, you know, or bring the phrase up and then somehow hold it. There had to be some kind of sense of holding in the mind. Are you going to hold this here? Part of the focus. Does that make sense, the word holding? Hold it there? Because what would the mind do on its own? If you weren't...what? It would go off. So there's different, these are kind of mental, different mental factors that come into play when you are trying to memorize something. These same factors need to come into play when you do concentration practice. Some people are somewhat passive about concentration, thinking, oh, I just sit back and if I just kind of focus in some abstract, kind of vague way, somehow it will happen. But these different qualities of the mind somehow have to be aroused. And so there's an arousing of the mind, an alerting of the mind, arousing and energizing of the mind, different factors of the mind that are required to get concentrated. So there has to be effort. Without effort, you're probably not going to get concentrated. There has to be perseverance. There has to be intent. Maybe it's a little bit different than intent, maybe not. There also, I think, has to be some sense of desire. You have to want to do this. Did you feel like wanting to memorize was a useful thing to have when you were trying to memorize? Did any of you really not want to? It would be good if someone said that. You said you didn't want to. Now, in not wanting to, do you think that made it harder to do it? That was like a little obstacle, like, oh, I don't want to do this. Yeah, it made it harder. Made it harder. Yeah. Do you find that too? It made it harder? Yeah. So I think it really helps if you want to do it, if you have a desire. Having a desire in wanting to do it doesn't mean you're good at it. But it really helps to have a desire. Yes, I want to do this. And that's a little bit different than the message that some Buddhists receive, Buddhist teachers sometimes give, where you think, oh, you're not supposed to have desire if you're a Buddhist practitioner. Desire is the problem somehow. And somehow you're supposed to do this without having a desire. Desire is actually a very important part of the path, but you need to have the appropriate desire. And one of the, you know, healthy desire, and for the desire to get concentrated, can be healthy. Now, sometimes a desire for being concentrated is mixed up with ego and ambition and, you know, escapism and other things. So then it's not healthy. But there needs to be some kind of desire. Okay, this I want to do. I want to do this. And hopefully it's open-ended without demand or expectation. Yeah, I really want to do this. And desire can be inspiring. And, you know, oh, yes, it gives energy. And then there has to be the applying of attention to whatever you can do, to the object of concentration. And then you have to hold your attention there. That's the, or I like the expression, hang in there. You've got to hang in there with it. Just like you have to hold those phrases or hold your mind engaged with the memorizing so it doesn't drift off. So there's this arousing, energizing aspect of practice. At the same time, there also has to be a relaxation. Arousing and energizing without some relaxation will just probably get you agitated. If you only practice relaxation, you probably go to sleep. And you won't develop the clarity. You won't actually develop the power of concentration that's available. And so relaxation and engagement and effort have to be kind of balanced and worked together. And part of what a person's development concentration is doing is monitoring themselves, monitoring their subjective experience, monitoring what's going on within them as they do this practice, and then beginning to some degree adjusting them so that they become more favorable and more helpful for the process of getting concentrated. If you really don't want to get concentrated, there's a lack of desire for it, then maybe you need to look at that and work that little bit, inspire yourself in some different ways, try to figure out why the lack of desire is there, and see if you can find out some way that you feel it inspired and you really want to do this. If there isn't the intent, what gets in the way of that? Is the factor of perseverance adequate or patience? Or is the effort a good effort or continuous effort? What is going on in the mind and can you arouse something and engage yourself more actively? And maybe in the same way you have to engage yourself, you really want to try and memorize something. So a part of developing concentration practice is developing the ability to monitor your subjective state, monitor the different qualities and aspects of your mind and mental factors. A little bit I'll try to explain what some of those are. A lot of it will be that as you develop concentration, part of what you do is you begin learning and studying what is going on here, what's going on in my own mind here, my own air life, and how can I align that so that it helps me to get more concentrated, helps develop concentration. Now this is very important because some people when they try to develop meditation practice or concentration practice leave out the self monitoring aspect and they just kind of hold their attention on their breath and mind goes away, they hold their breath. It's kind of like brute force, it's kind of mechanical thinking or magical thinking. If I just kind of lock myself on the breath, everything else will follow. And occasionally that can be the case. But I think more realistically you want to be able to have this monitoring, you're watching and seeing and then as it becomes more second nature to monitor yourself and know this, it's like riding a bicycle. And after a while you can do it without your hands because you know all the things, you don't have to think about riding a bicycle anymore because you've figured it all out, it's kind of in your body. And then at some point you can actually drop. As the concentration builds up, you drop some of the things, you might even drop the monitoring at some point. But initially when you first begin, you've got to kind of be engaged in the process of developing concentration. And you want to engage as much of who you are, much of your capacities as you can in this process. How can I engage in this in a way that's helpful? And some of the engagement is relaxing certain things and the other part of the engagement is arousing certain factors. So monitoring yourself, engaging, adjusting a little bit what's going on is part of the process. So in a few minutes I'd like us to do a meditation practice and I'd like to convey one more concentration teaching. And I'll do this with a little bit of the, I don't know if it's a word play, but a little bit of the richness of the English word concentration to concentrate. One of the meanings of concentration is you take a liquid for example, like orange juice, you can concentrate it and you can buy concentrated orange juice, right? And a lot of the water is taken out and it's really, the essence, the juice, the flavor and sweetness is really concentrated. And then in order to drink it, you add water and dilute it again. So part of concentration is to condense something, to concentrate a fluid to its essence, essential qualities. One of the ways this is done in Buddhist idea of concentration is through a word called seclusion. It's a very important word in Buddhism for developing concentration, is that the concentrated mind is a mind that is secluded. A mind, usually when we talk about mindfulness, we talk about a mind which is inclusive, that's open, expansive, that includes everything, is ready to be attentive to everything. A mind that's developing concentration is a mind that's developing a certain degree of seclusion from all the different sensory input and all the different activities of the mind that can normally go on. So a little bit it's done physically if you can, where you go into a room and close the door so you don't hear a lot of the noises around you, or you go someplace where it's quiet, so you don't have a lot of auditory impact coming in. Some people like to close their eyes when they meditate, so you don't get a lot of visual input coming in, so you're occluding your visual field a little bit. Some people like to meditate in a room or situation where the temperature is not too hot, not too cold, so that the temperature doesn't create sensations in your body. So there's some attempt to limit the amount of sensory input coming in, so that the mind is not going out in all kinds of directions. So another way of saying that is you're beginning to seclude yourself from everything else so that your attention, your concentration, your mental monitoring engagement is getting concentrated, getting condensed. So you're not diminishing yourself in the sense that you're becoming less of who you are, but in the sense you're allowing yourself to become more concentrated, more condensed to who you are. The essence of who you are, the fullness of yourself is not being diluted by all the different places the mind can go, scattered and engaged in all these different things. It's beginning to concentrate so we get more of the essence of who we are, the fullness of who we are. One of the ways of seclusion is we begin secluding the mind, or separating the mind from a lot of its normal thinking, everyday kind of thinking. And this is very important to understand that this is essential in order to develop concentration. If you sit down to meditate and are still really motivated, consciously or unconsciously, to solve your life's problems by thinking them out. Maybe you'll be successful in this particular sitting. Finally get it. So that's good. But you're not going to get concentrated. If you want to develop concentration, if that's what you want to do, you have to be willing to at least be interested to feel like you have the intention, have the desire, have the wisdom to let go of your concern with thinking about problems, thinking about life. Thinking about things, anything else but what you're doing at that moment. So no matter how important it might seem to you, you realize right now this is not the time and place for thinking about things which are not having to do with meditation practice. Now that's in some ways quite obvious, but it's not obvious to the little mind. And the mind thinks that it's really important to think about things. But if you kind of get it, kind of grok the idea that that's not what you're doing here, that's not the purpose of what you're doing here, then maybe you're more willing to temporarily put those things on hold to seclude your mind from those kinds of mental considerations and thoughts. A lot of people are not going to be very successful at first at secluding their mind from all the different thoughts that we're thinking about. That's okay. A really important part of developing concentration practice is learning to let go of our thoughts. Okay, let all that go. And even if you can just let go for half a second before the thing can come back, you're still exercising that muscle of letting go. And the more you can exercise it, in a sense, the stronger the muscle gets and the softer that muscle gets, it gets easier and easier to do it. And eventually you'll find it easier and easier. And as other factors, other kind of mental factors that support concentration get stronger, they'll all work together to help you develop samadhi. So one of the things we're doing is secluding, but not to diminish who we are, but actually feeling of condensing who we are. Condensing means, in my mind also, that everything's included still. So the feeling of, I translated samadhi last week as composure, is we really want to be composed and ourselves the best we can. So in the initial stages of developing concentration, we still have a kind of full open awareness of our physical and mental world. But we're not interested in the world outside of that. So we're kind of an alertness to monitoring what's going on, to feeling what's going on, to take in what's going on. So secluding the mind, being willing to seclude it. Another way of saying the word seclusion, the Pali word is videka. And a word that works a little bit better in American culture, that would inspire us better and feel like, oh, that's right, then it feels right. Seclusion, people have a little bit, wait a minute, what is this seclusion thing? Denying stuff? Is it repression? Is it turning away from the world or something? Another way that's maybe more American is rather than calling it secluding the mind, or seclusion, we call it independence. We're helping the mind to become independent from its preoccupation with the world and sounds and things around there. And as the mind gets more concentrated, then there's a natural process of that seclusion getting stronger and stronger. So strong that people in strong states of concentration sometimes don't really hear anything around them. The sounds around them are really not being registered because they're so secluded, because the concentration is so focused. Okay, a lot of ideas. Okay, so far? So if you'd like to stand for a minute and stretch, then we'll do a sitting.
