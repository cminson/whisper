 I just turned on the recording so welcome everybody. Okay, so maybe we'll begin. Welcome everyone just so happy and I feel a little energized as well excited to be here with you again. I was sorting out the classes that were done together. I just recognized that the four of us that have co-taught this Sati Center practice and study series. This is our 14th time eating together. And so, yeah, I really kind of energized my heart and my mind and my body. You can see that all of us have a love of studying suttas and practicing incorporating it into our practice. And we probably spent more time preparing all those classes than the classes themselves that we're offering. But we love it. So I welcome and enjoying this love of ours and hopefully this will be nourishing and beneficial. And so welcome. I'm going to pass it to teachers to say a few words as well. So Diana. Thank you. Thank you. I consider it a great good fortune to be offering this class with these co-teachers and to be sharing it with others. Of course, the four of us we have a lot of fun, but there's something really special to share with others to hear the comments and the questions that you guys have. Like bringing some things that we haven't thought about. And it's just great. It really makes these things come alive and nourishing. And maybe it says something about me, but it feels a little bit exciting too. So I'm just so happy to be here with all of you and I'll pass it on to Kim. Great. Thank you. It's a joy to be here. This is, of course, our first class for this new year. And I feel especially inspired by the topic of finding true wealth and security, which is offered through our practice. Because often people have had a reflective time at the end of the year and kind of thought about as they're going, you know, it's a construct in a sense. But as we go into the new year, we sometimes think about what will serve my well-being, what will be of benefits to cultivate or do this year. And these suttas that we're looking at may give some insight into that or at least into the way that we would go about whatever we have aimed ourselves toward. So I hope that will be as inspiring to you as it is to me. I'll pass it on to David. Thanks, Kim. Yeah, I just I'll add my welcome to those of my colleagues. It's just a, it's a joy to be here. Brew a cup of fresh stimulating drink and settle in for some practice and community. I just, you know, we say study and practice and I just I kind of want to make sure that our study is sort of an exploration, exploration of these early teachings in these early texts in ways that really can support our practice. So I'm just echoing what what getting started with. I can tell you a little bit about who's here, who we are today. And but all we have this time around is some geographic information. But I want to note that a little more than half of us are logging in from California. And that makes the theme for today. Let it rain our first sort of take on these on these suit as particularly appropriate and will be leaning into the rain metaphor and it'll have particular resonance for those of you from from California. But there are people from 12 other states. I won't read them all but from all over the United States, including far flung Hawaii. And also participants from five countries outside the United States, Canada, India, Singapore, the UK, and Chad. So welcome everybody from all these places, and I'll turn it back over to you, Diana. Thank you, David. So those of you know here that rain in California is wrecking havoc in some places and other places it's such a welcome respite from this drought we've been having kind of a mixture of responses. But can you imagine what it's like if there were a lot of rain and absolutely zero doesn't even exist yet something like asphalt or pavement or concrete or something like that right your experience or your relationship to rain would be really different. If the monsoons come, and there's absolutely nothing to prevent it from just completely flooding and landslides or whatever might happen. So, of course, thousands of years ago, they were concerned about the weather. They because they didn't have the construction materials that we have now. So, for these two classes today, we're going to be studying some verses from the suit and the pattern. This is a collection that's inside the fifth book that good again the kayak. You don't need to know these words these poly words. I'll say that suit, you might recognize this word right it's word that we use for discourses and nipata nipata means like a compilation. So, even way back in ancient times they appreciated that what's being collected in the suit and the pattern is something that was from over here and a little bit from over there. So these were some verses that were, we might say floating around loosely in the oral culture, and then I've got collected and put into when it came time to write them down and to canonize them they got collected into this one collection. And what's unique about the suit and a part of is that it's only in the Tara Vada tradition. That is, that the, if some of you are familiar with the Nolio's work that sometimes he will look at parallels, you know, preserved in this tradition and what it looks like and preserved in this other tradition. And the Nolio's work is the only one that has the suit and a part of it, but that doesn't mean that these verses don't have parallels and other traditions. They're just another books. Some of them are in the Donna Pada. Some of them are in the semi chin a kayak. Some of them are in the unguid or in the kayak. So, it's a It's just an indication of like how these collections came to be that we study. And so, one thing that's interesting about this agenda is that it's primarily verse, just like the Donna Pada is which for some people are familiar with and I would say the Donna Pada is the most familiar Buddhist texts. Again, it's okay if you don't know all these words that I'm saying it's not relevant to the teaching that we do today. I just kind of want to put it in a bigger context of what we'll be doing. So, the suta that we'll be exploring today is a dialogue conducted entirely in verse. So, one person says one thing in verse and another person says responds in verse, and there's a few of these. This kind of format is not unique to the suta, but it's a different way of maybe preserving and sharing a discourse that happened with the Buddha and somebody else. And something that's interesting about this is that it's a dialogue between a householder and the Buddha. And so, the householder of course is concerned with householder concerns, family, wealth, how to live a good life without being a monastic. So, so many discourses we hear are about monasticism. Maybe the last thing I'll say here is that polyverse is as a particular meter. That is, you know, it's, I don't know, there's different ones but we'll say that it's like short syllable long, long, short, short, long, long, emphasis long, you know, it has a very distinct way. And so in order to meet the meter, the authors have to use like unusual words or the different grammatical form of words or omit words in order, thinking that they'll just be implied. So, as translators, this is either fantastic, or it's terrible, because if it's fantastic you can kind of just feel your way in and kind of like makeup, not makeup but you have to like, try to understand what was being inferred. Or if you want to be really literal it's very hard to get into English. So, just this recognition that different translators will, their voice we can feel a little bit more when we're looking at verse them and we're looking at prose. So, as I said that this is a suta that's entirely inverse and it's a dialogue. And what better way to start, then with a little bit dialogue happening. And so, in this dialogue, Ying will be the Buddha, and David will be Danyan, the householder. So here we go. I've boiled my rice and drawn my milk. I stay with my family here along the bank of the Mahi. My hut is roofed, and my fire kindled, so go ahead rain sky, if you wish. I boil not with anger, and have drawn out heart heartedness. I stay for one night along the bank of the Mahi. My hut is wide open. My fire is quenched, so rain sky, if you wish. Here no gadflies or mosquitoes are found, cows graze on the lush meadow grass. They get by even when the rain comes, so rain sky, if you wish. I bound a raft and made it well. And with it, I crossed over well beyond and dispelled the flood. Now, I have no need for a raft. So rain sky, if you wish. My spouse is obedient and not wanton. Long we have lived happily together. I hear nothing bad about my partner. So rain sky, if you wish. My mind is obedient and freed. Long nurtured and well tamed. Nothing bad is found in me. So rain sky, if you wish. I am self-employed and my healthy children likewise. I hear nothing bad about them. So rain sky, if you wish. I am no one's lucky. With what I have earned, I wander the world. I have no need for wages. So rain sky, if you wish. Among my cows, I have many heifers and sucklings. Cows and calf and breeding cows. I've also got a bull, leader of the herd. So rain sky, if you wish. I have no heifers or sucklings. No cows and calf or breeding cows. I haven't got a bull, leader of the herd here. So rain sky, if you wish. The stakes are driven in unshakable. The grass halters are new and well woven. Not even the sucklings can break through them. So go ahead and rain sky, if you wish. Like a bull, I broke the bounce. Like an elephant, I snapped the vine. I will never lie in the room again. So rain sky, if you wish. Thank you for that wonderful reading. I apologize if there's a little noise outside. It will end in just a moment. So I wanted to talk through a little bit this suta that David and Ying just read the first part of. So we have Donia, the cow herd. And he's a successful cow herd. He lives in a warm, well-thashed house on the bank of a river. He owns a healthy herd with bulls, cows and cows. Plenty of land for them to graze, sound fences to keep them safe. His wife and children are supportive and have a good reputation and community. So naturally, he thinks that he possesses the height of wealth and security. And he confidently declares rain sky, if you wish. So we can imagine maybe a modern parallel in a person who has a stable job with benefits, a harmonious family and a house in a good neighborhood with excellent schools. You know, we, such a person also might have similar feelings as Donia. So the suta doesn't seem to indicate that Donia was greedy or competitive, merely that he was satisfied with the protection and pleasures that had come to him through his material success. And so we have this dialogue where Donia ticks off each item on his list of living the good life. And the Buddha offers a counterpart in the spiritual realm by replacing external physical conditions with internal qualities. And so there's some subtlety in this, you know, in using an analogy like that. So I would say that that suggests that the Buddha regards Donia as both intelligent and spiritually mature. So, you know, maybe just looking at a few of the lines to flesh this out and Ying is going to do this more in just a few minutes. But just for an example, Donia starts out saying, I've boiled my rice and drawn my milk. And so he's meaning the term boil, literally he's cooked rice. He has food. But the Buddha says I boil not with anger and have drawn out hard heartedness. So we have this image that comes from the sutas of the hindrance of ill will is sometimes said to be like water that's boiling so that you can't see clearly into it. So he's using this more metaphorical use of the term boil. And then also sort of the external warmth of a congenial family is replaced maybe with the internal warmth of having no hard heartedness. It's kind of a different concept and then there are various physical conditions for Donia's herd and those are analogized to favor favorable internal conditions like having no defilements. And the fruit of that is to live openly. Donia has quenched the fires of greed hatred and delusion instead of Kindle a literal fire to be warm he's quenched these fires of greed hatred and delusion those are named in, for example, the fire sermon as being the pliers that we live with. And he's crossed over the floods, and that's also a technical term the flood of sensual lust of becoming of views and of ignorance so he's gotten through all of these things. And so Buddha's assessment of Donia is spiritually ready to comprehend this teaching does prove accurate because Donia responds by taking refuge in the Buddha and declaring that he and also his wife will live the spiritual life with the Buddha as their teacher we'll get to that in a moment. A little bit later in the suta. And so, you know, Donia shifts internally from seeking refuge in his material assets, including his relationships to aligning with a superior refuge of the spiritual life. And then maybe as a sort of a dramatic flourish or we'll talk more about that image, it begins to rain as he does that. And you see that there's this new shift in Donia's understanding. Okay, so let me say also a little bit about the structure of this suta sort of now that we understand maybe the main theme, the structure, and I'm now borrowing off of an analysis that Bikubodi did is that we have these initial verses which are the ones that are being just read there's this exchange, kind of a statement and response about what is considered protection, comfort and security. And then there's a transitional verse about the downpour of rain, sort of changing the scene. We have the taking of refuge in the next two stanzas of Donia and his wife and we're going to have those red laders, so that we could hear it. In a sense though the suta could end there, you know, there's this change and then there's a new declaration of a different way of seeing things. Really the suta could end there on that positive note, but then we have two more verses with Mara coming in and putting up kind of one more challenge about, you know, but isn't the central world really worth it. And then the Buddha responding to Mara. So there's a some speculation that maybe these last two verses were added later they're very similar to some verses in the sutani in the Samyutani Kaya 4.8. Those of you who want to look it up those same verses appear there, it's possible in a recitation tradition for places where the verses are similar but slightly different for things to get transposed from one on to the other because the person remembering it just remembers the other version, for example. And then I'll just finish with a reading from the Dhammapada that expresses the same idea. Diana mentioned the Dhammapada earlier. So these are verses 188 to 192. See if you can hear the same shift in refuge. People threatened by fear, go to many refuges to mountains forests parks trees and shrines. None of these is a secure refuge, none is a supreme refuge, not by going to such a refuge is one released from all suffering. But when someone going for refuge to the Buddha Dharma and Sangha sees with right insight, the four noble truths, suffering, the arising of suffering, the overcoming of suffering, and the eightfold path leading to the ending of suffering. Then this is a secure refuge. This is the supreme refuge. By going to such a refuge, one is released from all suffering. In a sense, the suta in the sutta nipata here invites us to reflect on what is reliable wealth and security, and to what degree those might be present for us in our life. So let's finish with this reading of the refuge versus actually always wrong it's Diana and David that will read those. I think David you have right. Right, the context is that right then a rain or a thundercloud rain down soaking the uplands and the valleys, hearing the sky rain down. Donia says this. It is no small gain for us that we have seen the Buddha, we come to you for read for refuge great seer. Oh sage please be our teacher. My partner and I obedient will live the spiritual life under the Buddha gone beyond birth and death. We shall make an end of suffering. Thank you, thank you, David. Sorry, I was supposed to read part of that but I got a little confused. So, now we'd like to provide an opportunity for you guys to talk about this amongst yourselves. This idea that here's somebody who's saying, look, you know I'm set, I have what I need. And then the Buddha is coming in with an Aikido move and redefining so much of what Donia is saying that he has that he thinks is so valuable that Buddha's points well actually I had something that's a little bit more valuable. So, what are some parallels do we have today to this. Here's Donia who's concerned about his relationship, all these things are valuable. The Buddha is not saying that they are not valuable. He's just saying that there's, in addition, there's something more valuable things about relationship or household, or in this case is livestock for us. How might we understand that in modern language, maybe relationship and home, maybe we could relate to that but of course we don't have livestock. So, are we, well, maybe some of us do but most of us probably don't. So, how, how might we re interpret the suit in modern language. Not only that, how might this re interpretation with these more reliable forms of wealth and security, how might they be inspiring for you. And the things that the Buddha was talking about, not being with anger, or not being tied up, or, you know, bound to things. So, you'll be in groups of four, three or four, and you'll have 17 minutes, and it's a great way to do this to start by doing this is what I'm going to call the soup making method, and that is one person puts in one ingredient, which is just a single point, it could be more than one word, but just a point. Might be lots of ideas that you have but just a single point, and then it goes to the next person and they add a point, an ingredient and it goes to the third, the fourth and then it comes back around to the first person. And now they have heard some other ideas, and they might have something new to think that they hadn't thought of from the very beginning. So this is a way that kind of levels the playing field between the introverts and the extroverts, and also allows everybody to have not only an opportunity to say something, but an opportunity to say something a second time that maybe they wouldn't have thought of at the very beginning. So, a way for us to kind of, like together, create a new understanding. So, my colleagues put the questions in the chat box. Thank you for that. And here we go. Okay, welcome. Welcome back. So now I'd like to hear from some of you, how was that to explore some of this idea of what is true wealth and security and how Donnie is saying one thing and the Buddha saying something else, but how might we interpret this in modern times. So, anybody have a question. Thank you, Charles Lee for putting on the chat. I'd love to hear how was that. You have some new ideas. Were you feeling like, I don't know these people back in ancient India I feel so removed from them it doesn't feel relevant to me or you felt like, oh, this is actually very interesting this idea that can have wealth and security, not only in the traditional ways but to maybe even greater wealth of security. Charles Lee. Yeah, thank you. You know that the last sentence you said, that's, that's kind of what I got out of this I think I first read it thinking, you know the Buddha was telling Donnie a no no no don't you know, that's not the way you know this is the way but I mean, you know I think like you like you alluded to, it's kind of a both and situation it's like yes, these worldly. These are all acquisitions or external circumstances do you know, bring some measure of security. And even, and I can also show you that without these acquisitions or external circumstances, you can have a sense of security. Well, thank you. Thank you. Do any of my co teachers have something they'd like to say. Anybody else have a comment or question or something you'd like to add. I'm Robert in our group. Safe secure we can support ourselves. A lot of us. And so, in a lot of ways we're like the cow herd. And yet with that, there can be a feeling of dissatisfaction. Isn't there more. So, it was very analogous, we discussed that. And it also struck me that it was kind of like Maslow's hierarchy of needs and that you start at the lower level taking care of your needs you go up the pyramid, and that the tip of the pyramid is spiritual. And it seems like Donnie. He was doing well he was a good man, he was a good guy. And yet there was more so there's, there's more to be learned there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for trying that in with Maslow's hierarchy of needs right we need shelter and we need food and livelihood and things like this. Thank you. I'm looking at my co workers just our co teachers if they have anything they'd like to say, you can. Yeah, David. Yeah, I love that comment. Those last comments and, you know, sometimes we see it as an either or that the idea for example even in sort of Kim's saying, you know, the Buddhist pointing us in these in this exchange between Dania and the teacher toward that tradition there's this but it's also useful maybe to think that at the very same time, like we can be fully in this life of household most of us, and at the same time be free. There's that too in this teaching it's not it's not either or it's not. It's not just a higher aim but it's also a higher aim we can have in this life, taking the point that there are requisites or prerequisites to practice that have to do with physical security and well being, and that's a really useful point to have made. Thank you. Maybe I'll just also add to that. If you read on Buddhist response in nowhere he responded to say, no, Dania don't have this. There's nowhere that he said that he simply have a shift to bring out other aspects that the Dania may not have been open to. And so, I just want to point that out. Yeah, I think we might add that these material acquisitions and things that are helpful for the path. For the most part in the teachings I mean the Buddha does encourage people to have enough have sufficient of that in order that we can practice. But he also tends to acknowledge that they aren't entirely under our control, you know, whether you have a lot or don't I mean I think of a not a Pindica, the Buddha's most wealthy supporter who created monasteries and supported the monks and for years and years and years. He had a kind of a bad turn and his reputation fell this is from the commentaries, and he became very poor, actually, for a while, and he continued on with his spiritual offerings but it wasn't like his wealth was protected because he was a good person and it was like, these things come and go, and you know what the Buddha pointed to, which Charles Lee said at the beginning, is that actually there's something that's independent of this other part if we're putting all of our energy into the material side we're missing something important. I think it's a little different. Maslow's hierarchy does matter, but it a little bit implies that you have to have the base in order to get the pinnacle and I'm not sure that's quite implied, what is teaching. Thank you. Thank you, Kim. That's great. And I lean and this will be our last one. I'm kind of struggling with this because I need to disagree with what Robert said there are a lot of people in the West, even in the US, who are food insecure and who are going bankrupt because of medical bills and you know if the landlord raises the rent you're out of, you're out of luck. And so, there are many of us and I'm one of them who are still struggling with this basic needs stuff so I don't really relate to Danny as situation at all. And yet, although I know that retirement can be fulfilling spiritually. I also know that since I am working in my coworkers. At times are very annoying it gives me things to practice with. So, I'm not saying that you have to have the base of security necessarily. Maybe you can be poor and do the spiritual work to, but it's, it's very easy to be distracted by you know do I have enough in the bank that I can pay my bills. So, I'm seeing a lot of the food insecure people in my community. And we don't seem to have the sense of community that maybe people had back then that you know if you're in a rough time. You know the community will come together and help you out. We're more like the rugged individual stuff and you're kind of on your own so I'm, this is what's going. I don't know if you have any comment but that's what's going on in my mind during this. Thank you for saying that Eileen and I apologize for our just thinking like oh okay so everybody here in the West is the same one. We're not, we're not the same so thank you for highlighting that that food insecurity is a real thing is happening. And it's hard when you don't have that it's hard to consider anything else really, I can imagine how consuming that can be. I will say that it is very worthwhile to recognize this because we are different. I'm aware that that some may have a food insecurity, or some may have a financial insecurity. Some may have insecurity in terms of race, gender, and diversity issues. And this are rubbing in our hearts and mind. I think in this teaching, I don't think a Buddha was simply kind of just tossing it out and say you know, forget about that. But instead, what is offered is to look at a possibility of a deeper security and sense of a well being that's also possible in the midst of potential struggles that we may be having. And it's definitely nice, you know, you can kind of have our basis covered. But the practice itself, the practice itself and the orientation the Buddha is offering is that there is a way that our well being is not compromised simply because of this other conditions that we're in. So maybe that's something I'll put in the soup. I'm not saying I know I think I'll turn it back to you. Okay, so this next part of the teaching will be very similar, but I'm going to going to invite a different modality of learning or receiving this, this teaching. That is through imagery and some visualization. And it might be nice for those I don't know how it works with a phone or smaller devices. If you can kind of use the full screen, whatever the screen that you may have might be supportive. What I will be doing is to offer a slideshow of this dialogue between Dania and the Buddha. And I'll be offering this in a different way. That is, I'm going to run down a set of kind of images that points at what was filling Dania's mind. So I'm going to not do it in a back and forth dialogue, but rather kind of run through the words that came to Dania. And then I'm going to show a set of images that somehow represent what was on the Buddha's mind at heart. And as I like to invite you maybe to receive these images in a visual way, maybe almost as if it's almost like a meditative form. For me, receiving images almost immediately have a felt sense in the body. And so in a way, I'm inviting almost as if you're feeling into feeling into the felt sense in Dania and the Buddha. What was there? What was in their being as they were speaking these words? And as Kim was pointing out to that, the Dania was very literal. And he's really talking about his life, his family's food and shelter and cows. And the Buddha is metaphorical because he's pointing out something inside of him. And I also wanted to invite some fun with this. And that is, you know, I tried the best I can to pick some images that might kind of describe, be relevant to what is being pointed out. But it may not because I don't know how Dania looks like. You may see different people in the images. And I don't know how the Buddha looks like. And so I, you know, the best I can sometimes I use the monastic images and to have a certain association. Other times may not kind of match exactly. So I'd like to invite you to kind of just sit back and soft eyed to receive this. And see if you can share my screen here. So let me know if you can see the screen. Okay, great. Now I have to play with this. Just one moment. I should have a window where I can play this. Just like show. One second. Let me just start sharing and then see if I can get this going again. Okay, let's see. Just a moment to load this. Okay, now I think I've got it. Let's see now I'm going to share the screen. Alright, so we'll start with Dania. I'm going to overlay the words as well as I read it. I boiled my rice and the drama milk. I stay with my family along the bank of the maki. My heart is roofed. My fire kindled. So rain sky if you wish. No gadflies or mosquitoes are found. Cows graze on the lush metal grass. We get by even when the rain comes. So rain sky if you wish. My partner is obedient, not wanton, long halfway lived together happily. I have I heard nothing bad about them. So rain sky if you wish. I'm self employed. And my healthy children, my twice. I heard nothing bad about them. So rain sky if you wish. I have heifers and sucklings. Cows in cow and feeding cows. I've got a bull leader of the herd here. So rain sky if you wish. The stakes are driven in unshakable. The grass hop hotters are new and woven. Not even the sucklings can break them. So rain sky if you wish. Those are the words from Daniel. It's kind of the felt sense. It was on the Thaniest line. Rice, food, hut, family on the riverbank. Cow herds, different kinds of cows. A self-employed person. Quite good, right? Quite good. Yet what do you hear underneath of that layer? For me when I was looking at those images, there was a sense of some sense of fear underneath of that. So even though it feels all good, there was some sense of fear underneath of it. So now let's look at the Buddha. Let me shift my screen. This is slightly. I bore you not with anger. And had drawn out hard heartedness. I stay for one night along the bank of the Mahi. My hut is wide open. My fire is quenched. My bond a raft and made it well. And with it I crossed over, went to the far shore, and dispelled the flood. Now I have no need for a raft. The mind is obedient and freed and long nurtured and well-attained. Nothing bad is found in me. I have no heifers or sucklings. No cows in cough or breeding cows. I haven't got a bull leader of the herd here. So rain, sky, if you wish. I am no one's lucky. With what I have earned, I wander the world. I have no need for wages. Like a bull, I broke the bounds. Like an elephant, I snapped vines. I will never lie in a womb again. So rain, sky, if you wish. So those are what's on the Buddhist mind. Just going to pause for a moment and see what's the best thing for you. In contrast, I'm going to pause and just let the images be the teaching of itself. Maybe drop into the felt sense of your being. With that, we'll transition to a guided meditation. Such a rich practice here this morning. I can't speak for my teaching colleagues, but I think we have all just seen these images for the first time with, again, a rereading of the verses. And just a reminder that how powerful the verses in the suttas that are offered in these texts can be. And at least in my case, how frequently I've sometimes passed over them in the past, but they can really be quite wonderful in practice. So let's meditate a little bit with these verses with what we're uncovering today, this rich conversation about one aspect, this relationship between external conditions and the internal peace, the freedom that the path of practice offers. The, as Diana pointed out at the very beginning, we have little control, maybe no control over the things that most concern us over the conditions that in which our lives are led. But the Buddha points out that we have, if not control, a great deal of influence over our minds and how free they are regardless of the conditions that surround us. So let's bring this into our practice, maybe find a comfortable, comfortable posture, bringing the eyes down if that's comfortable. And bringing into the mind this phrase, let it rain, rain sky if you wish. I think this phrase goes to the heart of our discomfort, our discomfort with the lack of control. And at the same time, the opening to the Buddhist path of practice in which we prepare ourselves for whatever conditions we encounter, prepare ourselves to meet them with an open heart with as much wisdom as we can. So bringing attention first inward as we close the eyes, if we close the eyes, bringing our attention to our inner world, the inner life, bringing our attention maybe downward into the body, and bringing our attention to the breathing. In each breath we can find a balance between the energy that each in breath brings and the letting go that each out breath offers. As we proceed in the meditation, sitting with the breath, accompanying the breath, holding the breath, keeping the breath in mind, returning to the breath, opening back out into the breath when the mind becomes tight around thinking. Maybe today we can recognize that thinking sometimes takes us off into an engagement with external conditions, or worry about the next meal or the next rainstorm. When we return attention to what's here now, the here and now, the breath brings us back to. This path opening up of let it rain doesn't have to be a brave response. Doesn't have to be a responsive resignation. Let it rain can be an opening, maybe a gift or an offering with which we meet the world of experience. So for this today, our theme of let it rain as we return attention to the here and now to the breathing. Each time we come back into presence. Drop in this phrase, let it rain in whatever way feels comfortable for us. However, however much of that challenge we can take on or that offering we can make. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You Okay, so gently coming back from whether from the inner rain. So now we have a time for questions or comments. How was that for you? Or how were the images for you? Are you settling into a sense of what this suta is pointing toward or what this phrase let it rain? How that can work in our being? Okay, go ahead Peggy and then I see your hand also Adam but I saw your first piggy. Okay, sorry about that. Okay, I got the imagery was lovely. At one point I got a little caught up in my mind because let it rain means something but I was also imagining that a thousand years ago or whatever it could have meant catastrophe like pure catastrophe and I definitely wasn't ready for that. I felt like there'd been too much of that. These last couple years too much loss and understandable got a little stuck there. Yeah, most of it was peaceful. Yeah, I'm not sure if we're meant to invite disaster, but more a sense of declaration of confidence or something more internal but you're absolutely right about the reins I think Diana alluded to that, you know, in ancient India, it was an easy process. And even today, you know the idea of rain sweeping away an entire village is not an exaggeration. Thank you. Adam. Thank you very much for this occasion and auspicious occasion and class. I suppose what came to mind is, as in this one person said in our group, you don't want to feel too, too unsettled or too much in a rush or anything like that. But it's very nice. To keep in the back of one's mind somewhere, the notion of the highest. And there is this sort of incredible quality standards, if you like, to be revealed in these texts. These are very, very refined, invaluable texts. And so one can keep in mind the notion of the highest. And also the sense of danger or exposure, but not letting that, you know, not letting that overwhelm. And I think in the sutta that you so nicely expressed, there is that reference to the Ra, which I understand the next steps. The awakened one says, I have no more need for a Ra. But for most of all, that Raft is still there. And that is, so in spite of the danger, we have the notion of the highest. And it's that Raft of the teachings as a whole. That's there for us, that we can give attention to amidst our floods of information in our 21st century world. And we have that Raft there always to come back to. So that's what came to mind. And thank you very much for your efforts and the notion of this occasion. Well, thank you, Adam. That was beautifully said, you know, of the reality of the challenge of the world. We're not physically safe ever completely. And we can carry in our heart this very refined, you know, wish that to be in some kind of a happiness that doesn't depend on any conditions. But the reality is, you know, we may not quite be there either. But we have a path, we have a practice, we have something right here in this moment that we can use. And of course, the Raft image you may have been alluding to is also found in other sutas, particularly MN 22, the simile of the snake, which we did a class on, I don't know when, a while ago. And it does include this Raft image that we use the Raft until we don't need it, but we don't let it go until then. Yeah, thank you so much. I'm so excited. I don't know if my co teachers would like to add anything at this point or not. No. Yeah, DT comments that it's nice to hear that this teaching reminds us of getting back to practice. That's our hope. Study and practice is the name of our general series. And the ways that interacting with these texts can inspire our practice and form our practice challenge our practice in appropriate ways. And we can do that if we're open to that. Yeah, you. Yeah. Thank you for this, this practice today. Thank you so much for the picture show. I really enjoy that. Looking at those pictures, I think, wow, what a beautiful bowl he has. And I love his hut. And, and, but then I was thinking, but that must have been hard to build and hard to maintain and keep that heart from leaking. And that that bowl with the calves and the weaving the good grass. What if, what if I hurt my finger and I couldn't weave or I couldn't fix the huts. So there's so many things that could go wrong here. I teach it maintain my, my sense of well being this happy life that I built. And the, and then the Buddha says well, I don't have any of that stuff. But I have a great happiness overflowing with, with, with well feeling of well being. I love, I love, I loved it. Thank you so much. Yeah, those images went right to the heart I think being said at the beginning, I'll let you say, if there's a sense of a little bit of undercurrent of fear in what Donnie always say. Do you want to add more. Yeah, thank you for pointing that out. Yeah, when I was doing this on my own, contrasting the image that was such a strong sense of, you know, the stakes were driven you know it's a lot of work to try to keep all this holding together. But Buddha had no food security, no real shelter. Yet there was such a strong sense of freedom and peace and well being in there. And that was the powerful contrast as I've kind of was going through this myself. So thank you for highlighting this. Yeah. Thank you everyone I think we'll end with the questions there right on time but let me just say a few closing words. In preparation for second class on Thursday, two days from now. You might want to reread this suit up and consider it in light of the beautiful images that we saw and the other things we talked about you know what is true wealth and security, and what does that mean for me in the conditions right now in my life it's not that we're supposed to just throw everything away and try to be the Buddha that would that wouldn't be wise in a sense. But can we partake of that imagery somehow to inspire how we live. You know, next session we'll do. We'll go back one suta and do 1.1, which we also sent a link to, which is the word of a suit to the snake suta. And this one is related, it may not seem like it when you first read it, but consider, you know, we might ask you know how do we kind of get from being really entrenched in the world we in protection and gathering and maintaining. You know, what's the what is this we're after this path toward what does that look like. What do we have to. How do we let go in a way that helps us move toward what the Buddha was pointing toward, and it is a process of shedding of letting us know things that are occupying us in a wise way in helpful way. So that's what we'll talk about next time. Snake shedding its skin, we could have let it shed. So, we'll see you on Thursday for that. Thank you. Take care everyone till till Thursday. If you'd like you can unmute you can all say goodbye together and I'm really way so. Take care everyone.
