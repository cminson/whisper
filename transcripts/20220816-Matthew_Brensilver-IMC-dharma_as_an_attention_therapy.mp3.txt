 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. So, over the next four days, I'll highlight four mechanisms through which Dharma practice gets under our skin, into our system. And the first mechanism, I said yesterday, Seelisamadhi Panya, these are the kind of core mechanisms, how they're classically framed, how the practice transforms us. And I wanted to lay out a kind of another framework of this, not to replace Seelisamadhi Panya, of course, but just as a way of looking. And so the first mechanism is Dharma as a kind of attention therapy. The Dharma is an attention therapy. So our attention, attention is our most basic currency and really the sense of directing, directing our attention to what we deem important. That's very close to our sense of agency and sense of self, the core of who we think we are. William James said, volition is nothing but attention. Volition is nothing but attention. And this, of course, is part of why the commodification and extraction and fragmentation of our attention by modern life technology is actually a profound threat. It's like, as A.H.A.D. Akhtar said, the bright pliancy of mind itself, attention, is under assault, actually. And so we as meditators become connoisseurs of attention. And indeed in the scientific literature, meditation is sometimes described as attentional training. That's the language that's used. And in the first iteration of what would become mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, a kind of mindfulness-based intervention, it was originally called attentional control training. Yeah, I'm glad they changed the name to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, but that was originally the name. And attention, attention is a complex relationship with our own well-being. And it's notable that attention is fractured when we experience psychiatric distress. So in depression, for example, the attention is disrupted. There's an attentional bias towards negative information. And disrupted concentration is one of the symptoms of depression. Or in post-traumatic stress or some other anxiety, just sort of obsessive compulsive disorder, there's intrusive thoughts that disrupt the flow of attention. Or generalized anxiety, there's a kind of attention that's being constantly directed to the unknown future and worrying in an uncontrollable kind of way. And in addiction, there's attentional bias towards the drug cue or whatever the cue is. Or ADHD, attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, like attention's right there in the diagnostic name. And even when we're not in psychiatric distress, not in clinical distress, our suffering, even low-grade suffering, often includes an attention that is pinging all over. Pinging from memory to future to emotion and narratives. And so we train in attention. We train in attention. Why is attention? Where to place the attention? And the four noble truths rather than constantly engaging worrisome scenarios. We practice how to attend steadily, patiently. We train in steadying the attention so that the spotlight of attention isn't shaking and darting around so much anymore. We train the attention to relinquish distractions, like to the movement from being absorbed in discursive thought to back to the object of focus. Maybe that's the breath. Maybe that's your work. Maybe that's the person you're listening to. But there's less stickiness. The discursive thought is less sticky, more flimsy, less compelling. We train in attention because life feels very fast to the unconcentrated mind. Life feels kind of overwhelming. And so we slow it down. And as our attention gathers, it's less fragmented. There's a sense of seclusion. Even though we actually can come into states where we're noticing more change, there's a sense of seclusion and protection from the bombardment of samsara. And we train in the effortlessness of awareness. So when attention can go anywhere but not stick to anything, when the spotlight of attention can go anywhere in experience but not stick to anything, and there's a kind of deep poise that happens when we're not mesmerized by phenomena. We're not mesmerized by our notions of our life, our so-called life. And sometimes you hear kind of divisions between samadhi and insight, concentration, and mindfulness. But my understanding is that the Buddha spoke about these capacities in tandem, not a rigid separation. And a lot of fanfare about the kind of bliss of the gathered attention is understandable. But as far as I can tell, the bliss is maybe mostly good as faith and encouragement to keep going. Aspects of samadhi, this gathered attention, they are indeed closely related to insight and mindfulness. When we begin to stabilize the attention, we can perceive suffering more clearly. And it's so important to actually perceive suffering with a lot of vividness. And that entails a stabilizing of the attention. And when we stabilize the attention, there's no, yeah, just some of the Buddha's injunctions become so clear. There's just no doubt that clinging hurts. When it's perceived from a stabilized attention, there's no doubt that clinging hurts. There's no doubt that hatred hurts. No doubt that greed hurts. And it's through this stabilization of attention that the kind of fantasy of the closed-hearted happiness ends. That insofar as we will know deep happiness, it will be a function of open-heartedness. In the training of attention, Dharma as an attention therapy, this is part of what gives the mind its sense of depth. Yeah. The stabilizing, the kind of settling of the mind, it gives the mind its sense of depth, the matter of life, this matter of life becomes serious. And as our attention becomes stable, Dharma lessons, the insights we have, the seeing we develop, those lessons make deeper impressions on our mind. Sometimes we have an insight or understanding or something, but what kind of legs does it have? Right? Often, often what we once knew, what we learned, is overpowered by subsequent learning and lessons and the fragmentation of life. And so we go on retreat maybe and we know once and for all something, we discover something. This is, fill in the blank, this self-harshness is delusion. We know it deeply, but how does that lesson stick? How does it get its legs? And my sense is that Samadhi allows our understandings, this training of the attention allows our understandings to etch themselves more deeply into our being. Our insights stick. And so there are these very interesting interactions between this kind of attention, this gathering of the attention and the learning aspects of Dharma. Much more to be said about that, of course, but yeah, sometimes Dharma is reduced to attention training, but it's much more than that. And so we'll keep going tomorrow. That's why there are three more days. But for today, yeah, Dharma as an attention therapy, all that comes with that. So I'll pause here and wish you all a good day and thank you for your attention and I'll hang in the chat for a moment. And see you, see you tomorrow. Thank you.
