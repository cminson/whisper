So, welcome.
So, in his described investigation,
yesterday, Dhamma Vichaya sometimes rendered as investigation of the law.
Investigation of the law.
And if you don't know the rules of the game, very unlikely to win.
If you don't know that in basketball, you have to dribble,
or you get called for a traveling violation, you have to win.
If you don't know samsara, very unlikely to be deeply happy,
and so we have to investigate this realm, this human realm.
And this isn't about thinking our way into insight.
We try that, but we're not trying to think our way into insight.
We actually need data.
We need data.
We have to collect data.
And the data, I would say, is primarily gathered by awareness,
and especially awareness of our body.
And as we gather data, it may culminate in insights that we can articulate,
to say things change, for example.
It may culminate in something we can say, words we can say, a view we can take,
but we're not thinking our way into it anymore than looking at my bicep
and thinking my way into strength.
You lift the weight.
At the end, this path is all about getting what we want.
And we think we want pleasure, but we actually want satisfaction.
And what we actually want was what the Buddha described, the cessation of craving.
And so Shantideva said, we hate suffering, but love its causes.
And so our practice is to investigate how, investigate as is laid out,
investigate how suffering arises, how it ceases.
This is maybe the crucial project of the Pasana.
And in this investigation, one of the vital arenas is the relation between bodily affect and thought.
Now, I'm using the word affect here to mean something much, much broader than just emotion.
So emotion narrowly associated with happiness or sadness or fear, et cetera.
But affect is broader, it's broader.
And I associated with this kind of very primal urge to fix something, to tinker with samsara.
This kind of energy of the body and this urge to do, like as if each little burst of affect is a commandment to do something, to hold something, to keep something.
The group of scholars, affect of scholars, they write, we continuously evaluate events around us and inside us.
And our central and peripheral nervous systems allow the emergence of expressions, physiological arousal, bodily reactions, action tendencies, and felt subjective experiences.
And affective processes are typically understood to relate to the notion of pleasure and displeasure or valence, to not necessarily be consciously felt, and to mobilize the organism to deal with events that may be important to that organism.
Expressions, arousal, reactions, action tendencies, subjective experience.
This is a broad category of experience, but it's really, really important avenue for investigation because we are in a kind of continuous mode of evaluation.
And non-judgmental awareness, we say, oh mindfulness, non-judgmental awareness or something, we say, I say the word equanimity all the time casually, but non-judgmental awareness is very foreign to our system.
It's very foreign to our system in an important way.
The world is impinging on us. That's one definition of samsara, this realm of existence.
The world is impinging on us. We're always being stimulated, always being touched by the world, touched by sights, by sounds, by thoughts.
And stimulation is the stimulation of affect.
Experience largely becomes meaningful because of feeling, because of affect.
This is where the stakes are of a human life, and no feeling, no affect, really.
No feeling, no feeling, no meaning, no feeling, no meaning.
Like in the sense that we don't build stories out of neutrality.
That's not where the stories of our mind come from.
Neutral feeling, neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it's often missed because it doesn't call out to us, but that itself is kind of significant.
When there are no alarm bells going off, there's much less need to narrate the moment.
Does that make sense? Let's just say it's pervasively neutral.
What kind of stories would we build about the world, about self, about the moment?
Some of our practice is just contacting neutrality.
Okay, what in this field is neutral? Maybe for some people, the breathing is pretty close to neutral, or the hands, or the soles of the feet, or the soundscape, or the darkness behind the closed eyes.
And it's meaningful to contact neutrality and see that when it's all very neutral, the urge to talk about our experience, to make something of our life, is dramatically diminished.
But then we get pulled into balance, to the positive and negative affect of feeling.
And we start building again. We start making meaning.
So what is the relationship between bodily affect and thought? A theme, thought and freedom. What's the relation between affect and thought?
This is, I feel like, a lifetime of exploration. And we can ask the question, is the arrow from thought to feeling, or feeling to thought?
And no doubt, it's way more complicated than that. But for now, let's just say both.
Thought to feeling, feeling to thought.
Cognitive therapy says that maladaptive thoughts about self and world and future lead to emotional pain, to symptoms, maladaptive thoughts about self, world, future.
And a situation, the model, is a situation elicits often automatic thoughts.
Thoughts we might not even discern, but they're so habituated.
Automatic thoughts which then elicit emotional and behavioral responses.
And so from this approach, cognitive therapy, maladaptive thoughts are explored and challenged and the self and the world and everything is reappraised.
It's like a re-construed. We make new meanings. We start to drop some of the distortions of like major cognitive errors, of catastrophizing, of over-generalizing, taking one thing over-generalizing, of black-white thinking, dichotomous thinking.
And so the process is developing more adaptive schemas and frameworks, understandings.
And the dharma, we don't talk about it often in this way, but the dharma is in important ways, a cognitive therapy.
Like in important ways, it's a cognitive therapy.
And sometimes when I think, you know, you see kind of clinical research of an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention, and there are positive results from it.
Mindfulness is helpful. And I'm always kind of struck by that because, yeah, when I think about my attention,
at day one and my attention after week eight of my dharma practice, it was unimpressive and unimpressive, yeah?
But there was probably a lot of cognitive change happening, a lot of new ideas happening, yeah?
And Buddhist psychology, of course, begins with wise view. It begins with wise view, understanding.
With unwise view, with wrong view, it said that wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong content, wrong everything follows wrong view, right?
So we're invited in to set up wise view. This is a cognitive intervention.
And it's important because we have a lot of maladaptive thoughts about happiness, just a lot of weird ideas about what's going to do the trick.
My eight-year-old nephew has sort of meandered through various obsessions over the course of his childhood,
and started with predatory animals. I know a lot about cougars and bears, the different bear species, where we need to be careful.
Berkeley is all right, but baseball statistics was the phase, and fast cars was the phase.
He's a kid, but I was like, okay, we're talking too much about fast cars, and I just decided to try to give a lesson on the unsatisfactoriness of all phenomena.
And I told him the only Ferrari owner I know is extremely unhappy.
And he asked me, he said, yeah, but what kind of Ferrari do they have?
Perhaps implying that a V8 is not sufficient for well-being, but the classic V12 Ferrari, that might end all seeking.
So we look. Where do we look for refuge? Where do we seek our happiness? And the Dharma introduces a lot of views.
It invites us to consider a lot of views about well-being, about wholesomeness and unwholesomeness, about suffering and its redemption, about the centrality of ethical conduct, about how to divide up the pie of experience,
you know, not into good and evil, but into, say, the aggregates, right? Or we divide it up into the Satipatanas, yeah?
These are views that we take, meanings that we make, and over the course of practice we come to be more conscious of all the views we do have.
Some of which are, like, really obvious and some of which just fly beneath the radar and can be very subtle but profound, you know?
Subtle is significant, Shinsen Young would say.
And so part of practice is detecting all that we believe.
And some of our beliefs are just these wild, absurd ideas that we have about ourselves.
And if we set them out loud, they'd sound ridiculous. If we actually had to say them out loud,
I should be perfect? Is that actually, yeah, oh, that's actually in there somewhere, yeah?
And so some of our practice is just unpacking all of the layers, yeah, the assumptions.
And some of practice is this kind of cognitive dimension of the Dharma is about normalizing the human condition.
The first noble truth that there is dukkha, the first noble truth, is like the most normalizing thing that's ever been said.
And we develop wise views, views that are compatible with wholesomeness, with pleasant affect, with thriving, with non-harm.
And so the thought leads to the feeling, but then crucially it goes the other way, body to thought, affect to thought.
So if I unknowingly took a pill that was the opposite of volume or something, the opposite of an anti-anxiety, that actually produced anxiety,
what would happen to my view? If I unknowingly took that, my world would start to cave in.
So it starts to have a lot of doubt, doubt about maybe everything, who knows. It's Dharma style, I don't know about that.
All the people I love, they're flawed, something's wrong, yeah.
And then the drug would wear off.
And what are we to make of the house of cards that I would have constructed as the drug had its effect on me?
We can see this in a less dramatic way with the kind of gradual onset of the rosiness of caffeine, if you're a user.
And the caffeine kind of, you sort of like the onset as it starts to do its beautiful job, and all of a sudden there's just like a little rosy, yeah.
So we say affect, affect is not self. It's not a commentary on who you are.
It feels like it is. It feels like my joy and my sadness, my love and my grief are a testament about who I am.
But affect is not self. It's a million causes and conditions converging.
And our causal maps, the way we understand affect, the way we make meaning of it, the way we understand our lives, our causal maps, they're too simplistic, they're too simple.
It's so many things, so many things, so many factors, and that sense of the first cause, this one thing that did this, it's more complex.
The stories we tell about why we are who we are, they're too simple, why we feel the way we do, what we want, they're too simple.
And so our investigation, we want to see how we build stories out of affect, and this is happening all the time.
Thinking is usually considered, like described as a cause of dukkha, that's thought to feeling. So we train in wise view. But it's also the effect of dukkha, thinking as the effect of dukkha, the effect of suffering.
If there were peace and security and deep safety, we would not feel the same need to talk about experience, the same compulsion to conceptualize and freeze the world.
But because we're small creatures amidst unimaginably vast forces contending with the almost unimaginable vastness of a niche of uncertainty, unreliability,
we're naturally preoccupied with arranging our future and security, and as a consequence to arrange our security, we have to differentiate and conceptualize and make meaning and categorize.
And all of that meaning making at some level is a function of fear, function of fear.
And maybe you can even get some intuitive sense of like, if there were no fear, if there were no threat, if there were utter safety, security, protection, refuge, how, what would we need to think about exactly?
Some brain, a little bit of brain kind of science theoretical framework.
It's imperative, the imperative is to maintain a boundary between oneself and the world in order to avoid the dissolution of boundaries, what the organism does is make predictions across many timescales to produce survival actions that minimize the tendency towards entropy.
The organism's survival depends on high fidelity predictions.
The computationally efficient solution to this problem is for the brain to prune its models using prediction errors.
By processing the difference between predictions and sensory input, the organism can indirectly quantify the accuracy of its predictions and improve the models that generated them.
An organism that does not aim to minimize prediction errors over time would not survive for long.
This basic predicament of being fragile amidst profoundly potent forces and this need to actually model self and world to make predictions moment by moment.
What is going to happen next?
To look, to be conceptualizing such that we're trying never to be startled, to be surprised by what comes next.
You can feel that on the cushion, a certain kind of vigilance that is never far from the surface, tracking, making meaning, conceptualizing, leaning forward into the next moment.
All are kind of desperate attempt to manage a Nietzsche.
And as a consequence, we talk to ourselves all the time.
We're coming to conclusions and staying oriented and making meaning all the time.
And so sometimes I'll give the meditation instruction just not stop thinking but stop coming to conclusions like don't land anywhere, don't land, we're landing on conclusions all the time.
I want this and then the sort of chain stops.
Okay, that's the conclusion.
I want, I don't want this. That's the conclusion.
It takes a lot of trust and sense of safety to not come to conclusions, to begin to relinquish this kind of compulsion, to make meaning.
And in this, it's like so much of our data is coming, our body is giving us this data, this affect, this kind of surveillance of threat and opportunity.
And then our mind is compelled to make sense of it.
Yeah. But often the way we make sense of it, the way we interpret and make meaning, the implications we draw, the conclusions we draw, it compounds the bad feeling, a lot of bad feelings, or it compounds delusion.
And so we investigate what is happening and what meaning am I making in the openness of awareness, we're investigating body like this, affect like this, narrative like this, images like this.
There's a clinical model of pain that suggests like pain is the prediction of bodily harm.
Pain is the prediction of bodily harm.
And maybe, maybe following along, like maybe we say, shame is the prediction of social rejection, or grief is the prediction of isolation, alienation.
But we want to look, is it?
What do we make of this prediction?
This little ache in my neck, it goes off as a kind of alarm bell, right?
But is it, is it actually an accurate prediction of bodily harm?
Or is it fairly?
And sometimes on retreat, the invitation is we start to see the kind of house of cards that we build, the house of cards of thought.
That's like, like exhaust coming off the engine of affect.
And we build, build and build, oh my God, this retreat, oh my God, this, I mean, sometimes positive, sometimes negative.
And then the card, the house of cards crumbles.
And it's important to see that, see that kind of insubstantiality of the narratives that we often build.
And then we become, we sometimes it's like we have to just become attuned to negative affect, unpleasantness, and just ride it out without story,
without the stories that try to understand where it came from, where it's going, what has to happen, how to fix, how to, what's in all the urgency that's announced by the affect.
And so we just bear with it.
It feels like problems find me, but sometimes it's just my kilesas finding its object.
And it feels like the problem like they're just besieging me, but it's more like kind of a negative affect has to find a placeholder.
Greed has to find a placeholder.
Aversion has to find a placeholder.
And so there's a certain kind of vow sometimes I do not want to build this house of bad story, bad feeling, bad meaning.
And instead, we just appreciate this is unpleasantness, unpleasantness is like this.
Judge and Samedha said unpleasantness is like this.
We comprehend dukkha.
And if you comprehend it, there is some meaning being made, but not much, not much.
But of course, we have to live in the realm of meaning too.
And the Dharma, as I've said, is a bunch of views and meanings and happiness thriving is a bunch of views and meanings too.
And so how do we use the data from our body to make wise meanings?
There's something called like a digital analog converter DAC for short.
And it converts a digital signal to an analog signal.
It's in any CD player, mp3 player, and it's really decoding one form of data and expressing it in another.
And you can get, you know, I think audio files or sound engineers, you know, is like you can get a DAC itself.
That's tens of thousands of dollars.
It's not even the thing that's playing the music, right?
Incredible fidelity, right?
And I thought of that as I was considering this talk, that that practice Dharma practice helps us translate the signal of affect with more fidelity and wisdom.
Into thought and action.
Zajin Sajito, if you want to guard the Dharma, protect the Dharma and love the Dharma, feel it in your body.
The Dharma is then not the ideas or words or expositions.
It's the immediate flexion of joy and love in the presence of goodness and of disorientation and sickness that you feel on witnessing brutality and corruption.
We discover that the Dharma in our body and we translate the body with care, with fidelity, with wisdom.
We don't talk so much about it, but wise action, just intuitive wisdom, ways of living. We don't talk about it because it's hard to codify.
It's part of, I feel, the fruit of practice is where we've learned our body well and it informs our speech, thought, action.
And sometimes practitioners have the sense that, well, meditation teachers are just living their meditation instructions, that I'm there living my life and having an itch and having equanimity with the itch rather than scratching it.
But I don't do that.
I'm training so that when there is an itch that I cannot scratch, I will not collapse. But I just scratch.
It's very trivial, but we're learning about what actions to take and the body figures prominently in this. Wisdom is embodied. We develop this very deep, rich relationship with our body and its signals.
And it's complex because we can't just have some blanket idea of, I'm just going to listen to my body.
Because if I were just listening to my body, I would wear a garland of donuts all the time.
They would just be just wrapped, just there. I don't know where that image comes from. That might be Homer Simpson or I don't know, but we can't just, okay, we actually have to be discerning making meaning out of our body, out of affect.
We're sending mixed signals, motivations towards wholesomeness and motivations that will tend towards suffering, and we have to decode them.
And we have to learn what we can trust and we learn by paying really close attention to our body and to the effects of following this or that.
We learn by experimenting and perceiving all of this, perceiving with awareness what happens when I listen to this, what happens when I listen to that.
Are these just my weird, you know, patterns that are going to cause problems? Or is my body attuning to something before thought has any idea?
And it can be as basic as just like teasing out sometimes like, is this pleasant or unpleasant?
We have ideas of what we like, but do I actually like this?
Do I want this? Is this plan going to work? If I got that, how would I feel?
If I lost this, how would I feel?
We start to get a much more nuanced kind of map of our inner life, and we learn what we can trust inside us, the kind of the affective signals we can trust.
We learn to distinguish the wholesomeness of desire from the fever dream of craving.
We learn more about what we actually want, what we actually want.
We learn to distinguish the kind of false alarms, all the predictions of a certain kind of threat that are false alarms from what actually is urgent.
And they don't sound the same, the true alarms and the false alarms, but we have to develop our ear.
Otherwise, we don't distinguish the true alarms from the false alarms and we just can spend our life worrying, devoted to worry.
A friend of mine, Megan Cowan, a teacher, gave a talk about developing trust in oneself, and she said,
one of the things she said was like, when it clicks in, when you know, you know that you know, there's not a lot of self-justification and there's not a lot of doubt.
There's not a lot of, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is right, this is right, this is right, or, well, that, just like, yeah.
And that kind of intuitive knowing is at the field developed by practice and developed by exploring the relation between bodily affect and thought, the meanings we make, the stories we tell.
And so we have this laboratory of retreat of our lives to see how this works.
And we dwell in realms with less and less meaning, and we learn how to make meaning that's empowering, that leads to our welfare, that leads to the welfare of others.
And then we dissolve back into less and less meaning, and reemerge with new meanings.
So offer this for your consideration.
Please, yeah, please consider whatever is your for use and leave whatever is not behind.
Okay, thank you.
