 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay, everyone. So in meditation practice, always start out just by making sure that you are comfortable. The idea of meditation is the idea of the middle way, and the middle way is the place where the body kind of disappears. And for the body to disappear, you have to be comfortable. Make sure you are really nice and at ease. And when you close your eyes, you can feel your body really well. So it's not just about not having any pain in the body, it's also about being at ease. You don't want to be tense or uptight or anything like that. You want the body to relax. So take time just to really relax. We are trying here to get as deep a relaxation as you possibly can. Okay. And always take plenty of time as you start out with relaxing and finding the ease of the body. The body and the mind are very closely connected. And if the body is relaxed, the mind tends to be the same. Take lots of time. Don't be in a hurry to go to any meditation object. Just enjoy sitting peacefully here. Enjoy the peace and allow the body to relax. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And just try, if you can, to tune into that beautiful sense of peace that is available right here. It's actually a remarkably peaceful place. Enjoy that peace. Enjoy the peace of the good company around you and allow it to kind of permeate your body and mind. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And to make the meditation work, the attitude is so important. You'd like to have a degree of gentleness and kindness and positive feeling in your meditation practice. And one way of doing that is just very briefly to reflect on the good fortune to be in such good company with people who practice the spiritual life. People who want to do what is right in the world. What a wonderful thing it is to be in good company like this. And how sometimes how difficult it can be to find this. So rejoice in the good company here. Rejoice in being part of something wonderful and marvelous. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And the idea here is just to be a passive observer of whatever happens. Not to be involved in the world, but to watch the world kind of pass by. And by the world, I mean anything that goes through your mind, anything you might hear or feel. Just watch things coming and then going again afterwards. And this is the idea of mindfulness. This awareness that just knows things without judging good or bad and allowing things to flow. And going with the flow is what this really is about. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And if you are able, try to notice that the light of the meditation, the idea of leaving all the burdens of life behind. Right now, there is nothing that you have to do in the whole world apart from sitting down and just enjoying the peace, enjoying the freedom from all these things in the world, see if you can get your mind into that beautiful space. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So coming close to the end, not quite there yet. Just take a few moments before we come to the end, just to review your meditation. And if you do feel that you are a bit more peaceful, relaxed, mindful, whatever it is, ask yourself why that is the case. Okay. Okay.
