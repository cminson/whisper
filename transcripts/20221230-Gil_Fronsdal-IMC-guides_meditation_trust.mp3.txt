Hello everyone.
At this last meditation of the year,
thank you for all of you being part of it, however long you have.
And so to just jump right into the meditation,
one of the interesting perspectives for meditation is to consider what you trust and what you don't trust.
And certainly there are, what is your mind involved in? What are your thoughts? Do the thoughts, your preoccupations with the mind, what you're involved with with your mind?
Is it based on trust or is it based on some mistrust?
And of course there might be something in between or neutral where you're thinking about things that you neither trust or don't trust, it's not an issue.
But for meditation, you want to stay in the side of trust.
And for the minutes of the meditation, trust being present, trust mindfulness, trust the meditation.
And be sensitive that when you are not in the present moment, is it because you're mistrusting something,
in kind of the broadest senses of the term, that there's some kind of mistrust or nothing at all, no trust involved.
And if so, a better place to be is with your trust.
The trust that helps you feel the goodness, the rightness of being awake, of being aware, of being here.
The trust of being mindful of breathing, where the operating word is mindfulness, mindful of the breathing, aware of the breathing, trusting being aware of it.
And maybe you have some, maybe it's not a strong trust.
But maybe what takes you away from it all, what is stronger for you, could be understood as being mistrusting.
Or are you putting trust in the wrong places?
Maybe you trust planning.
But maybe planning is based on fear, which is mistrust.
Maybe you put your trust in remembering something, ruminating over something that happened.
Maybe it's nice to remember, but maybe also it's driven by the kind of betrayal or loss of trust that happened.
Maybe you don't trust the present moment. Maybe you don't trust being aware of the present.
Stay close to that so that you can see to the other side of it where there's trust for the present moment.
Trust for mindfulness, awareness.
Stay close to trust.
And maybe after this week of considering the readiness of mind, the malleability of mind, mind free of the hindrances, a inspired mind.
Maybe today, stay close to trust.
And so without taking a posture, maybe a posture that for you represents a strong trust, a trust which has strength to it.
A confidence.
A faith.
A certainty.
Gently closing your eyes.
Gently become aware of the body breathing with no special breathing.
Just notice, be aware of your body breathing.
Most of the time, for most of us, we have an implicit trust that will keep breathing.
Except for maybe when we bring our attention to it.
But maybe there's the body's trust.
The kind of willingness and ability for the body just to breathe.
That's been going on for a long time.
And then allowing the body to be receptive to the experience of breathing.
And awareness riding on the body's receptivity.
A second level of receptivity and being aware through the body.
Whatever tension, preoccupations you might have, body and mind.
Let it be okay to be that way.
Trust it's okay as long as you're aware of it.
Aware with it.
Breathing with it.
Breathing.
Trusting being aware of the present.
For these minutes, trusting it is the central place to be.
Trusting it with receptivity.
A softness.
A simple awareness that's free of the hindrances.
A kind of simple inspiration.
Here, now, aware.
Trusting awareness so you linger with it.
A kind of resting inexperience.
Because you trust being present for whatever your experience is.
Breathing with it all, in and out.
Breathing.

Whatever you're involved in is there trust? What are you trusting?
Are you trusting something unwholesome or something wholesome?
Are you trusting mistrust?
Stay close to trusting the present moment.
Breathing being aware. Here.

That allows us to be close to the coming and going of all things in the moment.
When we're in our thoughts, the thinking kind of lingers with things to make them more permanent, more lasting.
It takes us out of the river of constant change.
Trust the present enough to rest in the river of things coming and going.
Trust without clinging to anything.
Receptive, trusting, non-clinging to the coming and goings of the present moment.
Breathing.

The direct experience of suffering is part of the river of change.
Trust floating on that river, not holding on to any of it.
Stay close to being aware of the changing nature of the present.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
And to be close to the changing nature of reality.
How things change through the day, through the hours, through the minutes.
And to have a receptive mind, a ready mind for whatever change might come.
To have a soft mind, soft heart for whatever change is coming.
To be free of hindrances.
To be inspired by the value of staying present, receptive, soft, free of hindrances.
To trust.
Being receptive and soft, free of hindrances and inspired.
So that when people come into your awareness.
People do the surprising unexpected things that people do.
That you receive them in this field of awareness.
A field of softness, non-resistance and non-clinging.
To be able to see and know others in a deeper way than if we react.
Know with greater wisdom and clarity.
Know ourselves better.
And so be able to remember kindness, friendliness.
Basic human care of others.
Goodwill.
Well wishing.
May it be that in the freedom of our hearts that we can meet everyone.
With goodwill.
May those people that I encounter.
May I wish them well.
May I wish them to be happy.
May I wish them to be safe.
May I wish them to be peaceful.
May I wish them to be free.
And with those wishes.
May I be friendly.
Kind.
Supportive of others.
May the practice that we do for all of us as a community.
May it be a phenomenal contribution to the welfare and happiness of this world.
May it spread from each of us and collectively.
We will make a difference for this world.
Thank you.
