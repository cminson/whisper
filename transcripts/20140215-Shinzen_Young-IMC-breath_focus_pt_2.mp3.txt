The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Once again, take a moment to stretch up and settle in.
The spine expands up to father sky, like a tree,
attempting to find the infinite.
The whole rest of the body surrenders to the contractive force of Mother Earth,
pulled to the dimensionless point, the cosmic center of gravity.
The posture is born in between expansion and contraction, yang and yin.
Heaven and Earth, exemplifying the nature of nature.
Hopefully eventually one comes to see that everything is born in the moment,
in the folds of these spirit forces.
Now bring your attention to breath.
Find a location within the body which could be the whole body,
or it could be more localized, what works for you.
Rest your attention on that location.
If your attention gets pulled away, which is not uncommon, gently return.
Notice how that will be developing a taste, a quality that could be called
concentration, but also understand that everything other than breath
will eventually erupt, screaming for your attention.
Totally give permission for that to happen in the background.
Let it expand and contract, come and go as it wishes in the background.
And your willingness to stay with the breath is then equivalent to your willingness to let go of everything.
And that letting go of everything has a taste.
It's the taste of equanimity, which is the taste of purification, empowerment, freedom.
It's also the taste of dying.
But we're dying into life.
So be aware of this heroic sacrifice.
This is the equanimity quality.

The longer we work, the deeper we work, of course, also the tougher the going can be.
Eventually everything in the universe, other than the breath, will erupt, including physical pain,
sleepiness, and so forth.
Of course, never harm the body.
It's perfectly okay to move, shift position, perfectly okay, even encouraged to practice standing in place,
if that helps you, be more comfortable or more alert.
That's a totally traditional, legitimate posture standing.
Sometimes that can be helpful.
We're emphasizing two qualities of attention with regards to the breath sensation in the chosen location,
which could be the whole body.
There's a quality of concentration.
Your attention wanders, you bring it back over and over again.
But with regards to everything else,
the mental images, the mental talk, the external sights, the external sounds,
and the emotional and physical sensations other than breath,
that's everything else, the mind, the body, the world.
With regards to everything else, give it permission to arise and pass without push and pull to expand and contract,
to last or pass away as it wishes in the background.
It's a kind of detachment, a letting go with regards to all of these eruptions.
That's the quality of equanimity, and we're applying equanimity to the distractions.
We're not focusing on them, but we're sort of surrounding ourselves with a cloud of gentle matter of factness, spaciousness, acceptance,
within which all of these eruptions can come and go without push and pull in the background.
So even though we're not intentionally attending to them, we're still processing them because the primary cathartic factor is equanimity.
And you may be able to actually detect that that is happening.

Now in a moment, the bell will ring, but this time we're going to maintain silence and we'll do a period of practice in motion for 15 or 20 minutes.
It can be any technique you want. If you want to stay with the breath, that's fine. You can walk around and focus on the breath.
But we won't be talking, but it's okay to use the restrooms or to get something to drink and so forth.
You can certainly stretch and do yoga if you wanted.
We'll be in silence 15, 20 minutes with formal practice though, practice in motion of some approach that appeals to you.
And we'll come back, have a little bit more discussion and more practice.
Thank you.
