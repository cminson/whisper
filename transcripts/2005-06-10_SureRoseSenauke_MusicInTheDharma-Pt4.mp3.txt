 We could do one more each, or we could stop now. I know it's getting late. It's kind of late. How are you doing? Short songs maybe. I'd like to hear the dedication. Okay, then do one short. I'll do one short. Okay, short. Well, you know, I'm not, this is short to medium. See how many I can make. On that infamous first retreat with Thich Nhat Hanh, we recited the Heart Sutra, or he recited this Heart Sutra every morning. So I spent ten days hearing about impermanence. And the Heart Sutra is really pretty devastating when you really listen to it. Because you know how it is with these Buddhist sutras, they don't say it once. They say it twenty times. It's like no form, no mind, no body, no sight. It's like no, no. Everything you think is real is not. And just when you think you understand that it's not, it gets real again. It's so confusing. Just like reality, huh? Just like reality. Why can't they just tell you the way it is? Tri-Catholicism. Oh. Sorry. So there was a lot of discussion of this sutra and how the five senses are all impermanent and misleading and don't really give us the accurate picture of what's going on. And at the end of this sutra there is a mantra that we say which is gate, gate, paragate, parasam gate bodhisvaha, which sort of is the final evaporation of all sense of knowing anything. It's gone, gone, gone far beyond, gone to the far shore. Bodhisvaha, how would you translate that? Awakened. Awakened. Way to go. Yeah. Hallelujah. Did you ever hear the Philip Whalen version? No. It's like gone, really gone, completely gone, oh mama. Oh mama. I like that. That's good. So you'll get a chance to sing gate, gate quite a bit in this song. Every time I sing gate, gate, just come right along and then at the end we'll do the chant. Looking into the stream bed of the five rivers, I see how full and how empty they are. My five senses are pouring down that river, flowing into the ocean toward a distant shore. When I'm drinking from that river, I'm filled with what I've lost. Oh, that's the wrong verse. I haven't sung this for a long time. Excuse me. Might as well fix this while I'm at it. Here we go. There are patterns on the water, currents threaded through, and sunlight spills your secrets in a waterfall of jewels. I'm scooping up a handful, but the form just slips away. Oh, gate, gate, gate. Let's do that. Oh, gate, gate, gate. My mind can make believe that everything it thinks is real. My thoughts can fill the universe with words and points of view, but the emptiness keeps ringing until the voices fade away. Oh, gate, gate, gate. Looking into the streambed of the fires, I see how full and how empty they are, and my five senses are pouring down that river, flowing into the ocean toward a distant shore. When I'm drinking from that river, I'm filled with what I've lost, faces on the other shore, the longing and the cost, but the only thing that's dying is the taste of yesterday. Oh, gate, gate, gate. So what's the use of striving and storing up my plans? There's nothing left to win or lose, just sparkles in the dance on the waters of this moment, in the holy breath I pray. Oh, gate, gate, gate, gate. Sing with me. Gate, gate, para, gate. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. Para sanghate mohizwaha. And now for something a little different. This song comes of great singer Bessie Jones, who passed away probably about ten years ago. She grew up on the Georgia Sea Islands, an interesting territory off the coast of Georgia and South Carolina that was ceded to black people after the Emancipation Proclamation. And it was really isolated from the rest of the country and developed its own culture, a lot of its own language, and its own musical tradition. So this is a song from Bessie. It's called Things Are Coming My Way. Well, you can sing this along when I teach you the words. I've got the left hand leg of a rabbit. Oh, this is not for vegetarians, nor for people who drive cars. It's about rejoicing in what's been given you in the world through your effort and your good fortune and grace and getting what you deserve. Now you may not think, these days we may have to translate this culturally a bit, but down there it meant a lot. Well, I've got the left hand leg of a rabbit. Things are coming my way. All I've got to do is just reach out and grab it. Things are coming my way. Oh, me, me, oh, my, I feel happy all the time. I ain't got nothing to worry my mind because things are coming my way. That's half the song. I've got the left hand leg of a rabbit. Things are coming my way. Yeah, all I've got to do is just reach out and grab it. Things are coming my way. Oh, me, me, oh, my, I feel happy all the time. I ain't got nothing to worry my mind because things are coming my way. I've got the left hand leg of a rabbit. Things are coming my way. Yeah, all I've got to do is just reach out and grab it. Things are coming my way. Oh, me, me, oh, my, I feel happy all the time. I ain't got nothing to worry my mind because things are coming my way. I've got the left hand leg of a rabbit. Things are coming my way. All I've got to do is just reach out and grab it. Things are coming my way. Here comes the second verse. Oh, me, me, oh, me, how could I feel? I come position of an automobile. Now I can eat chicken and I don't have to steal because things are coming my way. Try that. Oh, me, me, how could I feel? I come position of an automobile. Well, I can eat chicken and I don't have to steal because things are coming my way. I'm not sure about this in a Buddhist center. I've got the left hand legs of a rabbit. Things are coming my way. Well, all I've got to do is just reach out and grab it. Things are coming my way. Oh, me, me, how could I feel? I come position of an automobile. Well, I can eat chicken and I don't have to steal because things are coming my way. It's made of tofu. Yeah, tofu or TCP or something. Well, I've got the left hand leg of a rabbit. Things are coming my way. All I've got to do is just reach out and grab it. Things are coming my way. First verse. Oh, me, me, oh my. I'm so happy all the time. I ain't got nothing to worry my mind because things are coming my way. Thank you. Thank you. This would be a good time to mention, since Heng Shui is about to grace us with a beautiful closing song, that Alan and I brought some CDs with us of our music that are out on the table there. And I also have a little email list you can sign up on if you'd like to hear about forthcoming recordings or concerts in your area. I have a women's singing circle in Palo Alto four times a year. Drop in any voice. Welcome to sing this kind of stuff. So if you'd like to be on that list, it's out there on the table as well. We want to thank you. Thank you all for coming. This has been extraordinary. This has been really wonderful. Thank you for your voices and your attention and mindfulness and support in this rather edgy Dharma experience. At a Buddhist Catholic gathering where the Catholics invited the Buddhists to comment on the rule of St. Benedict in Beech Grove, Indiana, Our Lady of Grace monastery, the gathering was called Benedict's Dharma. And we all gathered. Norman Fisher, by the way, wrote about this experience. We gathered nine days after 9-11. You remember where your heart was then. Well, many souls canceled. We're not coming. Those who came somehow remember how we needed to find spiritual refuge at that point. So every slot was filled and then doubled. So there were 250 people at the end. Sister Mary Margaret Funk, Benedictine Nunn said, You Buddhists do dedication to merit at the end. You transfer the merit, right? She said, we Catholics have intercessory prayer. She said, would you do one for us at the end of the conference? He said, sure, sure. We don't have one in English. We'll have to translate it. So the night before the end of the conference, myself and the Abbott of City of 10,000 Buddhas, Venerable, took the Chinese dedication of merit that we always do. It goes, you know, it's a standard. We've been doing it that way for 900 years. So we put it in English and translated it. But then we needed a tune. So what popped into my mind was Lorena McKenna's Dark Night of the Soul, which is a setting for St. John of the Cross's poem, his text, his devotional text. And it fit just fine. So the next morning, at the end of the conference, we went out, let everybody out around the plaster image of the HBV. There she was again. The Holy Blessed Virgin Mary was standing there looking very much like Gwenyem Bodhisattva. And we all gathered around and we passed out the song sheets and said, for the first time ever, put your heart into this dedication of merit. And I explained the way it works is that by coming together in an occasion like tonight, for example, where we're here purely to give heart and breath to principle, to the joy of liberation, of having a clue about suffering, about birth and death, and about sharing, about giving. That's a goodness. To do that with your Friday evening is a goodness. Think of all the things you could have done tonight, but you came here instead. So the method is take that merit, that virtue, and give it away. Just share it with your heart. Find something that you'd like to dedicate it to. In Judaism we say tikkun olam. You heal the world. You repair things. So that's repaired by the mind. It's broken by the mind. So I'd like to invite you all now, just like we did then at Beach Grove, Indiana, to make a wish and to take all of the goodness that we shared and send it out. It might be personal, a wish that some elder in your family is healed, or their minds are set at ease as they age and are confused about the next step perhaps, or just to encourage them on their way. It might be social, a wish that aids just disappear from the planet. Why do we have to have that virus here? If we can send it away, let's do. That's worthy of our wishes. It might be universal, a wish that all beings quickly become Buddhas or lead a Christ-like life, whatever, however you translate that. It's your wish to make. So we did that there around the Blessed Virgin. And I have to say that you could almost see those wishes just circle around and take off into the blue because our hearts are very heavy and there was a lot of healing that happened that day. And this song was the vehicle. So I'd like to invite us to do that now. Let's do that and then put our hearts together and end the evening and do it again. This was great. Thank you so much. Thank you. If you know it, please help those who don't know it yet. Thank you. The Every Living Being, our minds as one and radiant with light, share the fruits of peace with hearts of goodness, luminous and bright. If people hear and see how hands and hearts can find it giving unity, they, their minds, awaken to great compassion, wisdom and joy. May kindness find reward. May all whose sorrow leave their grief and pain. May this boundless night break the darkness of their endless night. Because our hearts are wide, this world of pain turns into vinice. May all become compassionate and wise. May it be so. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Thank you.
