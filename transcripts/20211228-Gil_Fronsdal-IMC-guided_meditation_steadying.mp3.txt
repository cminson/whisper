So good day everyone and welcome. In some meditation practice, the analogy that is
coming back to my mind today about sitting down to meditate, is the idea of not
staying in the control tower, but rather to be the airplane that's coming in for
a landing. And I imagine that the pilot and if the airplane was animated, was a
living being, would be focused for the landing, would put aside concerns and
thoughts about the future in the past, and would really kind of enter into the
moment of landing. And if the airplane was an animate being, it would stabilize
itself, would enter into its very body, its wings, and really become stable, enter
its kind of stability to really be focused. The way that some of you might
be focused if you're doing a craft or an art or something where it takes careful
attention. You have to give yourself completely over to the event and
everything else kind of falls aside. Even there might be people around and
you're gonna do something careful. And so you kind of, the sounds around you
kind of fall away. You don't really listening to anyone anymore, but you're
just really kind of there for that experience. So to, when we start the
meditation practice, to think of it this way, that we're somehow dropping out of
the control tower in the head into the body of this being that we are, coming
in for a landing, gathering ourselves together, being centered, feeling
ourselves here. So then, so assuming a posture that would help you feel present
in your body, as if your body, your body and your posture, are the means of
meditation. So taking a posture that maybe is upright, if you're sitting upright
a little bit straighter than usual. And then to gently close your eyes as a way
of beginning to turn your attention inward to your body. And to prepare
yourself for, so that you can give your attention over to this body, dropping out
of the control tower. You might take a few long, slow, deep breaths in a relaxed
pace, only as deep as is comfortable for you. And exhale fully, long exhale, but
not too long, just long enough that you have a sense that you're participating
in the exhale, as if the exhale is the plane coming down for a landing.
And then letting your breathing return to normal. And continuing with your
breathing, with the exhale, the relaxing of your body is a gathering yourself
together around your body. It's a coming home, a centering in the body. It's more
than just relaxing your face, or your shoulders, or your belly. It's a
remembering of yourself, bringing your members of your body together.
Relaxing the shoulders.
Relaxing the hands.
Relaxing the thighs and the legs.
Relaxing the back ribcage.
And relaxing the control tower. Relaxing the thinking muscle. Tension, tightening,
pressure to think.
Breathing in and breathing out. Here.
And then as we come to the end of this sitting, do once again on the exhale,
relax your body. If it feels okay, just gently taking some deeper breaths again,
very gently. And then see if there's further forms of releasing in your body
you can do as you exhale.
Relaxing the belly. Relaxing in the chest.
Softening in the face.
Releasing tension or pressure in the thinking mind.
And to feel yourself established, present, here in your body. And to consider that our
ability to offer embodied attention, our ability to be present for others, is the
root, the origin, the support for anything that follows, for any compassion or
kindness, friendliness. Not to rush ahead to be kind or friendly, compassionate, so
that you leave behind your ability to be rooted or centered here in your ability to
attend. Sometimes what's profound, what the profound offering to others is our
presence, our attention, our ability to accompany others. Sometimes that's more
important than our compassion or kindness or care. So staying rooted here in your
relaxed attention with that as a basis to dedicate the benefits from this
practice for the welfare and happiness of others. May all beings be happy. May all
beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free.
