The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
There we go. Okay.
So we are going to explore
meta,
friendliness, this goodwill,
sense of
ease, happiness, health, well-being,
sense of friendliness and goodwill, well-being,
as one of the four elements
in the Buddhist cosmology, as the water element today.
And you know, I'm not going to say much.
I'll just lead you through it and maybe
make some comments after we've gone through it together.
Okay. So with that,
I'd like to invite you to
get into your meditation posture.
I'm going to do some housekeeping here to keep us safe from
Zoom bombers. Okay.
All right. Excellent.
So I'm inviting you to settle
in your posture,
whatever is comfortable for you
and allowing yourself
to feel a sense of fluidity,
a sense of fluidity
of water, how it flows.
And if you're
warm where you're sitting,
maybe you can imagine
sitting in a cooling bath.
And if you're cold, you can imagine a warm bath.
Whatever feels most comfortable right now
as if you were held, supported
in waters with just
the right perfect temperature.
Maybe it's just not cool, but kind of a little quang,
just a tiny bit cool, pleasant. You could just sit in it.
Sit.
Warm. Whatever is
most inviting right now. Healing,
comforting.
And imagine
your body, every cell
of your body relaxing.
Landing.
Feeling nourished and soaked
as if you were sitting in healing waters.
This water you're sitting
in, sitting with, that holds you,
caresses you, comforts you,
invites every muscle
of your body to relax and soften.
Sit
with you.
Imagine this is healing waters.
Imagine this is healing waters, it's sacred healing waters of metta, of goodwill, it's
freely offered, it's touched, it's graced, it's touched by grace. And as if you had visited
in this moment, this ancient, ancient waters, healing waters, famed for their powers of healing,
you're sitting in them right now. The healing aspect just feels nurturing, safe, completely
safe, you feel safely held.
And as you relax in the waters, feeling the safety of the waters, you feel safe, you feel
safe. The power of these healing waters is also to bring more joy, more happiness.
Feeling more well-being. Enjoy in your heart.
Happy waters.
And feeling, tapping into the healing aspect now of the waters, physical well-being. Ah,
if there are any aches and pains, they are held with care, with kindness, with metta.
Soothing, soothing, healing waters.
The fourth aspect of the metta phrases, metta wishes, ease and peace.
Understanding yourself in this location, wherever these healing waters are, whether it's a pool,
a pond, maybe a lake, in beautiful surroundings, maybe it's an alpine lake, clear, fresh, calm,
covered by nature, trees, birds, sense of peace, sense of peace, offering up, giving up, any
anxiety, worry. Letting yourself be held lovingly, the healing loving waters.
these wishes of metta. From the healing sacred waters, for you. May you be safe, and
you feel it, you feel the wish of metta, the wish of safety. The water cocooning you, holding
you. The same way that in your mother's womb, the water held you in safety. In that environment,
this water offering safety, may you be safe. Lingering with this, the feeling of safety.
may you be safe, and you feel it, you feel it, you feel it, you feel it, you
feel it.
Lingering with this, may you be safe, and you feel it, you feel it, you feel it, you
feel it. Now I'd like to invite you to connect with the second metta phrase, the wish for
happiness, mental happiness, and imagining that these healing waters, and this magical
wish, magical ability, to enliven, to soak through your skin, through your muscles, into your
heart, and there's a little spring of joy, little bubbling, bubbling of joy, little bubbling
of joy. It's the offering of the healing waters to you, reawakening the spring of joy that
lies within you. And just receiving, it's already there, just receiving, it's already
there.
You
You
May I be happy feeling it from the waters may you have joy offering joy
Awakening the flow of waters of joy within that have flown before and know how to flow
again on the road might surprise you
now connecting with the third meta phrase about physical well-being
first with safety second mental well-being happiness the third physical well-being health and connecting with the healing aspects of the waters
how well-being physical well-being is offered to you freely soothing healing there is an ailment or pain
magical healing powers of this water and viewed as meta may you be healthy may you be strong
may I be healthy may I be strong connecting with this offered in the water
can you welcome to be created maybe there is an image of water washing through
washing through purifying rinsing away any ailments any pain any bacteria pathogens that there might be just purifying rinsing through
clearing imaginary water moving through cleansing healing
and connecting with the fourth wish of meta fourth method
meta fourth meta phrase may I have ease in my life flow with ease you have peace
healing this body of water healing loving waters of meta in whatever settings most peaceful to you
just being in the water sense of peace held in ease and peace receiving letting yourself be soaked every cell of your body
calmed soothed soaked pacified by healing waters of peace
you
you
you
you letting yourself linger
as any of the four metta phrases wishes as offered to you by the healing waters whether it's safety feeling safe and held
whether it's joy and happiness the spring in your heart that's awakened
being health healing waters washing through you or sense of ease calm nourishment linger for a while with one of them perhaps or all of them
whatever supportive to you right now to get to be creative
you
you
you
you
you
you
and now you're welcome to stay with yourself if you wish
and if you want to experiment here is another invitation
is now that your whole being has been soaked through and through the healing waters of meta
healing nurturing loving as your heart as your whole body has become soaked drenched drenched malleable as it's been offered to you
soaked it up as if a sponge now it's a part of you
and it flows through you this universal meta well-being wishes goodwill flows through you
and everyone that comes into your mind's eye all the beings that come into your mind's eye as if they are sprinkled
they're lightly sprinkled with holy waters of meta they're blessed
and they immediately feel the goodwill they're touched their bodies relax and soften
they feel your wish of goodwill
it's moving through you through your fingertips
just a mist they feel more ease more joy happiness health and ease as you share these wishes for them
without attachment to outcome just sharing freely sharing freely what's been offered to you with generosity spreading the goodwill
maybe some beings who are dear to you come into your mind's eye
some people you care about some beings you care about
and let it be not effortful you're not doing it it just happens
as you're just being these this goodwill the mist the waters the droplets of goodwill well-being just touch others
and maybe offered freely as you're in the world
all beings
and for the last moments of this practice period connecting again with a sense of flow
as if meta waters were flowing through you through your veins nourishing nurturing
supporting you through and through
and if there are any faults or emotions perhaps self judgment arising for what this period was or wasn't
letting them be soaked in healing waters of meta
letting the healing waters be transforming to any self criticism or judgment and see what happens
and
and
and
welcome back everyone I'm happy to report so far I'm not hearing any burst pipes of water in my apartment so maybe this was safe tonight we'll see
so I like to invite us there's a word or phrase that's coming up for you you're welcome to type it in chat and share what's coming up for you if you want to unmute yourself you're welcome to do that also and what's coming up for me from this meditation is I enjoyed working with the water element
there is a nourishing healing aspect of water and flow and spell especially the idea of the spring of joy I wasn't necessarily happy or joy as before we started this meditation but conjuring that image up there was a sense of oh there's a little spring of joy hello spring how are you
so yeah so Susan offers supported thank you Susan
the other reflections one word or phrase you want to share all everything welcome
I'm still hanging out in the lake I have to say
settlement settling thank you I
in April I see you're unmuted would you like to say something

Victoria I see you're unmuted oh I was just testing it I haven't been able to unmute or to chat the whole session I just wanted to see if it was working

they're both very very nice meditations thank you you're welcome I love it I love the contrast to it's sweet it's wonderful yeah so much of this practice is skillful means really finding ways that are skillful

and Andre also offers sharing the soothing feeling with my newborn grandson who shared this session with us oh how sweet oh and he offers healing in the body lovely lovely beautiful reflections thank you everyone for sharing your reflections
I have to say I feel nourished myself and just also to say one reason for offering especially for offering these tonight and last night with working with the elements is as times have been so challenging
with heartbreak and sadness and anger and and and also uplifted by hope returning point I think it's really important for us to take time to nourish ourselves nourish our hearts and also to share share it with others
yeah and just now offers I feel free swimming in water so yes the image of water is very healing oh that's lovely yeah yeah thank you all for participating in sharing the images that came up for you and also just to say but the practice period
I offered you a couple of options at the beginning a or b a was working with the water element with meta that B was lingering with each phrase and I ended up if you notice many of you notice I actually merged the two so that people who had voted for B also they got their piece
because we lingered with each phrase instead of we usually go through the four phrases one after one but we just lingered with each one for a long time and really soak them in so so with that I'd like to invite us for a brief
time to to hold each other now in healing waters of meta offering meta to each other and feeling ourselves held in community in small groups so I invite you to try this out and see what it's like to just share a few words
next how are you how are you in this moment with people in a small group and if it's not right for you tonight it's going to be a brief six minutes so it's fine to bow out right now before I make the breakout rooms which I will do now so here we go
you are on
I'm making the rooms here we go
okay okay so I'm going to open all the rooms here we go everyone
welcome back everyone the rooms are now closed and everybody's back great so we just have a couple of minutes if you like to share any reflections about practicing in
your groups in this sense of holding each other with meta holding yourselves with the healing waters of meta or you can also comment on the first part reflections questions complaints everything is welcome so please if you haven't spoken before don't be shy
you can unmute yourself or chat just unmute yourself or raise your hand I can unmute you
how was it what did it feel like did you actually feel like you were still resting in the healing waters of meta and other people were kind of held in the zoom space in meta with you in the lake in the cooling waters anyone
I'll say something I'll say we just we really just kind of chatted about our meditation practices and things like that but you know since we're not at least I'm not doing a lot of chatting with with people particularly like with you know strangers in the same way that you
normally do like talking at the grocery store or at the coffee shop or things like that it was really it was really lovely to just to just kind of have that like shared experience with with three people who you know I may see again on zoom or I may not but yeah but it
was something really lovely about it sweet lovely thanks for sharing that Christine yeah it's I think there are a couple of aspects to what you shared one is just the loveliness of connecting with other human beings in this way and it's particularly lovely because all of you
have had this shared experience of soaking in meta so there is a there's a different quality that's really brought in to the interaction that I think makes it probably doubly lovely to be swimming in that space and speaking from that space and being held in that
space thank you for sharing that lovely well it's seven o'clock and yeah may you all have ease peace well-being happiness and may you spread it through your mind through your heart through your actions to all beings everywhere
and may all beings be free may all beings be happy thank you all for joining on this Juneteenth yeah thank you everyone
be well and spread goodness in the world through your actions and thoughts bye
