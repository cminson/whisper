 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So this is the second talk on mindfulness of emotions. And the focus of today's approach to mindfulness is recognition. To recognize what's happening is really a central feature of mindfulness, of the kind of careful attention that we're providing to the world, to ourselves. So recognition. And maybe some of you had the experience of something being named, and then things just get relaxed, or let go, or settled when they're named. So for example, someone might notice you're running around kind of frantic to doing something, and someone just mentions to you, oh, you're tense. And you say, oh, yes, oh, yes, I am tense. And only then do you stop and relax and shake it off a little bit. Or you're in a difficult social situation with a number of people, and everyone's kind of in the full swing of the social storm. And then someone says, you know, there's a lot of tension in the room right now. And somehow naming that tension, something makes, everyone makes space, everyone stops, everyone, oh, yes, that's what's going on. And there's a chance to take that in and adjust accordingly. The naming of something, the recognizing of something, can be phenomenally useful. And mindfulness practice builds on the power of recognition. Oh, that's what's happening. Even something so simple as recognizing the inhale and the exhale, or recognizing the mind is drifting off into thought. Oh, thinking. And there's something happened just to, oh, that's what's happening. I'm thinking, I'm no longer with my breath. Oh, now I am with my breath. This is good. So the recognition of our experience. So in terms of emotions, it's helpful to think of emotions as not single, unitary things, but rather as composites, as made up of different elements. Because if we just have a general overview of, you know, how we're feeling, what the emotion is, it's hard to see where it is that we, attention, the recognition is most useful to be placed. Or it's hard to see if there's attachment or clinging or resistance, some complication in how we're relating to it, the emotion. It's hard to see if we just see the general state. But if we notice some of the detailed aspects of the emotion, then we say, oh, that's the part I'm attached to. That's where the resistance might be. And so what are some of the different components of emotions? One of the things that I find particularly useful to notice is the physical aspect of it. That emotions pretty much always are expressed or felt somewhere energetically, emotionally, sensation-wise, in the body someplace. Some of those sensations are agitated ones, some of them are peaceful, settled, depends on the nature of the emotion. And if you don't feel it in your body, someday you will, as the mindfulness gets more and more settled, and you become more and more sensitive and embodied, then you start noticing, oh, look, there it is. There's tension in my hands whenever I get anxious, oh, that's where the tension is in my hands, my fingers are slightly pulled in. It could be all kinds of places in the body. So physical manifestation is one. The second one is there might be a story connected to it. And the story might be what's fueling it. We're telling ourselves, reviewing what happened in the past, and as we keep repeating it, we're triggering and fueling the emotion. So if it's history in the past that your anger about something had happened, you might be sitting peacefully and very peacefully and meditating or something, and then you remember this anger-evoking experience a long time ago, and you can feel now you get angry. And you weren't angry a few moments ago, and now there is anger. And anger arose with the story. There's nothing about the story that triggers the anger. So the story is part of it. And even in the moment, it's not a story, but a living experience of the moment, the mind is little bit making stories about it, is interpreting in ways often for us to have the emotions we have. So the interpretation, the assigning of meaning, the story that goes along with it, is part of the emotion. And part of the value of feeling the physicality of the emotion is the body is not a story. And so it's a way of stepping out of the story, which is fueling the emotion, keeps it going, into a place where the emotion can be processed in the body. It can't be processed so well by just repeating the story. Some emotions have motivation as part of it, something that we want. We want something to be different. We want something to have more of something. We want to have something. We want to push something away. There's approach motivations and there's pushing away emotions or pulling away. So what's the motivation? What's the relationship that we have that's being expressed through this emotion? So again, if it's angry, it's something like we want to push something away or we want to assert something and make our point to someone. So there's a motivation as part of it. If there is something seemingly quite beautiful, it could be love, but the love maybe has a desire. It's a longing, a wish, and that's the motivation that's part of it. And then there's something filled in more amorphous, maybe the emotion itself, which is a little bit the overall feeling tone of the emotion. And that has different details as well. Some of it just might be pleasant or unpleasant. Some emotions are pleasant and some are unpleasant. And sometimes the hook to how we get detached or involved or resisting or entangled with the emotion, sometimes there's nothing more or less than that we're reacting to it whether it being pleasant or unpleasant, comfortable or uncomfortable. And then the other thing, part of the elements of emotion that to be interested to look at is what is the relationship for you to the emotion? What relationship are you having? And one of them is, are you defining yourself through the emotion? Some way evaluating yourself. So if you're angry, are you now consider yourself kind of a bad person because you're angry, you shouldn't be angry, and you should be different, you should be loving. And all these reference back to how I should be and how I shouldn't be, or we justify why we're feeling some way because we want to be justified. We want to be someone who's right or doing the right thing or know we're doing the right thing. So all this me and myself concern in relationship to it. And if someone is walking down the street and across the street and another sidewalk, you see someone who's clearly angry, maybe they're talking into their phone, and they're angry. You might look at it and wonder what it's about or find it interesting and in a little bit that person's angry and talking loudly. But you don't, it's across the street and the person doesn't see you and it has no bearing on you. And you're still, that's interesting, a person's angry. Can you do the same thing with yourself? Can you allow there to be anger without relating it to yourself, almost as if it's someone else's? Of course it's yours, but we add this extra component part. So all these things come together, the physicality of it, the energy, the sensations of it, the stories and the thoughts, the judgments, the interpretations that we have around it, the ideas we have around it, ideas of what should and shouldn't be, our values. There's also the motivation that's connected to it, what we want to see happen. And there's the way that we define ourselves by it or get hooked by it or want more of it, our preferences. And there's also the pleasant and unpleasant aspect of it. So these are some of the component parts that all get rolled up together into one big ball of the emotion. And so if you say that you're feeling grief, that could be a very accurate statement to make, but then attention to detail, what are the different component parts to it? And you go through the list of everything, and you find out that partly why it's so difficult is the discomfort that comes. And the discomfort seems to be, you seem to interpret it as if something is wrong if I'm uncomfortable. It's not okay to be uncomfortable. And that's where the complication is. So the grief is not just simple, clean grief, but now it's complicated with this judgment, it should be different, it should be uncomfortable. Or perhaps the grief is genuine in many ways, but there's a story connected to it. And the story might be, now I'll never, and you fill in the blank, now I'll never x, y, z. And maybe it's accurate enough, sometimes something will never happen again, that's why we grieve. But when we recognize, oh, that's what I'm grieving, I'm grieving futures that'll never come. And then that's what it is. So that's kind of a fascinating kind of perspective on grief, that's grieving futures that'll never come. Or it could be that we're telling ourselves a lot of stories, and it's the repetitive stories, rumination, that is somehow driving the emotion that we have and keeping it going and keeping us entangled with it. So maybe what I'm saying this today is not so, you know, as articulate as I wish I could be, it's such an important topic and something to respect a lot for each of us, our relationship to our emotional life. I hope the principle that I'm pointing out is useful. That the principle is emotions are not unitary events, they're made up of different elements, they're composites, there's components to them. And as we settle into our mindfulness, it's helpful to look around and see what are these different elements? How is it in the body? How is it in the feeling tones, pleasant and unpleasant? What's this quality and mood of the mind as I have this emotion? Is it contracted or is it more spacious? Are there hindrances in relationship to it? Is there identification in relationship to it? What's the motivation connected to it? And as you kind of begin kind of looking around, then you might ask yourself, is there one of those places that I'm caught where I'm entangled? And if it is, maybe it is not denying the emotion or getting rid of it, but it might make it a lot easier to be with an emotion if that one place where we're caught up and entangled is no longer entangled. Then there can be a cleaner relationship and there can be a clean emotion, clean anger, clean grief, clean joy, clean, even desire in a certain way. So you might look to that over the next, before we meet again tomorrow. You might spend some time, and maybe with a limited paper and pencil, trying to map out or understand the different component parts of your emotions. What are all the different streams that come into play that build to this singular thing of an emotion that you have? And you might even do it with a friend. It might be interesting to brainstorm together what are all the different pieces and elements of your emotional life that contribute to the whole. And then to see where do you get tripped up the most? Which of those components is the place where you most often get caught? Recognition, recognizing our emotions carefully, attention to detail. Thank you very much.
