Welcome. 
Warm welcome everyone. 
So yesterday we started a new set of explorations, a new set of invitations to explore with respect to meta. 
We started with the eight-fold path to explore the relationship between meta and each of the factors, path factors. 
And yesterday we started with wise perspective, sometimes translated as right view, like wise perspective more. 
And the second path factor on the eight-fold noble path is wise intention, wise intention. 
And intention is the precursor to the next few factors with wise action and speech and livelihood and will be coming. 
But intention is really the seed, the root, the, as it's expressed, as is taught really fundamentally in Buddhism on our intention rests the fruit of our actions or karma, if you like to, if we want to think of it that way. 
The fruits, the results of our actions really rests on the intention, what the intention is. 
So intention has a very central place in the teachings in Buddhism, what our intention is. 
And I found in my own practice checking in with my intention to be a profound practice, to be a profound daily practice. 
For example, pausing when I'm writing an email what is my intention? Especially before getting sent, what am I trying to accomplish in the world? What is my intention in doing this? And what seeds am I planting? What seeds am I planting? As I'm having thoughts or I'm having, even if I'm distracted in the narrative, I pause sometimes. 
What seeds am I planting? What is my intention here in engaging in this? Of course, not intentionally, but that really stops me in my tracks to really come back to my intention, not just in activities, in actions in the world, but also in actions of the mind, actions of the mind and heart, which are actions too, in a way, even if they're not perceived externally. 
So, tonight's this morning, this moment, exploration, the invitation is to explore our relationship with our intention and metta, the practice of cultivating loving-kindness, goodwill for ourselves and others. 
Many things we can notice in this journey. 
One is that as we intend, as we set the intention for goodwill for ourselves and others, how the landing, the planting of that seed of intention, how it helps metta flower, not just in our practice, but in our daily lives. 
As I mentioned in the way of, in our daily lives, with a reflection, what am I planting here? What seed am I planting here? Is it a seed of metta, goodwill? Is it a seed of ill-will I'm actually planting for myself or for others? So, relating really that contemplation about the intention to the seed you're planting and the defruits, that will be resulting. 
And vice versa, as we cultivate, as we cultivate metta, goodwill, friendliness, love, we'll see that it strengthens our intentionality. 
It strengthens the sense of alignment with our true values, with our true intentions in the world. 
We can access them more easily, more readily. 
They'll become more easily available without us living too far from them. 
So, by cultivating goodwill and friendliness and acting out of it, we'll be closer, we'll be living closer to our true intentions. 
The way we really want to live our life, even though every moment it may not show up that way, but we can become more aligned with our true intentions in the way we want to show up in this human life, in this limited, precious, impermanent gift that is our human life. 
So, with that, let's embark on our journey together. 
So, I'd like to invite you to the entire meditation posture, whatever might be supportive to you in this moment, sitting maybe upright a little more or relaxing the body more, maybe lying down for each and every one of us might be different in this moment. 
What is supportive? What posture? And connecting with your intention in this moment. 
Let's start with the intention. 
Ah! Maybe dropping in the inquiry. 
What is my intention? For this period of practice. 
Dropping in the question into your body, not into your head. 
Dropping this question, letting your body reverberate and see what answer comes up. 
You might be surprised as to what comes up. 
Embracing, allowing whatever is arising, whatever reverberation, or maybe nothing comes up. 
I just want to sit and be guided, that's fine too. 
Whatever comes up or doesn't come up. 
Ah! And sitting with the wholesomeness, with the goodness. 
Appreciating your intention. 
Treating this beauty, the beauty of this intention as a gift in your heart. 
Honoring it. 
As if you had an altar on your mind. 
Putting your beautiful intention on the altar of your heart, your mind. 
As an offering. 
Offering your intention in this moment. 
To life itself. 
Offering it to life as it is offered to you. 
Offering it to yourself and to life, this intention. 
And delighting. 
Letting yourself delight. 
This grace and beauty. 
The wholesomeness. 
Now letting this intention to reverberate again in your whole body. 
The goodness of it. 
Calming, soothing, nourishing your heart. 
Calming and soothing your body. 
Letting your body feel relaxed, open. 
Landing. 
More deeply. 
Onto itself. 
Letting the weight, the inner weight, the center of gravity internally. 
Ah, letting it drop down, drop down from your head. 
Ah, into your abdomen, into your sit bones. 
Landing inside yourself. 
If you need to land further, further down into your feet, your legs. 
Ah. 
Inviting your breath. 
To receive. 
To be received in your abdomen and also to receive all parts of your body. 
Your body receives your breath. 
Your breath receives your body. 
Just a moment of refuge. 
Sitting, being breathed. 
Nothing to do, nowhere to go. 
Resting in the here and now. 
Resting in the here and now. 
Resting in the here and now. 
And if you notice thoughts arising, memories, plans, it's okay. 
Acknowledging, noticing what's arising. 
And offering it up as if you were putting it on the altar. 
Imaginary, alter of your mind where you put your wholesome intentions as an offering. 
Offering up the worries, the plans, the thoughts. 
There's nothing wrong with thinking per se. 
At this moment, offering them up and taking refuge, the simplicity of just sitting and being breathed. 
The deliciousness of it. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Now I would like to invite you, if you wish, for a moment to imagine yourself in your daily life. 
Imagine yourself sitting, walking, interacting with people in your life. 
Maybe in this image you are interacting with them physically or on the phone, having a conversation with them. 
Or in a video chat, whatever is realistic for you. 
And then this vision, asking yourself, how do I want to show up? What do I want to cultivate? What is my intention? How do I want to be in this interaction? What is my intention in relating with this being? Is there, can there be an intention? Of goodwill and care? And just to say as you drop to the question of what is my intention in this imagined interaction, you might have seen a range of intentions, some of them wholesome, some of them not so wholesome. 
It's okay, don't judge yourself. 
All of us humans, we are a mixed bag. 
And to be completely honest with ourselves. 
Sometimes we can see both the wholesome intention, oh I want to care for this being. 
I want them to know that I care for them. 
I love them. 
And also you might see, oh I want them to see me, to like me, to care for me. 
Nothing wrong with any of this. 
It's just being human. 
No need to judge oneself. 
That our intentions aren't 100% pure in just giving and loving. 
Okay, so whatever came up for you is alright. 
As long as there can be, there can be an intention. 
The turning or heart towards seeding, planting the seed of goodwill and kindness. 
If that is part of your intention, that you're planting. 
See how it might feel in this imagined interaction with this being. 
If you kept your intention for goodwill, for care, for kindness, friendliness, love, non-harming. 
If you kept that front and center, what would it feel like in your body, in your mind? Notice what arises in your heart, your body and your mind in this moment, imagining this. 
Can you feel a sense of metta, a sense of goodwill, of care, caring for this being, radiating, imagining interacting with them? Just resting, connecting with this intention for metta. 
And seeing what it feels like in an imagined interaction. 
How it might show up differently, energetically. 
And seeing what it feels like in an imagined interaction. 
And seeing what it feels like in an imagined interaction. 
And now bowing to this image, to this being, it's served you. 
And I'd like to invite you. 
If you would bring up perhaps a memory of some time today, yesterday, the past few days, maybe, where you were judgmental with yourself, judging yourself, chastising yourself. 
Or you shouldn't have done that. 
Oh, that was terrible. 
Or you should have done this. 
Flogging yourself in some way, whatever version, whatever nuance, and just bringing that to mind. 
And asking yourself, what am I planting in this moment? What was I planting with myself? Fiddling, feeling small and little so that you would behave better? Making one small, whether oneself or others, doesn't quite work. 
You have the intended consequences. 
Acknowledging perhaps the mistake, kindly, understanding the causes, conditions that led to it. 
Acknowledging, seeing, being mindful with care. 
Then moving on. 
See if it's possible to connect with an intention of care for yourself. 
This being whom you are the steward of, you're the guardian of. 
To connect with a sense of care, with an intention of caring, taking care of, supporting. 
If you are saying to yourself, I care for you. 
I care for you, sweetie. 
You know, maybe this was a mistake, and I care for you. 
It's okay. 
You understand, I acknowledge the causes and conditions that gave rise to it. 
I see it clearly, and it's okay. 
I hold you with care, with friendliness. 
It's alright. 
If you could have done better, you would have done better, or differently. 
The causes and conditions were different. 
They weren't, so this resulted. 
Offering and understanding, care, friendliness to yourself. 
Seeing how this feels, connecting with the intention of friendliness, forgiveness, care for yourself. 
How this feels in your mind's eye, in your heart, in your body. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Now, I want to invite you, if you wish, to bow to this image, the sense of mental care for yourself. 
And now, inviting another image from your daily life, perhaps, in a moment when you were ruminating, you were upset and angry with someone, and your mind was lost in its story-making and its justification. 
They did this, they did that, they hurt me, they shouldn't have done this. 
And ask yourself, in the midst of this perhaps sense of ill will, anger, resentment, what am I planting? What seeds am I planting in my heart and mind? What am I training myself in, in this moment? What is my intention? Do I want to show up with ill will and anger? Resentment. 
Of course, not condoning the hurt, not condoning the damage, knowing that there are wise actions to be taken, but not out of ill will, not out of hatred. 
You can take wise action out of care, out of love for yourself, who's hurting and out of care for the other being too, for both of you entangled, out of care for both of you and all the people entangled, impacted by this. 
Can you connect? Can there be a connection to the intention for care all around? All of you, all of us entangled. 
Connecting with the intention of good will. 
Connecting with the seeds you want to plant. 
And take action, wise action, out of care. 
See if you can connect with this intention of metta. 
For yourself and for the other being or beings. 
Connecting with the intention of good will. 
May we all be well, may we enjoy safety, happiness, health and ease. 
Thank you all. 
Thank you all for your practice. 
I would like to invite us to share reflections, be it a word or a phrase, you can type it in chat or unmute yourself and share. 
And the question, the reflection is exploring the relationship between intention tonight, intention for good will in your interaction with another being that's close to you. 
Intention for care, friendliness to yourself, perhaps in the moment of judgment and intention of metta, care, friendliness for yourself and others in the midst of entanglement. 
What you may have observed what's coming up for you, I'll start by sharing one piece of my own practice tonight with a dear being, seeing the various intentions in the interaction and just leaning into the good will for them. 
Just shifted the energy, the interaction became more generous, just concerned for them, how are you, not needing anything back, which is really interesting to see. 
So please feel free to share whatever you noticed, your wisdom. 
Bill, thank you for offering the importance of mental habits and the stories we tell ourselves. 
Yeah, thank you for that. 
Do you want to say a little more about that perhaps? We can just let it rest. 
It's all good. 
Thank you for offering that. 
It's very important to notice the mental habits and whether what the intention is, what are we planting with all these mental habits and the stories we tell ourselves. 
Thank you Nav, offering intention feels like a stone dropped in a pond. 
The ripples start there. 
Yep, indeed. 
Hence the importance of it in Buddhist teaching. 
And I love the image you're offering. 
The ripples start there. 
Poetic and beautiful imagery that can stay in the mind. 
Yeah, thank you Paula for offering metta for self is one of the biggest challenges of your practice for many people. 
We often, we are often much more generous to other people in our practice in our hearts, the way we treat ourselves if we treated other people good heavens. 
We wouldn't do that we wouldn't treat other people the way we treat ourselves sometimes. 
So yes, thank you for sharing that the reality of that and and having shared this practice of metta with so many beings that fortunately or well it is what it is it is true for many, many beings. 
So it's important to realize that that's where the challenges and and give even more love and care to yourself. 
Yeah, and thank you Don offering on YouTube the reflection that when we are focusing on ourselves and image of myself as a young child came up. 
It was very helpful to help me feel more gently towards myself. 
Beautiful. 
Thank you Don for offering that it's skillful means what this practice of metta is a skillful means practice whatever works and image of oneself as a young child is one is one invitation. 
I use I've used many times and to conjure up a sense of, you know, we tend to have more care for younger versions for little ones of ourselves as it was so beautiful that it came up for you in your practice Don. 
Holly offers in the enlightenment meditation I noticed in sorry in the entanglement meditation I noticed that underneath I felt vulnerable and I saw their vulnerability to was easier to get the kindness from there. 
Thank you Holly this is profound right a profound insight that you're sharing to see one's own vulnerability with and the other persons to and can open the heart. 
Thank you so much for sharing that. 
And Yuka offers I noticed the way to automatically proceed unconsciously. 
It seems my chest has found a door that should open not only on that side, but on the inside. 
Lovely. 
Thank you for sharing that beautiful, beautiful imagery there too. 
Thank you all for sharing your beautiful practices. 
So I'd like to invite us. 
One more reflection before we go from Sheila. 
I try to set up an intention for peace for myself and others. 
It's hard for me to give care to myself care for loved ones. 
No problem. 
I tend I tend to add self fledgulate self castigate self torment, but I'm learning to send love to myself. 
Beautiful Sheila. 
Thank you for sharing that and and and letting yourself be held witness in in how both this is challenging and how you are learning to send love to yourself. 
I applaud and hold your beautiful intention for this cultivation and I invite the Sangha to join in holding your beautiful intention as if you're putting it on the altar of the Sangha and we're all holding it with you. 
Both you and also Paula who shared shared earlier that that self meta is the biggest challenge and I invite all of you who have this challenge to actually put your intention on the altar of the community in this moment and all of us are holding it with you. 
This beautiful intention for more self care and self meta. 
Yeah. 
And Susan offers I'm on call for dog walk, or I'd be on the zoom call with you all. 
Oh, thank you, Susan. 
I brought you all into my heart and my heart swelled. 
Oh, that's lovely. 
Thank you, Susan. 
Offering from you too. 
Beautiful. 
So now I'd like to invite us to if it's right for you at this time this evening this morning to join in community practice and the invitation today would be as we get into small groups to plan the seed of intention of care for yourself. 
Primarily, actually, primarily care for yourself and also intention of care for others so that whatever might be said might ever might come out of your mouth would be held with meta lack of judgment without wanting to appear a particular way or impress just held with care just held with care. 
Maybe even an image of a younger version of yourself if that's supportive. 
And thanks to dawn for bringing that into the space so I would like to invite you to to practice in this way and the prompt always is, what was this practice like for you there's no right or wrong and say I fell asleep didn't like it. 
It's not so much so much what you say, but how you show up for yourself and for others. 
So, and if it's not appropriate for you, participate tonight. 
It's all good. 
You can bow out. 
It's fine. 
And I'm going to create excuse me the breakout rooms now. 
And see here. 
Yes, so they are either size three or or two to make them size for maybe sign. 
Oh, wait, it keeps. 
Okay, no, they're all of size three now. 
Here we go. 
Okay, keeps changing. 
All right, here we go everyone intention intention. 
Remember intention. 
Okay. 
Welcome back everyone. 
We have a few minutes for sharing reflections and reports from the field from your practice, either in community or, or in meditation so please take it away. 
Feel free to unmute yourself and share reflections questions. 
If I speak, of course, please. 
I want to share that that for me intention is setting intention is a dynamic process. 
And I think people in my group have shared that that is especially as we talked other people interact that I find I have to reset my intention. 
It's not a single one time thing for the day. 
Very dynamic. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Thank you for sharing that observation both for yourself and, and from your, and your traction in the group. 
I guess the question that I would put forth is something to reflect perhaps is, is, you know, are there a set of, of general underlying intentions in your life that are the north star. 
And then out of those, in a given moment, a different kind of intention and nuance could be set. 
Is that, is that what you're referring to? Am I understanding you correctly? Yeah, so I, I, I do. 
I do have north star intentions and loving kindness intentions. 
And what I find when I interact with people, it's, it takes, especially in charged situations, that intention goes into the background. 
And if the dynamic part is bringing that back up, bringing that back into the present. 
And in times where there's difficult interactions, sometimes that happens much later coming back to that state. 
Got it. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Thank you for sharing the, the, the nuances of especially in, in the observations of, in the charged situation of interaction. 
Yeah, the, the, the wholesome say the meta can take the back, the backsies like way it's gone away. 
What happened to that? And maybe sometimes after the fact, like, oh, that's what I want to be. 
That's how I want to be showing up. 
Of course, beautiful. 
So, so I so appreciate you bringing up and, and, and also reflecting on your conversation with the group, the realities of how intention shows up in our day to day moment to moment interact. 
It's not clean and rosy. 
Oh yeah, you said your intention for the morning and you're just beaming metal. 
There's like, oh yeah, I forgot it. 
Wow. 
I wanted to show up with, with, you know, my intention was wise, wise, wise speech and gosh, I just, whoops. 
Okay. 
Like, let's remember that. 
So, so great. 
I appreciate that. 
I better understand. 
Yeah. 
Of course, of course, of course, bring me to the forefront. 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
And I appreciate just offering like practice remembering to return to the intention, like we do to the object in our practice. 
Yeah, exactly. 
Beautiful. 
And, and it's the remembering, you know, the same way that we have an intention. 
For example, with mindfulness, we have the intention and it doesn't quite matter what the object is that we're mindful of. 
We might be mindful of our emotions of our thoughts of this or that, but, but having that setting that intention sometimes we just have to keep remembering, keep remembering, keep remembering so bringing back to our, to our north stars. 
So, well, time flies when you're practicing metta and reflecting on intention. 
It's already seven o'clock Pacific time. 
Nine pm Eastern. 
Gosh, I should I go through all the times and now what time is it Yuka nine am Okay, I'll stop nine am in in Japan, 10 am maybe in Singapore. 
Did I get that right. 
Yes. 
Anyway, yeah, you got it right. 
All right. 
Okay, well, it's time. 
Thank you, sangha. 
It's been lovely to practice with you and just it warms my heart and I just so appreciate it also. 
Just to say one thing that came up for me in our group practice tonight was reflecting on intentions the reality of it aligning with it daily daily. 
Also, the moment that we all hypothetically or actually in our minds we put our intentions for more kindness to ourselves on the altar and all of us supporting that will stay with me for the rest of the evening so thank you all for your practice. 
May you all be safe, happy, healthy and have ease. 
Thank you all. 
Take care. 
See you on Monday. 
Good night. 
Good night. 
Good morning. 
Bye. 
Bye.
