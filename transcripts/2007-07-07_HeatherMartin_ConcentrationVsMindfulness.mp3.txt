 Now I'd like to share with you some of the ways of practicing the Utejaniya teachers. Just a little bit of background, I've never been to Burma before last November so it's my first trip. I've been in Asia briefly three months at an ashram in my early 20s in the north of India and that's it. Never been to Asia otherwise so that in itself was an adventure I must tell you and I went for the month of November and into December and partly it was challenging just because it isn't the West. It was very hot and very sweaty and smoky and noisy and dirty and full of flies and mosquitoes and all those sorts of regular challenges that happen and I'd never been with a Burmese teacher before here or there so that was absolutely fascinating and I have been to retreats for years and years and years and some very quiet long very sensitive experiences in retreats and this retreat Utejaniya doesn't require that people don't talk. Talk if you feel like talking he says but know why you're talking and don't just walk up and down a little narrow groove just because when you do your walking practice decide where you want to walk and why you want to walk there and how you want to walk there so that you know for yourself what's helpful for you but don't just do it because there's a form. He said I don't believe in any kind of forms just imposing forms and so most people would whamble up and down the length of this six acre compound sort of the main street in the middle of it talking and people were talking in the meditation hall sometimes and so on so forth so of course when you're used to everything being very regulated and just so it's like sometimes some loudest conversations were going on in meditation hall so it being there was challenging and changed some of my fond views of things it's very interesting when that happens because it makes you think why these my fond views like why do I believe this is important you know if this is different here so on it's very useful it was also very useful for me in that I was really uncomfortable to begin with and I was too hard I wasn't sleeping I didn't know how to keep the mosquitoes out from underneath my mosquito net I've seemed to trap them in there with me and took a while before I knew how to they weren't sort of very efficient cleaning supplies how to clean all the bugs off from underneath my bed so that the cockroaches weren't running a lot over the net at night and so on so forth so there was plenty of this kind of thing and for a while for the first week or so especially with all the radios blaring from 4 a.m. until 2 a.m. constantly very loud either musical singing which is a matter of choice and taste or party political broadcast basically the generals doing their political propaganda rah rah or Buddhist chanting coming blaring out one or the other or the other full tilt many hours a day not every day but in the beginning with what was noisier etc I spent this first week arranging organizing cleaning figuring out the systems and basically planning to leave and I was I somewhat foolishly maybe was given a friend of mine lent to me a lonely planet guide Burma when I went so I was part of my scheming to leave this reading about these other cooler cleaner places in Burma that I could go I was thinking of other retreat centers which were maybe in the hills or it was quiet and the way I thought a retreat shelter should be run anyway it wasn't until I was asked and able to answer the question do you think it'd be possible to not sleep very well and to have a lot of smoke and to have dogs barking it and radios blaring and mosquitoes and and not so clean and smoke in the air and stinky open drains and be okay that I was able to say to myself why did I come to Burma did I come to be comfortable I live in the greatest comfort I actually am interested in being free not in being comfortable and if I can be okay in the midst of this I can definitely be okay anywhere and so what is it stopping me being okay not just the lonely planet guide and so I relaxed about the conditions I also figured them out somewhat and learned my system and so on enough for my own company got I got somebody to buy Burmese tea kind of sachets of powder sort of like the sweepings of tea not really leaves and plus some kind of sweetener plus some kind of non-dairy thing in a little sachets with hotish water at four o'clock in the afternoon that helped me once I've organized my little comforts clean the bathrooms clean off the bugs underneath my bed learned about the mosquito nets that all helped but basically it was a change in my attitude to be able to just look and see the struggle that I was causing myself of course it's not about what happens it's about how we deal with it what we make of it how we translate experience into whether it's okay or not whether I'm okay or not and of course I was blaming all of the outer conditions knowing full well theoretically but forgetting for the moment that my happiness wasn't actually dependent on them and then I was able to apply myself to his teachings and then what I discovered was I did my usual form of practice well my usual is a practice that I've been practicing for many years and and I have done a fair amount of concentration practice including certain amount of jhana practice with the use of on upon a study and and one retreat for a month with jhana practice with meta mettajanas and and so I proceeded to attempt to do my normal concentration type of practice and was being asked by uttajaniya to notice my thinking process well what was happening was my thinking process was no longer happening would happen and a thought would come and go very quickly because I was concentrated and so he would be asking you know to notice when a thought happens why that thought happened and what happened to that thought and what the next thoughts were and so on which I couldn't do because they disappeared too quickly until it was realized that I was becoming so concentrated that I couldn't actually experience one's normal experience one's normal process in the world how somebody says something and it makes you feel like something and then you think certain thoughts because my mind was so quiet that that process was not cut short but it just the chain of events just is broken really fast and so it's like no no no not so much concentration that's too intense less concentration so I was like less concentration I kind of thought concentration was and so the less concentration hmm what I learned was that I started looking at my level of concentration which I sort of just assumed before not really examined now I was noticing how I liked it and how I believed in it and how protected I felt by it and how the irritating music wasn't so irritating when I was very concentrated because I was screening it right out and how I could find that just the sensations of sweating and sweat dripping down my body were just interesting sensations rather than being problematic because my mind was able to be calm and I began to discover how protected I was when I was concentrated protected from the vagaries of thought and thought trains and opinions and it was actually a place to go as a refuge to the mind to be quiet and concentrated which I knew in theory but I hadn't realized quite how much I believed in plus I saw how I really liked knowing what I was doing and I really like being able to concentrate because I knew I could because I had a lot and how that felt comforting and how I felt like secure because I knew what to do and that I was doing it okay and that it was working and it was measurable and I was therefore fine and that my identity was involved with doing something well and that felt good and all kinds of things about it that I had never really I had never questioned really we all know that we need a certain amount of concentration concentration the training of the mind to be steady rather than all over the place reacting thinking willy-nilly coming up with all kinds of responses and we're not at all in control of that we know we need to train the mind somewhat a lot of us and I'm certainly one had spent many years developing concentration but just thinking a little bit more concentration just don't just calm down a little bit more let me just stay a little bit longer with my breath and like making that the main feature who tation is this very interesting thing I didn't hear him say this actually until I was with him for the second time just this last May if concentration is worth a dollar the persona is worth ten thousand dollars that's his opinion of concentration so concentration concentration actually one of the most important ways of thinking of it is it's steadying but an important ways unit unifying it so that our attention can be fully engaged with something rather than dispersed into ten thousand things all over the place so it's a gathering together I've said this I don't know if you've heard me say this but one of my images forgetting the mind to be concentrated is like taking all the ingredients you're going to make into a loaf of bread if you're anyone's ever made bread and then kneading it and when you need and need to need it's the actual work of concentrating the mind so that what happens after some time you hold this lump of dough up and it doesn't all fall apart if you if you held a handful of the ingredients before you kneaded it it would just be a bunch of scattered mess but after it's kneaded it holds itself together like it's one thing instead of many ingredients that's what I think of as concentrating the mind unifying the attention so that it's now a useful thing something you can make something of a tool that you can direct deliberately but it doesn't mean just staying with one thing staying on one task that's a way of doing it just keep paying attention to the breath or just keep paying attention to the body or whatever the steps that's a way of developing a concentrated mind but it isn't the only way and it's the way that a lot of us and I'm one have thought of concentration and particularly having done Jhana practice which is concentration to the nth degree where you become so aware of the one thing you're noticing the object of your concentration that you merge your consciousness with it there's absolutely no anything else in consciousness there's that the sense of I am looking at something I'm noticing something disappears to the point that there is just an absorption it's called absorption that's what Jhana practice means so that's like so one-pointed it's just there is nothing but this one point concentration practice especially the way Ute Jhana teaches it is a consistency of awareness it's a continue continuity of awareness and he uses often the word momentum the momentum that continues all the time from the moment you raise your head in the morning open your eyes till you fall asleep at night that you're consistently noticing what's going on that's what he calls a concentrated mind one that doesn't keep spaced spacing out and forgetting and going into the past in the future but this constantly aware but not necessarily of just one thing it's the continuous awareness itself that he considers is the value of concentration we know that there's value in in Jhana practice and the Buddha describes it and there's there's a lot of benefit other you know there's the obvious benefit of training the mind so it becomes well behaved when we do concentration practice but there is a sense of deep nourishment that comes from a very quiet mind where there is such a the pleasure of the peace of a quiet mind really teaches us that other forms of pleasure aren't so pleasurable in comparison there's something so nourishing deeply to the cells when there's calm in the mind like that it's like delicious the downside of that of course is that you want it and that when you've encountered something that's lovely or you feel really good about it you want it back I don't know if it was to you or any of you and one of the times talking to you in the last few days but Steve Armstrong said this thing and I'll never forget it when he said it there's nothing like a good sitting talking about a day of practice or nothing like a good sitting to ruin your whole day because then it you know that's it's gone and then what and there's something wrong and you spend your entire time and Utejnayas says the same thing the seed of everything look pleasant there's dukkha the seed of dukkha in it which of course is that then it's a standard a measure a thing to want to get to feel proud about or pleased about or grateful for or something that's a setup then to try and regain it or or to judge because it's not there or something it isn't just seen for itself it's seen we give it meaning and then add you know our expectation and so on so forth there are different techniques there are different objects to be aware to train the mind in concentration as I'm sure you know in our practice we generally will use the body or the specific part of the body breathing or loving kindness phrases as a for a concentration technique some people it's a casino an actual visual shape of some form all of praying is concentrating the mind mantras are concentrating the mind visualizations and so on so forth many many different objects the Buddha taught 40 that's just a Buddha you know there's many other forms and so on so it isn't actually about the method it's the training of the mind which is concentration and what happens is the mind does become more malleable like bread dough is it becomes more serene not just scattered but there's a serenity and a gentleness that happens in the mind and the roughness of an agitated mind is revealed as the mind gets more calm so serenity practice is one of the words that's used a lot like calm water one of the things that happens when the mind is concentrated is for the time that the mind is calm serene steady stable seemingly our own rather than someone else running it hindrances are at bay we aren't then wanting something else we aren't then resistant to what is we aren't then agitated we aren't then dull we aren't doubting anything we're just present easy fine which again is a relief I mean it feels great to not be just beset by any of those hindrances so there's a pleasure in concentrating the mind the Buddhist said the absorption meaning Jhana practice is blissful in the present and will result in bliss in the future absorption is peaceful exquisite the acquiring of serenity the attainment of unity and not kept in place by the fabrications of forceful restraint so this is a piece about concentration which in the earlier days of my practice was just mind-boggling to believe is true I remember one of my teachers saying concentration is relaxation and to me concentration was downright hard work you know grit your teeth and just like really nail yourself there you know stay stay stay I remember one time walking I practice quite a lot if I can at Gaia house which is in England because I like to have holidays in England and I remember walking up down the hallway upstairs in this dry house and having an image of my mind being like a flapping bird there is this plastic bird on the end of a it's like a plastic on the road down the road here right and when it's really windy it just exactly like that this kind of crazy flapping thing and my attempt is to like nail it down and it just flaps and flaps and nail it down I remember seeing the efforting of trying to hold this mind that wanted to flap all over the place hold it steady and so initially there was a certain amount of work but as it steadies which it just does eventually gives up slows down less and less effort is required and then it's more and more rest resting in the present moment than trying to stay in the present moment but that was a factor of time but I remember thinking God wouldn't that be amazing to be relaxed some people can relax that the concentration is relaxing for them and for some people it's work to bring the mind more present but I remember discovering the pleasure of being able to relax more and more and basically trust that if I just stay here with some interest my mind will calm down rather than that I must do it as a striving personality type a you know try to dominate myself so those are some of the benefits of concentration and a couple of things that for the sake of concentration of one of the things that is taught by the Buddha there are these two wings there's so many ways of comparing how we how we see the teachings but anyway there are this particular way is saying two wings like of a bird I'm on bird mode today one is Shammata practice of concentration and one is the persona or insight practice and we need them both you cannot fly with only one wing so if you just get concentrated then you never actually see what's really going on of course it's the scene what's really going on that frees us if you just look and see what's going on without a mind that's stable it's going to react and get confused and not see clearly so we need them both together some of the just a couple of things to say more about concentration to develop it or to enhance it or to nourish it is a happy heart to feel content to feel at ease to feel good is really helpful it's really hard to concentrate because you should or because you know when you're feeling like dutiful or any kind of judging or harshness the mind does not want to do it it really is much it's happier to settle down when it's happy and so it really is necessary to do whatever it takes to feel at ease whether that's forgiveness or reflecting on the things which give you confidence and faith refuge is taking it's a nice thing to do things like this I've done self-matter and then found my mind really really calm and able to get very concentrated because my heart was at peace because I'd spent some time befriending myself for instance so gladdening the heart really supports a concentrated mind relaxation as I just was saying relaxation will only come when we trust when we don't trust our practice we think we have to do it we think we have to run it and make it happen and we don't really trust it then so we resort to willpower when we trust that the mind actually does have the capacity to calm down and if we're simply patient and over and over keep being curious we find it doesn't have to be such a force and then it can relax so confidence works with that for sure the key thing really for concentration is the continuity of being aware without any question of a doubt in my mind continuity is the key for concentration it's like steady steady steady keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it keep being present keep being interested just however simple it may be whenever the mind says oh god I don't know what the point of this is when I was going on keep going keep going and those moments when suddenly we realize I'm completely here and I don't know what happened or what changed but here I just fully engage it's all those hours of continuously being applying myself to mostly asking what's happening what's happening looking being interested who to engineer says a concentrated mind it's it isn't like a hundred-yard dash it's like a marathon so it isn't like supreme effort grit your teeth and really get it now it's just gently that keep keep going like you do when it's marathon like that steadiness so I really think concentration has that quality to studying my first teacher of a past in a teacher was going and and he had a very deep he has a very deep voice the Indian accent and he would say booming in this deep voice continuity is the secret of success you know how you are the teachers when you hear them enough they could reverberate around around your brains I hear his voice continuity is the secret of success but of course concentration just by itself can split atoms shatter glass do extraordinary things you know who David Blaine is of course you know David Blaine this extraordinary magician he's you know I saw him not long ago had a bunch of people that out of some restaurant standing around a table holding hands concentrating on the wine glass in the middle of the table everybody keep looking keep looking everyone's looking and suddenly it just shattered wines all over the table stuff like that concentration can do extraordinary things but that's not by itself but really it's gonna help us clever entertaining when it's you know in the teachings of the Four Noble Truths the eightfold path right concentration is the last of these ones what I mean and I don't really I am wary of the word right because it's so close to wrong and so ready for judgment and things but wholesome or wise concentration what this means in the eightfold path concentration is concentration with Dharma view with wholesome view with not the ego view doesn't just mean a concentrated mind I want this I'm going to shatter the wine glass it is seeing the truth clearly with a concentrated mind a steady mind so it's a wise concentrated mind not just a concentrated mind which brings us to why we need both of these two together shamata and a concentration there are some traps in concentration and Buddha uttajaniya really does talk about these a lot and it was really quite interesting and so when you look at it when I've been looking at it I've really seen the limitations to some of this and I've told you some of it what I was seeing we probably one of the biggest ones is that you get attached to it because it feels good and you like it and you think you're right in doing it and so we don't question things when they feel good we question things when they don't feel good one of the motivations to practice is struggling because it makes us think there's got to be some other way but when things are going fine we generally go great I'm not going to ask any questions then you know so it's actually useful to query so what what's my relationship to concentration that was really what was so revealing for me we the thing about concentration also is that we it's goal oriented I want a concentrated mind I want my mind to stay on my breath so it's like there's a striving there's an intention about concentration which the person doesn't have it's directed its target is the word that you take knees all the time there's a kind of closeness to it because what you're interested in is the thing you're paying attention to but then you're missing everything else for instance I was there practicing the monastery walking up and down doing walking practice quietly silently noticing my body noticing the breeze noticing the stinky smell noticing the smoke noticing the movement of the cloth on my legs and all the usual things that I'd noticed while doing walking practice diligently just being present but because I was changing my practice to include my my state of mind which I had just let be in the background I hadn't really given a lot of attention to because I was I'm very embodied and I was very able to do that suddenly I remember the day this happened loudly there seemed to be a whole city going on inside my head there was like a thousand thoughts going on making a comment I'd seen somebody wearing certain clothes what did they think I wonder if they knew that there to do wonder what other people thought was such a young American woman and she wasn't wearing a bra and she was wearing it as a monastery and there all these monks and nuns and what would be like for them suddenly this whole other lot of dialogue going on in my brain showed up of course it wasn't just beginning it had been going along all the time but I had been focusing on what I thought I should be focusing on and I had been missing this whole massive amount of activity I remember going to rotation here saying like I can't believe how much is going on in my mind and he's like well of course if you're alive he's like nodding and smiling there is a ton going on all the time in what we're thinking about but we by concentration can tune it out at very least tune it out you know if not block it out it's measurable when you you can see how you doing when people say I had a good sit what they mean is my mind was somewhat concentrated and I could measure that and that felt okay but when they people come to talk to a teacher you know and in interviews they generally don't say you know that was a completely lousy sit my mind was all over the place well even if they would say if my mind was all over the place they would judge that that was a bad sitting because we think it's good to be calm and serene and present which means we're not actually open to when it's not like that well lots of the time it's not like that and so we don't realize we just assume something about this concentration means certain thing and right so it's dangerous the person on the other hand the person is not excluding anything it's inclusive of anything everything whatever it's not targeting it's not protected you're open to whatever may happen good bad or indifferent so you begin to realize how nice it is to exclude the things you don't like and just focus on the things you do like it's actually a protection there's no protection with a person it's completely open as I shifted our attention today when I was talking about going to hearing sounds are going to come whatever they are you're not able to exclude them the person is an openness in that way it's allowing whatever is happening it's not controlling anything it's not controlling your mind not controlling it's just available it's actually very much more vulnerable it's very much more stimulating it's very interesting not the concentration isn't interesting but it's interesting in that there's an awful lot going on in fact once we open our minds up to it once we start tuning in it's embarrassing sometimes it's busy you cannot measure it in the same way you can if you have a standard of behavior like you do with with the concentration there's no standard it's whatever's happening and so you can kind of it can you can feel confused so we tend to go for the concentration because it's manageable it's doable it's recognizable it's measurable it's protective you know we were such doers it's a doing practice but person is a being practice here we are being present with whatever there's a hanging on with concentration because you're deliberately holding staying with being with the person is letting go letting go letting go letting go whatever's here whatever goes things that is coming and going there's no holding on at all is really different narrow narrow narrow concentration wide wide wide wide for person to practice is creative you can sort of create what you want to pay attention to the possible practice is you're not doing anything about it you're just recognizing what's already here some of the practice is to have something happen the personal practice is to investigate what is happening way more passive some of the practice in the way is to get something serenity the personal practice is to know what is very interesting when we look at it like this and I hadn't looked at it in a critical way what my practice was and what what was happening when we do the personal practice with this open kind of a mind without excluding anything the danger of course is that the mind could get so stimulated that it can stimulate itself into lots of the puncture lots of thinking lots of comments this is the danger which is why you can't just do the person without any kind of concentration an untrained mind is very hard for it to stay present and not get caught into commentary when it's almost stimulus so it's actually easier to do it when we go to a quiet place you know everything's taken care of a retreat center or and so on so forth you don't have random wildness it's relatively you know control the takeaway radios and they take away responsibilities and phones and all the rest of it to make it easier so it's challenging to do the pasta without some kind of limits to what you're being aware of but we have got at least I must speak for myself I have got over many years attached to a certain kind of experience to be able to be quiet with rather than be completely at ease with whatever is happening and that was so and for instance here I was in in this uncomfortable setup struggling away even though I know poverty well it was sufficiently struggling unpleasant that I was justifying all my escape planning and actually you know that's really missing the point so the parameter practice can be you're like what am I looking at I want to be looking at just this but personal practice is like what is here what is there it's just plain curious it's not limited in any way it's very interesting when serenity shamata concentration these are all interchangeable words by the way of course you know is developed it leads to concentration and the liberation of the mind from emotional defilements in other words the hindrances are at bay so it's protective in that way when insight the person has developed it leads to the higher wisdom of insight into the true nature of phenomena and permanently liberate the mind from ignorance so serenity practice concentration practice is temporarily helpful but it isn't permanently helpful what permanently helps us be free is to is to see really clearly of course how everything works the truth of everything and not just everything works it's actually how does our mind work we see how phenomena happens and how our mind makes something of it makes problems of it makes projects of it makes desires and so on so forth so we know this to be so but do you have a relationship with concentration and the person of one dollar to ten thousand dollars I had probably 5050 maybe even 60 on concentration 40 on the bus even though I know the person is what liberates my work in my practice was about concentration and it's not so it's nothing like the same extent these days it's easy for me to say that though because I've had many years of concentration so my mind has been trained a lot and so it doesn't get so lost in thought than it would if it hadn't so who's to say how I would have done if I had never done any concentration practice but we've all done some I just think what I want to say is that don't spend your entire time trying to concentrate yourself in sitting allow yourself to trust that really what's interesting is to see what we turn our experiences into in the way of a project in other words let the experiences come they are whatever they are sounds sites thoughts memories reactions to things watch then what you do because that is where you're caught or not caught even if you're temporarily not caught while getting serene that actually isn't really freedom is just temporarily an escape which is valuable to certain extent especially if you're all stressed out you know life is difficult you want to calm down fair enough train yourself fair enough but generally that's not actually going to service anything like seeing what am I turning this experience into now there was what's my reaction what's my attitude in response to this situation any and every situation tiny brief little then more and more the concentration the stabilizing the momentum does get established but it isn't in choosing any one thing the thing that you choose at least this is what you take a new teachers is the watching of the attitude itself so that what becomes really really steady is how's my attitude has managed you have my attitude is the tuning into is my attitude contracting around something involved with something turning something into a project or is it open relaxed back spacious steady is it tangled up in involvement he says in he says what gets involved with the things that happen to us is the defilements the defilements agreed hatred and delusion the defilements are how the ego is turning making life into a project making an experience into something that we have to get more of a lesser struggle in fact with explain away or something it's greed hatred and delusion that does that when there is no ego manifesting life is just flowing on it's the river of life and there's no project of it just is what's happening knowingly so where is your ego your ego is greed hatred and delusion your involvement your manipulation your struggle are you struggling in this moment or are you at peace in this moment is there space is curiosity a kind heart or is there some tension some holding some struggling how do you experience that what's happening right now and for me this is I know I've said some of you this I don't remember who and I said what over the last couple of weeks but there's a I tuned a lot into this feeling in this area of my chest it's around my heart area and I just that's where I can most easily feel energetically if there's a contraction here it's like oh oh oh what this don't like this trouble that it's a kind of literally a physical tightening here some energy holding here and what goes on when I watch is a bunch of thinking storytelling commenting explaining and all the rest of that but I can actually sense it physically energetically in here and so that's what I try and make my consistent practice how's this how's this and I can do it through my thinking by noticing I'm thinking all these thoughts but I can do it more for me it's more accessible to actually know that I'm struggling I use that word and there's some kind of catch I'm caught up or and there's a sense of quiet in here peaceful just open this is interesting this is what's happening so for instance that we're any of you here on Monday night on Monday night I didn't know what nurse to say will you hear some of you I was you know all these times I'm teaching you each time I got to give a Dharma talk right well sometimes you just can't come up with a Dharma talk I can't and I couldn't and I tried really hard for the day and a half and I just did I tried this topic this topic I couldn't and I was sitting here thinking you know all these room full of people coming to listen to the Dharma and I don't know what to say it's quite a set up to get quite freaked out and I was sitting here being completely fine thinking I don't know what I'm going to say so I'll talk about what the process is like sitting here not knowing what to say when everyone's expecting you to come up with some wise words so I just talked my way through my process of being with it which is actually really fascinating and it's like it doesn't actually matter as Utejani says it doesn't make any difference what the scenario is your work is how are you with that so here am I on a set up on a Monday night which could have easily been thoroughly tense intention I don't know everybody here you've come a long way to listen to me you know and I just keep applying that inquiry what's happening now what's happening now what's happening now and it's when we know what's happening now when we see contraction it's going to relax it's not going to relax when I can't see that I'm tense that's for sure it isn't necessarily going to completely relax just because I see it but that's when I begin to have part of me not in it and therefore not being led by it that's how it can subside and sometimes it poofs and sometimes it just gradually subsides that's not my business the cultivating of serenity requires skill in steadying composing unifying the mind cultivating of inside of a person I require skill in observing investigating discerning and then I'm going to go back to the beginning of the process investigating discerning we need both we need to strike a balance between steadying calming focusing on something to help us become and being curious and open investigating and wondering whatever is happening so not to not too open not too close like the whole of practice it's a middle it's a balancing and only you in this moment know how is your inner state how is your mind and heart now therefore what do I need more of am I tight am I getting am I trying to protect myself am I all guarded which is where we can use too much concentration practice or am I open and interested in curious or am I so open that I'm now getting reactive and I need to exclude a few things and calm down a bit and that's a constant change so you're always adjusting so there isn't any right practice there isn't any good way to do it you can't have a good sitting or a bad sitting if you look at it like that it's just what do you need now to help you be open interested in a kind friendly steady way and that will change because everything is changing and all of your chemistry is changing your blood sugar levels are changing your energy is changing externals are changing your moods are changing suddenly remember something and then you'll be in a whole other state so now you need something different this is changing all the time so it's totally it's not ever static ever well another thing mutation he has said this is interesting he says when you do if somebody does a lot of shamata practice and just shamata practice concentration concentration he said you are developing the becoming and he says that's why who's to say this but anyway he says he he's sort of half laughing and who knows but what's described at least in the Buddhist cosmology the heavenly realms the heavenly realms one is said to be able to be in those heavenly realms for eons he said of course you put so much energy into becoming calm and not doing harm because while you're being doing shaman practice there's no hindrances of base you're not causing trouble at a time it's not a bad thing to be doing but you can become become become and then you can be in the heavenly realms for five hundred thousand years because you're developing that stability of goal of holding on for Pasana there's no developing anything letting go letting go letting go know you becoming anything no trying like that just what's this what's this and is there a response that's open and interested or is there a response that's now struggling ten thousand dollars worth over a dollar he reckons very that's powerful ten thousand dollars hmm yeah so to think in terms watch your concentration practice you're practicing are you wanting something almost always it's just really really a lot so see your attitude to your practice what's your attitude to the person and what's your attitude to concentration are you hanging on are you trying to get are you feeling good about are you identified with or are you just plain interested is this wholesome and healthy or is this looking good or doing well or what's going on here and see not not to do it but to really see clearly why you're doing what you're doing honestly in each moment says there isn't an it to get it isn't calm mind it's it's be wanting to be liberated to be free from any unnecessary anything that isn't an it it's an absence of it we're seeing the struggle and releasing struggle there's that's it there's nothing to get another thing he says and this I think this is really precious is he's quoting his teacher his teacher called shwayu min who died four years ago four and a half years ago he says shwayu min would say if you're able to describe something in the past it's not happening it's a concept it's not real so be careful how much you are trying to bring words around things which maybe to look good or to understand but it's already sort of playing catch up our real true experience is immediate it's fresh fresh right now you think you know something you're actually already in the past it's like don't know what's happening right now if it's new it's a reality if it's old it's a concept he said it's really an interesting way to look at how our minds work we latch on to what has been to make sense of it we need to do that to some degree but practice is immediate vipassana is so in this moment just now with I don't know actually what this is and at times we do and we make sense of things and then at other times we don't know it isn't to have to put words around it is to be awake curious then there's this vitality and deliciousness about practice because it's fresh there's a lot of curiosity I think that's probably the biggest thing that I've enjoyed meeting him is that stimulated huge curiosity in my in my practice what's going on for me which is that's everything if we're curious we're alive we're interested we're alert soon as you think you know you've got it you get bored same old thing then you're lost in concept you're not actually awake and we're all hoping is to try and wake up okay I think that'll do anybody have any questions please thank you for that talk and the 10,000 to one ratio I know there's some humor looking there somewhere but do you think there's a bit of hyperbole there for the purposes of kind of an antidote to if you will to the hazards and traps of too much. Yes, I do I think that's true. I also think that I haven't asked this exactly but I think that we're speaking to Westerners and there is a tendency in Westerners to strive whereas Asians apparently on the whole need a little more encouragement to work hard, whereas we don't need that so much and so that there are some of us who have like taken it and got very grim. And of course, as well as also these apparently different centers in Burma, there will be people who've been to one center and who've decided actually that's not what they want they go to this center and the same. And so there are we call them refugees from other centers at these in each center and the refugees that go to Utejaniya are refugees from very intensive concentration type places who have gone because it is their fried. And so they're like there were people there for instance a man who had been practicing with I don't know if I'm being taped with mentioned names but anyway I won't. At a center and he had a headache for 12 years and so he had been practicing with Utejaniya for three years and Utejaniya was like no sitting walking practice lying down practice no sitting practice and watch your attitude watch your attitude and he now is walking up and down smiling and talking because he didn't have a headache. That's just one example of many. So a certain amount of what he's saying is in reaction to the over straining that can go with concentration. It isn't just as irrelevant as that. Yeah, that makes good sense. We have examples of that here in California too, I think. And I was just thinking about the metaphor of a bird with a big wing on one side and a pin feather on the other. Thank you. I'm flying right in circles.
