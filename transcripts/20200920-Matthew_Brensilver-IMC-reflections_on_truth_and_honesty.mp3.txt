The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So welcome, welcome.
You know, these
days,
sometimes I have this sense to
speak about anything, but grief feels like an empathic
failure, you know.
And sometimes that grief feels like
the grief required to have a good death, and sometimes that grief feels like
the grief required to
catalyze something in our hearts about care, about compassion.
And so that is occupying
my mind quite a bit.
And I feel like one of the
blessings of Dharma practice and what I was
alluding to in the
SIT was that
something about the practice that leads the heart to be more malleable
and to enter
and exit
states of poignancy
and delight, heaviness and lightness
to enter and exit that more with more
and more fluidity and ease.
And so there is
there are a million reasons to grieve and that's
real.
And
there are a lot of facets of being human
and there are a lot of facets of this moment
and want to try to
reflect the kind of many faceted
nature of the present.
And so Jesus said
to those who had believed him
if you abide
in my word, you are my true disciples
and you will know the truth and the truth
will set you free.
That's John chapter 8
verse 31.
The question will the truth set you free?
Is the truth
is the truth in our beliefs?
Is it in our bones? How do we think about this?
And
the liberating power of truth is of course a major theme
in Dharma teachings that
one way that teachers frame the path
of liberation is knowing the Dharma.
In knowing the Dharma we know truth
and seeing truth we are liberated.
That's a kind of major framework.
And from this view of hija
ignorance is the wellspring
of our difficulties.
So in Samyutinakaya
ignorance is the leader in the attainment of unskillful qualities
followed by a lack of conscience and a lack of moral concern.
In an unknowledgeable person immersed
in ignorance wrong view arises.
In one of wrong view wrong intention
wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness.
In one of wrong mindfulness wrong concentration
arises.
So here we have a picture where
suffering
is a function of not seeing the truth.
And the antidote
of course is a knowledge and vision of things
as they really are.
Now I've always had
a certain kind of ambivalence
about this formulation.
I'm not a philosopher but I've read
enough philosophy east, west
to know that capital T
truth is tricky business.
When you start to get into the weeds of that
it gets a lot of debates, a lot of complexity
and I just emerge from that
feeling a measure of humility.
This is the philosopher
Richard Rorty.
The reason for thinking
that there will be no last philosophy
is simply that no answer
can fail to be an answer to a question
and no question can guarantee
its own permanent relevance.
And it's interesting
to consider how
the questions that Dharma practice
is trying to answer have evolved over the course
of history. Yeah, that Dharma is trying to
answer a question or questions
and how have those questions evolved
over the course of 2600 years.
So as a Dharma teacher
I don't
proclaim access to capital T
truth.
That as a guiding metaphor
is, this is something for me
but
I do want to talk about honesty.
We may not know the final truth
but we know the difference between honesty
and deception.
We can discern the small T truth
and we find actually that small T truth
is actually enough to free our heart
in important ways.
In a way
our path begins with a very honest reflection.
This path of
seeking the Dharma heart, it begins with a very honest reflection
namely a realization of
this isn't going to work out.
The way at least I've been doing it
this isn't going to work out. We have that
intuition. And so we begin
the spiritual kind of quest
with this very honest reflection of
happiness
well-being. It's complicated.
And the way we generally go about engineering it
has problems.
And so we begin to practice and we make
a commitment to looking deeply
what is it actually like to be human?
That is a deceptively simple question
but we might think we would know the answer to that.
What's it actually like to be human? But we have to look to see.
We have to look carefully, deeply
in a sustained way from a mind
that is settled.
We may not know capital T truth
but there is a commitment to
see and to not rationalizing
one's life and preferences.
It is possible to
live
in
essentially marshaling
delusion to paper over greed
and rationalization.
We
delusion, it works
with staggering speed
and the hallmark of ego is defensiveness
and so the work of delusion
is to actually dignify greed and aversion
and that process happens quickly
and it leaves almost no trace and part of what we get good at
in our spiritual practice is discerning
the trace of rationalization
the trace of self deception.
We may not know
the final truth but we can
indeed move
against the tides of self deception
and so we gather our courage.
We gather our courage because revelation
is not comfortable. It actually does not promise consolation.
Yeah.
It does not promise consolation
and
my sense is that the awakening of the heart
actually deepens certain kinds of pain.
Now over the course
of my practice
I have cycled through many
many different intentions.
What feels like it's animating my practice
and I've tended
to smart start small.
We start small when we practice.
It's like an accoutrement of our life
and so the habit is to
essentially for me to
nestle the Dharma into the infrastructure
of my neurosis.
Does that sound familiar to anybody?
We kind of wedge it in
here and it's going to
live in this little compartment
to let the momentum of my neurosis shape my life.
But the Dharma won't stay
compartmentalized for long with sincerity.
So there are the intentions
evolve. It becomes maybe less self-involved
more dedicated to
alleviating the suffering of others. Sometimes
I don't know why we're practicing for a long time.
I didn't really know why I was practicing.
I just knew there was something essential about it.
But over all of these years
what I fall back on most
the intention that in a sense I trust above
all else
is to strengthen towards
curiosity.
Towards looking itself.
Philosopher James called
curiosity the impulse towards better cognition.
And curiosity
is distinctive because
we have an agenda. It's not
the instrument of something else.
It's just like we just want to look.
And this turns out to be very conducive to growth.
The
kind of hunger to keep seeing
becomes very alive and maybe
remember times in practice maybe that time is now
maybe there's time in retreat when
the looking itself the curiosity
the kind of wonder of seeing
the wonder of awareness
was just fully satiated.
It was not a transaction at all.
And in these times we do
we come to care more about awareness than what we call
our life.
And
the tides of pleasure and pain and hope and fear and gain
and loss all of this kind of
recedes into the background and
even the very longing
for freedom recedes
into the background.
And this kind of like
longing for a certain
kind of honesty with what is here to see
this
is the centerpiece of one's heart.
Ajahn Chah said everything is teaching us
everything is teaching us.
And I remember Gil one time saying
you know this is not mindfulness
maybe we shouldn't call it mindfulness practice we should call it honesty practice.
Just to be honest
this spirit of
honesty of doing what we can
not to deceive oneself or others
this kind of
yeah commitment to
a commitment to
yeah to honesty it's
very it runs very deep
in the path it's really
quite foundational
and
we commit to looking because
you know as the Buddha suggests like
our default
rather than clarity
our default is delusion
we can think about it like
now from kind of modern evolutionary
perspective like pristine
clarity was not at the top
of evolutions to do list
groupthink conformity
fitting in
it was probably more
evolutionarily advantageous
than the kind of maverick view
of this like radical honesty.
So
evolutionary psychologist Marty
she writes on the surface cognitive biases appear to be
puzzling when viewed through an evolutionary lens
because they depart from standards of logic and accuracy
they appear to be design flaws instead of examples of good engineering
to the evolutionary psychologist however
the task is not whether the cognitive feature
is accurate but rather how well it solves
a particular problem and how solving this
problem contributed to fitness
ancestrally. Viewed in this way
if a cognitive bias positively impacted fitness
it is not a design flaw it is a design
feature. Some genuine cognitive
biases might be functional features designed
by the wisdom of natural selection.
The Buddhist path it's very radical
it's really not aimed towards self-preservation
it takes us against the
stream. The reality
of our own mortality
the pressures associated
with that can
have profoundly distorting effects
on how we see.
So the Buddhist said delusion is the default
we do not see the three marks of existence
the three characteristics
we see the three
not characteristics
we have fantasies
about a durable pleasure
that might structure
that structures our lives.
We fantasize about tying up all the loose ends
of being human and holding the world still
of really gaming out
samsara of managing
uncertainty.
We fantasize about taking refuge
identity
we fantasize about possession
and control
and there is an innocence in all of these fantasies
but we have to look with that kind of
care, honesty, attention
so we look no
at its unsatisfactoriness
its uncertainty and permanence
it's the centerlessness of
being.
And 2020
is mercilessly
pounding this into us.
And I take this
as a kind of invitation to
learn because
the structure of insight is that it
it's multi-layered
it can always penetrate
more deeply into our bones
and our lives.
I had a
Tibetan teacher mentor
who said something like
trust your experience but refine
your view.
Trust your experience but refine your view.
So much delusion
we're not trying to
doubt everything we experience.
We're not trying to doubt
the truth of this moment. What's here?
Yes, that was the experience. And at the same time
the view can be refined
in a way.
Wise view
and perception interact.
And so in a way
it's like
I want to say I vow
I vow to explore
I vow to do what I can
to step out of self-deception.
And so part of honesty,
part of this commitment to truthfulness
is acknowledging
how easy it is
and
it said
I think of Tanya
she said
people tend to believe that they think like scientists
but they actually think like trial lawyers
not disparaging
the beloved attorneys in the Sangha
no offense intended.
But what she meant was
like are we, do we
form our view by accumulating evidence
and then doing our best to synthesize it
and arrive at a conclusion or do we begin with a conclusion
and then select
and marshal evidence to support that conclusion.
And we probably do
more lawyering
than blinded experimentation.
Where you're gathering evidence
in the most honest way we can.
And just knowing this is actually
it's not intended to ignite
doubt in us but
we want to
be open to the possibility
that some portion of our lives is really
and that some portion of our philosophy
of life is a kind of rationalization of our conditioning
and our preferences.
Sometimes we see this, we actually see
that we can build enormous
whole moral, political philosophies
like our entire idea
of what is, what should be
is just a river into which
our kilesas flow.
The defilements just flow into
that, just animate, give that philosophy body
give it life.
Empty, empty,
empty.
This world-making
this building
yeah, empty.
Truthfulness, non-deceptiveness,
transparency, this is
we want to consider the realm
of secret secrecy in our lives.
Freud said something like
human beings
are the animals that keep secrets.
Elsewhere it said like
we're not what we think, we are what we hide.
Now
secrecy is not the same
as privacy, right?
It may or may not be important to share
there are safety considerations. Just this morning I was reading about
biography of gay man
and the
the meaning of
secrecy, transparency, safety is very
different for some versus others.
And so
we want to be sensitive to that
but the kind of secrets that I'm pointing to
is that which we hide
from others but also kind of hide from ourselves.
And sometimes there can be this kind of
dance of denial and revelation.
Yeah, maybe you even can feel into that.
Like oh, this is real.
No, it's not.
Oh, I may have a problem.
No, I don't.
And this kind of this dance, yeah?
Dance where we're not even sure
what is real for us.
But there's a burden in this dance.
There's a burden in holding
secrets which are often encased
in a certain kind of shame.
And those secrets, to hold a secret,
secrecy is an active process.
One of the researchers on
thought suppression says exactly that.
This is Wagner.
Secrecy is an active process as it requires
behavioral and mental work.
The cognitive maneuvers necessary for keeping a secret
create an intentional suppression
of the secret thought, the consequence of which
is a preoccupation with the secret itself.
Yeah.
There's an anxiety in being,
the anxiety that we found out.
And
more and more we can
sense that longing to live our lives such that we
were not afraid of being found out.
And so we look for
where we are deceptive.
There's a psychologist Bella,
she writes, occasionally people tell lies
in pursuit of material gain, personal convenience,
or to escape from punishment.
Much more commonly however, the rewards that are sought
are psychological ones. We lie to make ourselves appear
more sophisticated or more virtuous than we think
characteristics warrant. We lie to protect ourselves
and sometimes others from disapproval and
disagreements or from getting our feelings hurt.
The realm of lying then is one in which
identities are claimed
and impressions are managed.
Our secrecy
shines a kind of light
on the architecture of self.
Yeah. Because secrets,
deceptiveness, often involves
a measure of shame, and shame
is often the trace of self-view.
We
can learn
about who we think we are,
about what we think makes us worthy or
unworthy. We can learn about
the architecture of
self-view. Yeah, shame
helps illuminate the moralism
in our view. Yeah, I was
alluding to the innocence, the innocence
of experience. And in shame, nothing is innocent.
Yeah, nothing is innocent.
And so we
come to digest
to begin to live with more
transparency, to diffuse the shame
that encased some of our secrecy.
And we might still be private, but the world
no longer reminds us of our secrets.
I want to unfold, Rilke says.
I don't want to be folded anywhere because
I am folded there. I am a lie.
Part of why I
teach Dharma is that
here, yeah, with
people like you,
I don't feel ashamed
of what I care about.
I can actually
express my heart.
This is the kind of intrapersonal dimension, but there's
effects on our interpersonal life, non-deceptiveness,
truthfulness.
You know, in a way, our ability
to trust others depends on
the congruence between their
explicit words and their affect,
their body. Yeah?
Like,
yeah, these become more overlapping.
Yeah, we find ways of
our inner life and our words
cohere more closely.
There's sense of transparency,
of non-deceptiveness.
And, you know,
truthfulness is a really kind of honored place
in the Buddhist tradition.
When we deceive others,
we take active part
in deluding them. Yeah?
We take active part in deluding them. We foster
a deluded view for them.
And
then they have to live with that delusion,
or they have to live with that confusion about
maybe I've been deceived and maybe not.
They have to try to discern that.
And then that delusion
or the potential, yeah, for their delusion,
that we have levied upon them
and shaped their life in ways.
And so it's been said
that
to deceive another is it's really a kind of
attack upon the autonomy
of those receiving our lie.
Yeah, we actually constrain their freedom
in inducing a measure of delusion.
And
conversely, like we support the freedom
of the other by being honest,
by speaking the truth.
Yeah, we may not know
that we may not have our last philosophy,
but we do know
what honesty is. We commit
to looking, to looking deeply.
Yeah?
To looking deeply, to finding new ways
of looking.
We strive for honesty with ourselves
to take a stand
against self deception, honesty about the human
condition, honesty about ourselves, honesty
about our relationships.
And
we hold
the permanent possibility of being wrong
not as a way of inducing doubt or
indecision or paralysis or anything like this,
but as a way of supporting
the looking. Yeah?
We never know when delusions
had its last word.
And that
unwillingness to
be wrong is, feels more
and more like a kind of
something like an ethical commitment.
Yeah, a kind of vow.
Yeah, because we're
the unwillingness to be wrong, the unwillingness to step out of
self deception
guarantees a measure of fragility
and defensiveness.
And the humility,
the humility of all of this, the humility it makes
us more careful, more gentle.
Yeah?
More careful about hurting someone on the
basis of our ideas. The humility makes us
more careful.
So I
vow to
strive on with
honesty.
Let's just sit for a moment.
