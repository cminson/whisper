 So these last weeks when I started to teach again I've been thinking a lot about what I could say or teach or discuss in the face of war, what's going on. A lot of people are anxious about it or concerned about it or thinking about it. One of my Zen teachers said once that Gandhi's contribution to Buddhism teaches you to sit. Gandhi's contribution to Buddhism is that it matters where you sit. Some friends of mine have sat at the gates of St. Quentin or sat at the train tracks in Livermore Labs and different places like that. They sit peacefully on the train tracks during their meditation. As it matters where you sit, we sit here for example at our center. It's a particular location and so we sit in this location. It has meaning that we sit in this location. It depends on different people, it means different things. To sit, to witness, to sit, be still, be present, be mindful in this location. Those of you who come Thursday and Friday morning can be very aware that one of the great fault lines in American society, we are sitting in a sense right in the midst of it, right on the edge in the street corner. The tension between anti-abortion and pro-abortion happens right here in our street corner. Relatively peacefully but sometimes very aggressively and apparently a few weeks ago violently where someone tried to run over one of the anti-abortion protesters. So we sit in the midst of that and what does it mean to sit in the midst of that kind of experience? And in a sitting meditation, a mindfulness being present, being completely aware and clear, seeing very clearly, not turning away, not seeing through our reactions but seeing through the clarity of an open heart, open mind. Is that political or is it something which is kind of wider than politics or outside of politics? Different people have different interpretations of that. So we sit here, matters where you sit, how you sit both literally and metaphorically. And so I've been wondering what to say and I decided today that I wouldn't say anything but I'd read this. It's from 1958 so it's a... The language is somewhat dated and language that probably most of us would rather not hear. If we heard it these days, some of the words we would be bothered by, insensitive words perhaps given. But it was a long time ago, different time, different understanding of language and things. And I find it very, very powerful and it's a speech by Martin Luther King. Since the philosophy of nonviolence played such a positive role in the Montgomery movement, it may be wise to turn to a brief discussion of some basic aspects of this philosophy. First, it must be emphasized that nonviolent resistance is not a method for cowards. It does resist. If one uses this method because he is afraid or merely because he lacks the instruments of violence, he is not truly nonviolent. This is why Gandhi often said that if cowardice is the only alternative to violence, it is better to fight. He made this statement conscious of the fact that there is always another alternative. No individual or group needs to submit to any wrong, nor need they use violence to right the wrong. There is the way of nonviolent resistance. This ultimately is the way of the strong man. It is not a method of stagnant passivity. The phrase passive resistance often gives the false impression that this is a sort of do nothing method in which the resistor quietly and passively accepts evil. But nothing is further from the truth. For while the nonviolent resistor is passive in the sense that he is not physically aggressive towards his opponent, his mind and emotions are always active, constantly seeking to persuade his opponent that he is wrong. The method is passive physically, but strongly active spiritually. It is not passive non-resistance to evil. It is active nonviolent resistance to evil. A second basic fact that characterizes non-violence is that it does not seek to defeat or humiliate the opponent, but to win his friendship and understanding. The nonviolent resistor must often express his protest through non-cooperation or boycotts, but he realizes that these are not ends themselves. They are merely means to awaken a sense of moral shame in the opponent. The end is redemption and reconciliation. The aftermath of non-violence is the creation of the beloved community, while the aftermath of violence is tragic bitterness. A third characteristic of this method is that the attack is directed against forces of evil rather than against persons who happen to be doing evil. It is evil that the nonviolent resistor seeks to defeat, not the persons victimized by evil. If he is opposing racial injustice, the nonviolent resistor has the vision to see that basic tension is not between races. As I like to say to people in Montgomery, the tension in this city is not between white people and Negro people. The tension is, at bottom, between justice and injustice, between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. And if there is a victory, it will be a victory not merely for 50,000 Negroes, but a victory for justice and the forces of light. We are out to defeat injustice and not white persons who may be unjust. The fourth point that characterizes nonviolent resistance is a willingness to accept suffering without retaliation, to accept blows from the opponent without striking back. Rivers of blood may have to flow before we gain our freedom, but it must be our blood, Gandhi said to his countrymen. The nonviolent resistor is willing to accept violence if necessary, but never to inflict it. He does not seek to dodge jail. If going to jail is necessary, he enters it as a bridegroom enters the bride's chamber. One may well ask, what is the nonviolent resistor's justification for this ordeal to which he invites men, for this mass political application of the ancient doctrine of turning the other cheek? The answer is found in the realization that unearned suffering is redemptive. Suffering, the nonviolent resistor realizes, has tremendous educational and transforming possibilities. Things of fundamental importance to people are not secured by reason alone, but have to be purchased with their suffering, said Gandhi. Gandhi continued, suffering is infinitely more powerful than the law of the jungle, for converting the opponent and opening his ears, which are otherwise shut to the voice of reason. A fifth point concerning nonviolent resistance is that it avoids not only external physical violence, but also internal violence of spirit. The nonviolent resistor not only refuses to shoot his opponent, but he also refuses to hate him. At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love. The nonviolent resistor would contend that in the struggle for human dignity, the oppressed people of the world must not succumb to the temptation of becoming bitter or indulging in hate campaigns. To retaliate in kind would do nothing but intensify the existence of hate in the universe. Along the way of life, someone must have enough sense and morality to cut off the chain of hate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of our lives. In speaking of love at this point, we are not referring to some sentimental or affectionate emotion. It would be nonsense to urge men to love their oppressors in an affectionate sense. Love in this connection means understanding, redemptive goodwill. Here the Greek language comes to our aid. There are three words for love in the Greek New Testament. First, there is Eros. In the Platonic philosophy, Eros meant the yearning of the soul for the realm of the divine. It has come now to mean a sort of aesthetic or romantic love. Second, there is Philia, which means intimate affection between personal friends. Philia denotes a sort of reciprocal love. The person loves because he is loved. When we speak of loving, those who oppose us, we refer to neither Eros nor Philia. We speak of a love which is expressed in the Greek word agape. Agape means understanding, redeeming goodwill for all men. It is an overflowing love which is purely spontaneous, unmotivated, groundless and creative. It is not set in motion by any quality or function of its object. It is love of God operating in the human heart. Agape is disinterested love. It is a love in which the individual seeks not his own good, but the good of his neighbor. It does not begin by discriminating between worthy and unworthy people or any qualities people possess. It begins by loving others for their sakes. It is an entirely neighbor-regarding concern for others, which discovers the neighbor in every man it meets. Therefore, agape means no distinction between friend and enemy. It is directed toward both. If one loves an individual merely on account of his friendliness, he loves him for the sake of the benefits to be gained from the friendship, rather than for the friend's own sake. Consequently, the best way to assure oneself that love is disinterested is to have love for the enemy neighbor from whom you can expect no good in return, but only hostility and persecution. Another basic point about agape is that it springs from the need of the other person, his need for belonging to the best in the human family. The Samaritan who helped the Jew on the Jericho Road was good because he responded to that human need that he was presented with. God's love is eternal and fails not because man needs his love. St. Paul assures us that the loving act of redemption was done while we were yet sinners, that is, at the point of our greatest need for love. Since the white man's personality is greatly distorted by segregation and his soul is greatly scarred, he needs the love of the Negro. The Negro must love the white man because the white man needs his love to remove his tensions, insecurities and fears. Agape is not a weak, passive love. It is love in action. Agape is love seeking to preserve and create community. It is insistence to any length to restore community. It doesn't stop at the first mile, but it goes the second mile to restore community. It is a willingness to forgive, not seven times, but seventy times seven to restore community. The cross is the eternal expression of the length to which God will go in order to restore broken community. Resurrection is a symbol of God's triumph over all the forces that seek to block community. The Holy Spirit is the continuing community creating reality that moves through history. He who works against community is working against the whole of creation. Therefore, if I respond to hate with reciprocal hate, I do nothing but intensify the cleavage in broken community by meeting hate with love. If I meet hate with hate, I become depersonalized because creation is so designed that my personality can only be fulfilled in the context of community. Booker T. Washington was right. He said, let no man pull you so low as to make you hate him. When he pulls you that low, he brings you to the point of working against community. He drags you to the point of defying creation and thereby becoming depersonalized. In the final analysis, Agape means a recognition of the fact that all life is interrelated. All humanity is involved in a single process and all men are brothers. To the degree that I harm my brother, no matter what he is doing to me, to that extent I am harming myself. For example, white men often refuse federal aid to education in order to avoid giving the Negro his rights. But because all men are brothers, they cannot deny Negro children without harming themselves. They end all efforts to the contrary by hurting themselves. Why is this? Because men are brothers. If you harm me, you harm yourself. Love, Agape, is the only cement that can hold this broken community together. When I am commanded to love, I am commanded to restore community, to resist injustice, and to meet the needs of my brothers. A sixth basic fact about nonviolent resistance is that it is based on the conviction that the universe is on the side of justice. Consequently, the believer in nonviolence has deep faith in the future. This faith is another reason why the nonviolent resistor can accept suffering without retaliation. For he knows that in his struggle for justice, he has cosmic companionship. It is true that there are devout believers in nonviolence who find it difficult to believe in a personal God. But even these persons believe in the existence of some creative force that works for universal wholeness. Whether we call it an unconscious process, an impersonal Brahman, or a personal being of matchless power and infinite love, there is a creative force in this universe that works to bring the disconnected aspects of reality into a harmonious whole. So that was in 1958. We know that Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement went on for a good number of years after that to create very profound transformations in American society. Huge kind of a revolution, a nonviolent revolution. Maybe the biggest one that this country has seen. And we benefit from that work to this day. So in Buddhism, there is a teaching of various central teachings of the importance of non-harming. And there's also very centrally important teachings of loving-kindness. And what Martin Luther King said about agape, I think, works very well for loving-kindness and the love that's behind non-harming. Metta is not meant to be reciprocal or in exchange, but it's a feeling of kindness, goodwill, that we're willing to give even our enemies. And I think it doesn't take too much imagination to imagine a situation where you would offer kindness to your enemy. And sometimes it's helpful, that act of imagination. Imagine them quite injured or sick or in jail or something where they're safe. And you probably want to go and do something for them. Help them out if you have the chance. It would be nice if we tried in this country to enshrine Martin Luther King and what he stands for by having a Martin Luther King holiday. And we have in places Martin Luther King Boulevard and various places and Martin Luther King High Schools and various ways in which we remember this wonderful man. But it seems that it's all too easy to forget the philosophy or the teachings that he represents just as seemingly in some of the countries that Mahatma Gandhi worked in seem to have all too easily forgotten his lessons. Though we see in, to some degree, his Gandhi's teachings did survive to some degree in South Africa. And the revolution of South Africa was partly a legacy of Gandhi working in South Africa, I guess around the turn of the century, about 100 years ago. And it would be nice if there's some way that the United States that we could remember very well the lessons of Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement. And to remember it all the time so that we don't have to only remember it at times of great crisis. Because sometimes in times of great crisis it can seem that we're not going to have much effect. But if we remember it all the time and all the small steps and all the small things that build up that perhaps the small steps can make huge difference in 10, 20 years. Last year I learned a story about Daniel Ellsberg. And I haven't heard it from him, so I don't know if he exactly sees it the same way, but as it was told, he was very instrumental for what was going on in the Vietnam War time. By releasing the Pentagon Papers, and he got a certain degree of trouble for doing that. And he worked for the State Department, and one of the turning points for him was at some point he was in Kyoto in the mid-60s or so. And there weren't many Americans in Kyoto at that time. And he ran into Gary Snyder. And Gary Snyder and him had a long all-night conversation or something about politics, non-violence, Buddhism and things like that. And that was the beginning of the turning point for Daniel Ellsberg, that his thinking about politics and action and what to do, his conscience, which was changed a little bit. And he began to think about other possibilities and what he had grown up to believe in. That eventually led to him, in a sense, he helped the United States government be publicly honest about what was going on, because there was a lot of deceit going on back then. And so the example is a very small thing, a conversation two people had, some years later, led to something momentous happening. And so we have in Japanese Buddhist tradition the saying, with this cup of tea, I stop the war. I suspect very few of us are going to stop this particular war by drinking tea. But maybe the way which the respect, the care, the love, in something as simple as drinking a cup of tea can make a difference in 20 years or 30 years in some way. I was deeply inspired one day when I saw in the meditation hall a Zen monk, not when he drank his cup of tea, but when he returned his empty cup to the person who had given him the tea. The way that he returned that empty cup, the care, the respect, the love, the presence, in something as, you know, something we often will just kind of ignore and overlook. And so I said, I'm going to drink a cup of tea. To see one person do it so completely with such deep reverence and respect, you know, changed me who I am. So I don't know, you know, how, or if anything, reading this talk by Martin Luther King, how each of you interpret it in your own way, how it is appropriate to have read this particular juncture of our country. But I hope that you feel somehow that it's relevant as a response. So those are my thoughts for today. And it might be nice to open it up and if you have comments you'd like to make or questions or anything. I just like to thank you for reading that this morning. They really touched me. Great. Thank you. Yes. I thought about the beginning part when you were reading and about attitudes towards people who oppose you and wise and skillful means. And if you just change words a little bit, you can apply a lot to your sitting practice to have an honest, friendly attitude towards things that come up in you. So Steve says that without too many changes in the language and the words, this whole talk could be instructions for meditation practice and attitude we have towards ourselves. Meditation is a form of nonviolence. It's perceived as something very passive, but it's really quite an active thing when things come up, how to skillfully deal with them. You said it's a very active. People think of it as a passive thing, but it's, you know, he thinks it was a very active thing, learning how to respond to what arises. It's both an active and a passive side to meditation. And there's a word that's very commonly used, an idea, it's very common in the American Vipassana movement, which doesn't appear that often in Asia as far as I know. And that's the word acceptance. Meditation's a lot about acceptance of what arises. And then there's always these questions about, you know, the situations where it's appropriate to or not appropriate to accept things. It raises a lot of issues for people. But lately I've been thinking that a better word, that kind of is more precise perhaps than the point is to be accept things as they are in meditation. The point in meditation is to have a nonviolent relationship to whatever arises. That's much more to the point. There are things maybe we're not supposed to accept, but we can still have a nonviolent relationship to them or to ourselves. So other things people like to bring up. Yes? If you feel a feeling of non-separation from other beings and all, how can you accept the suffering that is always through or in your own heart? I don't think Martin Luther King or Gandhi said you're supposed to accept the suffering, but you're supposed to work with it spiritually, which means that you see its redemptive quality, the possibilities of reconciliation. He used the word educational possibilities of it. He says you're supposed to be very active spiritually and internal, working with that, purifying oneself. So the question is not to accept things in justice in the world, because maybe we're not supposed to accept injustice in the world. The vipassana teachings around this is that acceptance is, you're not supposed to actively accept things out there, but you're supposed to accept it in the sense that the mind does not get contracted, or the heart does not get closed in contact with this. So acceptance is acceptance of the mind, not of our good sense and our intelligence and our decisions and our judgments and all that. And so that's why perhaps a better word than acceptance might be to have a nonviolent relationship to the injustice of the world. Well, due to a bit of personal being, having our suffering in the world, or in Germany, I feel just as being suffering and pain in my heart all the time, and I hear war, and I was thinking when the world starts, I probably close my door and cry for a day. So when I hear the note, my question is how to hold that. Close your door and cry for a day? Yes. That's normal. That's okay. I don't see you. It's painful, but the fact that things are painful doesn't mean that they shouldn't be that way. If you normalize your pain, it's a lot easier. Yeah, you're right. I'm accepting that that is what is happening in my heart. Yeah, I think so. And for people who've gone through that kind of trauma before, kind of retraumatizing, they take extra good care of themselves and be really careful. Sorry. I don't know what this means, but I was kind of struck while you were speaking that the two people that figured most in what you were talking about, Gandhi and Martin Luther King, were both killed for what they believed in. I don't know what conclusions to draw from that, but it seems to happen frequently. Is there a time where you'd be willing to sacrifice your life? For something? Well, I suppose there is. Do you think that that was a sacrifice of their lives? Do you think that they're... I know that Martin Luther King felt that he would very likely be killed. I don't know how Gandhi felt about that. Can you imagine a situation where you would walk into a situation where you thought, chances are you would be killed, but this is what you have to do? Can you imagine that? Yeah. I'm not sure how to... So, Steve is raising the issue that the two people who are most prominent in this is Martin Luther King and this talk, Martin Luther King and Gandhi. Both of them were killed. I'm sorry, I don't know if you could hear what he said in the back. And so he was wondering what that means. He's not really asking a particular question, just an open question. What does that mean? Are you worried that it's a proof of the failure of their philosophy? Is that behind the question? No, I think it's the validation of their philosophy. They obviously got to someone. He said he thinks it's a validation of their philosophy because it shows that they got to someone. I met someone. I've told this story many times and I apologize, but it's a moving story for me. I met this woman once. She came on retreat. And a white woman who had gone to the South in the 63 or something back then, that time, and to work for the Civil Rights Movement. And she had done various non-violent forms of protest, including one point standing, demonstrating somehow on a street corner somewhere. And she said that these white racist types would come by, came by, and they would heckle them. One point, a whole bunch of them came in a pickup truck and jumped out of the car and started beating them up with their fists. And they didn't do anything. They just let themselves be beat up. And the next day, these protesters went back to the same street corner, bandaged up, I guess. And the same thing happened, she said. The same guys came by, they came out of the pickup truck and they beat them up a little bit, and then they left. And so, you know, in normal, kind of maybe common sense of ways of thinking, to go back a third day and stand there seems foolish, right? But they went back a third day. And the same guy, the guys jumped out of the pickup truck and the same guy came over to beat her up, beat her up the two days before. And he had his fist above her head ready to hit her. She wasn't going to defend herself. And he looked into her eyes and he said, what are you doing? And then they had a long conversation. So I don't know the outcome of that conversation, but there was no more fighting. So, you know, maybe because they hung in there and allowed themselves to get beat up, that was what was able to get through to those races that they could stop and listen, have a conversation about what was going on. Is it worth it to do that? Are you willing to sacrifice yourself to that degree for something as stupid, seemingly, you know, on the surface? Seems like the common sensical thing is you're always supposed to defend yourself. That seems like the right call. The last time someone tried to beat me up, I dropped down on my knees and spread my arms. I said, okay, here I am. And the guy turned around and discussed and left. But at least it stopped the fight. Yes? And I think what you talked about, how he is not an affectionate love, but cultivating the sense of understanding compassion and understanding why the other side is doing what they're doing out of fear and therefore develop compassion for the other. And I just think that he had to guide himself to a general dilemma of anger towards the other side. Yes, very much so, yeah. So, apparently, I don't know Greek, but he says that agape, maybe he suggests it originally means understanding, to understand. So to have that kind of understanding. Yes? Another aspect of this that's very difficult is to read our own violence with the environment within the self. Right. And that's why I think why Steve suggested this whole thing to me. This is all a meditation instruction, this document here. Because to meet those sides of ourselves, to meet our own hate in that way. So rather than read a document like this and then feel terrible or feel, you know, angry or hateful towards ourself because we hate. But rather to bring the same attitude towards that part of ourselves. And one of my hopes is that for people who do Buddhist practice or do mindfulness practice, maybe anybody, that they always take really good care of your own heart. And that we don't overlook the preciousness of taking care of the quality of our own heart. We don't sacrifice that, overlook it or destroy it because we're so focused kind of, in a sense, externally at the injustice of the wrong or what's happening out there. But we still, hopefully, will take care of things out there. We don't do it at the expense of sacrificing the goodness of our own hearts, hating ourselves. And that takes a lot of work. So, you know, King says that, you know, he talks about being strongly active spiritually. You know, it takes a lot to, you know, and takes all our resources and intelligence and abilities to do that sometimes. Yes? It seems to me that nonviolent resistance works well better in a group because you tend to make a statement. When you take the attitude of nonviolence on your own, you are so isolated that it seems that it does not have much of an effect around you. And it seems to me that you end up not caring very much because you have no effect. And I'm concerned about the aspect of passivity versus making some kind of a statement and having an effect on us. That's a good point. So how effective can one individual be? It means the situation people leave now is a good point. I mean, certainly small groups of people can have a big effect. And a larger group of people can have a bigger effect. But can one person have an effect? I believe that each individual action, each individual person who acts and responds does have an effect. Where that effect is, where the beneficial effect goes is not always so clear. The symbolic expression of that for me, a picture of that was back in 12 years ago or so, 13 years ago in Tyneman Square. There's this great image of that single person who walked up and faced all those tanks. Those tanks were going down the street and to go into Tyneman Square to shoot, I guess, or I don't know what the tanks were doing. And this one guy walks up in his briefcase and just stands there in front of them. And the whole line of tanks stop. They don't run them over and they don't go any further. One person. So, you know, yes? It strikes me that the founding of our country was based on religious tolerance, which is, in a way, another way of saying putting up with other religious beliefs. And there's another level of acceptance of other religious beliefs and other ways of thinking. And what you were speaking of today, the loving-kindness acceptance of others beliefs is yet another plane of reaching for something higher, seeing in others that they have their own pain, they have their own difficulties. And that we don't need to approach them with anger or hostility. And that as individuals, we can act on that every day by stopping for pedestrians or, you know, other little things. A friendly smile or wave makes another person's day surprising. Yeah, it makes a big difference. And I was just thinking about this yesterday. It sounds a little bit trite, but I kind of think it's kind of profound, even though it's... Is that I've been struck how amazingly friendly the workers are at the local Safeway. And I think they've probably been trained to do that. We're told. It's probably their job description. It's kind of like they're required. But I'm amazed. Maybe it's a sign that people begin to see that I'm old and decrepit, but they always ask me, can we help you out to your car? Well, you know, they ask me, can we help you in the aisles? It's almost too much sometimes. But I think it's great. And so they must realize that there's benefits for them. But, you know, it'd be nice if we had a culture where we could have, you know, stop for each other. It could be, how can I help you? And what can I do for you? And, you know, all kinds of things. So the last thing I'll say, and then we'll stop, is the short thing is to encapsulate a little bit of Buddhist approach would be, again, Gary Snyder, who I guess was he said or one of his teachers said that there's two things to Buddhist practice. There's sitting in Zazen, Zen meditation for him, sitting in meditation and sweeping the temple courtyard. And don't think the temple courtyard stops at the gate of the temple. It's the whole world. And so in a metaphoric way, the, you know, sitting in meditation isn't just simply literally just sitting in meditation, but it's finding the way to take care of this inner life. To find how to have an inner life, which is non-violence and kind and peaceful and then and then take care of the world. Sweep the courtyard. So thank you all very much. And I hope I don't see you suddenly on some evening. And if I do, it'll be nice to see you.
