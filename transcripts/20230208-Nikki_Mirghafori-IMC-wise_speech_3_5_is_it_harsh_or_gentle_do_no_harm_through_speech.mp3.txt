 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Greetings. Greetings, everyone. So today, our third day of exploring together the topic of why speech. And on Monday, we started with the first question to ask ourselves. And by the way, all of these go together, all these six that I will be sharing. So if one of the conditions is not met and the last one, I want to give you a heads up. The last one I'll be sharing on Friday is, is it timely? Is it the right time? So even if it's not divisive and it's true and today we'll talk about gentleness, it's not harsh. If it's kind, everything is satisfied. Still, if it's not the right time, then we don't say it. So all of these go together. So I wanted to add a little bit of nuance, actually, to the teachings from yesterday and the day before. Before we go into the new question today to ask ourselves if our speech is harsh, abusive, or is it gentle? So that's the new question. And on Monday, we talked about is it true and factual? And yesterday, the question was, is it divisive? Is the speech divisive? Would I be about to say divisive or does it create harmony? So a couple of nuances to add to the teachings. One, as I already mentioned, that they all go together. All the questions. And the other nuance is regarding truthfulness. Is what we're about to say true, but it doesn't mean that we just blurred out everything that is true all the time. Because, of course, there is wisdom in what is it appropriate to say when how all of those other considerations come in. And also, again, together with the other considerations with truthfulness, often folks bring up this hypothetical situation. I don't know if I were, say, if I were alive during the World War II and I was giving safekeeping to people who were persecuted at the time and they were hiding them in my basement and say, you know, I'm not going to be able to tell the Nazis knocked on the door. Would I have to tell them the truth? Well, I appreciate the people who think this way and really try to engage with what does truthfulness actually mean. There is a bigger question of what is of benefit. What is kind of 360 degrees? And I think that's what we're always telling a lie that saves a life in this case of someone who's prosecuting the bigger picture of all things. Of course, it makes sense. So it's not about sticking to a particular rule without context, without non-harming this wish for greater goodness and non-harming in a bigger way. So important always to bring in the context, which again, maybe this inquirer, this question in a more, how should I put it, in a more casual or this inquiry in a more casual way when somebody puts on a dress and tells you, do I look fat? You don't blur out. Yes, you do. You just have to be a little kinder. You know, the other other aspects of kindness come in. But how can you be? But nevertheless, this precept of not lying, not shading the truth, really has to do with the intentions. Really, it goes back to the intentions. And that's something I've been trying to stress. How does it feel in the body? Why are we lying? Is it for our gain? Is it because of hatred? Like, what is the underlying intention, motivation? So really, let that be the guide. Are we deceiving in order to get some gain? Similarly, similarly, the what I mentioned yesterday with the question of is it harmonious or divisive? Also, there is wisdom there. You know, you don't want to, again, not divide people up because you want your friends to just be your friends and break people up. You take joy in discord. Again, it comes back to the intention. However, Buddha also has teachings about if, say, something has happened, say, something has happened. And another person is invited to say, did you see something? You know, that person is supposed to say, what has happened? You know, did they see if, in a way, say, if your friend is about to, let's say, hire someone who you know is going to be a really bad match and it's not going to work out for a variety of reasons. Of course, it's not wise to hold back, oh, I don't want to be divisive. Like, what is the intention here? The intention you need to, out of kindness for everyone with the heart of loving kindness, for everyone involved. Oh, this is, given these facts in the past, maybe you share, but this is what you need to know. Again, out of kindness, out of kindness, it always goes back to the intention and what is happening in the body and in the mind in terms of intentionality. So, so now, with those nuances, those very important nuances, adding more and more layers as we continue this week. The third question to ask is, is it harsh? Is it abusive speech, the way I'm about to speak, or is it gentle? So, the Buddha instructs us, of course, to abandon speech that is spoken in anger or with a mean sarcasm, intended to demean, to insult, to cause pain, to make someone feel bad. It just, it has shards in it, speech that has shards in it. This kind of abusive set in an angry tone is often, is the root of it is aversion, the root of it is hatred, one of the three poisonous roots. Agreed hatred and delusion, so aversion is its root. And it's often impulsive. It doesn't involve forethought the same way that slanderous and divisive speech that we talked about yesterday did. So slanderous speech has doubly heavy karma because it's both has its root, has hatred, and it involves forethought. But, but it's a slightly lighter karma. This is lighter karma because it's impulsive. We're just angrily and in a mean way we just say something and maybe later we feel bad and yet, ouch. We've both heard our karma. We've heard the other person or ripples in the world or ripples in the way it's affected us. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. Still unskillful, even if it has a lighter negative karma, of course. The antidote, the antidote to this type of unskillful speech is patience. Is the parame is the beautiful quality of patience, patience, patience. So if you find yourself to be someone who just worked something out and regrets it later in a angry tone, in a sarcastic, rebuking, demeaning, insulting, it's like, ouch, ouch, and you feel bad, patience. In that moment, they could pause, come back to the body, just not speaking is the best thing, causing the least harm, causing the least harm is the best method. And later when you have your calm, the right time, then you can address it. So patience, patience, patience, beautiful quality of the heart. And of course, when speaking wisely is just impossible in a particular situation, our secondary goal becomes causing the least harm, the least harm to ourselves, to our own karma, really causing ourselves harm with unwise speech, and of course to others and to the relationships that we have to others. And then the Buddha instructs us, instructs us to not just abandon harsh speech, but speak gently and I love these words, the Buddha directs us to speak words that are soothing to the ear, affectionate, go to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people. I'll read them one more time, it's like poetry, suttas are like poetry, speak words, one speaks, speaks, speaks words that are soothing to the ear, affectionate, go to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people. And this reading that goes to my heart and feels affectionate, but I really, it's almost as I hear his affection and kindness through the ages. Yes, yes dear, yes dear, this is how you should speak. So as we go throughout the day today, my invitation is to notice, is it harsh? Is it gentle or is it harsh? And oh yes, another thing I want to add, especially is with this one in particular, not just external speech, our external speech might actually be gentler and gentler than our internal speech. Sometimes we speak to ourselves in tones that we would never ever dare or want to use with others, we're so, the tone can be so harsh, so, so, ouch, ouch, notice the ouch of that. And not needed, can we bring kindness, can we bring compassion, can we bring gentleness? Can we say the same thing, but in a very gentle way? So as we go through the day, I'd like to invite you to notice, notice the tone of your speech, the inner speech and the outer speech. Is it soothing to the ear, affectionate? Go to the ghost of the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people, or is it harsh and abusive? Okay, thank you so much for your practice, for your cultivation, dear Sangha, and I look forward to our continuing this exploration with why speech tomorrow. Take care, be well. Thank you.
