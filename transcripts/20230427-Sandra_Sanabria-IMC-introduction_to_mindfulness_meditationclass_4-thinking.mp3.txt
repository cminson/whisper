The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
We are session five, four or five.
So I'm just going to try to summarize a little bit what we've done.
Why do we meditate? What are we doing here?
So when we meditate, we're not trying to reflect or we can take time apart to do that or to solve a problem.
We're just trying to practice being closer to our own experience, like to perceive, to notice, to know what is it that is going on.
And we're not trying to think about the experience. We do a lot of it, isn't it?
But we're just kind of like receiving the experience.
Another important thing about watching what's happening is the attitude that we have.
So we bring a meditation posture where we try to be straight and alert.
And there is an external posture. There's also an internal posture. How am I relating to what I'm seeing happening here?
How do we do that? It's kind of easy to say, but when we sit down and close our eyes, a lot of things are happening.
What time did we start?
6.30. You're good.
So the instructions are easy, simple.
And it's basically bringing your attention, bringing your awareness to an object.
And through the weeks, we started with the breath. That was week one. Bring your attention to your breathing.
And why do we do that? Why does that help us? Why is that helpful at all?
It means because if we look at our mind, that if you just close your eyes and try to see what's happening, you can see your mind going everywhere.
Probably the body is here, but the mind is time-trolling. It's fixing the past. We do a lot of it, I think in general.
Are we analyzing here? Are we planning what we're going to do? How we remember that I need to do such and such and such?
That's basically what the mind does, isn't it?
But when we bring our attention to an object of observation, the image that works for me is like a helium balloon that you attach to a rock and put it on the floor.
The wind is blowing, so your mind is going, but it's not going too far.
Okay, come here. It really helps you to start noticing, like, oh, I'm going away. I'm coming back.
So we started with the breath. And the breath is nice because, well, it's always there.
And something nice about the breath that is changing is not a fixed object. It's not like you're laser focused onto something.
It's kind of going and coming, it's like the waves. It's like that there's something very nice about it.
Like if you think in a swing, like, it feels nice when you're not completely static, but because there's some kind of this movement, so the attention kind of is doing that.
Sometimes a breath is not accessible for whatever reason.
There's too much agitation or just isn't working. There's a need to be a specific reason for it.
We can bring your attention to sounds, for example.
And the way we do it is not trying to figure out where the sound is coming from.
Oh, there's a car coming. It's just like more like, imagine you're watching a landscape and like an open field and you're just watching what's happening.
The same way we listen, like, oh, there's combs and ghosts, kind of receiving.
That can be quite powerful, that sounds can, if there's a lot of agitation, at least for me, it's a really nice way to get, okay,
come in my nervous system and I'm being here.
Bringing the attention to the feet, for example, if there's anxiety or something, like, okay, I'm here.
Like that contact with the floor is very, very real.
I am here. So that's kind of help us kind of get grounded, sensations in the hands.
Or if there's something else that is prominent in the moment.
It doesn't need to be always the same object. It depends on where you are.
You start attuning to your experience, what serves right now.
I'm going to be like, okay, I'm going to focus on it, no matter what. It's not a project.
Meditation is not a project. We just, we need to bring a lot of gentleness and kindness to it.
And make it like something that you, oh, I want to go and meditate.
Imagine like, oh yeah, it's nice. It's not always nice. There's moments where meditation is going to be challenging, difficult.
But in general, like, what is my relationship towards meditation?
So something that is, you can make it work. I can make this work for you. Like, this is what I need.
The second week we talk about the body.
And why the body, really?
I think we touch a little bit about the kind of the wisdom, the intelligence of the body.
I think we tend to live depending on the kind of work we do, but a lot.
If we, if we're just heads, I think sometimes I feel my day goes and it's like, it's just a floating head.
I forget that I have a body, that there's something else here.
Have you heard about the relationship between the brain and the gut?
Like the second brain. It's actually a thing.
So there's nerve cells that line our digestive system.
From the esophagus to the rectum, there's a layer of cells all over our gastrointestinal system.
And that system communicates with the brain. There's kind of, they're both in connection.
And there's also the vagus nerve. I don't know if we talk a lot about it for self-compassion, like self-soothing and things like that.
So the body and the brain, they're not this, they're not two different things. They're part of a system.
There's even, the studies are showing, for example, people that has issues, digestive issues, chronic disease, irritable bowel syndrome, a lot of those.
Yeah. How a lot of, like sometimes like there's, it's hard to deal with it.
Like you can get in this mood, depression, anxiety are related at part sometimes of all the symptomology of it.
So there was, oh yeah, it's obviously you're going to get sad and depressed and whatever just because you're sick.
But it seems that there's, it's more than that. There's a relationship between the two.
Your gut is in your brain, something. We have neuro receptors in that second brain, in that part of a nervous system.
And so it's, it's not because you're sick that you're getting that. Sometimes it's, yeah, maybe you're sad and there's this connection.
It's not, it's not black and white. I think there is much more complex than that.
And all that to say that why the body, why do we pay attention to the body?
And it's because there's a lot that we can learn from our body.
If we start paying more attention to, to what the body is telling us in the language of the body, the emotions that we thought that was week three.
The more the body expresses for emotion. Sometimes emotions are, have kind of a neurochemical signature.
There's electrical signals in our body that are associated with emotions.
There's connections in our brain. Things happen in our body.
So emotions is not something that we make up. It's part of our system. It's part of having a body.
So when in meditation, I think I mentioned that already, like Gil says that mindfulness shouldn't be called mindfulness, but bodyfulness.
Like if you really pay attention to what's happening in your body, it's an incredible way of getting grounded.
And we start, it's not only observing, but it's also understanding how we're relating to what we're seeing with what we're perceiving.
So it's the perceiving, but it's also the attitude that we have towards that.
And then the emotions and today thinking, the processes, the mental formations.
That in a way, emotions are kind of that too.
And what is interesting, so like everything is connected. So we have the breath.
We expand to the body. We added the emotions and now we're adding the thinking.
It's kind of something is blooming. It's like everything is part of our meditation.
We're not leaving anything out. Everything is part of the meditation.
And it's important to, and I think we, in Twitter, we know, like with the emotion, there's this connection between the emotions at the thinking.
And this, they create this feedback loop between them.
So the emotions are going to impact the thinking, the thoughts, and the thoughts are going to impact the emotions.
And we can totally create an avalanche if, like, if we don't know it, if we don't become aware that that's happening.
And I think that's what we're trying to train in meditation.
Starting to become more aware of those connections, connections with my breath, with my body, my body, with my emotions, my emotions, with my thinking.
How everything, it's like a fabric. Everything is connected in some way.
It's like we're not one thing or the other.
So I guess in a nutshell, that's a kind of a summary and where we're going to go today, thinking, keeping in mind that there's, it's everything.
It's like we just expanding and getting everything, the big part of everything and how everything makes part of the meditation.
So before I go any further, I wonder how the practice, how was the practice this week or any experience this week?
If anything, if you notice anything about emotions, if you change your attitude or there was some insight or more awareness about emotions
or the body of the breath in general, the practice, how is that going?
Do you want a microphone? If you want to?
This week was a little stressful and so I did a meditation by Nick Schwartz. Have you heard of him?
No.
Anyway, he has you like notice what's going on in your mind and then he has you take that and expand on it and such.
And it was so powerful, like my whole body had tingles throughout it and I was like, wow, that's so great.
And I slept so much better that night. I did it right before bed and I thought, wow, I gotta do this every night.
This is great.
What did you, if I may ask, what made you like appreciate it? What was something that you could...
So I watched this movie called The Woman King. Have you seen it?
The Woman King?
I know you've seen the previews but...
Yeah, it's a really good movie but in the movie she was haunted by, she kept calling it a monster and she figured out that that monster was her.
She was holding herself back and the reason she had those dreams was because she was raped by, it was in Africa
and they had her tied down and they would rape her over and over and she got pregnant and had a daughter and it's like this whole story.
But for some reason that affected me. So when I was doing the meditation, I was trying to think about my little Suzanne in my head, you know?
And for some reason that the rape scene kept playing in my head because I'm in therapy right now and so for some reason that made my body do things, you know?
And I was like, that is so weird. I don't know what that is so I talked to my therapist today about it.
But I did, in the end, you know, he did calm me down and then my whole body was relaxed and nice tingles.
Is that connection between our thinking and that loop that can be quite strong and difficult to break?
So, in a way, you already did the class of today.
Thank you.
I was pretty much sick for like three or four days intensely.
It was a huge problem with this bug which was not COVID, thank God, and not strep.
But I haven't gotten this sick in a long, long time.
And so there's very little in the way of meditation.
It was mostly just trying to just be with my body which was the one that's best.
So I don't have anything to report other than to say that maybe that's a meditation also, just staying with your body when you're sick, just staying with it.
Yeah, thank you. Is it that discernment at what serves right now?
What is it that can help me?
You're like, okay, I'm going to meditate and the therapist say, no, what's happening right now that needs my attention?
And when, yeah, I got COVID in March and the only thing I could do was just be there.
Like, I mean, not just noticing what was going on, like trying, but no break or anything.
He said, you just need to attune to what's the experience and how am I relating to it?
For me, I'm sorry, maybe I'm deviating a little bit, but it's like when the, and Jessica started, like the fever went down and everything, like, okay, I'm not being productive.
I'm feeling better. Maybe I should go and check in.
Wow, that was so interesting to see.
I said, no, I just need to relax and this is okay. I'm doing the best I can.
So you start noticing that how those places that the mind goes and that's what meditation offers us.
Is that opportunity to see my experience and how am I related to it? It's observing and also the attitude.
Yeah, thank you for sharing that.
What's interesting about it also is just that it puts you out of your sort of front of the male daily experience, right?
I mean, I remember times when I've been sick before and ripped out of my daily, usual experience and, okay, we're in this different mode now.
And it kind of has a timelessness all of its own because it has happened before, it will happen again.
And I tend to not take anything for it. I tend to just drink water, but until it's just like, okay, now I measure myself and I have fever.
Okay, fine, I should probably take something. But I kind of want to just be with it.
I want to feel, I don't want to suppress what's happening. I want to feel it.
COVID is another thing, but yeah.
And you just listen to your body. I mean, is it that body? I mean, it's not great, but I think I'm okay.
And if it's been a lot, it's like, okay, I think I need to do something about it. It's just attuning.
I found myself being, or just getting more distracted this week, just like a lot more things on my head.
So I would like put out my timer, but after maybe five, seven minutes, I'm like, I need to do something else.
Okay, yeah, I just want myself distracted more.
Okay, but you notice that you are distracted.
Yeah, okay.
I think that's one of the big things with this practice, like before we didn't notice that we were distracted, isn't it?
We were just, no, no, no anchor.
There was no reference point. We were just blown away with the wind.
And now you're like, oh, wow, I'm distracted.
That's huge. That is, I mean, it may seem like little or simple, but that is huge.
When we start noticing how our mind works, that makes a big difference.
And it's, this practice is, it takes time.
It's little by little, it's little things that happen that make you more aware, like, wow.
And then how does that make you feel when you're distracted?
And maybe, hmm, I'm very distracted. How does that feel in my body?
Or maybe, wow, look at my breathing is kind of accelerated or, oh, I'm feeling awful.
You know, it's start noticing all those things, context in a way.
Yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you.
All right.
So, when, mindfulness of thinking, mindfulness of thoughts, what is that?
So, imagine you, it's a beautiful day like today, blue sky and little bit of wind is wonderful.
And you just lay down on the ground, for example.
And there's these puffy clouds moving around, and you're just watching them.
That's little bit what we do in meditation, which is, oh, look, another cloud.
Oh, there comes another one.
Or like, and imagine it worked for me, like soap bubbles.
When you were a kid, or if you had kids when you play and you blow the bubbles and they just go, just like, oh, it goes there, shimmering.
But we're not engaging, like, oh, what kind of soap is that one?
Oh, is that a blue or a red color?
What reflection is that?
And we just, oh, look, bubbles, clouds, we're just looking at noticing that, like, the mind is the sky and the thoughts are the clouds.
Basically, I think we've heard that in several mindfulness images, we hear a lot of that.
But think about it, it's like, you're just not trying to understand what is it that thought is, and follow, go down the rabbit hole.
It's just, oh, I'm thinking.
Oh, that's a thought.
Okay, oh, I'm thinking here.
So, without engaging, is that easy?
Probably not.
Some thoughts are super sticky, something that is, especially if there's something emotional that starts bubbling up with the thought,
you just want to stick with it, like, if I think it even more, I know I'm going to fix it, or particularly with the past,
we're trying to have a better past often.
So, when we're in meditation, we just, with the blue sky, if that image works for you, and you're just trying to see the clouds.
So, let's, when I invite you to do a little easy exercise.
So, if you want to close your eyes, or lower in your case,
take a couple of deep breaths.
Notice your body, and adjust your posture if you need to.
Now, bring the attention to your thoughts, like, notice your thoughts.
Maybe that, when we turn, okay, pay attention to your thoughts, it seems that nothing comes.
Just wait, and something is going to pop up.
Perhaps notice if it's the thought about, many thoughts about specific topic, or random thoughts.
Notice if you mind, if you want to think more about it, if you want to go, and research that thought, and follow that thought.
Just noticing the stickiness of the thinking.
Maybe something that you don't want to think about.
That was sad.
What did you notice?
Was it easy?
What did you see?
Just, if you need to write the report, what did you see?
Okay.
I put you like, oh, it's so nice.
What else?
What else did you notice?
You want to take the, sorry.
I kept thinking, there's no thoughts in my head.
And then I started seeing some thoughts, and I'm thinking, I don't want to think about those thoughts.
And then I pulled them back, and then said, I want to think about this, and I tried, but then you ended.
I spent a lot of time on, there's no thoughts, there's no thoughts.
Like you were saying at first, there was like nothing, which is my preferred meditating state.
And then it was just like those inflatable things outside of the gas stations with, you know, arms going all over.
And pulling myself back.
Yeah, there's nothing more efficient to say, okay, think all you want, like, nothing's going on.
So that's a little bit of the sense, okay, they're coming and going.
And even if we think, oh, there's no thought, that there's, okay, something is in the package, there's always something going on.
The thought of there are no thoughts.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm liberated, no thoughts.
Now, the thoughts, I'm going to try kind of become very theoretical about it, like, okay, so what, how do you think?
I mean, I think thoughts could be images.
So they have, like, the process of thinking, you could see your thoughts could come like images.
They could come like words, sentences, colors, smells.
I mean, just kind of, how do you know is it thought and how, like, how is it for you?
Like, images sometimes we have, like, those kind of flashbacks.
I have images and then copies.
Yeah.
There's a lot of copies here.
Yes.
And then you're like, can you calm down?
Yeah. Rehearsing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Even music, smells, like memories.
Lower the volume, please.
Yeah.
So there's this kind of how they present themselves.
Go ahead.
I was going to say that for me, most of the time, if I'm going to meditate, I have to get myself into a quiet place first.
So it's very difficult for me to just kind of drop into something.
It takes me a little while to get to a place where I'm settled.
And in that settled state, one of the things that I have sort of discovered about what happens for me is when I am in a settled state, when I've entered it,
I will see these shades of color just kind of randomly floating in my field of vision.
And that's when I know that I've entered into that state.
It won't stay forever, but that's a good sign for me that I've calmed down enough that I can be there now.
But it's very difficult for me to just kind of go into like, I'm meditating, and now I'm noticing my mind.
You know, it's a work to get to the settled state.
Okay.
Do you, how do you, do you try to explain your experience?
To myself?
No.
Like if you see colors and things.
No, no.
Would you just, oh, look.
It's there.
Oh, there it is.
Okay.
Yeah.
It shows up under, I mean, I guess what I know at the same time is that my body has, my body feels settled.
My body feels calm.
It's like the whole thing, the whole enchilada is calm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And do you usually, like if you're thinking now, how are the thoughts coming to you?
Are they images?
Are you more of a visual person?
Or, I mean, I'm not saying that we always have the same.
You're always, your thoughts are always images.
It's a variety of things.
I don't know.
Okay.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Let's do more, do a little bit of that and see what happens.
Yeah.
Just to explore.
I'm sitting there and I'm like, walking through, counting the windows, and then I come up with
a number and no one else in the room could do that.
And I was like, wow.
I thought it was a good thing.
You're good at visualizing.
And I could visualize it, but no one else could.
Okay.
So it was a way to say, oh, you're a visual learner.
That's the whole point.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
So we have all that mental activity that will come to us in these different ways.
Now, besides the, like the, how do you, the wrapping of the thought.
Okay.
I know it's a thought for me, like images or things like that.
It's also the, the content.
What, what is, what is in that thought?
So for example, I can remember like a thought that comes and who I was walking by the kitchen.
There was this awesome smell of waffles and warm.
I'm like, hmm, like, what is it in, in, in the, in the thought or you're still rehearsing
that fight that you had in the morning.
And he told me this and blah, blah, blah.
And like, it's more like what, what's, so you could see that like a dialogue, but you
could be also kind of images.
So it's how we present itself and what is the content of the thoughts.
And then what is the style of the thinking?
Is it a memory that you're remembering?
Are you planning?
Are you fantasizing?
So it's kind of really totally kind of deconstructing the thought, but it's interesting to kind
of start noticing those different things.
Are we going to start maybe seeing some topics, some, some things that repeat over and over
and over again?
Wow.
Like images, for example, and usually when I think images, they relate it to something
that I like very much, that I enjoy, that takes me places.
And I'm remembering, I remember a lot.
Childhood and things like that.
So it kind of is interesting to see all those aspects of what it thought is.
So I'm going to invite you again to close your eyes, take a deep breath.
And just for a moment, let the thoughts come to you.
Maybe bring back yourself to the beginning of your day.
Notice how the thoughts come.
And what is the content?
What's the story?
And as you see the content, notice what happens in your body.
The emotions or you feel a shift in your mood.
And maybe bring yourself to the future in a couple of hours when you're back home.
How are those thoughts, again, images, sounds?
And what's the story?
How does that feeling in your body?
And if you look at what you just did, the thoughts that came and went,
what was the, there was a style, a particular style to it?
Was it, I don't know, complaining or wanting to fix something, investigating, interrogating, fixing?
Was there kind of a style to your thoughts?
How was that, what did you notice?
Let's just see, I'm hard of hearing.
Your voice is very calming.
Your voice is very calming.
I kept dozing a little.
I noticed like images, like being aware of the images and find myself rehearsing for something.
So that was what was on my mind.
We're going to be kind of in a therapy session.
I become aware in my mind, I become aware of sort of the different parts of me.
And one thing that happened recently which is really great was noticing this one part
and then out of nowhere sort of little gossips just going, fine, just don't cause me harm or suffering.
Not trying to suppress it, not trying to do anything else, I see you.
But please, don't cause me harm or suffering.
And that was, that all happened in this state of just kind of being calm.
And those are the things that I kind of really appreciate when I can see that clearly.
Without me having to think about it, it just kind of arises.
And there's a truth, right?
There is that side of me which can cause me great harm.
And another part of me, the one that maybe the little Buddha self, you know, just saying, I see you.
I'm not going to deny you, but just don't cause me harm.
Don't cause me suffering, please.
The other thing that I notice frequently is, oh, look at my ego.
Oh, look at my ego.
Oh, look at my ego.
And it's also a non-judgmental.
It's just like, oh, there you go.
There it is again.
There it is again, you know.
But that shows up in many different ways.
How do you relate to that?
It's kind of neutral.
Okay.
It just says to me, it's like I can see it clearly.
And what it says to me is, okay, so this is something to be aware of, right?
In your automatic daily life, right?
You probably should be a little bit more aware that your ego is going to be in the middle of it.
Strongly, so be aware.
But I've learned not to be harsh with myself.
I mean, if I did, then I wouldn't want to meditate.
Yeah.
It's just seeing it.
I get comfort in just, as you said, to Rocky, actually.
I get comfort in just being able to see it.
That's enough for today.
I saw it, you know.
Yeah, and then it's...
How many times, like, we do something and, like, wow, I'm showing off here, isn't it?
And it takes cuts to, wow, I'm showing off here and be okay with it.
Like, wow, oh, look, come here.
It's okay.
It happens, like, bring that attitude of, I think that's what this practice, in itself, self-compassion,
it's so embedded in the practice.
Like, oh, wow, look, I'm showing off again.
It's okay.
Let's see what we can do here.
It's fine.
That happens.
And just noticing that you can pull yourself out of it,
and maybe there's another way that you can do things.
Or, I don't know, being self-conscious, like, about whatever, like, oh, I don't know enough,
or I don't like my hair.
I don't know.
All those things, like, oh, look, it's again.
There it is again, like, okay, I see you.
I see you.
It's, yeah.
And just noticing also the older type of thoughts that we have.
Like, I do, for me, it varies, but a lot of the things that I do is rehearsing.
Oh, gosh.
Like, and sometimes I notice that it's a sentence that I keep repeating, even if I'm breathing.
It's like, oh, my gosh, really?
Like, okay, what is this about?
Like, wow, I'm rehearsing again.
Yeah, I'm like, so what's happening there?
And I notice my body, like, ooh, I'm intense.
I'm nervous.
And maybe there's a little bit of fear, something coming up.
And then just seeing it, and it's not a matter of, okay, how are we going to fix this?
It's like, oh, wow, look, it's a little bit of nervousness there.
I'm a little afraid of the presentation.
I'm a little afraid of that meeting that I'm going to have.
It's just noticing, just a little bit of distance.
It's amazing what it does.
It's like the ostrich getting the head out of the ground.
Yeah.
The other thing that comes up is, do we believe our thoughts?
I mean, they're helpful, isn't it?
Like, we use them all the time.
We function if we didn't have them as part of, yeah.
But sometimes we have certain thoughts that are like, wow, that's really particularly about ourselves.
Like, ooh, I won't be able to do it.
I'm going to mess up.
I won't be able to make it.
I don't know.
I'm not good enough.
A lot of self-reference.
And he said, really, is that true?
Is that so, really?
Or thoughts maybe about other people around us?
Oh, how would this consider it?
This is so selfish and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like all the criticism that we can create.
And he's like, hmm, really?
I mean, it's just a thought.
I don't, we don't have to believe everything we think.
And we don't have to agree with it sometimes.
Sometimes it's just kind of the reaction coming from our habits or we're trying to defend.
We feel, I don't know, attack in some way.
So we're having all these kind of thoughts just trying to, no, no, no, this is not okay.
And they just, wow, yeah, look at that.
That's not true maybe about somebody, how that person looks so dangerous.
Like, is it so?
Or am I going to let myself be pulled into that, into that fear?
And no, I don't want to be close to that person.
That is strange.
Or is that so?
What is it going on?
It doesn't mean that if you're in a dangerous situation, you're going to say, oh, analyzing,
oh, you're going to react appropriately.
But sometimes it's just really, am I thinking, is that true?
Is that really true?
Catastrophizing, isn't it?
We do that so much.
Oh, that's going to be terrible.
I won't be able to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I mean, it's normal.
Sometimes we're under so much stress or difficult situation and it's scary.
That's where the mind is going to go.
And it's not that we're trying to fix it or change it per se, but it's like, oh, wow, look, there's a lot of fear here.
Maybe I can approach the situation in a different way, like shift perspective or something like that.
Predicting the future.
Let's get the crystal ball out and we know exactly what's going to happen and really, really that happens.
Yeah.
What other kind of thoughts do you think we not necessarily need to believe that much?
What comes to you?
The thinking traps.
Yeah, catastrophizing, that's a big one.
I do exactly what she was saying.
Yeah, and we do it all the time.
Christian Neff, who wrote the self-compassion book, she has this one exercise you can do where you, or she was talking about a study where they did these cue cards.
And on the cue cards, you had like three things that were affirmations about yourself and then things that, then some cards that said it was about people with acne.
My acne doesn't affect other people, you know, that type of thing, because they were always thinking, oh my God, people are looking at you.
So I did that for myself with my therapist, we put it together and then I tried to read them.
So like the whole thing about catastrophizing, I have one that says, try it, you might like it.
Yeah, and just noticing, and when we are in meditation, I think we create a safe space for ourselves.
And is, can we drop the fight?
Again, if you think about it, we're always fighting.
We're always engaging in some way, like at work, I mean, that's normal, that's the way life happens, isn't it?
I was going to work this morning, I wasn't driving.
For some reason, I was more nervous than usual, there was a lot of traffic.
And like every time, there was like, oh my God, we're going to have an accident.
Oh my God, wow, look at that.
I was so into, like, this is dangerous, like, okay, can I, I know he's an excellent driver, he knows what he's doing, I'm going to trust that.
It's okay, this is stressful here, but can I just stop fighting this situation?
Can I just, I don't, I'm safe, I mean, an accident could happen anytime, but it's like, okay, this is okay, I can drop that fight.
I don't need to go into that bottle right now.
Okay, but these are just thoughts.
And sometimes it helps so much, like, you know that you're kind of trapped because your body tells you.
And then the emotions start coming up, like this anxiety, that fear, like, wow, look at that.
This, the feeling, this loop starts creating that, you know, the thing that works, I think is kind of making a list.
What is it that I can't control? What is it that I just cannot control?
It's out of my, yeah, no matter what I do, that's going to be there.
And that gives a little bit of an agency, and like, okay, I can get out of that state.
So, yeah, there's a lot of, yeah.
So, I think I mentioned before too that I came to the practice through compassion, compassion, cultivation.
And I see compassion in this practice, it's everywhere.
People say, okay, mindfulness, you know, the same thing as compassion, but they need each other.
But I think compassion is so, is so much part of this practice.
If you don't have compassion, I think doing this practice is very difficult.
So anyway, so let's maybe do a group of three, or we can do it together.
Okay, how many groups?
So, maybe I'll ask a question and see what that comes.
I'll ask you to, just whatever comes to your mind.
So, I think a little bit what I have asked already, but let's do this.
So, if you could share the kind of thoughts that came to you.
If you were going to describe them, as images or as sounds.
And even can you remember moments where a thought came to you, maybe as a smell, or something that was very evocative,
like, whoa, that brought you back to memories, a lot of it happens.
And how they make you feel.
So, not only, okay, that's a thought.
So, what we're trying to do in meditation is like, oh, that thought.
But things are going to happen in our body. They're connected.
So, bring a little bit of awareness to what happens in the body when those thoughts come.
You see a relationship between the thoughts and the emotions, or the thoughts and the body.
Kind of your bodily, body responds to thoughts.
What comes to mind?
I think what's unusual for me, or kind of what I'm most grateful for is that
it's the interplay between thoughts and emotions.
The body's kind of third in this list.
I'm really grateful when an emotion shows up as something that I can then recognize while I'm meditating.
I may have said this before, but I've had times when things have come up out of nowhere.
And I actually, I so strongly believe in the coming out of nowhere part.
That's why I like so much to just settle my mind, because it's in that settled state
that things will bubble up, that things will arise.
And then I can see them work clearly also.
So, it's kind of like the bubbling up of the emotion into something that I can then recognize.
Those are the ones that are really valuable, and they kind of then interact.
Some something will show up, I can then recognize it, and in recognizing it,
I can become very emotional about something, which tells me I've seen something.
I've seen something, I've got an insight into something.
I live for those. That's what meditation is all about for me.
And then it's basically, I guess, the other part of it would just be sort of more mundane,
but it's recognizing the different voices.
I know that there's very many different parts of me.
I just know that there are, not that I have multiple personalities,
but all of us have different personalities that we are, right?
In a way we do.
Yeah, in a way we do.
I think the commonality.
Thank you. That makes me think of how difficult it is sometimes to settle down.
There's a lot of things that are coming, like distraction, like wow, the mind is just crazy,
that mood that got into your head and you cannot stop thinking about it.
And sometimes we try so hard to be over it.
Like I want it to end. I don't want to think about this anymore.
And sometimes it's like that.
It's very, I mean, I can feel it in my, the discomfort, like how unpleasant that is.
I can totally feel it in my body.
And sometimes it is, don't be too quick and trying to live that state.
Because when something bothers us, like, well, this is worth investigating.
But I think that's the beauty of the practice.
Like stay with it a little bit.
As much as is possible.
We want to have a practice that is very balanced.
We don't want to get into crazy states.
We're not trying to produce any state.
We're not trying, we're just trying to be with our experience.
And a lot of it is going to come from inside, isn't it?
So try to stay balanced.
If it's not working, open your eyes, go for a walking meditation or just do something else.
And if it becomes too intense.
But if it's possible, stay with it.
And take a little bit of the distance, like the movie in your head, like, oh, wow.
Look, what is it doing to me?
Try to bring a little bit of distance.
What's happening there?
Why is it so bothersome?
Or why is it so in my mind?
Like just let it be.
Like without engaging too much, but noticing.
I think what Tanya was saying last week is, those states are going to come.
There's a physiological response that is going to be there.
But if we let it, it's going to fade away.
So could you, if possible, if it's the right thing to do, can you stay with it for a little bit?
What's happening here?
Was this mind so distracted?
What's, okay, wow, distracted mind.
How does it, where am I feeling that?
Is there, is there any change in my mood?
Am I, what am I fighting here?
What am I holding so tight that I'm not letting this go?
Can I just be with it?
What if I don't resist it?
What if I can, wow, yeah, thinking, thinking.
You can like put the label on it, remembering, planning, whatever it is.
That's like, give it, stay with it a little bit.
And eventually it's going to, it's going to move away.
It's hard sometimes.
Yes, it is.
It's hard when somebody is, you know, bawling you out, you know.
Like you did this to me, you did that to me, and this is my daughter.
And, and you can, can't do anything. You don't want to answer because she's in this crazy state.
So if you answer, then she's going to get mad at you.
And then if you don't answer, she gets mad at you.
So, and it's hard like being in that state.
You're just like, okay, I feel like I'm being reprimanded for my mom or something.
And that's the only thing I recognize is I have that really awful feeling.
And why, you know, why am I feeling this way? I'm an adult.
So that's the only thing.
But like beyond that, I couldn't go because I just felt you just get stuck in that feeling.
So I have a lot more work to do.
And, and, and maybe when it comes in your meditation, if you, if it, if it's very alive,
those, those interactions kind of stay there.
Like we, we keep repeating them.
So maybe just stay with it a little bit.
How does that make, like investigate?
What is, how is that making me feel?
Yeah, like, okay, it's in my body.
And like you mentioned, Christine, that if I think, wow, this hurts.
This is very unpleasant.
This is a moment of suffering.
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, of course, of course it is.
And I try to see by loosening it up a little bit.
Oh, no, I know, I know it's not easy.
I try to see.
I try and think about it.
Yeah.
And maybe you, you find your way and listening to different people, different strategies,
different tools.
I'm listening to different people, like, you know, Friday Brown, and Christine, the other guy,
when he was the first sentence in the book, said,
can you hear a shell or do you have a coin?
Yes, that is, that's me.
Can I say something?
Sure.
One of the things that I'm completely sure of is that much as me, the person who's speaking right now,
or the conscious mind that's actually saying something,
I'm not in full control over what's going on.
There's an entire system way back there, a huge system back there.
What is very clear to me is that there are times when my mind doesn't want to meditate.
And I stay with it.
I just, it takes me off there.
It takes me off there.
It takes me off there.
It tries to put me to sleep.
It does this.
It does that.
It does this.
And I just kind of stay with it.
And I just stay with it.
And I just stay with it.
Usually after it tries to put me to sleep, and I'm not off, and I come back, okay.
You tried your best.
We're here now, and we can do this.
And then I'm in fact very, very calm.
So the idea that the mind is not an active participant in your practice is,
the me is wrong, the mind is very active, not just in the sense of providing inputs for you to contemplate.
The mind is actually, it's tricky.
It's got its own agenda.
It's doing shit, you know?
And what I found in my practice is just, yeah, let it be.
It's fine.
Just let it be.
I do have an intention.
I do have an intention of getting settled.
And we're going to stay here until we're settled.
Try to put me to sleep.
It's fine.
Put me to sleep.
It's fine.
But when I wake up, we're going to be settled, you know?
It's great when I can sit down, and my mind is open.
My mind is not going to fight me from the start.
And it's relatively straightforward to get settled at that point.
But I have learned that the mind is, it's got its agenda also, you know?
And it's been useful to just recognize that.
Yeah.
The other thing that is important is what serves, what is skillful to do now?
Okay, you take your walk every day.
You love your walk.
You know that it's good for your body.
It keeps you sane, all that stuff.
Okay, I'm going to go for my walk, and you open the door, and it's pouring rain.
You know that the walk is good for you, that the movement is good for you.
Are you going to go for your walk?
Are you going to get into the rain and get wet to the bone?
Probably not.
Probably it's a moment like, hmm, maybe I'll take a nap.
Maybe you go in the rain, and I don't know.
But you have, that's a little bit what I'm saying about having a balanced practice.
Like, for me, I do need to meditate every day.
It keeps me, it's, in a way, part of my routine is kind of like brushing my teeth.
Like, I'm not complete if I don't meditate during the day, isn't it?
But there are days that is, gosh, this is so hard.
Like, there's too much going on, or just, yeah, I'm restless for whatever reason.
So maybe a movement practice.
I'm going to do something else.
Like, do a little bit of yoga, mindful yoga.
Something like, what serves?
I think that this body-mind serves.
I personally, I don't like to think of my mind as the mind there.
You that interfere with my life.
I don't know, for me, it's, hey, come here.
Oh, no, no, it's not a negative thing.
I don't think of it as a negative thing.
I know that it has a life of its own.
Yeah, and it's recognizing our human nature.
I mean, we are the hardware that the way our brain works,
how the, our second brain communicates with it.
That matters is, I know that that is there, and just honor it.
By the way, I'm not judgmental about that.
No, I know.
I just want you to know, right?
It's not like I'm saying that that's a bad thing.
No, that may...
That made me think a little bit of, just to emphasize that the practice
brings balance to your practice.
Right.
We're not trying to create the instruction.
So, like, check A, B, C, we're done.
It's more dynamic.
Like, what is going on today?
Like, get attuned to your experience.
I mean, maybe some days the emotional state is too much,
and you cannot handle it.
It's like recognizing, like, hmm, this is not the time for me to sit down and meditate.
This is the time for me to take a nap, go for a walk, and watch a movie.
Right, exactly.
But this is the whole point, is discernment, right?
Of what?
Discernment.
It's the whole question.
How to discern, right?
There's, I totally agree with you.
Like, if it's not the thing to do right now, don't go out in the rain.
That said, there's also saying, no, no, no, I recognize this.
That's not real rain.
You're making rain.
You're trying to make it look like rain.
Sorry, no.
I'm not interested.
I'm going to...
I have an intention.
Let's, we can continue offline when we're done.
I would like to offer another question.
The way we relate to our thinking and our emotions depend on many factors.
So, for yourself, what makes it more difficult to be OK to what you're thinking or what you're feeling?
So, for example, for me, if I'm hungry, I have issues.
If I'm tired, if I don't have my eight hours of sleep, I know it's going to make my experience
more difficult.
There's a layer of complexity that the states bring to our experience.
So, for you, what is it?
What are the triggers for you?
What are the things that you know that you need to change something?
That like, okay, this is happening, I'm being this annoyed just because I know I'm hungry.
Or you have a project, that work, I don't know, that is taking you forever.
I'm never going to finish that.
And that bleeds into the rest of your life.
So, just what influences your thinking, your emotion?
I've noticed that, for me, my mind tends to go to the more negative emotions and thinking back to like,
oh, this happened.
Why did this happen?
This is what I should have said sort of thing.
It's more often like that type of thing rather than the better emotions.
So maybe I need to start thinking about the more positive things rather than the negative ones as much.
Okay.
Yeah.
And is there anything that makes it worse?
Or something that makes it like, oh, that is lighter, that is easier to get out of it?
Something external, you mean?
Or I don't know, something that sometimes, for some reason, the planets align, okay, that wasn't too bad.
It doesn't need to be.
No, no, no, you need to, maybe, yeah.
And the invitation is like, we know what makes our life hard.
The things that we can control, isn't it?
So can we take care of those things?
Or recognize that, well, when I'm hungry, you better not be close to me.
So, okay, I know I'm peace because I'm tired.
I'm exhausted.
It was a long day.
Can I still be okay with it?
Can that lighten a little bit?
Does nothing need to really pull me down, make me feel the worst?
No, sometimes it's okay.
I'm not in great mood.
I'm hungry.
Maybe I just go prepare something.
But like, oh, wow, there's all these happening here.
And that's why I'm feeling that way.
And that's why I have these repetitive thoughts that may happen, isn't it?
And yet, okay, I'm okay.
I know that's happening.
I still can be okay.
So like, lightening the weight.
Like, get out of the automatic pilot and going, can I just take a little bit of space and do something about it?
Don't plan a difficult conversation when you know you're going to be exhausted and hungry or something like that.
What can you think of something, a situation like that?
Just now, last week I was freezing.
This week I'm overheating.
My body doesn't regulate well with temperature.
And so when I overheat, I get spasms.
And so that's why I took a muscle relaxer.
So I had a hard time focusing because that was going on.
That's why I stepped out and took my muscle relaxer so I can participate.
So I have that and also the food thing.
I definitely, that's me.
That's very nice.
And sometimes, like, if we're sitting here and like, for me, sitting in the chair is this difficult.
I sit in a cushion, but if I sit too long in a cushion, my knees are going to start hurting me.
Yeah, so it's something.
Exactly.
So like, maybe allow yourself to listen to your body.
Maybe I need to stand up a little bit and say, okay, I need to stand up.
Is that okay with you if that bothers you?
Or just do it.
Like, okay, like, be attuned to your system.
Maybe you're going through something super difficult in your life and you have all these thoughts and be aware of it.
Okay, this is kind of coloring my experience at work or this conversation with this person.
I know it's not that bad, but that is present.
So be aware of that.
So that's what, and when we're in the meditation is we're just practicing, we're training to be able to do that, to recognize that, well, there's something up here.
That's kind of the meditation sometimes is like the gym.
You strengthen that muscle.
And the idea is we erase the line between the cushion and daily life.
So we can, it's not, it's easier said than done, but that's where maybe what we, is it possible maybe to bring a little bit of that calm that you've reached in meditation to your daily life.
And when you have a difficult meditation, your mind is everywhere, it's not working.
It's like, I'm fighting it.
It's like, I'm having that conversation again, like I cannot get it out of my head.
Stay with it.
Can I do this?
Like gently, kindly.
What is it that is needed here?
Can I just start learning how to, ah, okay.
It could be a hurricane season over there.
I'm here in the eye of the hurricane.
I can find that place where I can be okay balance.
So I have the possibility of responding rather than reacting.
The eye of the hurricane for me is the breath when that's happening with the brains everywhere.
Try not to do that. Try not to do that, right?
The eye of the hurricane is the breath.
That's exactly what I go back to.
It's very simple for me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know that. That's a very good point.
Like what works for you?
What, what, figure out what, and it's going to change through life, basically.
For example, for me, this moment of my life is sounds. I get too agitated, feeling that it's too much sounds.
And I can't do sounds anywhere.
I don't need to close my eyes.
I can just kind of focus, look at it, and just listen to sounds.
Because sometimes the breath, that's kind of unusual.
It's always been the breath and now.
The breath is not working.
So, wow, sounds have been incredible help for me.
If it's a little bit too much anxiety, my feet on the floor.
Like feeling the weight of my body is like, I'm here.
Anger, like the earth is not going to let me go.
I'm here.
Like what works for you and experiment?
What is it that, and maybe you figure out in meditation,
when it's difficult?
That's your safe space where you can test things.
What is it?
So, yeah.
Could you?
I think this is it.
I find that using someone talking to you, just like you're talking through the meditation,
that helps me more.
I've actually asked my therapist, can you send me a recording so I can listen to you,
saying what I'm doing.
And yeah, and so the meditation last night with Dick Schwartz was him walking you through.
And there's like quiet time.
And he's like, okay, what are you seeing?
And like, let's do this or that.
And I find that really helpful just to sit by myself as a little harder.
But that guide is what helps me.
So in audio Dharma, there's tons of meditations.
So find what works for you.
And maybe they get a moment where you're going to want more silence.
So honor it.
Sometimes like when we listen to a lot of things and then he's like, okay, I'm done with it.
I need silence.
So I'm like, oh, honor that.
Yeah.
And maybe try walking meditation.
Okay.
Good.
So homework.
So try to see if you can extend the time you're meditating.
Even if it's one minute.
It really just, there was this image, Giel one, one's share.
This person learning to do yoga to the triangle pose, if you like.
And like, it was just so impossible to do.
So the recommendation was to use the Daytona 6 and more.
The books with all the addresses.
How do you call those?
Directors.
Yeah.
To pull.
Remember that the sheets are super, super thin.
So to use them and put your hand so you could hold yourself in your triangle pose.
And then every day you remove a page.
So you go into the triangle book comfortably.
The next day you remove another page.
Yeah.
I mean, it's going to take a long time, but eventually you're going to get there.
So add five seconds if that's all you can manage.
Add one minute.
Add two minutes.
Yeah.
And the other one, reflect on your beliefs about your thoughts.
What are your views?
Why are your opinions about your thoughts?
I mean, it may sound a little weird, but what am I thinking about my thoughts?
Are they always right?
I'm always right or not?
Something like that.
I couldn't bring the handout today.
I was going to, and no more ink in my printer.
So sorry about that.
But they're online.
They are online.
Yeah, they are online.
The other is see if you can track your, what kinds of thoughts do you have for a couple of hours?
That might sound like, oh, how am I going to do that?
So for example, why do you are waiting for something instead of getting your phone out?
What if I pay attention to what kind of thoughts I have?
It doesn't need to sit down.
Okay, I'm going to track my thoughts for two hours.
Don't make it something easy, accessible during your commute, if you're commuting.
If you go for a walk.
Okay, let's track, see if you can track your thoughts for a while and see what happens.
And then also track your intention.
When you do things, when you go around your day, what makes you, what is in, what's driving you?
Just noticing.
Where am I talking to this person?
I mean, it could be work related, I need to talk to this person.
But maybe you go and get a coffee and you end up chatting with the person that is giving you your coffee.
Why are you doing it?
Like what move you to do that?
Very simple.
Sometimes when we read that, it's like, oh, I'm never going to do that.
Really.
But it can be put into your day in very simple ways.
I don't think meditation should be a project.
I don't think this practice is a project.
It can bubble up naturally.
It comes in the most unexpected moments.
It's like, wow, I remember something about practice, like, oh, make it the three bread journey kind of thing.
Like bring it a little bit naturally.
Start bringing it when you remember.
So take a moment and focus, stay with it.
So let's dedicate the merit of our practice, of our time together.
So that this time that we have been here may be of benefit to all of us here,
to whoever listens to these recordings,
that it benefits the people around us, family, friends, the strangers that cruise our paths.
May every being be at peace and free of suffering.
Thank you for your practice today.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
