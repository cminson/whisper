 So good morning. Welcome to our second session on the awakening poems of the elder monks and nuns. We're glad to see that you guys came back because this is a little different format than usual and style. But there's a lot in the suttas, you know, there's a lot in there and encountering all of it as part of our practices to kind of bump our mind up against all these different things and see what happens. So we wanted to start out with an opportunity for you to offer any questions or comments or things that you've been discovering as you've been engaging with these poems. We had sent the ones from Saturday and offered a number of different ways of engaging with these poems. And I wonder if anyone has tried those things out or if you have anything coming up. This is a chance as well we get into today. Feel free to raise your zoom hand. Well, we might see your physical hand. Jerry. Jerry's got his hand up. Good morning. Sorry that I couldn't make it on the first class. This morning, I was able to devote time to listening to the shortened version of the first class. And I've taken the class because my little exposure to these poems, I didn't know the monks wrote them. It always gets me deeply. I'm realizing me reading the scriptures gets me. But seeing this morning. Two things. Two things. One is, I guess poetry is deep but non conceptual so it may not just be these verses it's the nature of that type of prose, that it's bypasses the mind, the thinking mind. Probably what touches me. But when David was reading those poems from last week from Saturday. I don't know if it's on a compass something like that. I was just shaking like a leaf. I mean this is becoming regular for me. And I think I'm probably restraining it a little bit. I'm not 100% comfortable with it but more and more the more it comes. But it's beautiful and I don't know how to express this, and I told myself I wasn't going to but then I guess you want to have an opportunity. It was a his one about the hot, which is who read the one about the hot. Okay. So, to me the hot was was in here and it was just vibrating, but I images of have just coming back from walking the dog. And as if this beauty was infused onto the world. It's really interesting I don't know what any of that means I don't care to know but I think happened and I didn't realize that we really do create the world. And if it's blowing and bright and awakened inside. It's blowing and bright and awakened outside and I found that very nice. Right. So I'm grateful for the poems, even deeper than I thought so that's what I wanted to share. Thank you for letting me share that. Well thank you, Jerry. Beautiful comment. And I love that you kind of didn't know that that was going to happen and just, you know, we don't know when we engage with these texts. Other thoughts other comments. I, I think I saw Deborah's hand go up. Okay Deborah. No. Oh, okay. Is that what you're saying. Okay. Maybe I'll say something about poetry. Just quickly here. I heard a poet who is also a practitioner. I was talking about kind of like the how because poetry has this just a few words, it tries to really, I don't know, distill down an expression or an experience or something into few words, and that's part of the powerfulness of them because it requires some mindfulness and what's really trying to be said, and to put them into few words and sometimes we can feel that we can touch into that. So, so I'd offer that. Yeah. Bill your hand is up. I noticed in several of the poems of the nuns, a defiant quality. Manger. Affirm rejection of the householder's life and being married and. So there's some heat there. So they don't have perfect equanimity yet. But there's a feeling that by golly now I know my own mind. And I know my path now. And this is the new life for me. And they don't mind being blunt and and they're being assertive in their expression of how they're feeling about their old life and now their new life. It's it's and we so often swallow our own thoughts or feelings. So it's refreshing to read it. And the other thing that comes through for me is that maybe there's some cultural differences between us and our time and them and their time. But what really comes through for me is the commonality or the how recognizable their emotions and feelings are. They're really just like us. And the Dharma really is the same from one era to another. So there's my thoughts. Well, beautiful bill. Yeah. One does hope that the what we're touching into shows us that our mind is I mean, the mind operates the same way as it did back then. And just what you said about the women and maybe having a different feeling than the monks phones. Yes. The men and the women came into the homeless life through different doors, in a sense. Sometimes sometimes, you know, men are trapped by gender roles, too. But they're there. I can see why that flavor would come through. Yeah. Yeah. Any other comments from the teachers? Yeah, I would just say that for me, there is a sense for women in that culture, even in today's culture in India is much more oppressed kind of culture. So for them to rise up, you know, rise up from all of the oppressions, identifications, societal repeatedly kind of put on them and takes a tremendous strength and power. And we see that in the poem. I think we'll see this again today as we look into some of the other categories of people who may share some of this. These aspects of their beings also. So for me, it was very powerful to see, wow, the expressions of them rising above all of the oppressions and the injustice, maybe using more than a word for this. So thank you for pointing that out. Thank you. Yeah, I remember that for women, you know, there wasn't support like there is in our culture for a woman to be living independently. That was just not a concept. And it wasn't guaranteed that their alms full would be filled or that they know there was danger of attack and rape and other things by being out of the house. So it was a whole different game for the women who entered the homeless life. Okay, these are wonderful comments and we have more to explore today. So the theme from Saturday was how is awakening expressed in these are awakening poems. What does that mean? And today we'll go on to look a little bit more specifically at how certain teachings and practices were contributing to the awakening of these elder monks and nuns. So, David. Thanks. Thanks, Kim. And thank Bill and Jerry for those early comments, which I dig. They're great leads lead ins to today. Today's topic. And yeah, I'd like to talk for just about 15 minutes about three of the actually four poems by by women. And as as you both sort of pointed to, there's something that comes up in these poems. It's true in the poems of monks, but maybe it's more noticeable here just of the way the engagement with the home life, and particularly, you know, the earthiness or the challenges of daily life, how those can lead into in various ways into practice into the teachings into awakening. And first, I would just like to kind of take a step back and recall the words of Patacara. And I first wanted to show an image of the Patacara the Patacara figure that we have at IMC here pictured at outside at IRC actually, but I think now Patacara resides in the meditation hall at IMC. And, and then just refer back to her verses, if I can find them. With this idea of kind of looking for some recurring themes as we engage the idea of specific teachings and practices that show up in the poems. And our initial idea was to sort of kind of talk about illness, aging and death, as we as I looked into poems that have those as contexts for awakening. It's so much richer than just kind of the three messengers or the like. By the way, I'm going to say things like the three messengers the five aggregates and we don't have time, and this, this isn't really about going into the teachings I think most of you are familiar with the teachings will mention. If not, we take them up in our other study and practice classes, and they're out there and feel free to ask but sort of going to make reference to them with the expectation that most people are have some familiarity with them. I just wanted to remind us of the part of the Patacara poem that came up again in the guided meditation I think or maybe, maybe it's just referred to later. But this idea if we can connect these things together and maybe arguing a little bit against this idea of Jerry's that the poems aren't conceptual, you know, it's an interesting, it's not without concepts that we walk the path it's in some interplay between the conceptual and the non conceptual until at least we're free of of conceptual mind or, or we stop seeing the world conceptually. But you can start to see these that there's that there's direction in the poems. They're not just some of them actually are just stands as that reflect on things but here there's something about watching the water, this aspect of daily life that is very grounded I said Earthie, this is literally earthy washing washing the feet, as you said, you know, as a daily practice, and with mindful attention to inherent or intrinsic aspects of it, the way it, the way water flows from high ground to low ground, it seems to bring the mind to a place of stillness and collectedness. Right, it says with this, the mind becomes still the mind becomes focused. And, and as a result of that, in meditation, it seems to be the implication here, or in a meditative frame of mind. The mind was freed. I want to suggest that in gills translation beautifully done and Gil is very skilled at this. In English there's two ways to read this. We can say, as the flame went out, in other words at the moment that the flame went out. The mind was freed. But we could say that also in the same manner that the flame went out. The mind was freed. I just wanted to point to this is the possibility in the poem that this is also saying that the mind is freed as a candlelight is extinguished. And many of you will know that this is a meaning of the word Nibana, that Nibana has this sense of being extinguished, like a flame goes out. So, here's three poems by women practitioners in each case, women who became who left the home life in and became monastics and led a life of homelessness those are the way we contrast those styles of practice, or that the way they're frequently contrasted in the text and illness old age, death, or the impending or the imminent death come up in them, many times and in some, in some cases in kind of simple ways in the case of Chittah very, very straightforward poem. And I think that, although old and at an advanced stage and with the support leaning on a staff, perhaps the support of the teachings perhaps the support of community of Kali Anamita of spiritual friends, the, the, the mountain is climbed the practices practice the path is is followed. And what I take to be a reference to a way of approaching meditation, letting, leaving, letting go of certain trappings of the life, maybe not eating overturning their bowl propping themselves herself against a rock and meditation. She shatters the Mac massive darkness, a phrase that probably will resonate with the various ways that Diana pointed out that the experience of of awakening is characterized in the poems shattering the massive darkness, Diana later told us maybe she's shared that with everybody maybe just with the group of four of us that it's only used by women in these poems, with one exception, an exception we'll look at on Thursday, but this particular way of characterizing the letting go of the defilements or the freeing of the world to go back to Jerry's point when we look at the world carefully we notice that it's free so much easier to let the world be free than to try to focus so much on freeing ourselves. Anyway, this shattering the mass of darkness is the way to talk characterizes her awakening. I'll read a couple more, a couple longer poems and first I'd like to just read them, and then maybe go back for a little, I hate to use the word analysis but a little bit of unpacking maybe of what's going on, or what can be seen to be going on in these poems. We, by the way, we're, we've decided just to not be too gender bound here obviously I'm speaking about poems by women. If there's somebody here who identifies as male who wants to read these poems that that's fine. Is there a volunteer to read so nice beautiful poem. I'm looking for a hand. I'm looking for a leaning to unmute. I hope you can see this clearly and I'll scroll as you go but okay. Hope you can hear me okay. Yeah. I gave birth to 10 sons in this form, this bag of bones. When I was young, feeble and old. I approached a nun. She taught me the DOMA, the aggregates sense fields and elements. When I heard her teaching. I cut off my hair and went forth. I trained a nun. My clairvoyance was clarified, and I knew my past lives, the places I used to live. I meditate on the sign less my mind unified and serene. I achieve the immediate liberation extinguished by not grasping. The aggregates are fully understood. They remain, but the route is cut. Curse you retitled age. Now, there are no more future lives. That was wonderful. I am so glad, which we attempted to do that because it's it's really nice to hear that in somebody's voice. And I hope the experience of reading it is sweet as well. So, I'm going to switch game plan here and instead of reading the next one, I'm going to, I'm going to switch down, just, excuse me, and look at, look at this one a little bit I've highlighted a few things that pop out to me. Perhaps there's nothing more earthy or more earthbound than, you know, the procreative acts that we engage in that lead to the bearing of children. It's interesting too that she says 10 sons, which in today's birth ratio would be at least nine girls too. So, this is somebody with a lot of childbearing and child rearing experience, we assume possibly sons is just means children in the, in the poly. These are very specific teachings and this gets to part of the theme for the day. As most of you, I think we'll have some understanding, the aggregates are the field in which self emerges, the sense fields is the field of or a way of seeing our reality that makes clear how attachment comes to be or the modes and points of attachment. And the four great elements is a mindfulness of the body practice, which is a particularly powerful way of getting access to understanding aggregates and sense fields. All of these turn up in the four foundations of mindfulness teachings and the Satipatthana Sutta. Bringing mindfulness of the body to attention in these things we come to understand for Sona brings her to the same expression of freedom that the Buddha uses to describe his freedom and Diana pointed to on Saturday. Meditating on the sign list, which we take to be a reference in particular to the arising and passing of all things as a center of attention and the realization or the understanding that nothing can be held on to as a permanent foundation for contentment. And then we see, like Patacara, that the experience of awakening is described as something that we're grasping as extinguished, we could say like a like a flame going out. If we wanted to sort of refer back to Patacara. Here we find that the five aggregates are fully understood and then this is a key part of the five aggregates teaching that as as individuals in the world, we continue to experience the world through, or as a, as a color rising of five aggregates, but we don't cling to them. Right. So, being that liberation as extinguished by not grasping in this particular case means not grasping to the aggregates, but recognizing that the world with which we're familiar, still, still arises. I didn't bold it but it's interesting that curse and I love the way Deborah read it curse you wretched old age was nicely read. Now there are no more future lives it's just an interesting contrast that, you know, this is somebody who is old has had, I'm figuring about 19 children and raised them all. And so somebody may be quite quite aged, but recognizing that there is no, there is nothing there won't be a return of this particular. This, this realm of suffering for for so now. So let's do this one more time. Gosh, you know what I'm running out of time, I'm going to do this fast I'm going to, I'm going to read it myself, meet that colleague in a minute. This is another one that's and we'll send these out to you and you can look through them but having gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness, I wandered here and there jealous of possessions. I'm going to, I'm going to analyze this one as I go the same time. Wandering here and there was a way of characterizing some Sarah, the wandering on, sort of a literal rendering some Sarah. This is somebody who, although they've become a monastic, they're still in the, you know, in an unawakened place, still jealous of possessions and honors which speaks very strongly to self and self in my reading. So somebody neglecting the highest goal pursuing the lowest under the sway of corruptions, not in touch with the goal of the practice. And then they become struck with a sense of urgency, some Vega is a term that some of you may be familiar with and I think will refer to again later today. And the realization I'm walking the wrong path, I'm under the sway of craving, and then, and then, inspired by some sense that life is short. Old age and sickness and death are near that before this body breaks apart. In other words, before I die. There's no time to not practice mindfulness to be fully aware to the extent I can be of the world. Again, apparently in meditation. The Kali examines in line with reality, the rise and fall of the aggregates. I think this is how maybe comes free of this jealousness of possessions and honors and the self. And when she stands up for meditation. She's liberated. Having fulfilled the Buddhist instructions and there again having fulfilled the Buddhist instructions, Diana taught us on Saturday is one way that the awakened experiences characterized in in all of these poems. I bring attention to one final thing before I pass the talking stick, as it were to Diana, just that you see in these and I didn't really underline it as we went, the centrality of the meditation practice in finding a path toward awakening. And then again in the poems, whether it's the hut or mittacali, the, the, the, the clarification of mind the seeing in mittacali case the aggregates for what they are holding self more lightly. Seems to be something that transpires in a in meditation or a meditative frame of mind. Diana. Great. Thank you, David. Thank you. That was lovely. Something that we saw and all these poems that David just shared with us is some of the difficulties that these individuals were having, whether it's old age needing to lean on a staff on a stick meeting some support some feebleness or lots of childbearing and maybe this person had so many children because maybe some of them died. Right. We had an ancient India we can imagine that that might have happened and just terrible heartbreak of this, or having jealousy or craving seeing how much their life was filled with craving so lots of difficulties. And then, as David said we also see in these poems are turning towards something different. So whether it's a meditation practice, or whether it's seeking guidance going to another none to get some instructions, or where there is to put the instructions into specific practice that is that I've got the sense fields and the elements. I know we're throwing these words around some of you will be familiar with them. And even if you don't know the specifics, just like that there are specific teachings that these individuals turn towards. And then of course they're awakening. So in some ways we could see a whole path here, kind of condensed into these beautiful poems. So, now I would like to encourage you and breakout rooms to share what is your understanding of this relationship between difficulties this or suffering, and this turn this pivot towards practice and teachings. This, your understanding of the relationship between having hard times, and maybe that being a fuel towards practice and teachings. And the way that we would like to do this is in groups of four, and we'll do it as in the spiral, where the first person doesn't say everything they know about the topic, but maybe just adds one thing, as if we were making a soup, you add one ingredient. And then the second person, maybe we'll say one sentence or something, add that to the soup, and the third person will add something in the fourth, and then I'll come back around to the first. So in this way, you don't have to prepare everything that you're going to say when the time comes for you. But instead, you can allow yourself to be influenced. And also allow yourself to do listening, and to feel what's happening, as opposed to a, maybe a conventional conversation that we might have. So in some ways, this is completely contrived, but this is an opportunity for us to explore this topic, the relationship between suffering and this turn towards practice and the teachings. So, if we're ready, we can go into the breakout rooms. So welcome back. Here we are. Zoom. Great, great. Welcome back. So now we would just love to hear from you with some comments and aha moments or maybe some new ideas or some reflections on poems, something that you'd like to share about your time in the breakout rooms. And then I'd like to hear some new ideas like, oh, I had some of that before. Aditi. Yeah, someone in our group pointed out that how they also had the struggles, because it was said in the poem or wretched old age. So that felt very relatable. Yes. So, aging right is always this, this, as we age, there's often this sense of, Oh, really, this happening to me. Yeah. Anybody else have a comment or a question. I'm sorry. There was a comment from a loyal and to in the chat box and being presented the poem off the cuff without time to absorb them contribute to a sense of dissatisfaction. Thank you for naming that. I think we are trying different things, but I'm knowing this is helpful for us as well. We're playing with this poems in various ways. I just want to receive that and naming that as well. Thank you. Thank you. And the sense of dissatisfaction is also what the poems are pointing to. Yeah. Alex. Okay. So, whether the last one I think it was the last poem, kind of. I struggled with I didn't find maybe I found difficulty with because she says what she says curse you old age, something about. Now I've achieved alignment or whatever I'm paraphrasing and now I know I won't I won't have experience rebirth. I was wondering like maybe my question is how does she know that and like don't we always like we achieve a kind of an awakening but we still have to continue on going through struggle with it doesn't really end in a sense but I don't know and that's why I'm asking so does any of my co teachers want to respond. So, this idea of awakening and enlightenment in this tradition is a complete awakening is an ending of suffering is the ending of greed hatred and delusion, and also the ending of another rebirth. In our tradition there's a different stages of awakening. And so there's true that there's these some first stages where there's a new understanding about the lack of an inherent self and their lack of emptiness of objects and selves. But there's still some suffering there's still a little bit of greed hatred and delusion, and it can be a long process to go from the first kind of tastes until there's a complete awakening. So, like the Buddha had complete awakening. So these nuns by saying this and ending of rebirth is saying that they had the same type of awakening as the Buddha did. This is one of the homeworks is this knowledge of, oh yes, what needed to be done has been done this recognition. Oh, okay, there's no rebirth there's no more suffering. Exactly how that happens I can't tell you but that is kind of like a homework is there's an awakening experience. And then afterwards is the knowing that things are different now. And then, is that was an okay answer Alex Yeah, it just seems like a really big statement to make, you know, like this, the kind of like that, this real confidence, right, there's this. But we know this that the Buddha did the same. After his awakening he talked about I knew, yes, David you interviewed it. I would just I think one interesting contrast that I didn't bring attention to I think it's in mittacali and I won't bring it up is that it but it must be because she says a very interesting thing she says she went forth out of faith. But then what happens in the course of the poem is that she develops this confirmed confidence in the teaching. So I think there too that's another aspect of an awakening experiences the absolute certainty that Diana just returned what just referred to the knowing that happens with that kind of awakening experience the shedding of attachments or the shedding of craving. So, I've been each and every one of these poems I think there's some feeling of that in them, some progress to this confirmed knowledge that freedom has has taken place. And that to go back to what I think it was Jerry first said that the world is seen free, you know, there isn't the self in it anymore. It's that the world is known as free and understood as free. Nori. Is this knowing that you're talking about related to independence and the Dhamma. Yeah. Yeah. I would say so. But maybe can you have something you'd like to add to that. Well Diana talked about two different stages. One is where there's a seeing through of the self and then there's this more final ending of all suffering, and the independence and the Dhamma is associated with the earlier understanding. When a person sees through a little bit sees her a little bit of the veil and has a clear recognition of where they're headed for the goal then they're said to be independent in the Dhamma but there's still that last bit of work to do that Diana said can take them until there's the full awakening. And I just wanted to comment also that this strong statement of I am completely free is called a lion's roar, and in the teachings so when you hear references to the lion's roar that's what it refers to. So all these poems are lions roars in a sense and we might hear about that again in the next class. Thank you. Thank you Kim and Randy, there'll be our last one. I have a question. In these early teachings early tradition, early statements or, or narrations of what has happened to one. There is seems like there's a fair amount of this recognition of having achieved awakening. And I, and in the modern age, there are people who obviously have become awakened, but they don't pronounce that they don't display their supernatural powers even though they have them. They don't go get act as subjects for research at Harvard, and they just kind of say things like, well, leave my body alone because I'm going to achieve rainbow body, or, or, you know, similar facts like I may seem like a regular person but actually, I'm not. So, I wonder what you think about that it puts to mind to me that the Buddha said that every 500 years, there would be an increase in degeneration and less people achieving awakening. So I'm wondering what you think about that contrast. I don't have myself I have no comment, you know, there's, I don't have a basis on which I can comment on on that I don't know if any of my co teachers do. I wonder what Kim thinks. I think, I think you've opened a large area, and it also has some things mixed in it from later traditions. And so that's what makes it hard to comment. Also, I don't know that I know. I don't know that I know about people who are fully awakened but aren't talking about it I have no basis for knowing that. And not everybody I think who awakens would talk about it it depends on the person's character. Even in the early teachings there are said to be awakened beings who don't teach or talk about it, those are for the Cheka Buddhas. But anyway, so, thank you for the comment. This is certainly an area of a lot of speculation and interest. And maybe what's important is to take that interest in awakening and see for ourselves. How it comes about as we practice. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for your answer. And now we'll turn it over to Ian. Yeah, I just want to appreciate. Well, let me do a sound check. Okay. My, my sound is okay. All right. So, I just want to appreciate the exploration and the comments, the questions. And so we're going to take those words into a meditative form and unhappy and happening to be on the land of a spirit rock. For those of you who know where spirit rock is it's a terra vada meditation retreat center. And so I just want to show you the mountains, rolling mountains of a spirit rock right outside my window, maybe for you to get a little vibe that's going on. Right around me as we go into the meditation. And as I was walking this mountain. So, we will bring ourselves to meditative mode for just about 10 minutes. So if you like to maybe just set a posture that's supportive of a sitting for short a while. I invite you to take some generous moments to establish some connection with the body. Sometimes I'm imagining as if I'm going to see a dear friend. As I go at the door. Maybe take a little while for me to connect with the friend. Just like that, as we sit. It takes a little while for us to connect with our body and our being state of mind. Sometimes a gentle scan from the top of the head to our toes. And help connect, checking and kind of like a very gentle soft. How are you. The shoulders. The legs. The presence of arrival. Rest your attention on your breath. The movements of the breath. The rhythm. The sensations. Maybe you feel the breath moving throughout the body. May also be energetic feel of the breath. Vibration. Pressure at different points. Release of the pressure. As we sit. I'll offer a little experiment. I drop some words from the poems that we read today. Into this meditative field. As you hear the words. See what happens in your lived experience. See the noun. My life is short. Trumpled by old age and sickness. I like this short. Trumpled by old age and sickness. Notice any effects That was near-lived experience There is a deep truth in what Nita Kali spoke Life is short In fact, we don't know when the death may come This breath could be the last one Knowing the truth of old age, sickness and death Some vikka can arise A sense of urgency A sense of a spiritual urgency can arise Nita Kali said Before this body breaks apart There's no time for me to be careless Some vikka can evoke a simultaneous movement of detachment and also alignment with the Dhamma Detaching from endless wandering around here and there Samsara that David pointed out Detaching from the pursuits of possessions and honors Instead we can align with the Dhamma In this poem it says I examine in line with reality The rise and fall of the aggregates We can become aligned with the Dhamma I examine in line with reality The rising and falling of the aggregates I stood up with mind liberated Having fulfilled the Buddha's instruction I spend many hours eating now Thank you Ying. That was very beautiful. So just maybe just picking up the momentum, David and Ying both shared from Mitakali's poem where she realizes that she's been living under this way of craving. And that's our usual way. That's also what conventional society urges us to do, encourages us. We can read any billboard or internet ad and it's mostly about getting more, getting the latest things so that you can impress your neighbors or making more money or having an exotic vacation, these kinds of things. Even if we don't live a consumerist life, we may realize at some point that we are unprepared to handle the onslaught of aging, illness and death. We may realize that the way we've been living hasn't really prepared us for that. And so for Mitakali, this led her to practice what she says is in line with reality and free her mind. It's a very beautiful line. So the Dharma offers us a different way of orienting than our usual way that's encouraged, a way that's not just under this way of craving. So this way of seeing evolves how it evolves through practice. Actually our view begins to shift, our orientation begins to shift as we practice. So it's a little bit, this is the origin of this phrase, against the stream, against the stream of the usual societal preoccupations and more in line with reality. So what practice will do to our mind. So I'm going to share today from a little bit longer poem from an elder monk named Godata. And that was sent to you in advance, but if you didn't read it in advance, that's okay. I'm going to share my screen in a moment. But if you did, you might be familiar. So Godata talks about seeing things differently from a conventional way. And he also talks about the practices that he did or the way he oriented his mind in order to free his mind from the difficulties of the world. One maybe imagined that originally he was quite caught up also like Nita Kali and now he has a different perspective with it. He shares in his poem. So today we're talking about teachings and practices that lead to awakening. David talked a lot about the specific practices that the nuns named in their poems. And I'm going to talk maybe more about the shift of view that we can have. I'm going to put this on the screen. Can you see that? So this is Teragata, great 14.2 Godata. And I'm going to slide it up so that we can see just the text. Okay. So what I'm going to do is go through and kind of highlight the areas that he points out in his poem, areas where he's starting to see things in a different way that leads toward awakening. So right near the beginning, for example, we have this stanza here. Those, so we have to think about the bull, just as a fine well-bred bull yoked to a load, enduring his load, crushed by the heavy burden, doesn't throw down his yoke. Then we have this analogy. Those who are filled with discernment as the ocean with water don't look down on others. This is nobility among beings. Is that how you think about nobility? That's not usually the association with nobility of not looking down on people. So right away, Godata offers us a view, shows us that he has a little bit different view than the conventional idea of what the word nobility means. So then for me, that kind of pricked up my interest. I wanted to know also other things about how he thought. So then he goes on and he talks about our main problem that we have in the world. So elated by causes of pleasure, cast down by causes of pain, fools are destroyed by both, not seeing them for what they are. So we have the issue that we spend a lot of our life in kind of emotional up and down. And life throws us back and forth from things that are pleasing, things that are terrible, things that we like, things that we don't like. And he says that the problem essentially is that we don't see them for what they are. And so we go up and down, up and down. How does he know this? Really his mind was like this, you know, kind of tossed about by life. And so then the poem a little bit farther down, I'm doing this slightly out of order, mentions a common list that there is in Buddhist teachings. So he says not to gain or loss status or the Pali actually says status or honor. But I'm putting in this because we can imply we can see that these pairs. So gain or loss status or dishonor, praise or blame, pleasure or pain. This list is called the eight worldly winds. And these are said to be the concerns of the conventional mind. So the conventional mind spends a lot of time trying to get the four pleasant ones of those and trying not to have the four unpleasant ones. That's like the aim of life is to have gain and status and praise and pleasure and not to have lost dishonor, blame and pain. And that can suck up a whole lot of energy trying to accomplish all of that. So but he points out that this is a problem. You know, this is what pools are destroyed by. These things that are go up and down because they don't see. They don't see them for what they are, which is just the ways of the world. That's just experience. It comes and goes. It arises and passes. We don't have a lot of control over that. So then he talks. Yes, he offers two solutions, if you will, to these one solution is presented in this stanza here. He says those who in the midst of pleasure and pain have gone past the seamstress craving. That's a little reference that we might have time to talk about. But anyway, have gone past craving, stand firm like a boundary pillar. Neither elated nor cast down. So we have this idea of standing firm. That's one solution to not getting thrown about by the world is to stand firm like a boundary pillar. This is something that mindfulness does for us. Is it presented kind of puts a stake in the ground of place where we're standing and we let things come and go in our mindfulness. So that's kind of one way that we can handle these ups and downs of life. And then this stands just after the eight worldly winds presents another idea about that. So here he says everywhere they do not adhere like a water bead on the lotus. Everywhere they're happy, enlightened, everywhere undefeated. So the idea here is not adhering. So I don't know if you've ever seen a lotus leaf, but they're a little waxy kind of like a Teflon pan. And if you put water on it, it just needs up. It doesn't really touch the lotus leaf, doesn't get it wet. And so this is another solution to this life going back and forth is that we could simply not adhere to that. And so one might say, oh, wait a minute, is this a contradiction or a mixed metaphor? We have standing firm and we have not adhering. Those sound different to me. But when I thought about these two ideas that he offers, I think both images are essentially about not getting drawn in, not getting involved. So that's what kind of the quality that unites standing firm and not adhering. So these are qualities that we would associate with equanimity. This is a quality of mind that comes about when we work with the eight worldly winds as we strengthen, eventually equanimity in order to be OK with the comings and goings, the rises and falls of life. So we understand maybe that Godata was pushed and pulled a lot by his emotions and ended up cultivating equanimity through these practices of standing firm and not adhering. So we see also that a person who is engaged in this kind of practice is not going to have the same values and motivations that we see in conventional society. The eight worldly winds are seen through and they no longer provide a motivation. We're not aiming for the four pleasant ones and to get away from the unpleasant ones. Instead, we have a different form of what we're interested in. And that is what comes about in all of these later stances here, which I'm not going to read all of for lack of time. But let's just look at the first one to get an idea of how one does orient. If one doesn't worry and he worldly winds. So let's just look at this. No matter what the unrighteous gain or the righteous loss, righteous loss is better than if there were unrighteous gain. So this word righteous should be understood to be just or wholesome in line with the Dharma, something like that being talked about aligning with the Dharma. So things that are we start to realize that we're not really that interested in pleasure and gain and so forth, but we're interested in wholesomeness. We choose wholesome over pleasant. That's a big change in the mind. This is about gain and loss. So just as a as an example, I was in a situation one time where I was sharing rent, sharing utilities with someone. So I was paying the full utility bill and they were paying me back for the part that they used. And we had an arrangement of this for a certain amount of time. And in the last month that we had this arrangement, we had a disagreement about something else. And they decided that they were not going to pay me back for the utilities that month. And so I thought about that because we did have this agreement. And my approach was that I said to them, well, look, this was our agreement and we're still going to have this different way of seeing things on this other matter. But please go ahead and pay your portion of the utilities if you think that would be an important thing to do. So I made it an ethical choice for them. I just said, this was the arrangement. Please do it if you think that's important. I didn't say right. I think I said important. But I left it up to them as an ethical choice. They never paid me. They didn't step up to that offer. But I felt good about having not gotten angry, not pursued them in small claims court. I just opened the ethical field and I don't mind that loss. And they had little gain by but it was unrighteous. So that was a clear choice. And I sleep well with that choice. So these are the values that one lives with. So we have status of the unaware, lowliness of those who know, we would rather have knowledge, have wisdom and a low status than have a high status but not see clearly and so forth through some of these other qualities. So essentially, we see that there's this kind of different way of living. And the fruit of that is that there ends up being now going to the end here, nothing dear or un-deer. And this is not a statement about no capacity for ethical judgment. It comes through actually a long process of making choices where we really are clear on choosing the wholesome, always the wholesome and not say just the pleasant, just the status, these kinds of things. Not to say that we prefer low status, prefer pain, prefer loss, of course not. Of course not. But those are not worth it if the means of getting there is not wholesome in some way, not righteous. So then finally at the end, having arrived at this equanimity and this clarity about having different values than conventional. Then we get to developing the factors of awakening, the faculties and the strengths. These are again references like David said, we'll make references to teachings and practices that you may know or if you don't, they can be looked up. And the result of that is attaining the foremost peace, awakening. So there's total un-binding which is the translators. This is Tanjev's translation, he uses that for nirvana, for awakening. So it's inspiring I think that we see Godata's path of resolutely choosing against the conventional way of seeing things and resolutely choosing in favor of seeing things in terms of the Dharma. And that steadied his mind with equanimity and allowed his mind to then awaken, become free. Thank you, Kim. Really wonderful. Yet another way to take one of these poems and in this case, kind of show the relationship between maybe a conventional Dharma talk kind of approach and the richness that comes through in these poems. Kim points out implicitly to how the teachings, not just specific teachings kind of one by one, but how they're interrelated, at least in a particular practitioner's experience of finding a path and finding that that path leads to freedom. How they bring together various teachings to create a path toward freedom. So let's pause before we get to the end of today and assign some homework, which we put quotation marks around and we smile when we say it, but sort of talk about maybe how to prepare for Thursday and just see if there are any questions for Kim or that came up during her teaching or any other questions or comments that come up. Raise a hand. Also, we're a small group. Raise a physical hand. I think too, we're a nice little intimate gathering. Feel free to unmute and ask a question if that works. Any questions come up for people? Michael. Yeah, I just wanted to point out that it looks like Diana has a question in the chat. She says, how does something like curse you, wretched or neglect and awakening the end of greed, hatred and delusion? Oh, nice. Thanks, Michael, for bringing that to our attention. Yeah, yeah, that takes us back a step, which is fine. I don't know if other teachers have a thought on that. I did see that in it. That's interesting. I guess I would just say quickly that we make this distinction between the kind of letting go that's possible while we're still embodied and the letting go that happens when the body goes. Above my head here, I have a picture of the Buddhist final nirvana. This is the breaking up of the body and the final letting go of that attachment to the world of bodies. That's what I get in that contrast between wretched old age and yet this certain knowing that this is the last wretched old age. I think that's where there's the awakening in it. It's that contrast, which I think is poetic device. It makes us think, as Diana's question makes clear. Ron, you have your hand up. I should have asked. Do other teachers have a thought on that or is that sufficient anything come up? Ron. Yeah. Thank you. Thank all of you for these wonderful teachings. I had a question going back to the earlier poems from this session. The question has to do with what some of these early nuns were actually craving. When I think of their social situation, it seems to me they were probably living in villages, almost a very meager type of an existence. I don't know that they would be in a situation where, for example, like us, they're not bombarded by advertising for things that they could get. I don't see them as having access to a great deal of material type of temptations. I was wondering, would their craving be more around actually craving for a sense of security in life, craving that perhaps they wouldn't have to suffer in old age being perhaps abandoned or whatever? But the question has to do with just actually what it was that they were craving. It's a rich question. We have only a couple minutes to delve into it before ending the day. I'll say one or two things and then pass it on to other teachers. You go back to the poems that we talked about earlier today, but in Kim's poem, the one she read, the Godata poem, there's a distinction drawn between the things we might want or need like shelter, food, security, and our attachment to those very things and all the other things that we come up with. It's the attachment and the continued craving for more or for different where the suffering arises. I'll just leave it there for a moment, but Diana, Ying, Ying, you've unmuted. Help us out. Sure. I'll just say a few words that it is true that for a lot of these women in the villages and they don't have what we have in a very rich materialized society. That the essential pressure is a source of really arousing craving. I remember, for example, for most of my life back in China, we had no air conditioning. It's got really hot summer and really cold winter. We have no heater. But once we have it, it's like we can never not have it again, but then I reflect, well, I lived 20 years without it. This is really amazing. It's really deep in us, this craving for essential pleasure and things that just make our life slightly more comfortable. Once we have it, it's really hard to let go. I think of the same thing for the ancient days, even when there is not a whole lot of other material things that we've got. But there's still a lot of longing for things that make our lives just eating slightly more comfortable and better. That's definitely one big aspect of it as well. Thank you, Ying. That's such a perfect segue to the homework because when we take a class, we get attached and crave homework. We can't really do a class without it. Don't get too attached, but here's Ying with some homework for Thursday. I said Diana had wanted to say something, I think. Do you want to say something before I give homework? Sorry. I did. I was just thinking that we could maybe weave together from the earlier homes that David did and what Kim was doing. Kim pointed out there's these eight worldly winds. We are craving pleasure, not pain. We are craving fame, not disrepute. We are craving, I don't remember all the words that was in this poem, but we are craving only one half of the spectrum of all of our experiences. So I'll just point that out. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. And so, yeah. Along the same line, I think you touched a really key issue, Ron. I remember reading from a monastic, I know we're right at time, saying that even though they had given up everything and taken robes, they are allowed to own, I don't know, five or six things. And they got really obsessed with their robe and bowl. They had to have the best robe and they're comparing their bowl to all the other bowls. And it's because craving is in the mind. And so whatever we have, whatever level of stuff we have, craving will find its way into that. You have more, you still have craving, doesn't matter, you want even more. So if you have nothing, you have craving in the mind, you will crave those two things that you can own. So this is pointing back to the mind, as always. And these kinds of comments keep opening up these poems. When Kim says that, I just have to say that the first poem we read, the short one, she puts down the robe, she puts down the bowl. So maybe that's about putting down craving, even for those things, that spectrum that Diana referred to. So Ying. Yeah. You know, I feel the craving to get this all sorted out. So that may be the homework to really kind of dipping into this poem. We will be sharing this poem. I love the comment that Diana posted in the chat box, like, you know, how do we understand the statement to curse you, rich old age? And so how do we understand that this comes from a weakened noun, right? And for me, it's a very rich opening exploration to read some of this poem. So I invite you to read it out loud, read it from a perspective of maybe aversive response to this. How might this come out of knowing, deep knowing what this is? And so maybe you can listen to the recordings, some recorded, and maybe you can read out loud and record yourself and listen to it. Reading different ways, different tones. So that's the homework. We will be sharing the poems with a follow on email. And I invite you to really soaking and enjoy. So thank you. Thank you all. And feel free to unmute and take care, everyone. Take care. Thank you. See you on Thursday. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
