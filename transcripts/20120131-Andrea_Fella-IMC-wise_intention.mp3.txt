So for the, having been away for a while, I thought about what to talk about this morning and I think I just decided to continue with the theme that I had been slowly winding, working my way through for the last six months. 
Been talking about the Four Noble Trues and the Eightfold Path and the last few talks I gave were about the first factor of the Eightfold Path, the right view, wise view, wise understanding. 
And so today I thought I'd talk about the second aspect of the Eightfold Path, wise intention. 
So there's a connection between these two, these first two aspects of the Eightfold Path, wise view, wise understanding. 
When we have a kind of a framework of how we understand our world, it leads us to certain intentions about how to act in line with those, with that understanding. 
And this is true with respect to any view that we have. 
You know, our views shape our intentions and our actions, our behavior. 
So, and this often happens in a kind of an unconscious way. 
We're not always aware exactly of what our views are. 
They can kind of be submerged or hidden or unconscious. 
That we've picked up views and ideas and beliefs based on our culture, based on our family history. 
And then we just act out of those without really recognizing that our actions and our intentions are motivated by these views. 
So an example, a simple example. 
One common view in our culture is that happiness comes from an accumulation of status or wealth, or that happiness comes from being able to control our environment to create what we'd like, to create the situation that we'd like. 
So these views, these beliefs will lead to, you know, for the first case, it would result in intentions and behaviors designed to increase status and wealth. 
And the second, it would lead to intentions and behaviors designed to control our environment to create a certain situation. 
And believing that our happiness is dependent upon this. 
So the view that the Buddha proposed is actually quite, you know, it's quite counter to these kind of familiar cultural views that we hold. 
He proposed that actually accumulating things, accumulating status wealth, trying to control things will simply lead us into frustration, dissatisfaction, and, you know, a sense of not being content with what is actually happening, with what's already happening. 
If we, you know, if we manage to control our environment for a while, we feel like, oh, there's happiness there, you know, it kind of confirms itself, that that's the way to go. 
But when we recognize, because we cannot always control our situation, when that, you know, side of reality hits us, we feel, you know, despairing, we feel like we've done something wrong, we feel like we've failed, as opposed to just recognizing, oh, this is the way it is. 
We don't always have control. 
When we manage to accumulate things, you know, we may be happy in that accumulation. 
If we don't manage to accumulate things, the frustration of that is immediately apparent. 
But if we do manage to accumulate wealth or status, the truth, the reality will inevitably invade at some point, that these experiences, these possessions are impermanent, and that we're destined to be separated from them at some point. 
And in that separation, that loss, there is, again, a feeling of, oh, I've done something wrong, or why me? You know, what's wrong with me? As opposed to just recognizing, it's like this. 
This is a reality, things are impermanent. 
So the right view of the Eightfold Path, I've talked about various aspects of right view over the last few times I spoke, but I'm just going to highlight two of them. 
One is the understanding of karma, which is basically a teaching about how our choices, the choices that we make influence our experience, they influence our happiness or unhappiness. 
If we make choices that are skillful, then we tend to move towards happiness. 
If we make choices that are unskillful, we tend to move towards unhappiness. 
And skillful and unskillful here are actually defined in terms of the word that the Buddha uses is dukkha. 
Suffering is the common translation, but it can simply mean dissatisfaction, unease, unsatisfactoriness. 
That the skillful and unskillful, the teaching about skillful and unskillful has to do with what leads us towards the letting go or the release of this dukkha, this unhappiness, this dissatisfaction, and moves us towards this happiness. 
So this unskillful actions tend to lead us towards dissatisfaction and unhappiness. 
Skillful actions tend to lead us towards happiness. 
So in this teaching, really this ethical aspect of the teaching, this is considered kind of the ethical component of the teaching, it's not about what we typically think of as morality, of right, wrong, good, bad. 
It's more about what is helpful, what is supportive for us to be happy. 
And we really misunderstand that. 
As I said, we have these views of what we think will make us happy, and those views typically will run into reality at some point, into truth, and we get a sense of there's something off about those views, only we don't really understand that it's the view itself that is off. 
We think somehow we've made a mistake, we've done something wrong, we've failed in our actions, and that's why we're not happy. 
As opposed to recognizing the view itself that having what I want will make me happy, is not the way to go. 
So there's this understanding of karma, the choices that we make lead us towards happiness or unhappiness. 
And in this, the choices here, I mean, one key point here, and this ties into intention, into right intention, because these choices, we often think about choices as being the actual action that we take. 
So we decide to say something to somebody. 
We take a decision to say something to somebody, and we think of that as the choice, that I'm going to say that to somebody. 
And that is an aspect of the choice, but the aspect of choice that the teachings are pointing to here isn't the actual thing that we decide to do or say, but it's the motivation which impels us to do or say that thing that's important to keep track of. 
So that the same thing could be said to somebody with a motivation of compassion and wishing to help, or it might be said with a motivation of wanting to look good and wanting to be seen as a certain kind of person. 
Both of those may be present also. 
We have mixed motivations, but that's what is being pointed to here, is the motivation behind our choices, looking at why we are taking action. 
And so that's really coming into this realm of right intention, of looking at what our intentions are. 
So the other aspect of right view that's really important that kind of shapes our intentions is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths, the truth of suffering, of dukkha, the truth of the cause of suffering being craving or wanting, the truth that it's possible to end that craving and be released from suffering, and then that there is a path that we can engage with, practices that we can work with that will support our moving towards the ending of suffering. 
So this view of the Eightfold Path is really diametrically opposed to the way we normally think of our happiness as coming to us. 
We normally think of our happiness as coming because we have things or we control things, that we get things or we can control things. 
Those are two main ways that we think of happiness as coming to us. 
The Buddha proposes, the Third Noble Truth is that the freedom from dukkha comes from letting go of wanting. 
It's not about accumulating, it's not about having, it's about letting go. 
So this is a really radical shift in our idea of how happiness can come to us. 
So it really is a shift of perspective, this right view. 
If you have some sense that these aspects, that happiness can come from letting go of wanting rather than of having, rather than happiness coming from having, and that happiness comes based out of making skillful choices, letting go of unskillful choices, then these views can begin to shape our intentions, shape how we choose to act in our lives. 
If we have the understanding of karma, if we have the understanding that the choice that we make, the intentions, the motivations behind our choices, impacts our happiness, we begin to have the intention of behaving from skillful motivations. 
If we want to be happy and we see that it comes from this, we have the intention to behave from skillful motivations, to not engage in actions that would harm others, and to not engage in things that would harm ourselves. 
We begin to have an aspiration to cultivate beautiful qualities of mind, of kindness, of compassion. 
If we have the understanding of the Four Noble Truths, this view around the letting go, that ultimately will lead to happiness. 
Then again, this will lead to intentions around looking at where we're holding onto things, and beginning to see can we let go, can we release. 
And also, as we see how these same truths apply to everybody, we begin to see how they apply to us through looking at this in our experience, and we understand, because we're human beings, that all human beings are subject to these same mistakes, the same mistakes that we make, the same misunderstandings that we have about where our happiness comes from. 
We begin to see that these are not just our mistakes, they are really widespread. 
Everybody makes these mistakes about understanding where happiness comes from. 
And as we see the suffering in our own lives, the dissatisfaction, the unease, the frustration, that results from these mistaken views, and we see that everyone is subject to the same kind of suffering, and if compassion begins to arise, we see that it's heartbreaking to see how misunderstood people are, and the impact that that has on the world, and on the way we treat our fellow human beings. 
So it can really bring a sense of compassion and kindness towards others, and intention towards compassion and kindness. 
So initially, this wisdom of wise view, the understandings, initially we kind of borrow this wisdom, we may hear this reframing of where happiness can be found, and we think, well, I don't know how it's going to work letting go, but certainly, at least in my case, I found that at some point in my life I felt like I hit bottom. 
It's like everything that I had tried to find happiness had failed, and it's like, well, here's this teaching. 
Somebody had sent me a book, and it's like, well, here's a teaching. 
I don't see how this is going to work letting go of what I want. 
I don't see how that's going to work, but I'd really felt like I'd hit bottom, and so it's like, I'm willing to try. 
Somebody's saying, this is possible, this is a direction, and it certainly sounded in the book that I read, which was Everyday Zen by Joe Gobeck, that she was speaking from direct experience. 
So in a sense, I was borrowing her faith, her wisdom, and saying, okay, it seems to have worked for her, maybe I can try this. 
And so we begin that way. 
We begin by borrowing the understanding and applying some of these tools of the Eightfold Path to our lives. 
And we begin to then see for ourselves how it works. 
We begin to recognize we understand how these practices work and how they actually do lead us to more happiness in our lives, that letting go actually does lead to happiness. 
And when we get that sense for ourselves, then there's an even deeper connection with this wisdom and a deeper motivation to act in the ways that will lead us towards happiness, towards a truer kind of happiness. 
So the intentions of right intention are three main aspects to this that the Buddha talked about. 
He talked about the intention towards renunciation, letting go of wanting, letting go of sense desire primarily. 
Here is what he's talking about. 
The intention towards kindness and the intention towards compassion. 
So I'd like to talk about these a little bit. 
But first I'd like to just kind of frame this from the perspective of what the Buddha actually said. 
He said that before he became enlightened he was meditating and he recognized that he could kind of put his thoughts into two categories. 
He said there's thoughts that will lead to affliction and suffering and there's thoughts that will lead to welfare and benefit and happiness. 
So whenever I notice thoughts of sense desire, ill will and cruelty, I recognize that those were not so helpful. 
I put those on one side. 
I recognize thoughts of renunciation, of non-ill will or kindness, of non-cruelty or compassion. 
But those on the other side saw that the thoughts of sense desire, ill will and cruelty led to affliction both of himself and others. 
And the other thoughts, the thoughts of kindness, of compassion and of renunciation, he said he realized I could think thoughts like that all day and all night and no affliction would come to myself or anyone. 
But these thoughts were wholesome. 
So this was his own exploration. 
I'm going to come back to this in a little bit because I find it personally inspiring to reflect on the fact that in the Buddha's own practice he had thoughts of cruelty arising. 
This is helpful for me to remember. 
He was not immune to this. 
So the first, and the first one is kind of a hard one for us to get our minds around sometimes the intention towards renunciation. 
Renunciation I think has kind of a bad rap, that word. 
We don't like that word. 
What it implies to us is that we let it go of things that we want, things that we like. 
You know, that it generally just is not a happy thought for us, this idea of renunciation. 
What he's connecting it with primarily is renouncing sense desire. 
The desire towards having our senses pleased. 
And again, this is not something that makes a lot of sense to us. 
You know, what's wrong with this? Why would this be a problem to please our senses? So first I want to talk a little bit about sense desire. 
You know, it has a strong hold on us. 
And it's really connected to our views about where happiness comes from. 
That we think that sense pleasure, having our senses gratified, is a path to happiness. 
And if we find a way for our senses to be gratified, that that's where happiness comes from. 
And so it makes sense pleasure extremely attractive. 
And the desire to fulfill that sense pleasure feels like the path to happiness. 
So it's really tightly embedded with the way our minds are structured. 
It's not us, it's not even just us in this country, it's really all animals, I think. 
All living beings have this kind of notion built into their biology in a way. 
Because there is a gratification, a happiness that comes from having our senses pleased. 
So we're conditioned to believe that this is the path to happiness. 
And so it's very natural for us to have this sense, this sense desire. 
But in fact we can't really fathom, I mean part of our misunderstanding here is that we can't fathom the possibility for happiness apart from sense pleasure, apart from having our senses gratified. 
Because these two have been linked in our minds for so long. 
And the state of the possibility of happiness apart from having our senses gratified is quite foreign to us if we haven't explored our own minds too much. 
So we just don't see, it's like how do we make this leap? It just doesn't make much sense to us. 
So in terms of renunciation of sense desire, the Buddha actually didn't just say stop desiring. 
He actually was approaching it kind of from an indirect angle. 
He said we need to approach this not from a kind of a harsh method of just saying either trying to stop it or repress the feelings of desire. 
Either one of those approaches doesn't really get at the root of the problem. 
It's just changing our desire to repress desire. 
It shifts the direction of our desire but it's still desire that's operating. 
So because our senses are so deeply ingrained we really can't just say let go of sense desire through an act of will. 
This is not really the approach. 
This kind of thing might lead to a kind of repression. 
If we try to through an act of will say I'm not going to want sense pleasure, it's going to lead to repression which is cultivating a kind of aversion and kind of tends to increase that desire because that desire is motivated out of a very strong belief that this is the direction for our happiness and if that belief is not being acknowledged and it's being repressed it's going to kind of come out even stronger. 
So the Buddha suggested that we need to use wisdom to break the grip that desire has on us. 
We are bound to desire because we see it as the direction for our happiness and so we need to start to understand the fundamental mistake in that view that that's a mistake. 
Bhikkhu Bodhi says in terms of exploring this kind of renunciation he says real renunciation is not a matter of compelling ourselves to give up things still inwardly cherished but of changing our perspective on them so that they no longer bind us. 
When we understand the nature of desire, desire falls away by itself without the need for struggle. 
So this points to understanding, as he says, when we understand the nature of desire it begins to fall away. 
Now this is not something that happens like, you know, oh, you hear somebody talk about desire and immediately it stops. 
It's much more of a gradual kind of exploration that we go through. 
So I'm going to talk a little bit about this exploration that we make. 
So as I said a little earlier, the hold that desire on us is intimately connected to our view, our belief that satisfying those desires is the way to happiness. 
Out of this view, believing this view, we act in ways that continue to reinforce this cycle. 
You know, we get what we want and we have a desire for some kind of sense gratification and we get what we want and we experience some happiness. 
Now that confirms to us that getting what we want is the path to happiness. 
It feels good. 
It confirms to us that this is the right way to go. 
We don't then kind of recognize that over time that, you know, if we've gotten what we want, you know, either our own minds kind of get bored with that, you know, and kind of it falls to the wayside. 
It's like, oh, yeah, that thing, oh, that was great, you know, oh, where's the next thing, you know. 
What else can I find that'll make me feel good, you know, wanting to find something to want so that we can get it so that we can have that hit of happiness again? So we have that kind of inclination towards getting what we want so that we get that hit of happiness. 
So we, you know, as I said earlier, if we get what we want, we have that happiness, but we, you know, we don't really see that it's just reinforcing this wanting, actually. 
It's reinforcing this pattern of wanting and that that, you know, that thing that we get, the gratification, the pleasure that we get from getting what we want, we don't think of looking at, really, how long does that last? How happy does it really make us to have that piece of chocolate? How happy does it really make us to have the car that we want? You know, maybe that makes us really happy for a couple of months. 
But then, you know, my dear friend of mine got a beautiful new car, and within a couple of weeks of getting it, got into an accident that totaled the car. 
You know, how long does a happiness last? It's kind of up to circumstance. 
So the view of the Four Noble Truths counters this understanding about how desire works and suggests that we change our perspective to look at the desire itself. 
When we actually start from that perspective, we look at the desire for what's going on. 
We don't usually think about doing this, actually. 
You know, we're more focused on the getting the thing and thinking about how happy we're going to be when we get the thing. 
So that's kind of overshadowing this whole experience of wanting itself. 
We actually take a look at this wanting. 
We actually look at the experience of wanting itself. 
We find that it immediately, as soon as wanting springs up, it produces a feeling of dissatisfaction, of lack, that something is a little off and needs to be changed. 
The feeling of wanting itself has a kind of unpleasantness, dissatisfactoriness to it. 
So the wanting itself is already connected with this dukkha, this suffering. 
We observe this process. 
We observe the wanting itself. 
Notice the kind of dissatisfaction of the wanting itself. 
We observe the process of either getting what we want or not getting what we want and see the kind of patterns that unfold around this, the getting what we want and then the kind of idea, oh, this is going to make me happy for a certain length of time and then, whew, maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. 
We don't get what we want. 
We see immediately the suffering of that. 
When we observe this process with mindfulness, and this is what the Buddha recommends, look at this exploration, make an exploration of what wanting is. 
The mind itself, through this process of observing wanting, begins to understand the drawbacks of wanting. 
And it starts to slowly let go of that wanting. 
If you watch, if you even take a very small desire, like craving for a certain kind of food or craving to watch television at a certain time or something, or to go to the internet and look something up, feel that wanting. 
Feel the dissatisfaction of that wanting. 
If you don't act on that desire, wanting itself is the same as any other experience. 
It is impermanent. 
It will go away. 
And then you get to watch and see what happens as wanting disappears. 
When the wanting disappears, that feeling of dissatisfaction disappears. 
It actually feels like being released from a vice grip. 
It's quite an amazing experience to recognize that happiness of the letting go of the wanting. 
It's a different kind of happiness than of having what we want. 
So this is a big topic, this topic of exploring desire. 
And I thought I'd talk about this more next week so that I can move on to the other aspects of wise intention. 
So the next aspect of wise intention is the intention to good will, of kindness. 
Or the intention of non-ill will, actually. 
It's based in the negative here in the Buddhist teaching. 
This is a wholesome intention, the intention towards non-ill will. 
So what is ill will? It's kind of the flavors of aversive states of mind. 
Anger, hatred, rage, aversion, contempt. 
That kind of emotion has the quality of ill will. 
Milder flavors might be irritation, displeasure, annoyance, that kind of thing. 
So our usual response to ill will, if we're not aware, not mindful of it, is to perhaps feel justified in it. 
That's a big one for me. 
It's like, oh yeah, I'm right. 
I know this person shouldn't have done that thing. 
They're wrong and I'm right. 
So that kind of justification is one aspect. 
We believe it. 
We give into it. 
It's like indulging that ill will. 
Or another kind of flavor that often we react to around ill will is that we're kind of horrified at our ill will. 
And we think, oh, this is bad. 
What's wrong? We need to stuff it. 
We got to stop feeling this thing. 
We recognize it as being something that's off in a way. 
And our response to that offness is to say bad feeling. 
So what's the pathway between these two of either kind of saying yes to the thing or bad thing? Or to recommend mindfulness. 
That we can have kind of an indirect approach here is to not repress the feeling, but also to not act on it. 
To be aware of it. 
To be mindful of it. 
Notice the feelings, particularly associated with thoughts of ill will. 
The bodily broiling that comes. 
The heat, the pressure, the tension that comes with this feeling of ill will. 
Notice also any reactions that we have to it. 
Self-judgment, self-criticism, or self-righteousness. 
What is the flavor of our reaction to this ill will? So this is one way to explore ill will. 
I spent one retreat where there was a lot of aversion and anger coming up at a particular person. 
And any time that person came into my mind, it would take off so fast. 
I thought about this person who was like a volcano exploding that this anger would arise. 
And so I really got to observe this. 
This was a two-week retreat, I think. 
I really got to watch this process of anger. 
And it happened very quickly, usually. 
So often I was right in the state of anger almost before I even recognized it. 
And then it's just a process of, okay, this is what anger feels like. 
This is what this state is. 
But over the course of the retreat, my mind got quite settled. 
And I began to see the thoughts in the mind that would trigger the ill will. 
And so I could see the thoughts before the ill will was quite there. 
And then I could begin to see the very first few split seconds of ill will coming up. 
And the first few split seconds of that emotion, mostly when it was fully blown, it had the sense of pressure and heat. 
It was like, brrr. 
The very first few seconds of that emotion arising were warmth and fullness. 
And it was pleasant. 
It was actually shocked. 
But what it showed me was, like, that's the hook. 
That was the hook for that emotion. 
It's like those split seconds of pleasure in that sense of. 
. 
. 
There was a little bit of that sense of self-justification before it went nuts. 
So we can really learn a lot by observing our anger. 
And as we observe it without acting on it, it begins to. 
. 
. 
The mind begins to understand this classic teaching of the Buddha that with anger, what anger is, it's an attempt to pick up a hot coal to throw at somebody to hurt them. 
We really kind of have this view or this idea that our anger, in directing anger outward, we have this view that it's going to make the other person miserable. 
That's kind of part of the aim. 
And actually, that's something I saw in looking at my anger, is that part of the aim of that anger was to make the other person miserable. 
And that was going to make me happy, to make the other person miserable. 
So if we see this process, the mind itself begins to learn, it's like picking up that hot coal, you burn yourself first. 
The feeling of anger itself has a burning quality to it. 
So the mindfulness is a way to approach the exploration of ill-will. 
Another approach is using reflection, cultivating a reflection of, what are the drawbacks of ill-will? This is one of the things that the Buddha did in his own exploration. 
He said, what I did when I noticed thoughts of ill-will coming up, and again, the Buddha is saying, I noticed thoughts of ill-will coming up, what I did was to reflect on the drawbacks. 
These thoughts lead to my harm, my suffering, these thoughts lead to the suffering and the affliction of others. 
That's not the direction I wish to go. 
So can I release, can I let go of them? So that's another approach, it's kind of conscious reflection of the drawbacks. 
And then there's a way, so the cultivation of the intention towards non-ill-will can come about through being mindful of ill-will, not acting on it, not repressing it. 
It can come about through this reflecting on the drawbacks of ill-will. 
And it can also come about through more consciously cultivating the quality of kindness itself. 
Cultivating the quality of the metta is the polyterm for kindness, for loving kindness. 
And there's a practice, a meditative practice that can support this cultivation of kindness. 
And it's a thought practice, it's actually a practice of using thought. 
We bring up thoughts in our mind of kindness towards ourselves, towards others. 
And the Buddha recommended this as an antidote towards ill-will. 
You notice yourself thinking thoughts of ill-will towards yourself or others. 
Can you replace those thoughts with thoughts of kindness? And simple thoughts of kindness, you know, may you be at ease. 
May you be healthy, may you be happy. 
May I be healthy, may I be happy. 
So this is cultivating the wholesome quality kind of more directly. 
There's a lot that I can say about metta as well, and perhaps I'll do that in another week as well. 
I think that deserves a good discussion. 
And the third kind of intention is the intention towards harmlessness, towards compassion. 
So this tends to oppose cruel thoughts, violent thoughts, aggressive thoughts. 
The intention towards the wish that another be harmed. 
Now this kind of intention, you know, it can be kind of startling and almost shocking to recognize this in our own minds. 
You know, to really see that, you know, part of our intention in our behavior towards others is wish that they be harmed. 
You know, we don't think of ourselves that way. 
We don't tend to think of ourselves that way. 
My own experience of this, you know, one person I was extremely angry with for several years. 
As I was exploring, you know, my rage, my anger, at one point I saw, you know, as I said a little while ago, how that, you know, intention of anger is kind of directed to making the other person miserable. 
And in that exploration, what I really saw is, you know, at some level of my mind, there was a wish that that person be harmed. 
You know, be miserable, get, you know, in an accident or something, there was, that wish was there. 
And it was when I, when the mindfulness got clear enough to actually see that and to acknowledge it, it was kind of shocking. 
And that moment of seeing that and recognizing that, it was kind of like seeing, you know, the seeds. 
And what came to my mind was it's kind of seeing that wish for harm of somebody who had been a dear friend, you know, that I wished at some level that they be harmed. 
I saw that kind of multiply by six billion. 
And saw that that's where war comes from, you know, that that seed for war is really, it's in all of us. 
You know, we think of ourselves perhaps as not, you know, oh, I wouldn't be in that situation or I wouldn't do that. 
But what I saw in that moment was, you know, I am not, you know, taking this kind of action because of the kind of circumstance I'm in. 
If I were in Afghanistan, if I'd grown up in Afghanistan, you know, it's hard to say. 
What direction my life would have taken, you know, that these seeds of cruelty actually are in each of us. 
And so not to, you know, repress this or, you know, it can be quite distressing to see this. 
But again, you know, the practice here is not about repressing, but it's about recognizing not acting on and not repressing this middle way to just being with that experience. 
You know, for me, that moment of seeing that opened to, you know, it was kind of humbling. 
And it also opened to the recognition of compassion for the fact that this pattern of wishing that others be harmed is not just myself alone, that it is kind of human-wide and results in so much suffering. 
So that seeing, you know, it showed me the possibility in my own mind of that direction, but also opened me to the compassion. 
So this is the, you know, this is how seeing these thoughts can open us to this intention towards non-harming, this intention towards compassion. 
So again, the Buddha recommended contemplating the drawbacks of these thoughts, you know, that these thoughts, if acted on, will lead to suffering, to affliction of ourselves and others. 
And we can also cultivate compassion in a formal way, kind of like the way we cultivate metta. 
The cultivation of metta moves along by wishing kindness, wishing well, you know, connecting with the kind of general wish for happiness that all beings have. 
The cultivation of compassion moves by connecting with suffering, recognizing the suffering of another person and opening our heart to that pain. 
When an open heart can meet suffering, the response, the natural response is compassion. 
And the wish is, may you be free from that suffering. 
So that's the kind of thought that we use to incline our minds towards compassion, bringing someone to mind and recollecting some suffering they may be experiencing and wishing, may you be free from that suffering. 
So the Buddha, in this teaching that I'm talking about, about seeing these two kinds of thoughts, you know, these two aspects of thought, you know, these kind that lead towards suffering and towards happiness, he said, whatever one frequently thinks and ponders upon, that becomes the inclination of the mind. 
If one frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of sense desire, one abandons thoughts of renunciation to cultivate thoughts of sense desire. 
If one frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of ill-will, one abandons thoughts of non-ill-will to cultivate thoughts of ill-will. 
If one frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of cruelty, one abandons thoughts of non-cruelty to cultivate thoughts of cruelty. 
So, we have some choice here that mindfulness itself is a way to, in a sense of not acting on the thought externally, but also internally. 
Mindfulness itself is a way to open to that experience that results from thoughts of ill-will, of cruelty, of sense-desire. 
But kind of internally, neither acting on nor repressing in our minds. 
Mindfulness kind of allows something to follow its natural course, which is impermanent. 
A thought of cruelty is impermanent, it will arise and pass away. 
A thought of ill-will is impermanent, it will arise and pass away. 
When we observe with mindfulness these experiences, we just see their nature with these thoughts. 
We see the nature of these thoughts as being impermanent. 
We understand how they're connected with dukkha. 
So the mindfulness is a pathway towards this abandoning of these thoughts. 
So turning our thoughts in the direction of renunciation, kindness, and compassion begins to put ourselves into alignment with the truth, with freedom from suffering. 
I'll finish with saying something from Bhikkhu Bodhi again. 
In this investigation around these intentions, he says, our concern must not be with what is pleasant, but with what is true. 
We have to be prepared and willing to discover what is true, even at the cost of our comfort. 
Our real security lies on the side of truth, not on the side of comfort. 
So we have a couple of minutes if there's any thoughts or comments that anyone has. 
Yeah. 
Your talk this morning seems closely connected to a lovely little book I found recently entitled When the Chocolate Runs Out. 
The author is Lama Yeshe, and it is, I found, I'm finding, a wonderful meditation guide. 
That's beautiful, thank you. 
This was a really, really useful talk, so thank you. 
I'm really stuck with a friend who I'm really angry with. 
She goes in and out of these passive aggressive phases with me and what she's been doing recently, and I had a moment yesterday where I could feel myself letting go and seeing a different view of things, but then it disappeared, and I can't remember what it is. 
Something along the line of like, oh, I'm just not even seeing things in the right way here at all. 
So I guess from what you're saying, I need to just continue to be mindful of not take action or repress, but continue to be mindful until I actually have a better sense of what to do. 
That's a really good approach, especially if you're committed to this kind of a path. 
Understand your own anger about things. 
Now anger, we don't always just simply with anger say, oh, anger, I'm not going to take any action. 
Sometimes anger indicates we do need to take some action, but to be sure that we're being wise about it, that we're not acting out of the anger, but acting out of understanding, acting out of compassion rather than frustration. 
So that observing for yourself until you're more clear about where the lines are because there is probably compassion in there, in the mix. 
I found that often with these emotions, there's unwholesome and wholesome motivations both tied together. 
And we so quickly will act out of the unwholesome motivation that we don't really get a chance to connect with the wholesome side. 
So an exploration of that, really begin to understand that. 
And you can also at the same time do some meta both for yourself and for her, just, okay, so may I be happy or compassion if that's more in line with what's going on. 
May I be free from the suffering of this anger. 
And may she be free of the suffering that's resulting in her actions. 
So to include that in your exploration as well can also allow the heart to relax a little bit. 
And I think, yeah, it's time to stop. 
I talked for longer than I thought I would, so I'll talk next week I think a little bit more about Sun's desire.
