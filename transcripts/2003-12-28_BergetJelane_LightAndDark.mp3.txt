 This is the season of light and dark, the time of the solstice. We just celebrated the solstice last Sunday, the shortest day of the year, the most dark of the year. And this seems a very important turning point. Many of us have sort of gone back to celebrating earth-based kinds of things, and the solstice is one of those. The light and the dark have great meaning, and I have several little things that hopefully I can read to you in the next little bit. Talking about the light and the dark, and if nothing else, I hope it causes you to think about it. What is the meaning of the light and the dark? What is the meaning of the two of them together? It seems that so often we tend to pose the dark as negative, the unwanted, or the so-called negative emotions or experiences, and the light as the positive. And when we do that, then often what we bring is aversion to the dark, and perhaps greed or clinging to the light. So probably many of you, as I did to some extent, sort of on the solstice, breathe a sigh of relief. So a friend said to me, now the days are getting longer. Not that it's noticeable, but there's that sense, you know, that's the most dark we will have to experience. Now we can begin to experience the light. This might be particularly true in California, where we're all so accustomed and so fond of the sun and the light. But as I say, if we pose those two as positive, negative, if we bring judgment to it, then we may miss some of the lessons, particularly the lessons of the darkness. The darkness actually has much to offer us. It can be a time of quiet. Some people actually do enjoy and prefer the darkness. They feel it as a time of going inward. They image coziness and warmth and embracing the dark. But many of us don't. So what I would like to propose is that we begin to hold the two in a more equal manner. That instead of seeing one as any better than the other, that we see them as two parts, two halves of the whole, like the image of the yin and the yang, where there's no sense that one is any better than the other. And in fact, each has a little of the other in it. And this is said several ways. The light shines in the darkness and the darkness grasps it not. This is from the Gospel of John. Darkness within darkness, the gate to all mystery. That's from Lao Tzu. So the darkness shall be the light from Elliot. And Maister Eckhart said, truly it is in the darkness that one finds the light. So when we are in sorrow, then this light is nearest to all of us. And from China Galant, who wrote the book Longing for Darkness, Tara and the Black Madonna. Speaking of the mystery of the heart of the solstice. There is a redeeming darkness. The darkness of ancient wisdom. Of people of color. Of space. Of the womb. Of the earth. Of the unknown. Of sorrow. Of the imagination. The darkness of death. Of the human heart. Of the unconscious. Of the darkness beyond light. Of matter. Of the descent. Of the body. Of the shadow. Of the most high. And this from Mae Sartan, a well known poet. Help us to be the always hopeful gardeners of the spirit. Who know that without darkness nothing comes to birth. As without light nothing flowers. And this is a commentary. The winter landscape can appear cold and bleak. Yet beneath it lies the seed that with sunlight will become a rose. In darkness is fertile power. The mystery. The great unknown. In light is the clarity and vision that come from having the courage to embrace the dark. So darkness can be seen as the source of all life. The great mystery out of which all manifestation is born. So when we talk about accepting the darkness as part of the whole and not judging it. We don't want to deny in any way. The experience or the qualities of darkness. For many of us darkness does bring fear. It may represent despair. Loneliness. Anger. Unhappiness. And we don't want to deny that and pretend that the darkness is light or that it's all so called wonderful. But what we do want to do is hold that even the experience of despair or loneliness or anger or whatever we might consider the dark. To hold that as equal in importance to the so called positive experiences. Knowing that we learn from those. We learn from the so called dark experiences and they are not to be pushed away. When we judge one as better than the other then we do get into aversion. We do get into resisting. Wanting to push away. Wanting to struggle or if not wanting to struggling against that. And that creates tension. That creates unpleasantness in our bodies and in the world. And it's that struggle. It's that resistance. It's that tension and tightness that we want to let go of. That that isn't useful. That creates disharmony. Creates enemies. Sets up a separateness. A dualism. A we they. And that's what we want to avoid. I think about social action. And how often people with very very good intentions meaning well. Unknowingly set up enemies. Pose enemies. In working for something positive set the opposite as an enemy. And can create more unpleasantness. More tension and struggle than is necessary or than is useful. And so it's not. Accepting the dark. As well as the light. Is not does not mean inaction. Or is not a. Giving up. Nor is it a condoning. It's not saying oh this is OK this is fine yeah fine I accept that. That's not what it's about. But it is about holding both in an equanimous way. And not setting up the dualism. Yesterday it was such a beautiful day and I knew I want to prepare for this morning but I also want to be outside. So I took my dog and we went to the park. And when you have a dog as those of you that do know that's always an invitation for conversation. So of course I ran into two other people with dogs both of whom I know and I had my chair and you know my papers and so they each asked me what I was doing. And I said I was preparing a talk for this morning so they want to know what the talk was about. And I told them it was about the light and the dark and acceptance and one person in particular. Stood and talked with me for quite some time and she she was really pondering this acceptance she was pretty skeptical you know she said well I don't know I think it's a fine line or I think it's semantics. She said how to know what to accept and what to change or what to work on. And so I tried to explain from our perspective that it wasn't a matter of accepting or changing that it was a matter of accepting and then doing whatever needed to be done. And that was that was difficult for her to get. She was very open and listened but went away you know still kind of uncertain. I think as Tara Brock has written about it is a radical acceptance to accept the so called dark to accept the so called negative to accept injustice. To accept things that we think should not be is a very radical notion and meets with much skepticism. I'll read just one section one little piece from her book. This is talking about our so called negative emotions. First of all it's not our anger it is not our pain. Everyone lives with anger with fear with grief. Our depression fear and anger are entrusted to us. I like that. That really changes the whole sense of it doesn't it. And can be dedicated to our awakening when we carry our pain with the kindness of acceptance instead of the bitterness of resistance. Our hearts become an edgeless sea of compassion. So it's not about denying in any way or pretending there isn't despair or anger or whatever. But it's about accepting that. And in that acceptance there's a radical a radical shift a radical change. Maybe some of you have experienced that in your own lives. It can be accepting another person accepting a situation. And when you get to that point and often you know it's it's not a one time thing or it's not sudden but it's a process we work at accepting and letting go letting go and accepting. For me sometimes it's a very long process. And I need patience and understanding in that process. But when I get to that point of acceptance just acceptance not condoning not giving up either but just acceptance. There's a shift. There's a relaxing and there's literally a shift in my perspective in my attitude. So it then changes whatever that situation is. And often the situation or the person literally changes because my acceptance allows something else to happen. So this process of accepting and letting go and letting go and accepting. It's a difficult one I think for the ego because the ego at least mine has certainly thought I knew how things should be. You didn't. I did. And that set up this duality this separateness which I ultimately came to realize was painful. I didn't like that feeling of being separate. And so the ego had to give up knowing how things should be. And that's never easy. I don't think. And I can't say that I'm totally there but I'm a lot further on the path than I was even a year ago. I'm a lot more willing to accept that I don't know. I don't know how things should be. I don't know how I should be. I don't know how the world should be. I know that I want to practice kindness and generosity and compassion. But I don't always know how things should be. I think for me anyway to accept that I don't know. Also meant building a lot of trust. A lot of trust in myself in life that things would unfold and that I could trust their unfolding. That turka has taken is taking continues to take a long time to develop and it comes out of experiencing that things do unfold and things do work. And often I see in life they work much better than I ever would have created them if I had been in charge. But I see that I came from a position of not trusting and a feeling that sort of the world was out to get me that I had to be careful. You know I had to do it right or I was going to get in trouble or things that happened were punishment because I hadn't done it right or I hadn't seen clearly or whatever. And I've seen how that pops up over and over and over again. Sort of this negative sense of how the world operates. And that has largely shifted although it still comes up once in a while. So now I have much more the sense much more the feeling that you know the world isn't about punishment. It isn't out to get me. It isn't out to to respond to every little mistake I make or every little trip up. It really is there to support me to it wants the best for me and you not any different for me than for you. The world the universe wants the best. I had a most wonderful experience the other night I think it was Wednesday night Christmas Eve of literally feeling myself held by the universe was very subtle but I just had this feeling I knew I was held by the universe and it was so delicious. You know what a difference that switch makes that I can trust that whatever happens whatever happens it's not about punishment. It's not about me being bad or me getting in trouble or something. It can be for my awakening as Tara Brock says it can be for my learning. So you know I have car trouble and I don't get to do what I was planning to do which has happened several times. It works out you know happened on New Year's Eve about three years ago I think I couldn't think of a worse time you know I was tired. It was late of course twelve thirty or one o'clock something like that. I couldn't believe it was happening and you know what it turned out to be not only not a negative experience it was very pleasant. The tow truck driver was extremely nice and I had cookies left over from our New Year's Eve time which I shared with him and he ended up taking me home and and it was I mean you know it was late and sure I would have preferred it didn't happen but it did and hopefully he learned something and I learned something. And so I don't I don't hold those experiences in such a negative way anymore. Mostly sometimes I do I get caught but then I can let go a little faster. So when I talk about acceptance I talk about I'm thinking about accepting myself ourselves as we are as well as the world. And I didn't used to do that of course I used to think that life was all about changing myself you know seeing my faults and then changing them. And I did a lot of work and I changed a lot and now I hold that very differently. I don't want to change so much. Now what I want to do is use the qualities that I have you know whatever they are whether I see them as positive or negative but use them in a beneficial way. Sometimes I think my struggle my pain if I share it is very useful for other people. So that's not that's not so negative. Sometimes I find the things about myself that maybe I think should be a little different really can be put to use really can be a value in the world. And so instead of changing so much anymore I'm accepting I'm seeing that it's a total picture. It's all of me and all of us are a mixture of qualities right. We all have as again as Tara said we all have anger we all have fear we all have pain we all have moments of joy. We all have generosity and kindness and loving and they are in different proportions right there in different proportions within ourselves at different times they're in different proportions for each one of us. But they all are a part of the whole of each one of us and how much more enjoyable how much more fun life is when I accept myself all of me and when I accept you all of you then I truly can experience and enjoy the differences. Look how look at the variety look at the different packages we all come in and that becomes exciting and fun rather than you know this is not okay and that's terrible. Oh that's wonderful but that is not so good. Then I learned then each one of you is a gift to me is a blessing and what a different way to look at people what a different way to look at the world. So then I think about accepting the world as it is and what does that mean accepting life just as it is one writer Eckhart Tolle who wrote the power of now says you know to do anything else is crazy if you're going to fight against what is you're going to lose. So anything other than acceptance doesn't make any sense. It's like banging our heads against the wall. Right. We're going to lose. So the power of radical acceptance of accepting things just as they are which in itself begins to alleviate some of the suffering when when we don't accept when we rail against things we create more suffering in ourselves. And in the world and I think of the Dalai Lama as such a wonderful example of accepting things in the world just as they are and through that radical acceptance you know he doesn't it doesn't mean inaction doesn't mean giving up and it certainly doesn't mean that he condones what's happening. But he he's very active. He works tirelessly. He travels he talks he educates for his people for to educate the world about the suffering the plight of the Tibetan people and yet he does not pose an enemy. He never talks about the Chinese in terms of an enemy or in ill will. He talks about my friends the Chinese and he recognizes that you know the Chinese and the Tibetans are inextricably intertwined as all of us are and that a solution to the problem has to be what's good for both. Both the Tibetans and the Chinese and how can they work together and how can they work it out. And he's a man of great love right and great acceptance great equanimity. And yet he works tirelessly for his people to preserve the culture and the religion of his people which has been so destroyed so decimated. So another saying this is a picture of a very fierce deity and the quote is from Carl Jung. Most of you have probably heard of a very well known psychologist to confront a person with his own shadow is to show him his love. And then about acceptance this is a poem from roomy that I'm sure most if not all of you have heard but it's very meaningful and fits I think very well with this acceptance it's called the guest house. This being human is a guest house every morning a new arrival a joy a depression a meanness some monetary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor welcome and entertain them all. Even if there are a crowd of sorrows who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture still treat each guest honorably he may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought the shame the malice meet them at the door laughing and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes because each has been sent as a guide from beyond. It reminds me of the Buddha on the night of his awakening when Mara visited him and rather than pushing him away saying go away Mara I don't want you. He didn't exactly invite him in but he did say Mara I see you. He acknowledged him and in that sense welcomed him. What a radical acceptance if we could welcome the unpleasant the difficult the challenging the dark so called welcome that whatever feeling as a gift as a lesson as an opening. As contributing to our awakening again not that we have to go seeking it and we all know plenty of darkness comes without seeking it right but when it comes except it. It can teach us we can learn from it and in that sense it has light so that the darkness has the light within it and the light has the darkness within it. Probably you've all experienced as I have that within any tragedy or darkness or negativity we see light we see we can see some positive some hope some not so dark and likewise within any light any so called pleasant or wonderful experience. We can sense the dark we can sense the shadow we can sense that there's more to this than just light and that's why I think the the symbol for the yin and the yang the light in the dark that's almost like a dancing and each has a part of the other within it. It's so meaningful for accepting both and holding them with equanimity I think that word equanimity is so important because that doesn't mean as I've said either condoning or pushing away just holding it as what is holding it with equanimity. So we have about 10 minutes. I'd love to hear some comments from you sharing questions. I'm going to try to get out of the way and people are going and yelling out the window. And somehow I just sort of shrugged my shoulders and I had to drive it and just do a little bit even though it was kind of terrifying in a way. But I'm very honored that as soon as I decided to just ride the wave the whole texture of the whole thing changed. Before we showed up they were really kind and wonderful. I just put flames around my car so that it showed up to us if I was okay. I took off from it and it was really odd to just frenzy anxiety and frustration and fear. But it was just sort of deciding what I could just use when I heard rather than my own ordinary set of reactions which were in the whole. And it's amazing how that changes. Yes. Yes, exactly. Thank you. Yeah, that's a beautiful example. I wonder about situations where you know that a person or a group of people is pushing you and is punishing you and trying to hurt you. And how can you come to an acceptance of that as opposed to making the decision that no, this is not okay. Yes, and sometimes those decisions, setting those limits or whatever is very important. Accepting something does not mean, oh yeah, that's okay, go ahead, push me around, you know, hurt me or whatever. That's not what it's about. But it is about not having aversion. So that, and that may seem very difficult in a situation where you're being pushed or harmed or something is happening that is not okay. But it is possible to meet that without aversion, to accept that, okay, this is what's happening. Now, what am I going to do? And when we're in aversion, then, you know, we may be angry, we may be pushing back, we may use very unskillful means to deal with it. We create tension in ourselves, unhappiness, disharmony, etc. And we pose an enemy. And it ends up being this struggle. And often, feeling very justified, you know, in certain situations we may go to court and, you know, the whole thing and we're feeling very self-righteous about the whole thing. But it's very unpleasant for everybody. And a judgment might be rendered, but, you know, nobody's happy about it. A different way is to accept with equanimity that this is what's happening, sort of like the Dalai Lama, but without posing an enemy, without making the people that are harming you bad or wrong or terrible, at the same time setting whatever limit you need to set. And, you know, this may take some struggle, some lot of thought and working with it on your part to find out exactly what that is. Sort of like the Dalai Lama, who, of course, to be as equanimous as he is, has not only is reincarnated, but has studied and practiced all his life. To get to that point of holding terrible, terrible sufferings, harm to his people without posing an enemy, without making those harming the Tibetans his enemy. Does that? I have a comment from I was just going to say, is thought sometimes, are you saying it's not to take it personally? Well, sometimes that's very helpful, yes. I mean, I don't know, I'm just trying to remember. Sometimes that's very helpful not to take things so personally. That as Tara says, we're all entrusted with these feelings, these things happen. And very often, if something is being done to us, it really is more about that other person than it is us. It affects us, of course, and in that way can feel very personal. But it's so often not really about us, it's about the other person. It might be about their fear, their greed, their despair, whatever. And we end up being the recipients, but it is not so much about us. So yeah, not taking it so personally can be very helpful. It's also sometimes very difficult. When it's happening to you, it's very difficult not to take it personally. A couple of things. One is, in this practice of no preference, it's like there's another part of the brain that does the no preference. But you can step back from it. So it's not the engaged part of the brain that's feeling the pain and the suffering, but it's the judgmental part, I think. It's the judgmental part that does the, that you can soften and have this acceptance. I found in practicing this that it's also good to practice it on the light side instead of just the dark side. So whenever something good happens, it's to say, oh, that's what that joyful thing feels like. And it helps in being able to train the mind to do the same thing for an adversity, something that happens. Yes, yes. That is a very important part that I didn't mention. But that's right. It's just as important to hold the joy or the positive with equanimity as it is the dark. Yes. I'm on the line, sort of a different side of it, but I just got back from a sleep addiction. And my sister was trying to teach me how to go down by her. And she said, you have to go down this, this deepest part and face down. It'll be much easier if you face down, which is called the ball. And every impulse in your body is saying, don't go sideways, go sideways. But then sometimes I would, I would face down. And it was amazing. It was sort of a totally different experience. And that was one of those things where it's kind of like, you have to, you face this deepness and face the hard part. And then it becomes, I guess, easier in a way. Yes. I think the children have arrived. Anything else? Let's sit for just one moment. Will you ring the bell, Kim? Thank you.
