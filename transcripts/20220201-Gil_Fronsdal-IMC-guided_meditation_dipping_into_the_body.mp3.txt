 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone. And today, this week, we're very much here to experience our body. At least that's what the instructions for this section of the Discourse on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, what this section is about. And one of the things we're contending with as we bring mindfulness to the body is a tendency of thinking to take us away from the body. And I've found it helpful sometimes to think about thinking, to consider thinking, my thoughts to be a little bit like thought bubbles in a cartoon in the comics floating above the head. And the reason I find that sometimes useful is sometimes it's very clear that when I notice that I'm thinking or have been involved in thinking, that I'm not really connected to my body very much. There's not any sense of embodied presence, embodied attention. And that when I then settle into my body, it's a richer, certainly more embodied experience of myself. But also it becomes more three-dimensional. Whereas thinking by itself is one-dimensional or two-dimensional. It's kind of flat, even though what we think about might be exciting and emotionally evocative and all kinds of things. There's some way in which the embodied life feels richer, more valuable. And so this first foundation of mindfulness has to do with becoming embodied. So when we're sitting today, you might study a little bit the difference for you between being preoccupied in thoughts. When you notice you are that way, notice what its quality of the mind, the body, the quality of your experiences when you are so involved in your thinking that you're not connected to your body. But then when you switch modes and come into your body through the breathing and settling, what's that like? How's that different? The image I like to use for myself in those kind of times when I get preoccupied in thoughts is that now I'm going to dip back into my body like I would dip myself into a refreshing pool of water. Or a warm pool of water if it's cold winter weather right now. So dipping myself into a wonderful pool of water. And as I'm just kind of settling myself into the water of the body, and that image of settling in to water is very nice for me. It helps me kind of settle in to my body a little bit more. So taking a meditation posture, and taking a little bit of time with the posture, knowing that mindfulness of posture is one of the practices of mindfulness. Mindfulness begins as we attend to our posture. Perhaps making a many small adjustments just to get aligned and get everything just right. Closing the eyes. And noticing the degree to which you're involved in thinking. Is there a lot of energy in your thinking right now? And if there is, feel that energy. Feel the activation that's connected to thinking. Feel that activation physically. What does it feel like in your body? Is there tension or pressure? Is there agitation, physical agitations on part of your body that's connected to thinking? And then as you breathe, maybe breathing a little bit more deeply than usual, breathe into the place that's activated. Breathe into the place where thinking predominates. And as you exhale, relax the thinking mind. As you exhale, calm the mind. Maybe slowing your thinking down a little bit. Or lowering the volume. If you think more in images, maybe you can imagine the images are further away from you, projected into space at a distance, so you're not so involved. And then taking a few longer, deeper breaths on the exhale, settle into your body as you exhale. Exhale and relax into the body. Breathing in and breathing out. Establishing yourself in the physical sensations of breathing. And maybe the ways in which they are the sensations are come and go with a rhythm of breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out.
