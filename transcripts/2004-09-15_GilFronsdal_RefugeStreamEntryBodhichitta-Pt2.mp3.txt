 We're going to do an exercise now and this is where it might seem a little bit more challenging for what we're about to do and I invite you to relax into the challenge and let that challenge surprise you with what might happen. In some ways what I'm going to ask you to do is not so surprising because if you're doing mindfulness practice, I've been doing it for a long time. One of the things that Buddhist practitioners have confidence in, part of the heart of what we have confidence in, is the immediacy of direct experience. This thing called the dharma that moves through us, that is us as intelligence or this patterning or the lawfulness of life, is something that moves in the immediacy of daily life, of daily experience and our direct experience, what's happening right now. So Buddhists have confidence in, not only in the immediacy of life, but more importantly I think in the value of being present, simply present for life as it lived immediately in the present moment, how it's experienced. Then there's a learning and learning how to get out of the way so we can just be here for the direct experience unmediated by our stories, our interpretations, our signing of meaning to it, unmediated by our tendency to wander off and protect ourselves and be defensive, unmediated by memories of the past or thoughts about the future, just right now what's happening right now, just that. That's where the dharma, that's where the dharma, its heart really resides in the immediacy of our life as it's experiencing, as it's being experienced. So I would like you to have an experience of this, where you explore this world of the immediate experience and do it in a way that you sustain your attention over time, to see what happens when you've maintained and sustained your attention in the present moment as it's unfolding, as it's living. What is, what do you experience directly when you're there to experience your direct experience? What do you experience? What are all the different dimensions and aspects of your present moment experience? What is it that you, when you hear a sound, is it there's a sound that you hear? That's very simple, you hear a sound and there's that which hears. The directness, the immediacy of that maybe what hears a sound that registers or becomes it. There's the immediacy of the sensations of the body, like we talked about earlier, the body itself is an organ of perception or awareness and so we can feel the immediacy of that. What's that like? What is it, what is it like? Both the experience itself and what it's like to experience it that way. So you don't have to remember these questions. The instructions is for you to find a partner here. So there's two of you and then one of you will start and then the other one will get a turn and for 15 minutes, actually a little bit, a little bit less than 15 minutes, I'll ring a bell so you don't have to keep track of time. I want one of you to do a monologue out loud of what you're experiencing in the present moment and it's exactly the same as the mindfulness practice that you do except you're less likely to get lost and also you're saying out loud, you're being witnessed in doing that and the person who's listening just listens. You don't ask questions or encourage them or say anything. You can just listen attentively, respectfully and kind of be present in a very direct way. You're there to really be the witness for them as the other person is speaking and talking this and then I'll ring the bell and then you can just say thank you and then you can maybe breathe for a minute or two and then the second person can do the same thing. Just have that opportunity and then we'll see what happens next. So why don't you see, I don't know if we're odd or even number but why don't we find someone, it doesn't really matter who, find someone and because they're not talking back to you and also you're welcome to spread around a little bit, take some chairs and sit in the outer hall or sit out in the porch so we're not all kind of so loud and here. The next thing is also to form dyads. It could be the same person or it could be another person. It might be nice to do something different and one person is speaking and the person who's listening is going to ask a question and they're going to ask a question repeatedly and the question you're going to ask is tell me a way that you get in the way of your direct experience. Tell me a way that you get in the way of your direct experience. So tell me a way that you get in the way that you interrupt or stop or get distant from your direct experience and the person who's going to speak then will say whatever comes to mind and when the person is finished it might be just one sentence, it might carry on for a while explaining something and when the person is finished then the person asking the question you should say thank you and then take a moment and then ask the question again afresh. Just like you're asking for the first time. Tell me a way that you get in the way of your direct experience and we'll do this for 10 minutes. So one person will talk, will just be answering this question for 10 minutes on and on and on and you'll see probably have all kinds of answers have already come to your mind and you'll say those right away because you were prepared. But after a while you can't you run out of your prepared or your easy answers and you can surprise yourself see what comes out when you just kind of keep asking that question, you're keeping asked that question exploring it and anything that comes to mind that seems true, true enough, you can just say and is that clear? So yes please. I think it's nice to do a different person but if for some reason if you want to do the same person again it's okay with me but I think my preference would be just fresh with someone else. So I'll ring a bell in about 10 minutes. Just to do one more exercise like this but I want to check in with you first before I kind of go along. It might be a lot, it might be already too much to have done this much kind of that kind of exploration and maybe doing one more is too much or maybe you're ready to go one more level with this. What do you think? What's next? Oh I'm not gonna tell you. Are you guys up for one more round? It'd be the same way, I have 20 minutes. It's like a game show. I'll bet it all. You're on yeah that's what you expected to do. So what? Lower than my, okay can you hear okay? So with the same person, now the person asks the same thing with asking a question, same question over and over again. And when the person finishes responding whether it's one sentence or whether it's a long monologue doesn't matter but when the person's finished just say thank you for having said that and then freshly asked the question again. And the question is what are you directly present for right now? What are you present for right now? So if I just do the same partner and the two of you maybe can confidence in the Buddha Dharma and the Sangha to have very strong confidence to have that as an orientation or as a protection, as a refuge, as a offering a sense of direction in one's life. Together with a fourth element which is called virtue to start having a virtuous life those four have those four together. It said it inclines the heart towards liberation, towards the deathless, towards peace. And the example that's given is that if you have a tree that's growing with a strong east blowing wind and it grows kind of you know I guess it's blowing from the east I think I'm confused right now but it's blowing from the west it's blowing east. So the tree is leaning towards the growing growing up leaning towards the east. If you come along and chop at the base of that tree when it falls it'll fall towards the east because that's how it's inclined towards leaning. So when there's strong confidence in the Buddha Dharma and the Sangha and a commitment to living a virtuous life or life of integrity that that makes its heart is leaning in the direction of nirvana. And one of the images that's used for kind of switching images in a sense but with the same idea is the image or the metaphor of a stream that once we put ourselves in a stream that's strong enough that stream will carry us downstream. That's the nature of the stream we get put in the stream we get carried downstream and there's different meanings of what that stream is or different kinds of streams in our lives. But one of the very significant streams is a stream of what we experience in the present moment. When we're really present there's a stream of what comes into the knowing into awareness into recognition into you know that fills our presence. And as was said there's a kaleidoscope there's a huge realm of what can you can be aware of in the present moment and in a sense in any given moment we're aware of a slice of that perhaps or just one aspect of it. And part of Dharma practice is to trust something but the wisdom or the intelligence of the slice that happens to come to you, happens to come in any given moment. And so you're entering into this stream of the sense of slices of you know little segments of what's all available here and that there's something very powerful and transformative can happen when you meander, the stream is meander right, when you meander in the stream of the present moment as it unfolds and you're really being present and honest, direct, this is what's happening now, this is what's happening now. And if you do that all kinds of things will come in. There might be a lot of external things but sooner or later you'll be aware of your subjective world as well. And then at some point you'll become aware of how the subjective world and objective world are in relationship to each other and all kinds of things will come up to be clarified, be digested, to be worked through or to be you know to, but we don't have to be in charge of that, we don't have to kind of choose what to look for, we don't have to be working on anything in particular. We can just trust the stream, the flow of what arises in the present moment when we're really there in the immediacy of the present. Is this clear enough? So entering the stream of this present moment. So I'd like to stop for lunch now and I'd like to give you an exercise for lunch. And I don't expect you can do a very good job at this because it's lunchtime. But if you could carry these two questions with you into lunch and just let them kind of move through you and reflect on them, think about them any kind of way you want, that would be great. So the first question, I'm clear in my mind what it is, the first question is, in what ways do you mistrust staying in the stream of your present, immediate moment experience? To what way do you somehow mistrust that you know that it's okay just to be there and stay there in what's unfolding in the present moment in and of itself? The second question, maybe you want to divide lunch into half, you know half of each question, I'm not going to do it, is for you to reflect on, think about, intuit, feel your way into what it might be like for you if you could really thoroughly, completely trust the stream of present moment experience as it unfolds, as it moves through. So we'll stop for lunch and we'll take an hour for lunch. Wait a minute, an hour. We're running half an hour late, according to this tight schedule. We could just, and there's nothing interesting the present moment requires us to take a whole hour for lunch, but you might need, you might feel like you really want to have some space to go for a walk and have lunch. Should we do an hour until two o'clock or should we do 15 minutes and come back at 10 to two? Any objections? 45 minutes? 50 to 15. Any objections? It's okay people? So I have to, so we have those two questions for lunch. I recommend that during this lunch time, you maintain silence, do silent lunch. If you really feel like you want to talk to someone and they want to talk to you, then kind of do it as a walk, kind of a little further away so we keep this general area kind of a quiet place. I recommend that you eat lighter than you maybe otherwise would have, less food than you normally would have eaten for lunch. You can always snack later on or we stop at 3.30 so you can, you know, eat all you want then. I mean eat enough to sustain yourself and get through the afternoon, but err on the side of eating kind of lighter. And then if you can, if it feels right to you, I mean take care of yourself during this lunch time. So I don't know what that'll look like, maybe it's laying down, I don't know what it means for you, but I have a little idea that going out for a walk, walking around the block and getting some energy that way is a really good thing. So you have to decide that for yourself.
