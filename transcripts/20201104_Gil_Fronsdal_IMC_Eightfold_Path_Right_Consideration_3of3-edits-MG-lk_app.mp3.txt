So my friends,  it's the task to continue  with the Eightfold  
Path.  And the topic  is quite  topical  for our times.  The 
first two factors  of the Eightfold  Path are usually  
considered  to be wisdom  factors.  Some  people  
translate  the word  paññā  as discernment.  The ability  to 
discern,  to see clearly  what's  going  on here.  And with 
wisdom  comes  action.   
 
The second  part of the Eightfold  Path is called  sīla, 
usually  translated  to English  as ethics  or as virtue.  But 
the word  sīla literally  means  conduct.  It is usually  
understood  in this context  to mean  virtuous  conduct.  
Wisdom,  the first two factors  of the Eightfold  Path,   
 
    prepare  us for conduct  – how we act, the actions  we 
have  in the world.   
 
There  are three  kinds  of actions  that Buddhism  
emphasizes:  the actions  of the body,  of speech,  and of 
the mind.  The wisdom  factors  encourage  us, maybe  in 
small  baby -steps  at first, to begin  taking  responsibility  to 
avoid  actions  that are unwholesome,  unhealthy.  And to 
choose  those  that are healthy.  Not to force  ourselves,  
not to overlay  something  on top of ourselves,  not to 
pretend  exactly,  or to live under  heavy  obligation.   
 
We always  begin  with ourselves.  And the world  begins  
with us. It begins  by us looking  at what  is here for us. 
And really getting  to know  what's  here,  before  we act. 
Or to say it differently,  “To be mindful  is the first act.” 
 
Maybe  we can allow  the world  to begin  with each  act of 
mindfulness.  This simple  knowing,  recognizing  what's  
here.  And of course,  there's  going  to be all kinds  of 
things  that we do which  are unwholesome,  unhelpful,  
caught  up in anger,  hostility,  greed,  or delusion.  Of 
course.  As the mindfulness  gets strong,  we learn  to see 
that clearly  – without  shame,  without  conflict.  Seeing  in 
a certain  kind of way, allowing  it to be there.  Just sitting  
in inner  awareness.   
 
And then in seeing  clearly,  having  the wherewithal  to 
say, "No, I don't  have  to get involved  with that. That has  
 
    arisen.  I've had those  thoughts.  I don't  have  to invest  in 
them,  or believe  in them, or go along  with them."  And 
that can be done  peacefully.  It can be done  without  
conflict,  without  hostility,  without  shame.  Just,  “No.” And 
we choose  what's  wholesome.   
 
Maybe  we can take some  reflections,  some  
consideration  to discover  what's  wholesome . And to 
discover  it in a way that has integrity.  Not to do it 
because  it's a policy  that we should  do it. That's  why 
this phenomenal  benefit  of meditating  is to discover  a 
way of being  where  there's  response -ability,  but without  
the burden  of responsibili ty, without  a sense  of 
obligation.  Because  where  the Eightfold  Path is going,  
or what  it's really  about,  as the goal,  or as the 
beginning,  is freedom.  The heart's  release  from all its 
suffering,  all its constriction.   
 
So as I've been  saying,  there  are two versions  of the 
Eightfold  Path.  The version  that takes  us to freedom,  
and the version  that arises  from our freedom.  On the 
way to freedom,  we learn  to pay attention  to all these  
different  factors.  The first factor  is to really  appreciate  
deeply  that our actions  have  consequences.   
 
As we begin  to discover  freedom,  then that's  where  we 
really  begin  to have  more  and more  freedom  in 
choosing  how to create  our world.  How the world  flows  
out of us. And we can choose  that which  is wholesome.   
 
    But sometimes  it takes some  consideration.  And some  
kind of reflection,  some  kind of discernment  about  what  
is it that's  helpful  here,  what's  wholesome,  what's  good.  
This is the second  factor  of the Eightfold  Path,  the 
consideration  that in whatever  we do, we have  these  
consi derations,  these  concerns,  as part of figuring  out 
what  to do.  
 
One is to avoid  addiction  to sensual  pleasure,  to being  
caught  in the grip of that. To avoid  ill will. And to avoid  
cruelty.  This might  be translated  as avoiding  
harmfulness,  doing  harmful  things.  And then to do the 
skillful  and wholesome  things.  That's  right 
consideration,  appropriate  consideration.   
 
So to renounce  the addiction  to sensual  pleasures,  and 
to avoid  ill will, and to avoid  cruelty.  But there  are also 
positive  sides  to this. I think of the renunciation  of 
sensual  pleasure  as a life of blessed  simplicity.  Where  
there's  this beautiful  quality  of simplicity  of being  that 
doesn't  need  sensual  pleasure  for satisfaction,  for 
happiness,  for joy, for a sense  of being  alive and 
connected.  There's  a deep  sense  of blessed  simplicity,  
which  is a phenomenal  wealth.   
 
The positive  side of non-ill will is kindness,  care,  and 
mettā . To act with kindness,  friendliness  – that is skillful  
and wholesome.   
  
 
    The idea of non-harm  or non-cruelty  encompasses  the 
world  of compassion  and care that we have.  To really  
care for the world.  On the way to freedom,  we 
understand  that this kind of care for the world,  with 
kindness,  friendliness,  or compassion  – this really  sets 
up the conditions  for freedom.  It sets up the conditions  
for growth  in the Dharma.  It really  nourishes  us and 
supports  us. And it's meant  to nourish  the world.   
 
Not to be sensu ally involved  with addictions  to sex, 
which  creates  so much  suffering  in our society.  Not to 
be caught  up in addiction  to alcohol,  which  causes  so 
much  widespread  suffering  in families,  often  for 
generations.   
 
To care for our society  is to avoid  sensual  addictions.  
To care for our society  is to be kind and friendly.  To 
care for our society  is to be compassionate.  This right 
consideration  is integrally  connected  to the actions  we 
set in motion  in the world.   
 
The second  set of factors  in the Eightfold  Path has to 
do with action.  And right consideration  sets the stage  
for the quality  of those  actions.  We're  giving  
consideration  to what  we want  to infuse  our actions  
with. What  do we want  to flower  and flow from our 
actions?  What  do we want  the fruit of our actions  to be? 
And the consequences  of our actions  in the world  make  
a world  of difference  if we avoid  the unwholesome  and  
 
    we do the wholesome,  especially  in our social  actions.  
Kindness,  friendliness,  loving  kindn ess, compassion,  
care,  to really  care for others.   
 
I love the word  ‘care’  because  of its dual meanings.  It 
means  to have  kind regard,  concern  about  something,  
to appreciate  something,  I care for something,  I 
appreciate  it, I value  it. And the other  meanin g is to tend 
to, to fix, to repair,  to heal,  to do something  supportive  
for something.  I care for my family,  and therefore  I care 
for them.  I do things  for them.  I care for this world.   
 
And so the question  for you is, “What  is it for you: 
something  wonder ful, blessed  simplicity,  blessed  
friendliness  and kindness,  blessed  compassion  and 
care?  How is it? How can it arise  out of your freedom,  
your tenderness,  a place  of being  non-conflictive?  
Really,  when  you settle  deeply.”  Maybe  answer  that 
question  coming  out of something  like meditation,  or a 
walk in nature,  or a time when  you really  feel like you're  
at home,  at peace  and centered.  How is it that these  
beautiful  qualities  flow from our inner  non-conflict,  our 
inner  peace,  our freedom?   
 
If you have  some  sense that this is possible,  then even  
when  you don't  feel your freedom,  maybe  you can 
discover  a quality  of freedom  in acting  with kindness  
and friendliness.  In acting  in compassion  and care.  In 
acting  in being  simple.    
 
     
To consider  and act and be this way, can also be a 
discovery  of freedom.  It's important  then we don't  do it 
as an obligation,  forcing  ourselves,  and gritting  our 
teeth.  But what  do we have  to let go of? What  do we 
have  to release?  How do we open  up in a genuine  way 
so that we can have  blesse d simplicity,  friendliness  
towards  all people,  and have  compassion  and care for 
everyone  in this world?   
 
How can we be free from looking  at the wider  world  
around  us and expecting  it to be different?  To expect  
the wider  world  to behave  well. The wider  world 
provides  its own answer  to the ills of our society.  Why 
give that authority  away?  Of course  we can wish and 
work  for a better  world.  But let the world  begin  with you.  
 
Let your goodness  – let what  you most  strongly  believe  
is the best and nourishing  and wholesome  parts  of who 
you are – act in ways  that nourish  and bring  forth the 
best in other  people  as well. And out into the world.  Let 
your goodness,  your freedom,  your wholesomeness  be 
the beginning,  every  day, for a better  world  that spreads  
from you. Right  consideration,  the second  factor  of the 
Eightfold  Path,  is to think  deeply  and considerately  
about  what  is wholesome  and unwholesome,  so that we 
act in ways  that are beneficial.   
  
 
    This brings  us to the next step of the Eightfold  Path.  
The next three  all have  to do with what  we do. Right  
consideration  is setting  the foundation.  The next three  
factors  all have  to do with action,  and how our actions  
affect  the world  around  us. This path of Dharma  is 
intimately  integrally  connected  to making  a better  world. 
To being  in the world  in a particular  way.  
 
That's  why at the end of the meditation  I said,  
somewhat  as a challenge  – or heuristically  for a 
particular  teaching  point  – that meditation  is the 
preparation  for the practice.  And the practice  begins  as 
we leave  our meditation  and are out in the world.   
 
May you take very good  care of yourself  today  and in 
this week  in all kinds  of ways.   
 
And if you have  this practice,  you will find your way. It 
might  take a while,  but you will find your way. Thank  
you.
