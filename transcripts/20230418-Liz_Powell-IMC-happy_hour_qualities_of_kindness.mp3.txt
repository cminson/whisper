The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So this evening I thought I might share a little bit of the origins that
inspired me to undertake META practice. When I started to sit with Gil
Franzdahl at IMC in the Insight Meditation Center 19 years ago, early on I
read a copy of his book, The Issue at Hand, which contains essays on
Buddhist mindfulness practice. Just curious, how many people here know about
that book, The Issue at Hand? Some folks, yeah. And I'll give you a way to find it
later this evening. It's a great resource for any of us, especially it gave
me a good initial grounding in these practices we do and how we do them just
in the whole scope of practice of Buddhist practice. And in including META
practice, on the final pages of the book, Gil offers a translation of the META
Sutta that I've always found particularly inspiring. In fact, I memorized it soon
after I read it for the first time and for years I would mentally recite it to
myself every morning. So I'd like to read it to you tonight to begin our time
together. To reach the state of peace, one skilled in the good should be capable
and upright, straightforward and easy to talk to, excuse me, easy to speak to,
gentle and not proud, contented and easily supported, living lightly and with few
duties, wise and with senses calmed, not arrogant and without greed for
supporters, and should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize. One
should reflect, may all be happy and secure, may all living beings be happy at
heart, all living beings, whether weak or strong, tall, large, medium or short,
tiny or big, seen or unseen, near or distant, born or to be born, may they all
be happy, let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere, let no one
through anger or aversion wish for others to suffer. As a mother would risk her
own life to protect her child, her only child, so toward all beings should one
cultivate a boundless heart. With loving-kindness for the whole world should
one cultivate a boundless heart, above, below and all around, without obstruction,
without hate and without ill will, standing or walking, sitting or lying
down, whenever one is awake, may one stay with this recollection. This is called
sublime abiding here and now, one who is virtuous and dowed with vision, not
taken by views, and having overcome all greed for sensual pleasure, will not be
reborn again. So that's Gil's translation of the metasuta and I actually
recommend memorizing it. What I've been noticing about memorization is that it
tends to keep all of the facets of some practice that you'd like to learn or
some passage really close to your mind and heart and it also provides an
opportunity to just reflect on some of the phrases and what they might mean to
you. So it's so beneficial to take time to reflect on each of these phrases in
this sutta from the start. They can serve as a guide to behaviors in the world
that are in themselves kindness to ourselves and kindness to others. So I
thought tonight we might reflect just on the first four lines of the sutta and
then do our meditation. These first four lines are pointing to how our behavior
in relationships might support peace. So the sutta begins to reach the state of
peace. One skilled in the good should be capable and upright. So this is already
interesting. It points out several things will be more peaceful if we are
inclined to becoming skilled in the good. So I puzzled for a while over what the
phrase the good might mean and for me it invites me to ask what is good? What's
good for me? What's good for other people? And in addition the good seems to point
towards ethical behavior. Clean, clean speech, clean behavior, kind, clear ways
of interacting with other people. And then the passage goes on to mention
capable and upright. So someone who's capable can be trusted to take on a task
or interested with the care of someone or something that we find important. So
that's interesting, capable. Someone who's upright is likely to be, I think
this what this is saying is, someone who's honest, someone who's ethical. We
can trust this person. So what could be more kind? So just pausing right there to
consider these initial words, they're introducing us to some essential ways in
which we can cultivate kindness to ourselves and to one another. So in
addition to this practice of saying phrases of kindness, of inclining our
minds towards others and towards ourselves with kind intentions and the
other practices that have been emphasized lately, you know, Bruni was
talking about sympathetic joy or mudita, extending some appreciative happiness
for another's good fortune. Of course, Nikki's been emphasizing compassion this
week, extending compassion to others. So these ways that we cultivate these
traits, in addition to saying these phrases that incline our hearts in that
direction, I'm just pondering all the ways, all the many ways that we can
cultivate peace and cultivate good, the good of humanity, good speech, good
actions that help this along. And what it does is it these qualities help others
feel more comfortable in relationship with us and the more comfortable our
relationships are with other people, the less we have haunting our minds, you know,
so we don't have as much to struggle with or suffer over. This first phrase,
this first set of phrases, this whole idea of being trustworthy and honest, I
can't think of anything more deeply kind and a way that helps others relax
around us and know that we're safe for them or trustworthy. So with that, I
thought we might start our meditation this evening, just, you know, just a few
seeds from this metasuta that we can begin our metameditation with this
evening. So finding how you'd like to settle in to the meditation, allowing
yourself to recognize how you are right now and find the posture and the level
of alertness that is most supportive for you, whether you're sitting or lying
down or standing for this meditation. A comfortable posture but also one that
keeps you alert enough to engage fully. Taking your time, sometimes the events of
the day or the events of the last few minutes have an impact on the body, the
heart and the mind. Allowing that and allowing yourself to recognize the
intention with which you are participating this evening. The things
that bring you to practice during happy hour, the aspirations.
Taking in receiving with kind attention. The body, this body,
as it sits here this evening. How your body can trust you to take care of it, to
do what's needed. The heart, the feelings. What feelings are present? Receiving them
whether they're pleasant or unpleasant, or feel neither pleasant or unpleasant.
Extending your care towards the emotional state you find yourself in.
And allowing with kind attention any thinking, any state of mind that's here.
States of mind might include a little bit of fogginess or distractedness or
could be quite clear, quite settled. What's important here is recognizing what
is being received in awareness with kindness. Conditions before this moment
led to states of mind that are present in this moment. There's no good or bad, no
right or wrong things to be aware of, simply receiving with awareness.
Perhaps noticing what is the good, what is good for you, what is needed for
things to be supportive and good for you.
Allowing that recognition of what is good to be very simple. Being aware of what's
happening may be part of the good. Just whatever bubbles up spontaneously, no
need to be thinking too much about this right now. Just noticing what is good
and supportive for you in this moment.
Perhaps sending a kind wish or inclination of mind may any well-being
that's present continue. May freedom from harm increase and be available.
May some ease be available.
May happiness be a support for this practice.
Continuing to wish for well-being, for freedom from harm, safety, happiness and
ease as supportive conditions towards the good.
May you be well.
May you be safe and free from harm.
May you be happy.
May you be at ease.
Perhaps allowing some images coming to mind of areas in your life where you
can be trusted by others, where you are safe for them or supportive for them,
ways in which you are capable and provide that to other people, whether they're
close to you or they are strangers, ways in which you are ethical, honest for the
people in your life, upright and the ways in which you support others with your
honesty, with your ethical conduct and how that is a form of kindness to them
and to yourself. Whatever fits in this category, it could be something seemingly
small but very important. Every small act of honesty and trustworthiness is part
of what creates support or other support for yourself, allowing that to fill your
heart and mind, and if the opposite comes up,
something that might be troubling you. Again, it could be large or small. Allow
yourself to receive that with kindness. Just notice. Be aware and send yourself
kind wishes. May I be trustworthy for myself and for others.
May I provide appropriate support where it's needed. Above all, may I be kind to
myself and to others in these delicate areas of trust and ethics.
Continuing to send kind wishes to yourself in those areas where you'd
like to be trustworthy or you are trustworthy, where you are ethical or
you'd like to be even more ethical and supportive of those around you and of
yourself. Sending kind wishes to yourself for that.
Next, perhaps, if it works for you, turning your attention towards someone,
anyone who might have been a role model for you in your life. Someone who you
saw as being skilled in what was good, what was trustworthy, what was ethical,
could be someone you know well, could be someone you don't know well, but you've
always seen them to be a good example of kindness through goodness, through good
heartedness, through trustworthiness, through supportive action on behalf of
themselves and others. Allowing this person to fill your mind, see them in
images or words and extending kind wishes for their well-being. May you be
well and your goodness continue.
May you be safe and free from harm.
May others be ethical towards you as you are ethical towards them.
May you be happy. May you enjoy the benefits of the trust and the support
you've given in this world.
May you be at ease. May you enjoy the peace that's been cultivated by your
good actions.
As we continue in silence with this meditation, continuing to send kind
wishes to yourself and to this wonderful example of another person for whom you
wish continued well-being, continued safety, happiness and ease and peace using
your own phrases or some of the ones I've suggested, then repeating them softly
as a whisper in the mind.

So it may be very worthwhile to spend some time this week reflecting on all the
ways that kindness manifests. What are some of the forms of kindness that you
especially value in other people and ways that you'd like to cultivate them in
yourselves? And I'll read those first four lines again. To reach the state of
peace, one skilled in the good should be capable and upright. So there are just a
few qualities there of that may relate to the kindness that we're trying to
cultivate with meta-practice. And what we'll do next is a form of kindness and
that and also a form of allowing yourself to be inspired or to have
availability of more ideas about this. So we will have small breakout groups of
three people each and in that group you might discuss how you you know what
kinds of things came up for you around this and allow yourself to discover by
listening to the other people. What kind of things you might not have thought of
or what what types of people came up for them, what inspirations came up and as
you listen it's very valuable for each person to just put one idea
into the circle at a time and to not offer advice or try to educate one
another or do any crosstalk but rather sincerely listen to the other people
when they're putting their one thing in and then to keep private what is said
in these groups. So we'll do this for about ten minutes and then I'll bring
it back and we'll have some time in the larger circle. So enjoy your time!
