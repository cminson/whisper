 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So formally, hello and good evening, everyone. It's good to see you. Good to be back. I missed you on Friday last week, so for this evening, or whatever your time zone might be for this moment in time, I'm just thinking it's given that in the United States right now is the week of Thanksgiving holiday, which of course has its historical complications, as we know, and acknowledge. And with the theme of giving thanks, let's bring in the theme of giving thanks, as it is a beautiful practice. It's a beautiful practice in Buddhism. It's a beautiful practice in so many traditions, so many traditions to give thanks, to be grateful, to have a grateful heart, to land into appreciating the goodness, all the gifts that we receive as human beings in this life that often we don't acknowledge. Often we focus on what is lacking, what is missing, what we don't have, what is not going right. And instead turning, turning our hearts, turning our minds to so many gifts every moment, every moment that we receive that sustain us. And so many different to do this practice of gratitude. So with the guided meditation today, I'll introduce a couple of ways for us to engage with. And what else do I want to say? Oh, yes. There is so much research on how the practice of gratitude makes us happier, makes us feel more connected to others, to this flow of goodness, the giving and receiving circle, the sense of interconnection. And practice of gratitude also makes us feel more abundant. So we become more generous and in turn share our abundance with others. So there are so many beautiful aspects of this practice of gratitude. It's not just, oh, we only do it to make ourselves happy. Well, that's good too. It's nice too. It's lovely to nourish the heart and mind so that we can contain more joy and be available for more challenges, more suffering, which is, every one of us has plenty of that in our lives. So let's have more joy to be more available for that, be with challenges, with more grace when our heart is full, when we turn, when we're aware of what is nourishing and what is good in our lives. And also it has this other dimension, not just the obvious dimension of gladness and goodness and generosity, but I want to point out for us to become aware of this other dimension of gratitude that is liberating. It's sustained. It supports our freedom. Instead of our vision being tight and just focusing on what is challenging, what is difficult, it expands our vision, it expands our capacity so that more insight can arise. Freedom, liberation, nebana arose by any name. So with that as the invitation for tonight or setting the stage, let us land. Let us begin the practice of meditation. So let us land in our body, see what your body needs. Maybe you need to shift a little bit left and right, land in this body, land in your seat, in your chair. Hello body. Ah, and as always we start with tilling the soil, collecting, collecting the mind, the heart before we turn to our cultivation practice. We start, we start by landing, just arriving, arriving, turning our gaze inward, inviting our body to relax, to soften, to offer its weight to the earth, to the chair, the cushion in lieu of the earth. You can feel that we're intently working for the MIdigal Try Guys toDC us to every day start Letting the feet, letting our sit bones connect, lend, rest as if sponges, soaking, soaking up the sensations of contact connection. So grounding, so groundingly delicious. And inviting every cell of the body to unwind. Invite, invite every cell to let go of any tightness or tension. Just be, nothing expected. No doing expected. Let your breath be received. The lower abdomen. Gave it by loving awareness, cradled, cradled, appreciated. Notice how the mind, the heart settles, becomes filled with gladness. Now hello dear breath, hi. Thank you. Here you are. In breath. Out breath. Let's, now and Open FOR you You And if thoughts arise, okay Thank them, thank you, thank you thought Please come another time And releasing the thought with generosity If you're releasing a balloon Or a bird into the sky Ah Sense of ease, letting go Picking up, picking up this cradling Of the breath in breath and out breath with awareness With appreciation You You You You You You You You You You Can there be a sense of appreciation? For this moment of just sitting and breathing this moment of refuge what if we allow our hearts to light up, to be ignited with the goodness of just this moment here just taking refuge, sitting and being breathed maybe you've had a busy day, a full day or you've had a day without sangha and now you're sitting with sangha or you have a moment to yourself this moment of connection, of awareness expansive filled with grace just as it is this moment has never been this moment of my life has never been and never will be again this moment can I meet it with appreciation can I greet it with awe, with delight with curiosity, interest with gratitude knowing that all things are impermanent this moment, this life the way things are right now in my life it will change even if there are challenges this period, can I meet this moment with gratitude as a stepping stone for opening and if there is, there are things that are going well in this moment can I open up wholeheartedly recognizing their goodness thank you what is the blessing right now in this moment can I open my heart to it, breathe it in fully deeply appreciating thank you what is one thing in my life that I take for granted a blessing that I take for granted that perhaps there are other beings in this world wishing for that can I appreciate this blessing not with shame or guilt but let it nourish my heart, my body, my mind not to be taken for granted let my heart know, goodness, appreciate blessings as fullness of our heart with gratitude can inspire generosity can I be grateful for this, really let it in thank you thank you thank you can you imagine this thing that you are grateful for, this blessing what if it wasn't in your life, imagine your life in this moment without this blessing what would your life be like without this use your imagination yeah, the squeeze in your body, squeeze in your heart and now, whenever you're ready, remind yourself goodness, this blessing is in my life letting yourself open up to it even more the goodness of it, having had a vision of life without it often we can bring more appreciation, gratitude if we imagine this blessing not being here say we could imagine our arm, our leg being in a casp not being able to walk, not being able to take care of ourselves to feed ourselves, to walk around but whatever is a lie for you, you can imagine that also so let's say after this practice period you wouldn't be able to get up without crutches, unassisted from your seat, moving around, how difficult that would be imagine going through the day with your arm, with your leg in the casp it was both in the casp, why not? preparing a meal, taking a bath, or a shower, grooming yourself, brushing teeth how you could imagine the impossibility of going out for a walk how limiting your life would be, perhaps how painful and guess what? your arm, your leg is not in the casp you can get up unassisted after this sit, can make yourself tea go for a walk, your arm and leg are not broken, they're not in pain so much to be grateful for in the last minutes of this sit perhaps considering the gift of your practice, the gift that your practice has been in your life you can support this practice, this opportunity, this sangha, this medium none of this was in your life no practice, no degree of freedom, insights that you've had, none of them this sangha, any sangha, none of that was in your life if you can imagine that, and they're letting yourself appreciate, appreciate, yes, yes you have the gift of practice sangha, teaching, support, oh so much goodness, so much beauty, so much grace, so much richness my heart feels so tender and moist, gratitude, gratitude for this practice, sangha, dharma so much to be grateful for so much to deeply, deeply, humbly be grateful for may our practice of gratitude open our heart to know its own abundance open our heart to generosity letting go to freedom, may all beings everywhere be happy, may they be free thank you, thank you for your practice everyone thank you for being here so much gratitude for sitting together tonight, in this moment and as for me towards the end of this practice as I invited you to reflect on what if the sangha was in here, what if you had never come across the practice and then imagining that it is in your life, for me so much tenderness arose and tears of gratitude, appreciation, wanting to kneel and kiss the ground in appreciation, wow, wow, so grateful, so grateful for this, so grateful ah, so, so dear ones, the floor is open, your reflections, questions, comments, appreciations, you can type them in chat, raise your hand, you haven't shared for a while thank you for the appreciations on YouTube that I see, ah, yeah, thank you Bill who says wonderful session, thank you, thank you, Bill, Jane, Jenny and Paul also on YouTube what came up for you, what did you notice, what worked, what didn't, what's coming up for you now how is your heart, how is your heart? Megan says the visualization resonated with me, I have multiple patients right now with bone cancer, two of whom have full length casts on their legs while I have often felt grateful leaving work with the abilities and health I have I had not yet attempted to visualize myself in this position, with this compassion arose thank you, thank you, thank you for that reflection of compassion, Megan, appreciate that yeah, yeah, all good Ben, no worries yeah, Austin, please hey everybody, thank you, um, yeah, reminded me of a stoic practice of like, picturing yourself without something I forget the name of it, some stoic meditation, but yeah, really reflecting on my health and gratitude for it and I'm really healthy, and I don't think about that like hardly ever um, but I wanted to ask you, I remember being on a retreat with you and you had talked about how you lots of people when they go to work, they get kind of drained from work and then they come home and they say that they need to like recuperate and kind of fill their cup so that they can go back to work and then kind of almost like empty their cup and I remember you being on retreat and you were saying how you gain energy from, you could see like 10 yogis a day and that you actually gained it, I remember you were saying that was mainly through mindfulness of the body but I was wondering if you could talk about that again yeah, yeah, thanks Austin, first I so appreciate you sharing and reflecting on the appreciation for your health that you're very healthy, yay, may you continue to be healthy all the time and how you take it for granted and just really appreciating that, that's beautiful um, and the sense of being drained um, and how you remember me sharing with you that uh, that the sense of um, being nourished from my work quote unquote work being with yogis and seeing many yogis and being nourishing, it is true, I have said that oh, it rings a bell, it's something I would say um, and that, and in fact as you remember well, it does come from the sense of mindfulness of the body really being connected with my body, connected here, connected resonating with the person so now, the times, if I get in my head and energy comes too high up thinking and and engage too much falling into emotions then I can lose my balance with being embodied really with the sense of embodiment emotions, thoughts, all can be held, it can all move through and there's a sense of um how should I put it, there can be a sense of opening, there's a sense of um it's not me, not mine, there's a sense of open, I guess in some other practices could be called chi or energy kind of moving as if the body is grounded, is well, you know my mind is grounded in the body and the body is grounded with the earth so the sense of um, yeah the mindfulness of the body as a friend so and um, also being in meetings, you know various things, I've noticed a difference if I lose my mindfulness of the body if I'm on Zoom, whether if I have mindfulness of the body and I'm well grounded in my body um, being on Zoom it's very different for me, one is, can be very tiring and the other one can be grounding, noticing, just letting go of the energy as if it's getting grounded into the earth so those are a few things I can say about that, there's so much more to say about mindfulness of the body but is that uh, is that okay for now Austin? Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. So, dear ones, here we are, let's take time and engage in the beautiful practice, happy making practice tonight, the happy making practice tonight in small verbs and the happy making practice tonight is when we get into our small sanghas of roughly size three, the question, the prompt is what are you grateful for? What are you grateful for? And let's go around, so one person will say one thing they're grateful for, the next person says another thing and then the third person and then the first person again so you go around and round and round, just sharing, witnessing what you're grateful for and feeling mudita, vicarious joy for one another and feeling happy for yourself, this is such a beautiful happy making practice so, and it's perfect for this week of uh, thanksgiving, so I will create the rooms and as always please take care of yourselves, please take care of each other and um, yeah, what are you grateful for? Maybe start with the person whose name is closest to the beginning of the alphabet, alphabetical order, let's make it simple okay, have fun, here we go, opening the rooms Welcome back, welcome back, the rooms are closed so we have a couple of minutes for any reflections either from the practice or from being in groups, what you noticed, what it was like to share and hold witness um, what you and others are grateful for, so please, Deborah I, I just realized, I really enjoy practicing gratitude and in my family I was always the control freak at the thanksgiving table, wanting everyone to go around and every year my brother hated it, like a few people hated it and my mother just loved saying how much she was grateful about the children and she'd cry and it was just beautiful, so I just feel kind of like maybe vindicated or something, I don't know what the word is but thank you, thank you, thank you for this practice Thank you Deborah, oh that is sweet, it's sweet to hear and also to appreciate, you know, the particularities of all family members right, they're just the way they are so it's pretty sweet, yeah, thank you for that Ben, please Yeah, I changed my Zoom setup so it might be like 10 times more reliable than it used to be, see I also am really grateful for a moment that sounds similar to what I understood of Deborah's a teacher who probably several people here might know, or in sofer, sort of gave a talk that like was my clicking point to not experience gratitude as being a performative thing, I just like, it's amazing how much I completely at the age of 24 maybe thought that just like my whole life gratitude depends, you should be grateful for that, or you know let's go around say we're grateful for as a chore that like you're performing for other people, and Orin like gave the metaphor of just like gratitude is like ringing a bell and I won't go into the three steps of that except for the last one which is let it ring, which is just to say feel good about good stuff in your life. And that's like so relatable and so much better. I thought before, so I'm like super grateful for that moment and then like over the years since then, gratitude has been a really fundamental practice in my life. Beautiful, beautiful. Thanks so much for sharing that been that that gladdens my heart so much. Yeah, it's, it's a thing as you brought up it's really that performative it's the should aspect that you should be grateful or we feel like we should be grateful it's the should that really takes the joy out of gratitude, it's the should, you don't have to be grateful. You really don't. It just, it feels good to be grateful, you can, you can be if you want to, but there's no should. So I think that really makes all the difference so thanks so much for for sharing your aha moment so beautifully. Yay, yeah, that is so lovely. So that is all the time we have tonight folks. It's 7pm so let's bring. Let's bring it to a close when I see your note, but not going into it right now so we'll save that for another time so thank you all. Thank you for you showing up for your practice for being here. Thank you thank you thank you. You make up happy hour. So may all beings be happy may all beings be well may all beings know their own abundance, including ourselves. Thank you all. Take good care. Bye bye.
