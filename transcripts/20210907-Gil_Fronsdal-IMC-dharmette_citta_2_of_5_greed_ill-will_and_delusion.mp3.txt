 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So this will be the second talk on the third foundation of mindfulness. And the third foundation of mindfulness is that of becoming aware of the general state of our mind, or state of our heart, the mood or disposition that's in some ways more enduring than particular sensations we have in the body that come and go, or particular thoughts that we have that come and go, or particular sensations that come and go, feeling tones, pleasant and unpleasant that come and go. And certainly mind states also can come and go, but they tend to be more enduring. It tends to be a disposition through which we sometimes see the world, experience the world, interpret the world. And the disposition, the state, the quality of the mind through which we're aware has a huge bearing on how we live our lives, a huge influence. And it's also something that's intimate and closer in than the changing details of the moment that might be here fleetingly. And it's more kind of close in to who we are in a sense. And so the general instructions around this mindfulness of the chitta, mind state, is in regard to it, simply to know it as it is, to know the mind state in regard to the mind state. And what this means is that we don't have to add stories, add ideas, interpretations, we don't have to connect it to a lot of things, just know it in the simplicity of how it is in the moment right now. And then it begins by knowing mind states, dispositions that are characterized by greed or the absence of it, with ill will or the absence of it, and delusion and the absence of it. And in August, a few weeks ago, we did three weeks on each of these greed, hatred, and delusion. And in part, that was in preparation for this teaching on this third foundation of mindfulness. So those of you who are there, perhaps you're now, you know, you're more sensitized, you're ready to be mindful of greed, hatred, and delusion and the absence of it. And so the idea is to become aware of it, but not as a fleeting moment of greed or a fleeting moment of a moment, a few moments of it, but how it can appear sometimes as a disposition, as a general state or mood that we're in. We're just kind of the mood is that of desire. The mood is that of ill will or aversion. The mood is that of just being confused, bewildered, deluded. And so it's a little more persistent and more like the mood, the veil through which we see, the filters through which we see the world. And what's very interesting, the Buddha says, when he gives instructions here, he says something, he uses the word with. And probably it's not a word, it's a prefix. But he says, he uses this with. He says, when the mind state is with greed, know that it is with greed. When the mind state is without greed, know that it is without greed. And the same for ill will and delusion. And so this word with is there. And the idea is to be mindful, to know that it's there. And the marvelous thing about when we're really clearly practicing mindfulness, we really know what's happening, really conscious of what's happening. Part of the mind is not caught in what is known. Part of the mind is not defined by what is known. Now, if we get preoccupied by our thoughts, our fantasies that go on in the mind, our concerns, we can be so involved in it that it kind of becomes who we are. There's no outside of it. Everything's seen through that lens. Everything is related to it. That becomes the be-all and end-alls occasionally. So sometimes when there's desire, desire takes over. And we become the desire and get out of the way. Sometimes occasionally, I can get famished and I come home and my wife says, you had a look in your eyes. And I'm kind of looking around the kitchen for food. Maybe I'm like hunting or something. And it becomes kind of like my disposition is wanting. And so some people are saying it's frozen with no sound, but other people are not. So I'll just continue. So the Buddha uses this idea of with. And as I did in this guided meditation, it's possible to be aware, to know, what we know doesn't make up the whole experience of what's happening. It's only part of it. And because of that, we can become make room for it. We can allow it to be there because we're not defined by it. And we're not collapsed into it, we're not leaning into it. The knowing is free of what is known. The knowing has space to feel and experience what is knowing. And this idea, I kind of very much like the idea of space for things. We have a capacity to hold things. We have a capacity to allow and to know. And part of what we're doing in mindfulness practice is increasing that capacity to know things. Not knowing, not knowledge of things, but rather the capacity to be present for our experience, be conscious of it without reactivity, without becoming it, without resisting it, without being defined by it, without entering into it and becoming it. And so we have capacity so we can really hold and feel. And practice really becomes different if we have things like desires, greed, hatreds, delusions, fears. And we've learned how to open up, how to relax, how to make space to know it in and of itself in relationship to our desires, greed. We simply know it's greed without a story, without justification, without putting a value on it even, without kind of saying, well, I'm a bad person now because I have it. This is wrong. It's embarrassing. I should feel shame or getting involved in justification. I'm supposed to have desire. This is important. This is the time of my life I have desire. It's just desire, just greed, just lust, whatever it might be. Anger, hostility, irritation, frustration, all the different flavors of kind of hostility or ill will that might be there. It's just known in its simplicity. And this is not necessarily easy to do, but this is the direction the practice is going. The third foundation of mindfulness is the third foundation. One very wonderful way of practicing these is to build towards this. So the teachings and the four foundations of mindfulness begins with mindfulness of breathing, with anapanasati, the first tetrad. Breathing in, breathing out, breathing, experiencing the whole body, breathing and relaxing the body. It's such a great place to begin and to get settled, to get stable, to relax. And then it continues with mindfulness of the body, continues with mindfulness of feeling tones, how we react and respond to pleasure and the pain, and learning how to be with that in a simple way and not be so reactive. And as we learn the skills and the stability and the steadiness and the clarity of knowing, then at some point we can become aware of greed, hatred and delusion that the mind is with it, not that the mind is it. And as I said, I think if there's clear mindfulness, there's more to the mind, there's more to the mind state than greed, hatred and delusion. We've created space, we've created a healthy kind of sense of distance or independence from whatever it is we know. And so this is something you can experiment with. Next time you have a really good bout of greed, hatred and delusion, just stand still or sit down and see if you could come back into mindfulness of it, where there's space for it, room for you to be this way, you're not trying to stop it necessarily, but you're not participating in it. Mindfulness is not participating in it, not reacting to it. And just, you know it, oh, here's greed with, here's a mind state with greed, and here is mindfulness that is independent from it, is free of it. And it might take some experimentation to see what is it like to have a knowing, have an awareness, be conscious of something, where that consciousness is not caught by it, reactive to it. And the same thing for the absence of greed, hate and delusion. And here it gets a little bit more interesting because the absence of greed is not quite the same thing as the presence of greed. If the absence of greed is generosity, if the absence of hatred is love, the absence of delusion is wisdom, then yes, that can be without, that can be a mind with generosity, with love, with wisdom. And the same freedom can be there, the same spaciousness, the openness can be discovered. However, if the absence of greed is simply the absence of greed, if the absence of hatred is simply the absence of hatred, the absence of delusion is simply the absence of delusion, then that absence kind of overlaps or shades into or merges with the state of mind, the quality of awareness that's open and receptive and there. And so to experience the goodness of the absence of greed, hate and delusion, to experience the spaciousness, the freedom that's there, kind of allows us to kind of more and more develop or grow in this capacity for the mind to hold experience, including the ability to hold the suffering of the world. And I'd like to think this is one of the directions, one of the tremendous potentials of this practice of mindfulness, is that it doesn't keep us aloof or distant or unaware of the suffering of the world. It actually increases our capacity to experience it without having it weigh us down. So this is the beginning and now talking about these instructions for mindfulness of the mind states. And I'll continue tomorrow, I'll continue for the rest of the week, and it develops and grows through here. And as it grows, we enter into kind of more wonderful qualities or states of mind that are available when the mind is no longer identified or caught in what is known. So thank you.
