And it's a great pleasure for me to introduce our teacher today, Kelly McGonagall. 
I'm just going to read you the bio because I don't want to forget anything here. 
So Kelly's a PhD senior teacher and research collaborator at the Stanford Center for Compassion and Elfism Research and Education, as well as being a psychology lecturer at Stanford University. 
She's a longtime meditator in the American Zen tradition and integrates modern science with contemplative practices. 
She's also a yoga teacher, I understand. 
Yes. 
And quite a spectacular one at that from what I hear. 
So she's an author. 
Her books include The Willpower Instinct, The Neuroscience of Change, and Yoga for Pain Relief. 
And Kelly is one of the senior teachers in the C-Care program. 
And they're teaching the CCT program at Stanford that I have the honor to be part of. 
And there's some other folks here from that program. 
It's an absolutely incredible program. 
And you're going to get a little bit of a taste of it this afternoon. 
So I welcome you all. 
And again, as Laurie said, if there's any questions logistically, you can ask either Laurie or myself and we'll be around all afternoon. 
So Kelly, thank you and welcome. 
Thank you. 
Okay, so we're going to begin our first practice in just a few minutes, but I want to orient you first to what's going to happen today. 
So there's still time to run out the emergency exit if you think you're here for the St. 
Patrick's Day festivities. 
So I wanted to actually tease Robert a little bit here. 
Robert asked me, you know, we want you to teach something on compassion, send us a description. 
So I sent this description, which you may have read. 
This experiential workshop explores through discussion, self-reflection and meditation, insights into the process of cultivating compassion based on the latest research on compassion. 
Topics include self-compassion, obstacles to broadening compassion, and how compassion meditation changes the brain. 
Practices will include guided compassion meditations, gentle mindful movement, and simple breathing exercises. 
So I sent that, a little bit of silence, and then I get back this very sweet email from Robert saying, we've talked about it and we're wondering if you're actually going to be able to do all that in three hours? Should we maybe take some of that stuff out? Do you remember that? And, you know, so here's my thought about this. 
That's the overall trajectory we're headed on, and then we're going to respond and see what actually happens as we practice. 
So this will be a mix of science and practice and conversation. 
You'll be talking with me, you'll be talking with yourself, you'll be talking with each other. 
There'll be opportunities to take notes if you're a note taker, and there will be lots of opportunities to meditate. 
And even though this is not, so we're in a meditation center, but it is a secular workshop. 
So it won't be quite as formal as maybe some meditation retreats or workshops you've been to. 
But we do have some basic guidelines, and I just wanted to set them up since many of you have never taken a workshop with me before. 
And there are a few basic principles I like to follow to make this a safe and supportive environment for everyone who's here, whether you are a lifelong meditator or brand new to this practice. 
And so the first guideline is that you are free to participate or observe in anything that we do today. 
That includes big group conversations, it includes the meditations. 
You may find that, you know, you're like, wow, I'm just going to listen to this meditation first, and then maybe I'll explore it again on my own. 
Or feel free to dive in and actually do the practices as I lead them. 
It's also going to be true we will occasionally break up into small groups or partners for a couple of short exercises. 
And if you're the kind of person who feels like you want to keep this a little bit contained to your own experience today, you're welcome to practice with yourself rather than with a partner, although I'll encourage you to work with a partner for a few of these exercises. 
Now, when it comes to group conversations and partner exercises, I'm going to ask you to be impeccable with a few basic rules for how this happens. 
One is that when we talk as a group, I'm the facilitator, so you're always talking to me. 
And if someone on this side of the room says something absolutely amazing and fascinating and you want to respond directly to that person, I'm going to ask you instead to speak from your own experience and speak to me. 
And in this way, it makes it a little bit easier for folks to share their experience without worrying about whether someone's going to come in and evaluate or misunderstand or interrogate. 
So you're going to be more like a witness in conversations both as a full group and also when we do partner exercises, there will be very specific guidelines for just witnessing and listening to what someone shares to make this as really as impeccable and clean a process as possible. 
The other thing I want to mention is that we will be taking a break about halfway through, but you should also practice self-care. 
So if you need to take a moment to yourself, step out, use the restroom or anything else like that, I realize in a room this tight, it's going to be hard to do that without feeling a little bit awkward, but you should do it anyway. 
People will understand if you have a need that you need to take care of. 
So those are our basic guidelines. 
Can we have a kind of consensus around that? And I'll remind you of that as we go along. 
Yes, sir? I just wanted to say I'm a little chilly at the break. 
I'll go out and get some clothes as to stuff that I thought maybe others would like. 
Yeah, should we take a vote? Are we cold? The room holds lots of different temperatures. 
The room has microclimates is what I'm being told. 
So from people who know this room better than I do. 
So, oh, this reminds me of a great story about rooms being too cold and too warm. 
We probably will not be able to create the perfect climate for each one of you. 
But if things get, if there you go and someone has offered you the word that comes from, that's great, ask and you shall receive. 
So if we as a group get increasingly uncomfortable and there's a skillful way to deal with it, we will. 
Otherwise, we also make room for the fact that, you know, things will be imperfect and that's okay too. 
Okay, the other thing I wanted to mention before we go into our first practice is a definition of compassion that I'm working with and the scope for the material that I will be presenting to you today. 
So the definition of compassion that I use is one that comes from the Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism. 
And this is one that really integrates what you might call wisdom traditions with science. 
And this is the idea that compassion is a response that unfolds in the awareness of suffering. 
So it begins with awareness of some kind of pain or suffering in yourself or in others or in the world. 
And that that awareness gives rise to kind of a mixed emotional state of a little bit of distress but also a sense of care and love or connection that then motivates a desire to relieve that suffering and whenever possible, the willingness to act skillfully to relieve that suffering. 
So when I say compassion, that's really what we're going to talk about today, awareness of suffering, how suffering makes us feel when we're aware of it and how we can try to transform whatever we're feeling into a desire to relieve suffering and skillful means for relieving that suffering. 
And this is going to be a mash-up today of two classes that I teach. 
One is a straight-up meditation training. 
That's the eight-week compassion cultivation class that Robert mentioned. 
So we're going to be doing a lot of meditation. 
And the other class is a class I teach called the science of compassion, which is a straight-up science lecture on compassion. 
So we're going to go back and forth between the two. 
You'll get a taste, both of them are eight-week classes, and you're going to get small doses, thin slices of that material today. 
Okay, so now I think that probably as many of us are going to be here are here. 
So we are going to start with stabilizing the mind and settling practice. 
And I'm actually going to invite you to, now that you've all gotten super comfortable, I'm going to invite you to stand up. 
Now, standing is not possible for everybody at every moment. 
So standing is your version of standing. 
If that means just sitting up a little bit more, if that means bringing awareness to the crown of your head, standing is relative. 
So this is an exercise that I call Mountain Sun Sky. 
And it allows us to touch into what we might think of as the embodiment of certain qualities of compassion. 
And the first quality is groundedness and steadiness, and you're almost already there. 
The only thing you need to add to this is bring some attention to your own foundation, whether you're sitting or standing, whatever the posture is right now. 
See if you can make a more conscious choice about the placement of your feet, your legs, or your hips. 
If there's a lot of tension holding you together, you might give yourself a little more space at your base, whether that's spreading your hips or spreading your feet. 
And then let your shoulders come all the way up to your ears on an inhale. 
And as you exhale, drop the shoulders down. 
Let's do that two more times. 
Inhale, shoulders to your ears. 
Exhale. 
And one more time. 
Now take a moment and either close your eyes or just focus your gaze at one spot so there's a sense of your attention stabilizing. 
And turn your attention to what you sense in your own body. 
And although there may be a lot going on, I invite you to turn your attention to any sensations of stability or groundedness. 
Now I invite you to take one hand to your own heart or chest area. 
And again, you can have your eyes open or closed, whatever feels more appropriate. 
But keeping your attention inward toward sensation. 
I'd like you to make contact with the second quality of compassion, which is your own natural warmth. 
You might sense that around the heart. 
And sensing the three dimensionality of your breath, like a radiant sun, there's a sense of expansion as you inhale. 
And a gentle release as you exhale. 
And then go ahead and bring your other hand to your belly. 
Then bring in the quality of the sky. 
So this is the quality of acceptance and spaciousness. 
You were to think of an expansive blue sky that has room for everything. 
All the clouds that pass by. 
And sensing your own body, the breath moving in and out. 
Sensing the body as a spacious container for the breath. 
I'm going to see if we can take these qualities into a brief, silent, seated meditation. 
I know some of you are new to the practice of meditation, so I will give you a little bit more instruction than that. 
But the first instruction is to take your meditation posture or seat. 
Mindfully come back to whatever your seat is. 
So you're going to find that quality of steadiness in your seat, the mountain. 
You want to feel connected to whatever is the support underneath you. 
Maybe it's feet flat on the earth and hips spread on your chair or sit bones rooted into the floor. 
You're going to make a conscious choice about the placement of your hands, whether that's hands, the lap, on the knees, or in contact with the breath. 
Keeping with that quality of stability, once you've made a choice about your position, I will encourage you to stay with it and to allow the body to enter stillness to the best of your ability. 
Now we'll make contact with that quality of the heart by setting an intention. 
I'd actually like you to bring to mind your intention for being here today. 
So there's some reason you decided to show up. 
You take a moment and bring that intention to mind. 
And it's that same quality of the heart that can also hold space for the intentions of everyone else who's in this room right now, although you do not know the content of their intentions. 
See if your heart can just for a moment hold that awareness that there are other human beings in this room who are also here for a reason. 
And see if you can make some extra space for all of those intentions as part of our shared experience today. 
Then finally, we are going to bring in the quality of the sky with both our attention and with our breath. 
So the focus of this practice will be the breath. 
There's a particular way that you practice breath focus or breath awareness meditation. 
Go ahead and use that technique. 
If this is a new technique for you, my favorite way to do it is just focus on how it feels to breathe. 
Whether that's the sense of breath in and out of your nose and mouth. 
Or maybe it's the feeling of expansion and release in the belly and the core of the body. 
And as we sit in silence for a few minutes, I invite you to notice when your mind wanders away from the breath and then gently bring it back to the breath.
