 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There we go. So welcome, welcome everybody. Nice to see you, Robert. I just have this appreciation for practicing together. You know, that we just come back here and show up and it's a beautiful thing. I think it's good. Even when it isn't beautiful, right? Even when it's messy or, or I don't know what word to say, but sometimes for me, it's, you know, not always exactly the same experience. Of course, right? We're all humans. So today I wanted to share a little bit about some scientific findings that from social scientists. Sometimes when we think about science and meditation, we think about sticking people into scanners or like neuroscience. But social scientists also not specifically about meditation, but they have, of course, it's just a natural that they would investigate. What are some of the variables that contribute to having some long term well-being? What makes people happy? Maybe it's a short way to do it. And one way that they measure this is just with questions, right? They ask people to tell them. And here's a standard question that's from like a really well-known questionnaire to measure happiness. Happiness taken altogether. How would you say things are these days? Would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy or not too happy? So this is the way that they kind of measure it. So just this little bit of a vague way, kind of feel your way into this taken altogether. How would you say things are these days? So reminding us not to just look at that irritation we're experiencing at the moment, but to a bigger, bigger picture. And so here's either of some things that I thought were a little bit surprising about this with some of the findings are. Here's the first one. I'm just going to talk about a moment. About 50 percent, about half of our happiness is attributed to our genetics we inherit. So maybe we have like this set point. So I thought that was very interesting and not usually what we tend to think, but you know they do this with twins separated at birth, this kind of stuff, these kind of studies. But what about that second half, that which we can do more about? And some of it includes our circumstances. Of course, if you find yourself in a concentration camp, it's going to be very different than if you spend your days on a yacht, for example. But that's not entirely all of it. So, and for a large part, not exclusively, of course, you know, our circumstances aren't always under our control. But here's the last kind of bucket or maybe variables are from three types of things to help support some enduring happiness. One, our relationships with others. This importance of having caring, loving relationships with friends and family. They discovered that without these people don't thrive as much as those who do have these relationships. Maybe this doesn't come as a surprise to us to learn this, but just an encouragement to take care of our relationships. Second variable that contributes to happiness is what they sometimes will use this type of language to have a transcend, have access to you or part of the transcendental elements of life. That is maybe a structure in which you can surpass your narrow self-interest. For some people, this is a religion. For some people, it's a way that, you know, being to serve others in a way, in a context that helps them to see the bigger picture and to be not only lost in their own self-concerns. That's the second. And the third are to have productive endeavors that create a sense of purpose. So that is to have, we could say, an occupation or work or the way that we spend our time. That gives us a sense that we are serving others again, this topic and earning our success. So that there's a sense of that what we're achieving is a fruit of our efforts, not just given to us because we're the bosses kid, for example, or something. Human relationships, the transcendental elements of life and endeavors that create a sense of purpose. So, loving kindness meditation can be a support, right, for our human relationships. The more that we have access to or recognize or practice with cultivate more heartedness, the easier it is for us to forgive, easier it is to really show up in a caring, authentic way when others are having difficulties. To hang in there with the tough spots in our relationship. And this transcendental elements of life, this having a focus that's beyond our narrow self-interest. It's part of loving kindness practice, of course, right, we start with them where it's easy, but then we extend, you know, greater and greater numbers of beings and maybe with more greater and greater difficulty that we practice loving kindness with. So I can't promise that a loving kindness meditation practice is going to ensure some long term happiness. But I can report for myself that it contributes, it contributes to having some sense of well being, sense of satisfaction or absence of dissatisfaction. It's not necessarily the only reason why we do loving kindness practice, but it's one of the ways in which it can enhance our life. One of the ways in which it can make a difference for us. So, with that as a background, as an introduction of loving kindness, it's part of a bigger picture that helps create the conditions in which we can have some enduring happiness, some enduring well being. We'll do some meditation. So, to take a meditation posture. And feeling into the moment. Feeling into this experience right now. Noticing, maybe in a global way how that body feels how the mind feels. Is there some ease is there some tightness. There's some agitation, whatever it might be. Just tuning in. Whatever we find, can we allow it to be there. It is there. Can we just allow it to be there. Welcome it in some kind of way. Allowing the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing. That is the movements of the chest or the belly. Thank you. Thank you. And when the mind wanders, just very simply, gently begin again with the sensations of breathing. Thank you. Feeling into, what does that feel like to have an in breath. What does it feel like to have an out breath. We can always come back to this practice mindfulness of breathing. Whatever it seems that loving kindness practice is not the right practice. Not the right thing to be doing. But to begin our loving kindness practice. This is to start where it's easy, simple and complicated. A little bit more accessible. And that is to start with a lovable being. Might be a pet. Might be somebody we know. Might somebody we don't have a relationship with necessarily, but who has had a big impact on us. Through their teachings or writings. Their way in the world. To bring in this lovable being to mind. Connecting with them. To support our culturally loving kindness. Can repeat these phrases. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Allowing any softness, openness, warmth that arises. We don't have to make it happen. It's perfectly fine if nothing in particular is happening. Just allowing any softening that might be occurring. Some warmth that might be arising. We don't have to make it happen. We don't have to make it happen. We don't have to make it happen. It's a blessing to have a warm hearted feeling. It's a goodness. And our lives can we maybe appreciate or allow ourselves to experience it. Again and it's perfectly fine if right now feels so dry and not particularly warm hearted. That's okay too. And then to extend our loving kindness to a good friend. Somebody we care about who's part of our life. Maybe the relationship is not always smooth, but that's okay. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Allowing ourselves to feel the support of feeling warm hearted. Allowing ourselves to feel nourished by this. That good friend, may you be safe, happy, healthy, and live with ease. Thank you. And then to extend loving kindness to ourselves. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be safe. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. Recognizing this link between care, respect, warmth, and happiness. And well-being. And then to extend our loving kindness to those we don't know, we don't have a relationship with. Neutral people. Maybe somebody on this call, somebody you see in the neighborhood occasionally. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. Bring in this neutral person, the unknown person. It's helpful if it can be an individual, but this is a little more difficult. Bringing them to mind, connecting to them with our intention of having openness, warmheartedness towards those we don't know. And then to extend our loving kindness to those we don't know. And then to extend our loving kindness to those we don't know. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. And then as a support for loving kindness practice and as a support for happiness. Let's do some equanimity practice. So bringing to mind somebody that you care about, but you have a little bit of stickiness or a little bit or some more bothersome, not the most difficult person. Bring them to mind. And we'll use this phrase. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. Thank you. Equanimity practice can be a great support for enduring happiness. Helping us with our relationships. And I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. For you. Thank you. Maybe I've been talking about loving kindness practice and happiness but you maybe you've already made this discovery yourself and didn't need social scientists to tell you something that you already knew. Just a reminder I suppose, some of these habits, quote unquote these things coming to happy hour for example that we do really can create a foundation for our life to blossom and flourish and go in the direction that we'd like. Not because there's anything in particular about happy hour for example, but just things that support relationships and support some warm heartedness and support our. I use this language trends and dent and it's not my preferred language but something that helps us to move away from this that over self concern that we, but so easy to get caught up in. Help us to see a bigger picture. Want to serve others support others. And I think that's a great way to do this and breakout rooms where you have an opportunity to explore this topic and talk about it. And a group, and it's best if you don't say everything you have to say on this topic but instead, take, say one point and let it go to the next person and then say another point and let it go to the next person this way spiral around and around, allowing yourself to be influenced by others. So if it's helpful, you can go in order by the number of characters in your screen name. Their entire screen name. If you have a long screen name, you'll go last turn in this one. This version. Okay, here we go. So welcome back welcome back everybody. Somebody have some comments or questions or something they'd like to add. Yes, so rain. Well I was just in the middle of a thought, when we finished that I in response to the idea that we choose our thoughts, I sometimes feel like, like at the very beginning of your talk I settle in and it's such a pleasurable thing and I'm so happy to be here. And then I realized that I was thinking about something else and I missed the first two points. It's almost like my, you know, it's like, I didn't choose to be involved in those thinking thoughts that caused me to not pay attention to the first two points so it's almost like, you know, my brain is, or my thinking is just a I just keep thinking you know I really need to do a retreat and just really practice yourself. You know, several hours a day for several days. But this is fantastic that you have this insight that you see like, yes, my mind doesn't do what I wish it would do it's doing its own thing. Yeah. And you know often before we have a magician practice we don't realize that. Right. So, thank you rain. Thank you. Eileen. Yeah, I have a spontaneous experience today that led me to think that because I've been starting coming back to happy hour after being too tired at work. And I'm not particular with it. I had the experience where I was starting to think about whether I liked something or not, in my mind just bypass that whole thinking process and just loved it. And I think that, you know, there can be this spontaneous happiness that is not interested in me figuring it out and just goes ahead and loves and that that's real, that's really special when the practice kind of has that momentum builds up to that. Thank you. Thank you for sharing that you're absolutely right. Sometimes we can get into our analysis or try to figure it out or think about it, but so there can just be an open heartedness. Nice. Thank you. Thank you, Eileen. Anybody else have a comment or something they'd like to share. Okay. Trudy I can see that you're speaking but you're muted. I don't know if you know you don't want to okay okay. Okay, okay so wishing you all some well being some happiness. I think you both are on some safety, health and ease in there too. So maybe we can unmute and say goodbye. Thank you, Diana. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Diana. Diana. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Diane. You're welcome. You're welcome. Bye bye.
