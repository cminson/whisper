The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, just beginning by finding a posture that feels comfortable and relaxed
and that supports a natural and easeful sense of wakefulness.
Just inviting a softening in the body.
Just do a sweep through the body and see if there's any extra tension or holding that can be released.
Just allowing the body to settle, to soften.
Allowing any extra tension or tightness to simply release, simply relax.
Being very kind and gentle with any tension that remains.
No need to force anything or make anything happen here.
Starting with taking a few slower breaths
can be helpful to emphasize the exhalation.
The exhalation can bring soothing and relaxation to the body, mind and nervous system.
Letting the breathing just find a natural comfortable rhythm and pace.
Allowing the attention to rest wherever it's most comfortable.
Perhaps that's with the breath, perhaps with the sense of the whole body sitting.
Or perhaps a spacious awareness that includes all experience.
We can check in and see what the quality of the mind is.
Just receiving the natural experience of the mind alongside the natural experience of the body.
However, it's presenting itself right now.
Just inviting the mind to relax, inviting the mind to settle, to soften.
And rather than trying to make yourself be aware,
perhaps there's a way in which you can simply be available to this experience that's already happening.
What is it to be available to this experience?
Perhaps this has a gentler, more relaxed, more receptive feeling than trying to be aware of experience.
If so, you can experiment with this way in. Maybe we can be available to our experience in the way that a good friend might be available to us, however we are, without needing us to be anyway.
Just appreciating us and caring about us, however we are.
What is it to be available to ourselves, to our experience, in a way that feels kind and gentle, perhaps even generous?
What is it to be available to us, to our experience?
It can be very supportive and skillful to allow any sense of pleasure in one's meditation really be appreciated because it can be a real support for the settling and stability of our minds.
Perhaps there's some sensation in the body that feels comfortable or easy or pleasant or even just neutral and okay.
Can we let ourselves and give ourselves the opportunity to be nourished by this experience?
Just allowing a natural appreciation, no need to dig for anything or try to create anything.
Perhaps it's generous to simply let ourselves be exactly as we are.
This experience of the body, this experience of the mind, these emotions, these thoughts, can be an act of kindness and generosity.
Just simply let our experience be as it is.
Not demanding it to be different.
What is it to be available to experience here and now in a simple way and in a sustained way?
Letting it be light and easy and restful so that there's no straining in the way that we are being with experience.
This makes it sustainable if we're trying hard, it tends to create tension, tire our minds and bodies.
Just receiving the simplicity of the body and mind.
If there's anything in the field of experience that feels pleasant, perhaps a stillness or silence or a warmth or an openness or a softness.
Letting the mind rest in the goodness of this simple experience.
Perhaps some aspect of the breath in the body feels pleasant.
The hands or the feet, the lips, the face, the head.
When we orient to the wholesome pleasure in meditation, this supports an effortless and natural deepening of the continuity of awareness.
Like watching a sunset. You don't have to tell yourself to watch, watch, watch.
Your mind naturally rests in taking in the sunset because it's drawn to that which is beautiful.
Can we appreciate that which is beautiful and the simplicity of this present moment experience?
Even just reflecting on the goodness of your intention to practice and connect you with this sense of the beautiful.
You can just see if this might be a support for your practice.
