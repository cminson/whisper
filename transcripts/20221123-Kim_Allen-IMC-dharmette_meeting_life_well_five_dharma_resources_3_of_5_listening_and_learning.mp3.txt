 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. So this week we are talking about five Dharma resources that help us to meet experience well. And when we have these five readily at hand and we're also mindful, then we will find that appropriate responses are much more likely to come forth. So we've talked already about confidence and virtue and how these are not automatically Dharma resources, but they become so when we take them into the heart and let them be nourished there. So the third item in the list is called a suta in Pali. It's not suta with two T's like the discourses of the Buddha. It's suta, S-U-T-A. And this one is interesting because we really need to bear in mind the idea that it becomes a resource when it's linked to the heart. So suta is a past participle of the verb sunnati, which means to hear. So suta means heard, something that has been heard. And in the Buddhist text, it's often translated as learning. So we can consider that in the Buddhist time, the teachings had not yet been written down. And most people were illiterate anyway. So the only way to learn spiritual teachings directly was to listen in person to a teacher and be able to remember what was heard. So suta doesn't just mean literal hearing, but something more like learning what has been learned, what has been comprehended, what has been taken in intentionally. So how can we understand its presence in a list that is connected to things like inner wealth, fortitude, aspiration, and modes of spiritual growth? As I mentioned on Monday, those are some of the ways that this list of five is named in the sutas. So how does learning help us to meet life well? So for this series this week, I'm translating suta, s-u-t-a, as listening and learning so that we get a richer picture of it. So we could say that we will meet situations well by really listening and also by drawing on our inner wealth of knowing dharma teachings. And that's not mental. It's not the learning that's just in our mind, but it's more the learning that's happened through listening to them with our heart. How can we listen in a dharmic way? One time in a class of about 45 people where I was a student, we were asked, how many of you feel that you are really listened to every day? And maybe two people raise their hands. And this is significant and maybe also a little bit heartbreaking. There's so much talking and so much hearing, but so little real listening. And this is actually something that we learn to do for ourselves in meditation. So if you meditate every day, you can experience the feeling that you are deeply listened to every day. In meditation, listening is related to this quality that we call investigation, which is one of the factors of awakening. So we don't mean literal listening to the words of our thoughts, although that can be part of it if we happen to have that going. But it's kind of deeper listening to the sensations and energetic flows of experience. It helps to listen with the whole body. Of course, the attention and the interest are coming from the mind. The mind and the body are not separate, but there is a way to bring in the body such that we're connecting more intuitively. And we can even take in the Dharma in this way. I was living at the Insight Retreat Center, IRC, when we held the very first retreat in Spanish there. And I went to the morning instructions and the Dharma talks, even though my Spanish is rather minimal. But it didn't matter. I could feel the good energy from the Dharma in going into my system through some other channel. My linguistic mind was not getting much satisfaction, but my heart could still feel it. And that prepared me well for attending a couple of retreats in Sri Lanka that were given in Sinhala. As an aside, some people say singles for that language, but it's properly called Sinhala. I don't speak a word of it, but still there was this sense of receiving Dharma. Actually, Sinhala is quite an ancient language, and it's related to Pali. And when the teacher would quote the Pali Canon during these Dharma talks, he would read the quotes in Pali because the Sri Lankan people didn't need a translation. And interestingly, I found that I could half ways understand the Pali quotes, even though I couldn't understand the Sinhala at all. It was a great experience. So all of this is to say that we can listen to the Dharma in a language that we don't understand literally. And that means that we can also listen for the Dharma in everyday situations. Is there Dharma in a trip to the grocery store or out hiking or picking up your children at preschool? I would say yes. It's just a kind of a matter of tuning in. And sometimes people ask, where is the Dharma in my crazy life? Or often, how can I take my practice out of the meditation hall into the world? And one possibility is to listen for it. There's so much Dharma happening all the time if we listen for it. So here's where we can shift to this other aspect of the word suta, which is learning or what has been learned. We're talking about listening and learning together today. And so if we're going to be able to detect the Dharma in everyday situations, it helps to have some integrated knowledge of what the Dharma teachings say. Not all teachers focus on this, but I do encourage people to study and learn something of the language of the Buddha's teachings. And I don't mean Pali. I don't mean the Pali language, but rather the terminology and also the major lists and how the path works to lead us from a place of suffering to less suffering or even no suffering. Not because you need to get a good grade in a class or that you need to memorize things or think about them a lot, but more like because we're always operating from some model or view of the world and our self and our life. We're not neutral entities in our interaction with the world. And so if we want to support the Dharma path unfolding, it really helps to see things in a way that aligns with the Dharma. So, for instance, seeing our challenging mind states in terms of the five hindrances or seeing a difficulty that we're in through the lens of the Four Noble Truths. Oh, this is suffering. That's what's going on. I wonder if there's some craving or clinging going on here. So maybe an analogy is, imagine if you're studying to be a chemist in a modern Western setting, but you grew up with a model of the physical world that was based on the four elements of earth, water, fire and air. And suppose, though, that you then insist in your chemistry classes that you have to use that model and you refuse to learn the periodic table of the elements that is the current standard way to do modern chemistry. I suspect it will be very difficult for you, but it would instantly be easier and more effective to just think in terms of the periodic table. So I don't know if that's a perfect example, but there is some similarity between that and the situation of learning the Dharma teachings in order to be able to walk the eight path if that's what you're doing in your practice. But probably it's even more important in the case of the Dharma because the Dharma is not just a cognitive model like we have in chemistry. It's a whole body issue, a whole being issue. And I've seen this in my own practice. I started studying the Buddhist texts maybe one year into my practice, and I've devoted quite a lot of energy to learning the teachings, listening to talks and trying to understand some of the more difficult ideas that the Buddha taught. And in ways that I can't quite explain logically, phrases and ideas that are rooted in the teachings sometimes come forth spontaneously in everyday life. And also on the cushion. I remember one time I was doing a search on the Internet about a specific kind of a scientific explanation for something, and I found all kinds of fascinating articles and videos, which got me kind of excited and joyful because it was something really cool. And my mind can do that kind of thing. And for some reason, my mind noticed that my mind state was similar to the first half of the awakening factors, which are the energizing factors of investigation, energy and joy. And because there was mindfulness, I felt like I sort of felt my mind naturally step back and expand to take in the bigger picture of what I was doing. And as that happened, there was this natural calming of the energy, and of a release from being wrapped up in the energy and joy and excitement. But there was, you know, there was still joy and interest there. But I felt the balance coming in of including the more calming factors of tranquility and composure and equanimity. So these were kind of everyday versions of the factors of awakening. But still, I marveled at how my mind drew on its knowledge of the awakening factors to recognize some of those factors in my present moment experience. And then it drew on its knowledge of how the awakening factors operate in the mind to bring them into balance. They operate by having the energizing factors and the calming factors present at the same time and in balance. So, you know, that can happen just in our everyday life. And it happens on the cushion, too. Sometimes I get snippets of teachings coming into my mind, key phrases or verses. They come in kind of like a Dharma coach during meditation sometimes. And I would guess that you might have some examples like this from your own life and practice also. In the foundational text on mindfulness practice, the Satipatthana Sutta, the fourth establishment of mindfulness is about seeing in terms of the Dharma. So this is recognized and it's a fundamental practice. The fourth foundation is mindfulness in terms of dhammas, which are then expounded as being five hindrances, the five aggregates, the six sense vases, seven factors of awakening and four noble truths. But those are just representative. What we're what we're generally doing is learning to see in terms of the Dharma teachings. So through this quality of listening and learning or sutta, we gradually cultivate what I like to call the mind of Dharma or we can say the heart of Dharma. And in terms of the Dharma resources for this week, we're training our heart to bring forth the qualities that are named in the teachings, which include also things like the Brahma bhiharas, the heart qualities, generosity, patience, as well as the various lists that I mentioned. So this this heart of Dharma is a heart that knows the teachings, that can stay mindful in a range of experiences and that responds in line with ethics and heart qualities and sees in terms of wisdom. You might notice how that brings in a number of other qualities that are on this week's list, like ethics and wisdom and generosity. So as we listen internally and externally, learning to recognize the Dharma qualities that are all around us, we will more and more be able to respond in line with the Dharma, which will be in a non-harming and wise way. So I wish you very well with your connection to the to the Dharma today. Thank you.
