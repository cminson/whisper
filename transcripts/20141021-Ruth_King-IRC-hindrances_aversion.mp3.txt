So, we will continue our little road trip together with the hindrances and let me just
say a little bit more about the hindrances because so many of you in the interviews today
and it is characteristic at this stage of the journey that we are very aware of our
busy mind and the beautiful thing about the journey with the hindrances is that
they are intended to support you in characterizing the activity of the mind.
So, it is kind of like a shortcut of being able to name the characteristic of the busyness in the
mind. So, we can name and notice the characteristic of desire, of aversion, of sloth and torpor.
It is not just a busy, busy chatter where it is all racing together but there are some things we
can discern from looking at the hindrances, all of which hinder our capacity to be fully present
to this moment. So, it is useful to think about them that way as we can look at the busy mind and
then we can look a little closer and see what is the characteristic that is at play here.
So, tonight I would like to talk about aversion and ill will
which is, it would be the part of the road trip where there is road rage.
No, it is just not going the way I planned it. So,
yeah, and nobody escapes this by the way. So, we all kind of bump into this
characteristic of aversion and ill will. I look at them, aversion and ill will is slightly different.
Aversion can be something that is just a dislike. It could be mild and subtle or it can be very
gross. I just don't like that. It could be a policy or, you know, the way the dog next door barks
or I don't like it, it needs to stop. You know, we can have an aversion towards those things.
Ill will is almost like it takes it to another level. It is not only do I not like it,
but it needs to be annihilated immediately. Let me figure out how I can stop it out.
So, it has a bit more charge to it and then the intention behind it has got a bit more of a poison in it.
It is the stuff that wars are made of. So, if you put a little power with your ill will,
if you have any power that you can add to it, it can be quite a force, not only in our marketplace
world but also in our own hearts and minds. So, the Buddha talks about them together.
I want to talk a little bit about the shape that aversion and ill will takes out in the marketplace
and how it informs our sitting practice, how it has the kind of momentum that can inform
the frequent visitors in our sitting practice. And then I will speak to how we go back out
into the marketplace. So, the characteristic, in Buddhist psychology there is certain types.
We have a, in Buddhist psychology we call them aversive types and greedy types and delusional
types and some people do a lot of fun exercises with this typology. And there are kind of constructions
or ego constructions that take a certain shape as a result of our conditioning. We have a
propensity towards being a greedy type in the world or a propensity or a habit energy towards
being an aversive type or being a delusional type. So, we can start to see that that's kind of how
we respond to what life offers in our world. So, aversion and ill will has a certain form and
characteristic out in the marketplace. I happen to be an aversive type. For many years I was very
proud of this. I didn't think there was anything wrong. The world was a problem but for the most part
I was pretty right about what I was doing, even wrote a book about it. I mean, you know, I mean,
I, you know, we're judge, jury and everything else when it comes to these aversive types.
But the characteristic that we see in the world is someone that's critical, judgmental, can be
highly controlling, righteous, angry, can be belligerent or could just hold the energy of
belligerence where, you know, you've been around people that are so hot you think the teapot's
going to explode right in front of you. They don't have to say anything. You can feel the
intensity and you just want to move away. Very much in this characteristic is a sense of the
energy creating a line, drawing a line in our lives, making a mark. You know, you over there,
me over here, you know. So it's a energy that's about division and top and down and us and them.
That's very much a part of it. The conditioning around the aversive type as long as with any of
these types is a real hard groove in the heart mine, a deep, deep groove in the heart mine.
So it's a strong, what Thit Nhat Hanh would call habit energy in terms of our relatedness to the
world. There's a sense of distrust, distrust. There's a fine sense of being able to notice
rather immediately what's wrong and to have a solution for it, by the way. The entire nervous
system is hard-wired to be on the lookout to be alert and charged and ready for battle.
There's an addiction to intensity that's characteristic of aversive types. It's just a
comfort actually with this discomfort and conflict. It's not so much an issue. In fact,
if it's not there, there's a certain anxiety that's present. It's kind of the energy of bullies,
you know, somebody that actually blames a lot but feels very isolated and alone in it.
And the other characteristic in the marketplace of the aversion and ill will types is the
characteristic of doing battle mostly with the people you love and need. It's a sense of not
being able to tolerate or trust the intimacy that is inherent in relating to other people.
So some of the things that will really ignite an aversive type is this would be the attitude.
Don't accuse me of being incompetent, needy or helpless. Those are no no's. Don't expect me to
explain myself or apologize for what I said. Don't mess up my plans. Don't make a mistake.
You won't get away with it. And don't expect me to follow the rules. I make my own rules.
So these are kind of the marketplace postures. But what's underneath that is a big secret and it
has to do with intimacy. We tend to push away what's painful and we don't allow intimacy with
ourselves or others because we can't control the variable. We can't control it from not changing.
So there's a certain intolerance to impermanence or allergic reaction that we have to things
changing especially if the heart is deeply involved. So we cling to loved ones very tightly. Are we
cut them off completely? Because we're afraid of being disappointed and afraid of the vulnerability
that goes with that. So the hard cover is actually covering something very soft and tender.
So the avoidance of the aversive types avoid intimacy through criticism and blame.
But there is a deeper calling underneath. So we come from the marketplace and we bring our
lives with us into the retreats and we sit and when we get still we start to remember. We start
to remember a deeper truth. Something that lies underneath the cover of our lives. So we begin
to explore. Sometimes we're startled by what we see, by what comes up, by what we remember.
And the Buddha talks about how suffering is meant to be known, to be touched, to know,
to be known intimately, not to be held onto, but to know. And sometimes we want to pass over
what's uncomfortable and get over to the good stuff, the spiritual stuff, the nice delight.
But I think what happens is when we sit we can feel some of the things that we really
don't like and don't want to see. Our wish never happened. We come face to face with that
and it touches us again, but this time with new resources. So I love what Gil said earlier today
about respect and that the meaning of respect was to re-inspect, to return to a sense of
what I, where I went with that was to honor and respect our experiences. I think that when we
sit on the cushion and we start to remember what we're rooted in, it's important to bow to it,
to be willing to allow it and to also open to the gift of it. And that's
a way that I relate to this respect word. So I invite you to just reflect for a moment of what
what do you bring to the cushion? What deep roots do you sit right with you right next to you?
When I sit sometimes I can remember that I start to thaw out a bit and I start to feel
some of the early fears from being raised in the civil rights movement, just in the thick of all
of the heat of that time and all the bravery and fear that seemed to permeate my environment.
Sometimes when I sit I can feel the tension of the holding that was atmospheric at that time.
Sometimes when I sit I can start to touch into the ways I didn't grieve how my father was murdered
when I was 17 years old. I start to touch into I have a capacity now in a practice now that allows
me to be with that in more of a tender way. So the body kind of knows that so it just says oh yeah
we can go there now. You know I can finally come out. I can finally thaw out. My body can finally
have a relief from the holding of that for so many years. Sometimes I think when we sit we get in
touch with how we carry what's unfinished in our lineage and our ancestors and African spirituality
it's said that whatever is not finished and grieved is reborn. So you look for it in the next
newborn baby you look for it to return and once it's cared for the whole community feels relief.
So sometimes when I sit I touch into that that there's kind of a template or a structure that
I'm holding that's older than I am that needs my loving attention and that the holding of it has
been a form of aversion towards what I actually embody and I'm here to do. So we all sit with
our histories our histories however you want to fit and it starts to kind of reawaken us
to what it means to be human. It allows us to touch the suffering of the past and also touch in
to how we're living and responding to life in the present moment. Sometimes we come to the cushion
you know for different reasons sometimes we're curious. Sometimes we've had losses in our lives
and the things we've done in the past no longer work and sometimes it's from just
just deep deep deep suffering that we're we're trying to have a different relationship with.
Sometimes we come because a friend said you need to go and you just trust him and go
and you're indebted with that friend forever. Sometimes there's not knowing why you come
but there's an itch there's kind of a discontent that you're curious about.
So then we get here and we sit
and we begin our practice and what's been cut off starts to want some union.
Aversion and ill will is a very heavy armor to carry. It's a heavy weight and we fill it.
I can remember once being on a concentration retreat and I had gotten myself still enough to
to wear the stories and everything had just kind of faded away in the background
and what I started to feel was the soreness in my body that had been holding the tension.
It was like I had big places of just achiness in my body because I was no longer holding the
story so the body was finally having a chance to relax. It was a wonderful relief in an odd kind
of way. It hurts so good. It's kind of what they say. So aversion covers a sense of frustrated
desire and it oftentimes can represent something that's unfinished. Sometimes aversion will show
up on the cushion with us and it'll only be there for a little while. Other times it's
just kind of a constant companion. So you might as well just set a seat for it right next to you
so that the next time it comes it has a place of honor and you're not so surprised. You can just
say oh yeah over here sit down. I love you. Sit here sit close tell me all about it.
Ultimately the stories that aversion and ill will have to tell us is around sadness
perhaps some grief something forgotten that's really needing our attention
and sometimes it just needs to be acknowledged. So I want to offer a few strategies for working
with this on the on the cushion some ways to be kind to this energy that can really kind of knock
us off our off our seat. One thing that's really helpful I find in working with aversion and ill
will is is to is to set an intention or to be clear of your intention when you set to practice
or sometimes setting a simple intention because part of what we have to do is kind of break our
loyalty to to kind of going there again and again and again and sometimes it's useful to do that with
an intention a simple intention like may I be kind may I be kind during the set may I be gentle
with myself during this during the set may I notice the ways that I'm beginning to harden
and during this set may I be less judgmental less critical of myself during this set.
So a simple intention so that you can have that remind yourself when you're sitting
of what's happening when we set an intention we become more alert and it helps us it's almost
like a contrast to what we might be doing we can say oh yeah that's quite that's it's not my
intention it inclines the mind to in a direction that's more wholesome. So that's a simple thing
that just helps you realign you know what's the restart button that you can push.
It's also useful to tend to the breath throughout the set when especially when a version is
is raising its its head to make contact with the breath especially the exhale
to notice the beginning middle and end of an exhale can be really useful when you are dealing with
an intense emotion like a version.
The exhale also has the ability to kind of cool the system from the inside to put your
attention on the exhale has the ability to cool down the heat.
I like what Rumi says he says you have to keep breathing your heart until it opens
and that's a nice way to just kind of self support yourself during the set.
Another strategy that's really useful that a number of you may have heard about is rain the
acronym rain R-A-I-N and it has to do with recognize allow investigate and non-identification.
So I'd like to walk you through how each of those can support
a kinder journey with a version and ill will.
So the R represents recognize so right in the heat of an aversive
ill will thought that emerges that kind of occupies you can recognize right then and there
what's going on what's happening recognize the form and the shape that a version is taking in
that moment you might just ask yourself the question what's happening what's happening right here right
now like a child a version wants to be called by its rightful name and and also wants to be seen
so it's not a time to turn away unless it's unbearable but to just face and say yes I see you
what is my experience right now is it a a thought and emotion
is it a sensation what is informing me right now that I am dealing with a version and ill will
what's happening so um
sometimes just the recognition of it is enough it kind of pierces the bubble of a version just to
be called what it is yeah I get it anxious tight frustrated angry blaming sometimes that's enough
just to name it but usually it's not usually we have to go a little further
or never so simple and so then there's the allowing it to be there allowing it to be just what it is
to allow is to accept what is right now what it is right now without judgment
can I allow this is where that exhale really can serve you can exhale and say yes welcome
welcome I see you the question we ask with allow is can I be with this right now can I
bear this experience right now can I be with it can I be with it with this breath
can I be with it with the next breath can I be with this right now
if you can't be with this experience if you can't bear it then it's good to back off
and just go back to the breath or go back to something that feels very solid
but if you can allow it you can say yes
you don't want to say yes if you're feeling un un imbalanced or kind of too frightened because
it shocks the nervous system and then we we got to do double duty so it's useful to
genuinely ask yourself the question can I be with this right now can I be with this discomfort
right now sometimes that's enough to just be with it you don't need to go any further you can
just rest right there with insistent aversion usually we need to keep going so then we move
into investigating our experience and it's not just investigating our experience it's an intimate
exploration of the experience of aversion
it's a shift from our head into what's happening in the body it's a shift from the story we have
about aversion to the experience that's that's in motion inside the body
all thoughts have roots in the body and so we're we're moving away from the thought we have of
aversion to seeing where the legs are how it's experienced in the body
sometimes we might pause here and explore where am I feeling the sensations most alive here in my
body where is it happening it could be an image it could be a memory it could be a sense of
something that feels heavy or dark or light and wavy I mean we can start looking at the
characteristic of how this is actually living in the body there's a tracking that we're doing
here with the investigation so this is a witnessing activity where we're we're noticing and touching
the movements of mind that's occurring throughout the body
the other thing that's happening with this investigation with this intimate investigation
is we're actually having an experience with impermanence we're noticing also how things are
changing moment to moment one of the things you get in touch with as you track the experience
is that it's changing all the times and here is where you can also notice when the intensity of
aversion and ill will is not so predominant there is a time perhaps and often we're just not always
used to noticing it when the intensity of aversion is not there it's actually ceased sometimes
especially with aversion types we're so accustomed to seeing what's wrong that's where the focus is
we're not accustomed to seeing when it subsides when it's no longer predominant so one of the
things we can do as we are investigating our experience is notice when it's when it subsides
notice the space that's there that opens after the intensity has lessened it's there we just don't
we're not always accustomed to seeing it and that's a real time of release that's a real
time of freedom when we notice that contrast intimate investigation allows us to cultivate
more tolerance for the present moment and how it's constantly changing so we're sitting with
this change we're sitting with the movements of mind and being touched by them and also noticing
when they subside so that's the intimate investigation of experience
sometimes that's enough we don't have to do much else after that
but there's one more thing you could do in this journey and this is the the end the
non-identification with the experience
and here we're turning our attention to witnessing what's occurring and exploring
what what you could do about it you know it's like what is this experience actually asking of me
what's needed here what is this aversion needing from me
sometimes aversion needs a kind eye somebody to just allow it to be there and to hear its stories
whatever it might be the mindfulness attention that we can bring to the situation could be a
lovely offering to aversion so we might just pause here and ask what what is it that you need for me
so it could be that aversion needs some kindness some meta
so you can imagine yourself offering this aversion kindness
you can see that in your mind's eye and then see what happens when you do that
so if you're offering kindness then you can then see how that changes the experience
so
this is the simple format of rain recognize the aversion allow it to be present if you can
then investigate it with heart staying close in with it and then non-identification with
what's happening offering it what it needs
the antidote the Buddha teaches that one of the things that supports aversion
is meta loving kindness loving kindness practice
and this is I know especially been true for me in my own experience my own practice of coming from
a tremendous amount of rage and in my life and my upbringing and so many things that to
to kind of stumble into meta was a real shocking revelation that worked me from the inside out
it was it was not a concept I was living with it was a direct experience that actually changed my life
and I was first introduced to the notion to it not as as meta but as a soft spot
and my studies in the Tibetan tradition Cheyenne trumpet Rinpoche talks about the soft spot he
talks about it as a tenderness we can't cover up avoid or deny and the image I always had of it is
is a little tender spot at the top of the baby's head when they're little you know when they come
into the world there's a little spot up there there's really soft a little dent I can still
feel mine actually so we have this soft spot pymish rodent says it this way she says
the soft spot is the weak link in the hard boundary of the ego structure
it's the soft spot is the weak link in the hard boundary of the ego structure
and we might try to cover it up with all our might but you really can't escape the access
and the power that tenderness can have in your life it can penetrate
regardless of our cover
so for me it was this idea of a soft spot that supported me in knowing that
I had been kidding myself with this hard cover of a version throughout my life
and the Buddha taught from a boundless heart in the heart suit of the Buddha says one should
cultivate a boundless mind towards all beings and friendliness towards the entire world
throughout one's waking life one should practice this mindfulness
his offering to us and his teachings was from a boundless heart a generous heart a heart of meta
and he taught these four forms of love that are kind of known as the Brahma viharas and meta loving
kindness is the first one that's talked about it's described as loving kindness but it's
also described as friendliness and one definition that I heard of it was to grow fat with friendliness
and it's like okay I can really relate to that one these days
but it's the intentional offering of goodwill
towards yourself and towards others and it's a boundless state of heart mind
the late Dr. Maya Angelou says that love has no boundaries it jumps hurdles leaps fences
penetrates walls and a rise at its destination full of hope so this sense of just far extending
radiance of heart that touches everything without qualification indiscriminate as if the high noon
sun touching all is the antidote to aversion and ill will it is the medicine if you will
it is the infusion that you want when you find yourself entangled in this
and meta is a technology I see it as a technology it's a software upgrade we put into the hard
wiring of our conditioning and and there's a learning curve with it where we learn through
practice how to use this software and to soften in our lives so it is indeed a practice
what we're doing when we practice meta is we're controlling the climate by setting the thermostat
to kindness and we are readying the mind to embrace what arises in an atmosphere of warmth
so this is the balancing offering for aversion and ill will and it's a simple practice
it's not always so easy as some of you know it it has four classic phases to it may I be safe
may I be happy may I be healthy and may I live with ease it's kind of the simple framing of it
so it's simple but it's not easy because we don't always feel loving and kind especially
when you're dealing with aversion it's like what not today not right now I'm not finished
with what I'm doing I can remember setting an intention and doing meta practice for
uh several months and um this was a few years ago and I got off the phone with one of those
customer service calls with my computer that wasn't working and I'd been on the phone all day
and I remembered slamming the phone down and not just once but then killing the desk with it you
know you know and my partner walked by the room and she said way to go dharma teacher
it was just the moral shame I needed to snap out of it and she kept going she wasn't about to step
but I think the last thing she said was the YouTube is rolling and then I just really
so that's the power of setting an intention you set an intention and then somebody somebody
sometimes not always you gets to snap you back in alignment with what you said you're
intending it was a really nice wake up it's like oh my gosh so um be careful what you asked for right
so yeah so we don't always feel this loving and kindness um
you know but um
um
but what we're doing when we practice is we're opening a field a bit more space for us to know
intimately what's possible with a with a willing heart when we practice Mehta we get to see that
uh we get to see closely when the heart is opening and when it's closing when it's gripped and when
it's released when things are warm or a little chilly when we are opening up or closing down
with the with the right atmosphere we can relax a bit and see more clearly what's actually happening
happening and when things are too difficult then we can practice Mehta with Mehta
may I be kind to myself in this moment of suffering or struggle may I learn to be kind to myself
during my own suffering and with Mehta practice we become it becomes the way we are instead of
something we're doing on the cushion it becomes again the atmosphere that's really really important
um so with aversion and ill will it's useful to have a tender way of investigating the experience
that you're having um we're poking around um the heart when we're looking at aversion and ill will
it the the aversion and ill will has legs it has stories and emotion and um there's information
there for us to bow to for us to pay homage to not in a clinging way but in a clear seeing way
so that it cannot continue to kind of morph into something something else
so we we have a sense of this shifting in the outer world when we can acknowledge to ourselves
and others that we are hurt and afraid that's not something the aversive type tends to do very quickly
when we become less controlling and judgmental of others in ourselves and our relationships
and what we see across the room how we judge other people and in our own minds and hearts
when the judgment lessens
we're relaxing and knowing aversion and ill will more intimately when we can
um uh genuinely open to how we are interrelated and how we impact each other
that what i carry and what i do next actually has an impact on the collective and climate
that we're in and when we can be more accepting of things not being perfect or the way we think it
should be when there's a softening around that we're starting to loosen our grip with this
over identification with aversion and ill ill will and when we can experience our truth instead
of defending it all the time can experience it without necessarily a story the buddha said that
the um freedom from aversion and ill ill will was like being healthy after a long illness
being healthy after a long illness
and the buddha also said that uh with metta as this antidote the willingness to train our heart
is the highest devotion that we can have so when we bring our heart we cultivate our heart
it's a deep devotion the highest devotion and it supports our ability to relax
and allow the uh rising and subsiding of aversion and ill will to come and go without
being gripped by it
so let's sit for a few minutes together this information
I'll offer a little metta while we're sitting here these last 15 minutes
so take a moment here and recall a time of loving presence
it could be not so much a person or a situation necessarily but a moment just a moment of loving
presence that you've experienced in your life and imagine that person or that pet
or that offer sitting right before you
you taking joy in you and wishing you well
just relax seen into this reflection
of that moment in time that loving moment and feel into it as if it's right here before you
notice what's happening in the body and with the breath
and riding the rhythm of your exhale
as you receive this offer and this reflection
feel the happiness and the joy of this offer
allow every cell in your body to receive
this moment
let's really take in your time to fully receive and be touched by this reflection
staying close in
allowing yourself to bear the goodness of this reflection
now allow the image of the person or the pet to just fade away
whatever the image was just let it fade away but maintain the essence
of the intimacy that was exchanged
allowing whatever experience is there even if it's slight
appreciating the glimmers of love
resting in this awareness
and from this place of remembrance of that moment of being touched by love and kindness
staying with that as an atmosphere I'll offer these phrases
may I be safe may I be safe from inner and outer harm
may I be safe
may I be healthy
and if I can't be healthy may I accept
my body just as it is
may I accept my thoughts
may I be healthy
may I be healthy or may I be happy and content
may I be happy and content
content with what is
may I be content
may I live with ease
may I live with ease
may I live with ease
may all beings without exception be safe from inner and outer harm
may all beings be healthy and strong to the degree possible
may all beings experience joy and contentment
may all beings live with ease be free from suffering
and taking these last few minutes to experience the genuineness of your offer of meta to yourself
and others to experience the good intention of this offer
thank you for your kind attention
