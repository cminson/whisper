 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Here we go. So, so hello and welcome, dear Sangha, to, to this edition of Happy Hour today. Whatever the time might be and the time zone you're in around the world. So, the theme for today's practice is Metta and Impermanence. Metta and Impermanence. So, so impermanence. I want to say a couple of words about that. So impermanence. It's a fact of life. Nothing, nothing that's challenging stays ever the same. Everything will change. Everything that is quote good or quote bad in our lives, whatever experience, everything changes. Everything changes. And sometimes we feel that impermanence is on our side when something is challenging and we know it's going to shift and change even though our minds think, oh, it will never change. It will always be the same. But of course it will shift. And of course, if, if there is a period of ease, enjoy it because it will shift, it will change. Not to grasp, not to cling because clinging to it can cause undo, undo pain. So it's wise to realize everything shifts and changes part of this life. So, so meta and impermanence. So can we love, can we love what is knowing that it will shift and change, especially knowing that it will shift and change ourselves, situations, people in our lives. Can we lean into meta, goodwill, care, love, especially in light of impermanence, in light of shifting nature of life. That's just the way it is on this dimension of being human. And I want to offer a poem as our inspiration. So, the poem is called Eternity, which is interesting because it's actually talks about impermanence. It's by William Blake. And here's the poem. Many of you probably already know it. He who binds to himself a joy Does the winged life destroy He who kisses the joy as it flies Lives in eternity's sunrise I'll read it one more time and apologies it's gendered language but he lives from 1757 to 1827 so you can change the gender as it works for you but I'll read it as he has written it. He who binds to himself a joy Does the winged life destroy He who kisses the joy as it flies Lives in eternity's sunrise So this idea of impermanence It's joy as it flies, can we kiss the joy? Can we kiss the joy as it flies? Instead of binding ourselves to it Destroying by binding ourselves by the sense of clinging Destroying ourselves destroying it, destroying the joy as it flies So can we kiss it as it flies? Can we have good will, metta, love for whatever their circumstances are as they're flying as they're flying, they're changing all the time changing all the time So can we live in eternity's sunrise? By appreciating with love, with gratitude, with metta the permanent nature of all things So that is the loose theme of tonight's practice So let's settle, let's begin together So let's arrive in our meditation posture whatever it might be supportive for you in this moment Sitting, standing, lying down or maybe walking for those who might listen to this later on Adhir dharma And for most of us right now, sitting, sitting, feeling our sit bones, on the cushion, on the chair Landing In this moment, in the impermanence, the fleeting nature of this moment Kissing this moment as it flies Letting our feet, the bottom of our feet, sense, feel their contact with the earth I am here just as the Buddha touched the earth with his hand the night of his enlightenment This earth being my witness, touching the earth, with our feet, with our body with our bottom on the cushion, I am here Allowing the breath to move Any wage wishes in and out of the body received felt in the lower abdomen Just receiving this breath, this in breath, this out breath with appreciation if it's available right now In this impermanent moment as it flies I am here Just chilling in the soil Calming, inviting the mind to settle, to be calmed and the body received in the body Calming, inviting the mind to settle, to be calmed Calming, inviting the mind to settle, to be calmed Calming, inviting the mind to settle, to be calmed Calming, inviting the mind to settle, to be calmed Calming, inviting the mind to settle, to be calmed Each breath received in breath received Out breath received the abdomen Embracing, appreciating As if each breath is a winged life, a winged life appreciating Turning our kind awareness, receiving with kind awareness Each breath as it passes through As it passes through Turning our kind awareness to this being who is us, who is myself This impermanent being who's of course impermanent in the big picture It also shifts and changes, aches and pains, energy of the body This body keeps shifting and changing every hour, every day Moons, emotions, thoughts, coming and going This dear, dear being with arising and passing sensations, thoughts, emotions So much in flux, this being is in flux and hurriedly impermanent Oh dear, dear being who is me Holding, this being shifts and changes Being with Metta, with love, with care, with friendliness May phrases of Metta work for you, feel free to use the phrases You have, of offer, subtypical phrases, may I be safe from inner and outer harm Knowing fully well that there is no complete safety in the world, we're just expressing a wish Out of kindness for safety for ourselves, may I be safe May I be happy and joyful May I be healthy and strong May I meet every changing moment with ease May I be safe As the conditions internally and externally change all the time May I be happy and joyful in the changing world, internally changing, externally changing May I enjoy as much health as possible with shifting circumstances internally, externally May I meet with ease every changing moment The phrases adapted for our theme today, you can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish Ease You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish You can shorten them if you wish Thank you, Wayne, and bless you for being part of the community of teachers in your 13th hour in the classroom, preparing and serving and supporting so many students. So what I would say is just one couple words briefly is, you know, executive function is not a term or concept that the Buddha talked about. However, one thing that might be helpful to consider is perhaps reframing it as wisdom. How can you be wise with your time, how can you be wise with your purpose, how can you be wise with the way you spend your time and serve your students. So I'll just leave you with that. Thank you. So, dear ones, dear, dear impermanent beings in impermanent conditions of our lives internally and externally. We are going to now change everything changes so we now are going to shift and change from being in larger community and turning into small groups of size three to support share our practice with each other practice in small breakout groups. So, and as always, we'll start with 15 seconds of meta ourselves for the other people. And then we will turn to sharing saying as little or as much as you wish about impermanence and meta, what came up for you. So, the rooms are formed. And here we go. Take care of yourselves take care of each other. Restart the recording. So we have just a few minutes for reflections comments questions, what, what came up, what you realized. Please don't be shy, especially if you haven't shared spoken for a while. As the poem set the moment. Is there, it was just something specific also that came up in the group that you mean the moment in the group or the moment for the for the meditation Jerry. You're welcome to unmute if you like you don't have to. I was just talking about the moment actually. At the very end, the timing was get and I said, Oh, this is a fleeting moment we need to say. And it was a moment of real and real moments because it was a very enjoyable period to be with another member and the group but. We talked about, because both of us were reflecting on one hand, the buttons and a lot of pain. You know, Jill has mentioned in his talks that, well, it will change the pain will never be constant is always a nuance. And then of course I reflected on the other side that when you enjoy this a tendency to want to cling to it and not let it go, but in both places, it's that space of trying to recognize things are always changing. And I gave the example of a cardinal that I bird that I saw the other day I took a picture and sent it to the neighbors that it was good. But I many times just see the bird and absorb that moment and enjoy it recognizing it's going to go without having a sense of loss, but you can get into a sense of loss when you're in a period of joy. Right. Exactly. Exactly. And you're bringing this up as as also Mark brought it up earlier with with the puppy like enjoying this puppy I love the puppy so much I love this this bird flying so much. Oh, whatever goes away that that sense of angst so so befriending befriending the law befriending that that that impermanent because that too is impermanent that sense of grasping and clinging so all of that. Yeah, beautiful. Thank you. And thank you all for your practice such rich practice with this theme. Can also also one last thing quickly I want to bring in is is Jerry as you're talking about pain physical pain. Realizing everything is part is impermanent can bring a sense of sweetness, the sense of befriending for what is only here for a limited amount of time, whether challenging or more pleasant and Henry on YouTube says, Hello in breath. Out breath. Thanks. So, that's another way to summarize our practice so thank you all thank you so much for your practice for showing up for yourself for each other for all whose lives yours touches, they all beings be well, they all things be free, including ourselves. Thank you.
