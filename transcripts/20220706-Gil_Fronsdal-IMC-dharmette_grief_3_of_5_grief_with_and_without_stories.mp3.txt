The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So on this third talk about grief, first I want to say that grief is a huge topic
that certainly deserves a lot more attention than I could give in this
short 15-minute talks, five talks that I'll be giving. And one of the things I'd
like to convey is that the grief is something to respect, grief is something
to allow for, grief something to that has its own process that we want to make
room to unfold without complicating it unnecessarily. There's no shame with
grief, there's no pride with grief. Grief is, you know, many many factors come
into play with grief. And one of the things that comes into play with grief
is the stories that of our lives, the stories we associate the grief with. And
they might not be so conscious that there's a story involved in grief, but
it could be very very simple. It can be the story that the person we loved is
no longer here, and then we won't be able to do the things that we love to do. We
won't be able to share the things that we shared before. This is all true and
it's a story. Saying it's a story is not meant to diminish its value or be
disrespectful for it, but it is to identify that it is a certain processing
and functioning of the mind that is operating that's in addition to just a
simplicity of the present moment. Now we don't want to overvalue that simplicity
of the present moment and dismiss the stories. We live in stories. They're a
huge part of our life. And related to stories are meaning. The things have
meaning. So the death of someone, the meaning of that is that that person
won't wake up in the morning to make me coffee anymore. And that was just, that
was just a kind of a ritual of love and someone who cared. And so now there
won't be that caring of me anymore. And so they're signing meaning and to that
event. Sometimes the meaning, the stories that come into play with grief have to
do with past griefs, unresolved griefs, griefs that were quite strong and powerful
that still somehow live in us. And new griefs come along and the stories of
those griefs, the meaning of those griefs that take the form of very
powerful emotions and feelings might come up and arise as well. So sometimes
when there's grief, it's very useful to go find someone to talk to that you can
just talk the story, talk what's going on, talk about the events of it, and talk
about the expectations, the hopes that have been shattered. Talk about the, you
know, what that relationship or that thing or whatever that's been lost, what
that meant for you and the value of it. Talk about the, what metaphors are, do
you relate to this? What are the beliefs that come along with the grief that you
have? And so to be able to talk to someone about it is invaluable because, or
write about it for yourself, because it allows room for us to hear and see and
understand, give voice to the stories and the meanings that are operating. And if
they're not seen, not understood, then they operate kind of underground. And they
have a momentum and a strength to them that will influence our emotions, our
feelings, our attitudes, our beliefs, but what's happening in kind of unconscious
ways. But bringing things to light is part of the function of living a wise
life. If we're dismissive of grief and think that we're not supposed to grieve
or it's wrong to grieve or we have to grieve quickly or something, then we
don't allow ourselves to grieve in our way. We don't allow the grief in such a
way that we bring to light what all the different elements and aspects of what's
going on with the grief. So talking to someone, and sometimes it's best to talk
to someone maybe who's not too close to you and who's kind of maybe caught in
the same, some of the same dynamics and can be useful. In mindfulness practice we
do something that's maybe unusual and that is we recognize what's happening
that's really a big part of it is bringing things to light and really
seeing and learning to identify all the different component parts of it, the
emotional aspect of it, the physical aspect of it, the cognitive aspects of it
that involves the beliefs and the stories. Those beliefs and stories that
might be somehow unconscious or subconscious bring them to light and
understand what's going on. We sit down to meditate and it's a wonderful time
to discover how much the mind is spinning around and around maybe saying the
same thing over and over again and we start listening more deeply. What's the
mind saying? What's going on? It's like you're listening to someone else to hear
deeply. What's going on underneath the words? So we can listen more deeply to
ourselves because we're spinning the same story, the same idea, the same meaning
that's going on. Some of that might be very personal, the meaning, now my
life has changed, my life has changed in this way and I can't do this anymore. It
might be more about the other person, it might be more about society or the world
or the wider family. Now I won't have this be part of that and many things.
And so to bring that to light and let it be, let's live there and we see it clearly.
So that's part of mindfulness practice. The other part that's maybe the more
radical and the more surprising for some people aspect of mindfulness practice
and that is to temporarily, not forever and not to dismiss its importance, but
temporarily put to rest, put aside story making, put aside meaning making, put
aside the flow of thoughts and thinking and ideas that flow and and come with
grief. Not to dismiss any of the grief, but there's a way in which the story
mind that repeats itself over and over again, the meaning mind, can also
interfere with the deeper process of grief that that is going to somehow
bring something to, something is going to settle, something's going to open,
something's going to unfold through it all. It's kind of like giving your grief
its freedom, freedom from the cognitive mind, the thinking mind, the meaning
making mind, the story mind, the predictive mind, predicting the future, or
free from the memory mind that's constantly reviewing the past. Not to
shut that part down, but to put it aside, let it just kind of drift by. Don't
live in the thinking. And one of the ways that you can do this is of course
you're going to be thinking anyway, you can't just turn it, turn a switch and
turn it off, but recognizing it as it is and then take this story as if you have
you can gather together the meaning and compost it in the body. Feel what's
happening in your body and relationship to it. The body is not a story. It might
be impacted by a story, but the body is not a story. Just keep coming back and
feel the breathing, feel the body, feel the embodied experience of what's
happening as you're grieving, and make room for it, and make more and more room
for it. And part of what meditation is doing is expanding our capacity to hold
difficult states of mind, difficult emotions. But feeling it in the body is
the best you can. For as long as it's useful, for as long as it feels as it
doesn't spin out and be too challenging, and you start maybe panicking, or start
to kind of feeling like you're drowning, at that point maybe get up and go for a
walk, or talk to a friend, or do something different, do some methameditation,
you always want to moderate yourself and not do this too much with grief, but
but to come and feel the body, be here. And the point is to live an alternative
than to live in the stories, alternative to live in the meaning-making mind, and
allow something deeper to unfold. And there's a kind of a freedom that comes
from that. And we can't really free ourselves from it, from the story and
meaning-making, unless we learn to recognize it first, and recognize it as
something that's not wrong or bad, but it's not something we have to live in all
the time. And there's an alternative. And so with grief, what's so powerful about
this stepping away from the meaning-making, it allows for the deeper aspects
of the heart to have more space. It allows for the deeper emotions to unfold
without being renewed, without being new data, new new things coming in and just
keep spinning and spinning, and allows for us to kind of drop into the depth
of some deep aspect of who we are. And I'd like to propose that grief is connected
to the beautiful depths of our own heart. Sometimes grief is connected to our
love. And to be able to put aside the story and the meaning-making, it's
sometimes we can settle into where the love is. Sometimes the grief is connected
to a desire for safety or a desire, a hope for a better life that gets
complicated when we start telling ourselves stories about what that's
going to look like. But the very idea of wanting a better life is a part of
self-care, part of self-love perhaps. And to settle that back and just feel
that self-care without the complications of stories that may or may not be
realistic, is to drop down to something that's deeper and more present here. And
so to put aside, that's why when we sit and meditate and keep putting aside our
thoughts, letting go of our thoughts, and learning the skill, learning the art of
that, that this serves us really well in times of challenged like grief, where
sometimes that's a trigger for a lot of intense aspects of the story and meaning
and purpose and memories and the operation, you know, it churns up
expectations and anticipations and hopes that are now being shattered. We
didn't even know we've had. And so to let to let go. So a wise life is one that
understands the stories we live in, some stories we receive from our culture, from
our family, from our religions that are contingent, that are not absolute, but
it's a story. It's a meaning, it's a that's assigned to this life and to
ourselves. And and to respect that for sure. But then also to learn how to put
that aside. And so I define grief as the pain that arises in the emptiness
associated with loss. And and here, rather than filling the emptiness with words,
with stories, meaning, ideas, the idea is to let the emptiness be there without
story, without meaning, without a lot of thoughts and ideas, and see what happens.
And maybe that emptiness will become large. Maybe that emptiness will be
freeing. Maybe that emptiness will make room for more of the depth, something
too deep to sink inside of yourself. And and to do this work of letting go of
the stories and allowing the emptiness to be empty is to allow the contemplative
life, a meditative life, to allow something to flower, something to settle
in a deep, deep place, way, place that is deeper than the surface mind. So perhaps
you'll have an occasion to have grief. And if you do this next 24 hours, see
what it's like to sit with the grief and putting aside the stories, the ideas, the
meaning of it, and just sit with your experience. See what that's like to that
emptiness and see if it does, in fact, allow something deeper and more profound
to happen. So thank you. And I'll be at the Insight Retreat Center going down
there when I finish here today, and I'll be there for two days. So what it means
that this tomorrow morning I'll be in a different location. I'll be in one of
the meditation halls of the retreat center. So probably I'll be with
Pathachara, the statue of the nun that we have, that some of you probably
remember. And so I look forward to connecting you to you from IRC. Thank you.
