 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's a little cleaner recording, other than hearing the background noise. So, the thing I want to talk about a little bit today is, you know, at the beginning of the year, there's sometimes this pressure. We used to hear, New Year, New You, and now I'm hearing New Year or Reset or something like this, but it doesn't matter whatever way that we name it. There can be this idea of, well, maybe I need to get serious about some of these goals in my life or whatever it might be. And there are a number of ways in which we might orient our lives or orient our practice or meditation practice, our loving kindness practice. And certainly one way is towards attaining goals. For example, like maybe doing loving kindness practice so many days in a row, we could set that as a goal. Or maybe there's this idea that we should perform better, like maybe perform like quote unquote, right? There's this idea maybe for loving kindness, maybe just feel warm heartedness in more and more settings in our lives. Or maybe there's this idea that we're going to want more, whatever it is, we want more, right? Certainly society encourages this. Maybe we should not only feel warm hearted towards others, but we should feel warmer hearted, right? Whatever we used to do before isn't good enough. So maybe that's another one is to compare ourselves either to how we used to be or to compare ourselves to others. So there's all these ways in which we might orient or maybe we could use the language, evaluate or use as a frame of reference. But I'd like to suggest an alternative. Something different than these usual ones that we hear about. And in this way, that can really adjust and support us in a meaningful way. And it's available to everybody. And that is, what if we orient ourselves or use as a frame of reference, the level of sincerity we are bringing to our practice into our life. So what do I mean by sincerity? You might say that it's this has a certain amount of authenticity and with that being aware of what's really going on with ourselves, with the social dynamics in the room or whatever the situation is as best we can. Right. Very often we just don't know. But can we authentic be authentic that is to show up and to pay attention as opposed to purposely ignore or as opposed to trying to avoid. But instead to not only be aware what's happening, but also to bring all aspects of ourselves. Not just the persona, maybe that we adopt in certain situations. And to be sure, like, I show up here and my role as a dorm teacher differently than I show up when I go to visit my mom. Right. I don't talk to her the same way I talk to you guys. Right. Or my friends. Right. So we're not saying that we have to be a way that's inappropriate, but authenticity is maybe to bring all of ourselves to whatever it is we're doing. This isn't always easy. And maybe it's not even clear how to do that. And maybe it requires some vulnerability so we have some hesitation to do that. But is there a way that we can as best we can again as best we can have this as a way to orient our lives. OK. What would it mean for me to show up in an authentic way? Some sincerity. And I have encountered that some people have said, well, in order to be true to myself, I need to tell you everything that's wrong with you. You know, that there's kind of like this. I need to tell you everything that's wrong with this. This is my truth. And so, of course, I'm not saying that either. But sincerity is a way for us to just show up as best we can with the fullness of who we are with this appropriateness and without pretense, without pretending it's otherwise or that we want something different. And when we're trying to looks like we're doing one thing and trying to get something else or. And in some ways, sincerity requires that we know what our motivations are. Why are we doing what we're doing? So it requires a little bit of, you know, knowing oneself and maybe even some introspection. And I would say it's about being aligned with our values. Like, what is important? If we have goals. Maybe to recognize that our values are different than goals, but maybe sincerity is to maybe see how they how they line up, how goals and our values are congruent and similar. So this just this way I like this idea of sincerity or integrity or completeness or authentic or something like this as a way to orient our lives as opposed to just getting more of this or better than I was before or something like this. It's so easy to fall into those traps. Of course, it is. Because, you know, society really wants to promote that. But what would it mean to just be authentic? To be sincere without pretense. Okay, so with that as an introduction, let's do some practice. Part of the way that loving kindness practice really supports the sincerity is allows us to accept those parts of ourselves that maybe we aren't inviting to the table. And also allows us to give us some way in which we feel like we have a little more stability or a little more ruggedness or I'm not sure what the word is I'm looking for but robustness maybe so that we can be sincere and authentic. So we'll begin with a little bit of mindfulness. Just checking in. Right now, just globally with the body how it is, whatever posture it's in. Is there a way in a relaxed easy way might be more ease. Feeling the pressure of the chair cushion couch, but against the body. And the body makes contact. Feeling that pressure. It's not uncommon to hold tension in the upper part of the body around the eyes. The job. The shoulders. Maybe by just mentioning them there can be some softening. Okay, if there isn't. Just resting attention on the sensations of breathing. Just hanging out with the breath. And when the mind wanders. We don't have to make it a problem. Just very simply, gently, begin again. Just a reminder that you can always come back to this practice. Mindfulness of the body or mindfulness of breathing. And to begin loving kindness practice. Bring to mind, a lovable being the most lovable being. This might be an imaginary kitten or puppy or baby. That might be a pet. Might be somebody in your life. Might be somebody that maybe another time in your life really supported you and made a difference in your life. Or maybe it's somebody that you don't have a relationship with, but through their writings or through their teachings or their. Ted talks. They've really touched you. Whoever it is, bring this lovable being to mind. Connecting with this lovable being. Some people imagine like a ray. I mean from their hearts connecting to that heart to the other person. I just offer that as an idea, no requirement. May you be a support for maintaining this connection with a sense of warm heartedness by saying these phrases. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. You. You. You. You. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. You. You. And then to expand this loving kindness this warm heartedness. To include a good friend or family member. To them. Somebody that you feel connected with and have in general a warm hearted feeling. If you can't think of anybody right now, it can be an imaginary person or I mean, imagine somebody, a relationship with somebody. Or maybe earlier in your life. The point here is to continue cultivating warm heartedness. So whatever will support that independent of which being you choose. Maybe a school friend. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. We don't have a relationship with a stranger. It could be somebody on this Zoom call. Maybe somebody you see occasionally in the neighborhood. Or at the grocery store. Bring this person to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Bring this neutral person to mind again. I have to refresh more often with this individual. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. I have to be healthy. Sometimes there's a little bit of uncomfortableness in the relationship. A little bit of irritation or frustration or annoyance. To be sure this is not the most difficult person. In a scale of one to 10. Maybe a two or a three, keeping it mild. I'm going to say a different phrase. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. At the beginning, this evening I talked about sincerity, showing up with sincerity, authenticity, integrity. Practicing with equanimity and loving kindness is a great support for us to show up completely, openly, to whatever it is that life is bringing us. Thank you. Thank you. Sometimes we might think that to have a show up with sincerity means we have to be super gung-ho. We have to be authentic in a way that is born from care for ourselves and respect for ourselves and others. We are not trying to hide away or manipulate in some kind of way, but with sincerity and authenticity. Loving kindness is such a support for that. Maybe it's not obvious at first, but when we feel like there's some warmth inside of us, then it's easier for us to open to whatever is there and to meet it without hostility or to meet it without running away or maybe even just to meet it. So now I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms. We're having an opportunity to talk about some of these ideas about what does it mean to show up with sincerity. I know there's one way we can think about sincerity, which maybe sincerity isn't the best word. Maybe there's even a better word. Maybe that's something you guys could talk about too, of what I'm trying to point to here. But a way in which all aspects of ourselves and without hiding, but also with some warmth, but also it's aligned with our values and this is what we want to do. Is there a way? Maybe one of our values is to meet our responsibilities. So it's not necessarily what we prefer to do, but it's what we need to be doing. Excuse me. So you'll... All right, I had to mute myself so I could cough. I just have something in my throat. I'm not sick. I always have to say this. Okay, so you'll be in groups of three or four. And those of you who've been here before know that I like to do whatever. I'm now going to call this the soup making method, where everybody puts like a single ingredient into the soup. It goes to the next person, they add another ingredient, and third person adds another ingredient, and then it comes back around to the first person. And now you've seen what other people have put in and contributed. And now you can put something in. So what is an ingredient? An ingredient is a single idea, a single point. So I'm sure all of us have a number of things that we could say about this topic, but just offer one. And then allow yourself to be influenced. Maybe you'll think of something you hadn't thought of before, which you're less likely to do if you just said everything all at the beginning. And for the purposes of this today's discussion, why don't we go according to the last digit of your house number. What you know your address. Okay, so you'll be there for 13 minutes. Okay, so welcome. Welcome back. Anybody have a comment or suggestion or how something they'd like to share. Maybe. I don't know maybe you thought this idea of sincerity was not a great one or maybe I don't know this is something or I don't know. I don't think my group focused on sincerity. They focused on Michigan. I don't know if you know what that is, but they changed the subject altogether. Yeah, this can happen. I don't know what to say about this right. You can't say, yeah. It's it's unmentionable. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the plenary and the small groups. I guess one of the things that came up was about at least I didn't come up in the group but I was in some ways it did indirectly but I think the act of sincerity can help offset sort of the idea that one is parking difficult feelings in this effort to do loving kindness so making it a sincere effort then prevents perhaps the near mess of sort of like, you know, being distant. So, focusing on sincerity I think just came to it after we had closed a small group is a way of preventing is enriching it to avoid just avoiding difficult feelings within oneself. Yeah, yeah, some disconnection or aloofness Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Jerry. Michael. Can you hear me. Yes. Cool. Um, so we, we focused on authenticity it was sweet and deep buzz to our small group community. Yeah. Okay, and was it was it fruitful was it interesting was it helpful was it fun was it. It was awesome. With the heartwarming and, you know, as, as the Buddha said, Tonga is the whole Dharma. And, you know, it was rich. Great, great. Thank you, Michael. Peggy. How do I say this, it was really good for me. Our group did focus on authenticity sincerity. We've been struggling with something, you know, personal and having a hard time getting out of the story, and just being present with it. So the talk really helped the idea of bringing all parts of ourselves to the table, but also just hearing others who have similar. I call them concerns in their life. It, it really helped me because I felt like really alone with it so it's it just reminded me now we all go through things and so I think it lightened it will see in the days to come. So, I appreciate my small group very much. I'm happy to hear this. Yes, sometimes just hearing that other people have difficulties kind of normalizes our experience. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Peggy. Jerry I see that you put a thumbs up is that like yes or is that like, I have a comment I'd like to make. So I was just commenting that, yes, that's it can. I was in agreement. Sorry. Okay, okay. Okay, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I just want to say, Kathleen I got your chat that we sent right before that maybe you and I can chat just for a little bit at the end here it's it would that be okay if you just hang on for a moment. Okay. Okay. So then, if everybody would like to unmute and we can say goodbye all at the same time so. Thanks. Ever staying to see everybody disappear before. It's kind of sweet. It's very sweet.
