 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So today, doing a guided meditation, we'll explore a little bit more of a focused practice this morning than we often do in this sitting. Partly because the topic is going to be concentration. And yet, I do want to just say, you know, that the different forms of concentration, there's a form of concentration that comes from practicing just moment-to-moment mindfulness. And there's a form of concentration that comes from attending to one particular experience. And since we're mostly doing the first form in this guided meditation, I just thought to emphasize the other one in a very light way, just a very light way. And yet, we'll begin, as we usually do, with relaxation. Because relaxation supports mindfulness, whether mindfulness of whatever arising experience or attending to a particular experience. And we'll use the breath this morning. And so, allowing there to be, or orienting towards, relaxing the body. Perhaps there can be relaxation of the head and face, neck, shoulders. Maybe the arms and hands can relax. Maybe the chest and upper back can soften, relax, especially all those muscles around the ribcage. Maybe taking a deeper breath and noticing how that stretches those muscles on the in-breath. And then how they can relax and soften on the out-breath. Maybe another deeper breath. Another deeper breath. The deeper breath can also support a relaxation of the body through giving it a little more oxygen, which seems to have a relaxing quality also. You also might notice a more general relaxation as you explore a third deeper breath or a fourth deeper breath. And then letting go of particular control of the breathing, we'll continue relaxing the body. Maybe the muscles across the stomach and abdomen can relax. Middle and lower back, the hips, the legs and the feet. Maybe there can also be a softening or relaxation more deeply inside the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. Maybe too there can be a relaxation of mind. Letting go of things that may be spinning or creating mental tension. Letting go of thoughts, worries or concerns, setting them aside for now. With the invitation to be with yourself. Maybe the mind can relax. As the mind relaxes, it can very naturally be available to receive experience. This is what mindfulness naturally does. And so with a very soft, receptive invitation, perhaps opening to the experience of breathing, how is the experience of breathing happening for you in this moment? Receiving an in-breath. You don't have to look for anything specific or focused as to how are you experiencing an in-breath right now. Maybe through sensations in the body, you may notice various areas of the body that are affected by an in-breath. Perhaps sensations inside the throat or inside the mouth, nostrils as the air passes through. Maybe the movement of the ribs, the chest as it expands, as the lungs fill. And as they release, expansion and release. Maybe movement of the abdomen, the diaphragm just below the sternum. Or perhaps maybe a broader sense, just a sense of breathing happening, breathing in and knowing that you're breathing in without really connecting to specific sensations. But just knowing in-breath is happening. Now what breath is happening? Sometimes there can be a broader, more subtle experience through the body, a sense of a subtle, kind of maybe vibratory, energetic shift with the breathing. However it seems most easy and relaxed for you to connect with the experience of breathing, allow awareness to receive the breath in that way. If the attention is pulled off to something else, it's okay. Just gently kind of acknowledge that and thank it for being here and then return to receiving the breath. It may happen that it feels more easeful to include it with the breath if the attention goes to something else. All hearing is happening and there's breathing. Letting the attention be broad and soft, you don't have to push away other experience. It can be kind of in the background, hearing and the breath, other body sensations and the breath. Emotions, moods and the breath. Just inclining towards a very light connection each moment. Knowing there's breathing, knowing there's a breath in breath, breathing out, knowing the out breath. We may also know other experience at the same time, almost kind of naturally. If there's any aspect of the breath, of the experience of breathing, that feels comfortable or relaxing to breathe, you can let your attention connect to that comfortableness if it's there. And if it doesn't feel comfortable, sometimes I've found just a gentle kind of invitation. I'll drop into my meditation. May the breathing become comfortable and not try to do it, not try to make it comfortable, but just see almost if the body and mind know how to find some ease with the breathing. Sometimes it can be surprising that there's a movement towards more comfortableness, sometimes not. And if there's not a comfortable breath, then perhaps exploring the possibility of, oh, uncomfortable breathing, what's that like? Maybe there can be a softness in the mind to receive the breath, however it is. In my own practice of concentration, I explore the emphasis on relaxation because relaxation is such a supportive condition. And so can there be relaxation while being aware of the breath, relaxed and breathing in, relaxed and breathing out? And if it's not possible to find relaxation with the breath, then I'd encourage just let go of the emphasis on the breath and connect again to relaxing the body. Maybe inviting, maybe the body can relax and just open to exploring relaxation independent of attention to the breathing at all. And then perhaps as you find a little more softening and relaxation, inviting a receiving of another breath, or perhaps just becoming aware, oh, there's a breath happening, aware of that one. Is it a relaxed with the breath? And again, if there's a wandering off of the present moment, you wander out, lose track of being aware. And the moment that you return that moment, give yourself a moment to connect again with awareness and start with relaxation. You don't need to jump immediately back to the breath. Allow the conditions that support connecting with the breath to come. So that wandering happens, you wake up, oh, the mind has been lost. Let there be, oh, maybe there can be relaxation. Letting relaxation be the ground, the kind of place from which we connect with experience. And if through attending to the breath, there becomes tightness or tension, let go, come back to relaxation. And then let the breath come to you as there's some more relaxed quality of body and mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
