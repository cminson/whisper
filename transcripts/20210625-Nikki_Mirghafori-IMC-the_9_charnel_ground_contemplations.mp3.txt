 So, the topic of the sixth body contemplation, the Satipatthana Sutta. So, it is called the Nine Charnal Ground Contemplations. And as I mentioned at the beginning, the previous practices, especially the 32 body parts, considering body as a bag of beings and the elements which you did yesterday, elements of earth, water, fire, and air. This body is nature, nature inside, nature outside. So, in the practice that we did, we envisioned, we brought to our attention, to our contemplation, to our mind, to our imagination that this body is not so separate from other bodies. I actually did apple today just to be more gentle with entering into this practice, with an image that I also showed at the beginning and an apple decaying on the forest floor. We are not different. This body is not different. This body is nature. This body is ours and yet it's not ours. We weren't given a choice menu before we were born. Were you? I want this feature. I want to be this tall. We didn't really choose this body. This body is nature. This is a deep and beautiful contemplation that helps us, that supports us not to take this body so personally, so every wrinkle, every this, every that, this body is nature and will go back into nature. It can't be any other way. We know this. Of course, we know this and yet we try to, but all the society, especially the Western society, keeps it as a hidden secret almost and are going back into nature is so sterilized, is hidden, is taken away from view. And this practice really tries to bring it into our consciousness that yes, this body is nature. It will go back into ground. It will just, it will decompose all the sinews, the flesh, the bones, all the elements inside will go back to nature. It's natural. And this practice is laid out step by step by step. Actually, we in quite a lot of detail. And when I teach longer day longs or retreats, I think you would be more appropriate. But for today, as it's brief, you know, not going through the nine stages because it takes some preparation, but I will read them from the sutta so that you know what is in the sutta. And then I'll talk a little more about what some of the effects of this practice could be, perhaps, but of course, you explore for yourself to see what it does for you. So here is the section of the nine charnel ground meditations, contemplations from the satipatthana sutta. Again, practitioners, as though one were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground. And just to say the charnel ground in the times of the Buddha was an over the ground place where bodies were left to decompose and decay. So not underground, but over ground. And there was a practice, a very active practice of the monks going to charnel ground to do this practice specifically to actually witness bodies left to decompose in different stages, different stages. And that's what the nine stages are, that this body is, yes, it's alive and it's nature, it will go through these nine stages. So, so please humor me as I will read these stages for you. So, as though one were to see a corpse thrown aside in the charnel ground, one, two or three days dead, loaded, livid with oozing matter, which is what happens with every dead material, including this body. So that's one stage one. Second stage, being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals and various kinds of worms. Again, part of nature. Nature is very efficient, very efficient. We showed a an image of a nurse log, a log in the forest that has fallen becomes food for other for other beings for other forms of life. In nurse log so we become a nurse log in in this way. Food for earthworms. Next stage, a skeleton with flesh and blood held together with sinews. A fleshless skeleton smeared with blood held together with sinews again, clearly they observed very in a lot of detail what happens. Skeleton without flesh and blood held together with sinews. Next stage disconnected bones, scatter scattered in all directions. Next stage, bones bleached white, the color of shells. Next stage, bones heaped up more than a year old. Next stage, bones rotten and crumbling to dust. So all the nine stages is the invitation in this practice in detail. It prepares this same body with it thus. This body too is of the same nature. It will be like that. It is not exempt from that fate. So this practice, this contemplation practice is one to bring to mind either being able to be in the charnel ground or imagining in one's imagination to imagine yes this body as if lying in the forest floor is not so different from the apple decaying or anything else decaying. This body is nature. This body is nature. And one impact, one impact that this practice can have is, again, actually multiple impacts, I'll speak about one first, is to loosen our attachment to this body, this, or rather I should say our over preoccupation. We're preoccupied but over occupied. This body is nature. And it doesn't mean that we don't treat it then with respect or we don't take care of it. No, not at all. We take care of it as this amazing, incredible piece of nature that somehow is us or has been entrusted to us to take care of without taking it so personally, oh, my skin, my hair, my mind as if it's our, or my stomach is gurgling or my, as if we have, you know, it's our personal responsibility to make it all act exactly. It acts according to the laws of nature. The hair might be frizzy according to the laws of nature, it's human, or we get sick according to laws of nature so it really brings a different, healthier, more free, again, not careless, but more free, different ways of relating to this body, not taking it personally and yet loving it, caring, loving it, caring for it as this amazing, incredible piece of nature. Another impact it can have is to again bring awe for this piece of nature that's alive. It will be dead when the liveliness when this, this aliveness when we take our last breath and aliveness is no longer part of this body, it will die, it will decay, very quickly in fact. Within minutes, there is research that internally, gases and and compounds and chemicals in the body start to decay. I think I read, was it 20 minutes, 40 minutes I forget now, after we take our last breath. So, so that this piece of nature is alive. All these cells are alive and functioning and rethinking and going about our lives and have agency. Wow, this piece of nature is alive. It's just amazing. It fills us with a sense of awe that we want to drop to our knees and kiss the ground in awe that this body is alive in this brief moment, and the mind can let go of so many preoccupations that are not healthy or not are extra or not needed. May we all find freedom, find freedom and embracing our impermanence, not hiding it, but embracing the impermanence of this body, and may it be a cause for freedom and ease for all of us. Oh, one last thing. I invite you, the next few days to bring attention to bring awareness to maybe if you do composting, you know, if there's a piece of fruit or fruit that sets. That's decaying on nature, nature, this body is not so separate so bring it into your consciousness, instead of pushing it away and letting it be sterile and away not seen bring the fact that this is nature, bring it into your consciousness. This is nature. So, and one thing that I want to invite you for those who may want to actually take this practice if they feel, if you feel ready this morning to take this practice to the next level. What I'll do is that I'll formally close this morning. And then I will share the link for the zoom link that I'm on right now. And there are a few more images of this practice that I can offer that for those who want to see them. So welcome to enter the zoom link and see that there's a few more slides to the presentation that, again, if you if you like to see them, you can get on the zoom link, otherwise, continue to practice. In a natural way. So, thank you all for your practice. Deep bowels, deep bowels for your generosity for your practice, may you be well. Be free.
