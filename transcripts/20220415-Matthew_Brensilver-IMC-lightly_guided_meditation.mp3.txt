 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, good morning. Welcome. Really nice to see the names streaming over there. Okay, you know what we do in these parts, so straighten up and settle in, see what happens. Okay. Taking a few fuller breaths. Something actually arrives. Thich Nhat Hanh uses the language of becoming available, available to the Dharma. He uses the language of becoming available to the kingdom of God. So we soften, relax and arrive, such that our heart becomes available to the Dharma. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When we make our hearts available in this way, each moment becomes Dharma kind of gift. So the deepest form of acceptance is gratitude. So the tides of pleasure and pain. The deepest form of acceptance is gratitude for it all, as if all phenomena, all phenomena, are the Buddha whispering in your ear. Make your heart available. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Questions of self-worth and deserving, judgments become so utterly beside the point. And it's the field of presence, the very non-moralistic field. It's infused with love, with Sila, with all of that, but it's non-moralistic. Less and less room for judgment charged with aversion. Just make your mind open, vast. Let the smallness of our judgment, our harshness, unfold in that vastness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All the ways we indict our minds, indict experience, indict ourselves, all of that betrays this very basic innocence of experience. The innocence of your own being, the innocence of the movements of your mind, the innocence of the Dharma. We start to let go of the thought of what might have been, what could have happened just with this last breath, this last fantasy. We become radically old. The ground of our aversion, self-judgment, or greed is folded into awareness itself. Its innocence is known. Letting go feels natural. Letting go feels natural. Letting go feels natural. The kind of desperation which we've tried to cobble together alive becomes poignant, touching, very deep care for ourselves, for the human condition arises. Love starts to feel like the most obvious thing. Amidst the openness, just one drop of love. Ngāvázh... you you you you you you you you
