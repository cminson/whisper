Connecting to your present moment experience, how you are in this moment. 
So often in our meditation practice, we explore this possibility of just meeting ourselves as we are. 
Sometimes we explore a more directed kind of practice, aiming the attention at a particular experience or cultivating Meta, for instance. 
But the mindfulness practice, the basic mindfulness practice is to just open to the present moment with awareness. 
And so is that available in this moment to be present, to where? Allowing a relaxation of body to support this. 
Some of you may find it supportive to connect to a particular experience, such as the breath. 
If that's supportive, that's fine. 
Others of you may find it more easeful to just receive what is obvious in this moment. 
How is the physical body communicating? What's here? What's obvious? What's happening in the mind? Are there thoughts, emotions or feelings? Just opening to what's here? If you're exploring, connecting with a particular experience, such as the breath or hearing or body sensations. 
Just opening to that experience in and of itself as it is. 
You need to try to change it to be something in particular. 
The breath that's happening right now is the breath that's happening right now. 
So cultivating this awareness of what's here, joined with equality or an attitude in the mind of acceptance, allowing openness to what is happening. 
Sometimes this is challenging, we don't like what's happening, so we're resisting it. 
We like what's happening, we want it to keep going. 
We want to hold on to it. 
We're trying to find some other experience, what should be happening, we think. 
As opposed to this is what's happening. 
And seeing if the heart can allow open fully to acknowledging this is what's true right now. 
This is what's happening right now. 
Opening to things as they are, what's here right now, is an expression of wisdom that the mind can hold what's here without resistance or holding on. 
And yet the quality of allowing is so close to love and compassion. 
That cultivation of opening to this moment, it's not just the awareness or a mental kind of experience, it's the heart allowing. 
So we're cultivating and allowing awareness, we could use some other words. 
Kind attention. 
Friendly awareness. 
Loving awareness. 
This simple instruction, this simple exploration of can I be with this just as it is, can I allow this? Simultaneously deepens and supports the growth of love and wisdom together. 
So it's a simple practice of can I be with this? Sometimes we can, sometimes we can't. 
If it's a feeling of resistance, then maybe there can be an allowing of that. 
Allowing that resistance, then the heart can open to that. 
Hold that with a loving, friendly awareness. 
What's here in this moment? Receiving, allowing. 
Stretching our heart with the possibility of holding more and more of what's here, of what's true in this moment.
