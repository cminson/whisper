 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. It's a delight to be with you all in person. I'm sorry I can't see all of you from my position. Paul, would you mind moving back just a tad so I can see Sage? Great. Okay, more than a tad. That works too. So I don't do well talking with the mask, so bear with me. And the sound is a little bouncy? Okay, sounds a little bouncy to me on this side. It's okay, good. I'm going to offer you a little context and roadmap for the work of chaplains and then in particular Buddhist chaplains. You may have watched the video already on the course website where people are asked, what's a chaplain? Anybody watch that video? People are like, what? What? A who? Charlie Chaplin? What? And you may have that question yourself. I may have that question. The really short answer is it's a minister who cares for people in a crisis when they are displaced from their usual place of living. So historically chaplains, the word relates to the word chapel and chapels were extensions of the church in rural areas. So whether it wasn't a church or a cathedral, the Pope or the King had chapels to make sure you got to everybody. Instead of the Pony Express, they had chapels out and about as the most important thing to make sure no matter where people were. And I like to think about chaplaincy as service to people who are in crisis. Now you can define crisis in a lot of ways. You could go with the crisis of human existence, existential crisis of what am I here for? Or the crisis of I'm in college, I'm in the military, I'm in the ER, I'm living on the streets, a loved one died, I'm incarcerated. I'm new to a Sangha and a congregation. I'm a member and I'm in a crisis. So I just always kind of keep that word in my head. So if you get in an elevator and somebody wants to know, you can tailor that yourself. And you will over the course of this year figure out what that means to you and how to articulate it. And you may or may not relate to the word chaplain. I relate to it. I am accustomed to people not knowing completely what it means. I invite you to figure, see what happens. There are a couple of national chaplain organizations in this country. There's a national education for ministers where they kind of place people in crisis settings and have a kind of a standardized curriculum. So those groups have like their definitions, their standards or doctrine. And they talk about competencies for chaplains, like what are chaplains able to do. And also they talk about in educational dimensions, what are the learning outcomes. So like for us here, one way to think about what Paul and Gil put in practice language, if I was to put that in education language, there are certain learning outcomes that we're headed towards in this training and the curriculum is designed accordingly. And our pedagogy, our methodology, there's several aspects to it. One is it's contemplative. Two is it's based on experiential learning and adult learning theory. What really works, I think at the heart of it is the experiential learning where, as Paul was relating, you do something, you reflect on it, think about it, feel it, let it settle, whatever word you want to use, and then you do it again. And when you do it again, you're informed by the last time you did it as well as the reflection. So some of the learning comes from just doing it like, oh, I did this once, I'm going to do it again. So now I know what it feels like to hop on one foot up a step, you know. But the integration is more like, what was that like? What happened? The next time I think I'll angle my foot slightly differently or I'll, you know, it was great, but there's a little bit more I could do. Or just what was it like, like, yeah, I made it up a step. So that's why we have the reading and the writing and the small group discussions and the buddies in the small groups. And this is all method, if you will, to get towards an educational view of this, just the learning outcomes. On the course website, you saw a short list. What you have in front of you is the long list. And I'm not going to go into this in great detail right now except to say a few things about it. But I'm going to give you a minute just to read it. And I already see one typo inside the circles. So I'll take care of that missing. That L got bumped over to the second line. I think they might have ended over there. So right next to you. And you might even see which ones as you're reading through get you a little excited or take your breath away or make you think, oh, oh, right. Well, what have I got myself into? Another minute. So the first section is the most Buddhist. So if you were at a Presbyterian chaplaincy training, perhaps three of these categories would be the same. But it's the Buddhist one that's, I think, distinct for each of us as individuals as well as a collective. I'm imagining there's some language in here that's not familiar with you for you. There is some definitely spiritual care of ministry lexicon inside of this. So maybe we can popcorn out what some of these phrases are or words that you haven't really put together before. So we can just get an idea of what what phrases and words here seem new to you for whatever reason. And I won't. I'm not going to say why, but just just the popcorn. If you could grab a microphone. And how about if when you take the microphone, you also tell us your name so we can begin to learn besides staring at your name. So. Thank you. I said I was going first because there's one that really puzzles and pleases me articulate their dormology of care. This is like within the pantheon of Dharma, which basket is yours? We're like, what's your go to Dharma? And it's unique for everybody, if not similar to. And I'm Kristin. I forgot to say my name. Kristin. Who's next? Thanks, Conrad. Great. It's called psychic volunteering. Just tell us which phrase speaks to your curiosity. Explain three to five Buddhist teachings relevant to spiritual care. And I'm kind of curious, like, is it just sutas like you have to know, you'll recite like the Maja Menakaia, like stories from there or start to finish. Yeah. Or is it more like, oh, this teacher had a story that really spoke to you and like is a reflection of practice. It could be. It could be. Awakening. What's awakening got to do with caring for people? Could be something really broad. So we'll see. Yeah. We should just give this as a test at the end of the year. What do you think, guys? Answer these. Give an example for each. Can I ask a microphone to somebody else? We've all here. Thank you. Asia and conclude spiritual care relationships. Goodbye. It's over. How do I transition from being in some ways a caregiver or a chaplain to you to Dharma sisters? You know, like at the end of the year, for example, like I kind of make a formal statement at the end of the year, like, OK, I'm done teaching this course. If I see you in the world, let's just be, you know, Dharma friends. Or if you want to be mentored by me, let's contract and be formal about that. But what do you say when somebody says, can I have your phone number? I loved our connection and would like to talk about more about Buddhism with you. Like, do you don't you? Yeah. Great. Thank you. There's a song that goes with this from Kenny Loggins. I think it was the gambler. You got no window. Hold them. No window. Fold them. No window. Walk away. No window. Run. So like, how do you get in and then how do you get out to? Yeah. Sri, what jumps out at you? Well, what jumped out of this, actually what Kristin asked before, articulate that the homology of care, I had no clue what that meant. So but anyway, you already answered that. So it said we'll we'll talk about it. Right. So the other thing is demonstrative working knowledge of multiple religious beliefs that kind of jumped out. So because I honestly don't know too much about other religions. I know a little bit, but not enough to kind of provide proper context. Right. And where you serve or volunteer, you will pretty quickly figure out what is the dominant, what are the dominant religious or spiritual cultures. So like I worked at Kaiser in South San Francisco. So the staff and the clientele, the patients were primarily Filipino. So then I had to learn about Filipino Roman Catholicism as well as urban Filipino, Roman Catholicism and rural Filipino, Roman Catholicism, which are very different, particularly when it comes to making medical decisions. So it's that kind of, you know, or like what are the churches in the area that people may be going to that I should just at least go by and say hello and go to one of their services, you know, or, you know, what are the holidays? What's that holiday? You know, maybe go participate in it just in case someday you never know somebody. Somebody might say I'm a pagan and you might think, oh, good, I'm glad I went to a solstice ceremony on the beach last winter on December 21st. Yeah. Thank you. Sure. One thing I want to point out is that there's both an inner and an outer around Chaplain learning. And I think we have a good emphasis in this training on the inner learning, you know, like, because you could imagine that as a chaplain, as a companion, you don't have a lot of tools besides yourself, like you are the one in some ways. And then so to know who you are, you know, your strengths, your gifts, your shortcomings, your bad habits, you know, it's good to know those and then kind of intervene on them, you know, push some forward and hold some back, you know, or to the extent that you know what it's like to go through a crisis and what your go to is, then you can campaign to others through their crisis and kind of work the field between you. Does that make sense? Yeah. There'll be times this year when people have sometimes ask, well, what about when this happens and what about when that happens? And as an educator, I usually sidestep that because it's a little too specific for the other people in the room as well as who's to say, you know, you get 10 people together. But where the question comes from is important thing to pay attention to. I'll give you an example just for me like so I was going down a flight of steps with a rail on the side carpeted in the morning, really happy in Ohio with my family and I slept and my whole weight and I broke two bones. And the hardest part of this for me, aside from the massive pain when it happened, they say it's worse than childbirth. Oh my God. The biggest practice point for me has been being really mad at myself for doing it in the first place. Just like Jennifer, how hard is it just to keep your feet on the stairs? Why didn't I drop the glass so I could catch myself? I kind of like fell and was still holding a glass like, you know, like just there was a scene in Casablanca at the end of the opening restaurant bar scene where Humphrey Bogart's leaning on the piano and says to Louis Armstrong, the piano player, he says, of all the bars and all the cities and all the countries in the world, why did you have to walk into mine? This is like a famous line from Casablanca. I was like, of all the steps, of all the days, of all the locations, you know, like so, you know, that's my inner process around a crisis, you know, like that my own kind of lack of self-compassion is a pattern. It's not new. And I've had to really sit with it. And one of the most helpful things that somebody said to me was the doctor when I said, I can't believe I did this, you know, like, I couldn't even look at the x-ray. My husband looked at the x-ray and went, wow. And I was like, I don't want that. You know, I'm like this. And the doctor said to me, we all have accidents all the time. And once in a while, one of them is really serious. And this was like a little magic, spiritual care perspective. You know, this is somebody that sees this every day. That's a really good point. You know, this is just one out of a million, you know, very consequential, but just one out of a million. So that's the kind of inner and outer that chaplains traverse. Yeah. And so part of really a big kind of thing to get used to if you haven't cared for people a lot in the past is that as the chaplain, gosh, I usually do this, I demonstrate this standing up, but I'm going to do it on one leg. I need a volunteer to help me. You want to help me, Gil, since you're nearby. So as the chaplain, metaphorically, I found the chaplain and you're the patient, right? Thank you. Chaplain, recipient, me, you, there's a space between us, the relationship, as well as the individuals. So as a chaplain, I'm tracking you, I'm tracking me, I'm tracking the space between us and I'm tracking the context. Does that make sense? So you can see how these, thank you, that's great. You can see how there's a lot to kind of take into consideration. And that's why I think these four circles are really helpful. Because like, when is it me inside? When is it the space between? When is it them? When is it like the larger context? Yeah. So we'll work with that. When there's even a little diagram that'll be on the course website, I forget the title of it. I think it's the structure of a care relationship. Yeah. So that's something to really think about if you have that in your life already through your experience, and you may in terms of raising children or being in a relationship or your role in your Sangha. But it's really kind of the setting, the context, yeah, to really think about, take to heart. And as for an example, my husband, I'm amazed at how much it doesn't occur to him to care for other people. There may be innate care that you mentioned earlier, Paul, but I'm like, really, it just didn't occur to you to like, you know, he's a software engineer, like, you know, the little thing in the sink breaks and he's all too happy to run around into the garage or the hardware store, you know, like, you know, he's a fixture, you know. And we're trying to be and say, wow, that was so nice that you offered them this or you talk to them or, you know, you're so generous. And I'm like, I guess some people are wired for this and other people aren't, you know, and so also in this training, you'll find out like, how much am I wired? Or maybe in my life right now, only so far, you know, like, it just amazes me. It just doesn't occur to him. I'm like, really, you just can't say to somebody, can I get you something when I get up? However, he's so even keeled. He's such an engineer that like you imagine what's like to take care of me the last, you know, four weeks. He's completely non plus by it. People say, does your husband have a direct practice? I say, no, he doesn't need one. It's just even keeled. So just but just not like a caregiver. It's so interesting. So that's a little bit about kind of the learning, the pedagogy, the fully by July, you can look at the sheet and have a different understanding of it. You know, you can see, oh, I really got into this. I didn't get so much into that, you know, and that's a curiosity for us. When say, Paula was saying, we learn to with you. Some of you may come to a matter session and you're talking about identity and I might want to take vows or people are looking at me like a Buddhist, but I don't even know. And others of you were like, that's really clear. And, you know, I just didn't know what to do when this person asked me if God was punishing them for their crisis in their crisis, you know, like so those of you may be really focused on. I don't I don't know whether to serve in prisons or in the streets, you know, like what's the best use of my gifts, you know. So we'll support you with whichever one of these is really a lie for you and it could change. It could happen all at the same time. We'll see. But it's as I said to many of you in the interviews, we support all all learning and you tell us what you figure out what really is the heart of it for you probably after the first few months. Does that make sense? OK, great. A little bit my story as a chaplain, I'm sure you're curious and killing each poly said a little bit about themselves and their practice. I trace the roots of what I call my ministry pretty much back to being a girl scout in the 70s where I experienced community. A community of women, a community of service, a community of learning and I still have my sash, which is full of badges, you know. And a little while back when I was studying the precepts and considering taking the Bodhisattva vow and the Zen tradition, I looked up, I started thinking about the girl scouts and the girls actually have something they call the Girl Scout Promise. And that promise is to love and serve God and to be a good to be a good person and serve your community. And I was like, wow, I was really young. I was seven or eight when I kind of started. So that's how far back I kind of trace. How did I get here? It's been a zigzag the whole way. Don't get me wrong. But it goes that far back for me. And my mother tells a story about I have a younger sister that I actually helped toilet train my sister. So I guess I was doing service work from a very, very young age, helping others. I don't think my mom initiated that. I just think I was in some ways born to it. And for me, I didn't know much about chaplaincy, but when I heard the word, I got kind of really excited. And then not too much later, I entered a hospital that offered kind of a standardized chaplain education program. And I had no idea what I was getting into. Like I can't bawl into the deep end of the pool and came up smiling like, we this is great. And I've been at it ever since. And I'm very passionate about the work of chaplains at this stage. I'm committed and fully engaged in the education of chaplains. So you as a group, this training, you as individuals are a jewel in my practice and my life too. Like this is my, you know, I'm going to be on my deathbed going. That was a really wonderful thing. That was one of the best things besides finding practice and love and, you know, all the privilege I've had. Wow. That teaching that course was just a blast. So just know that I'm not here begrudgingly because I, but I'm like almost overenthusiastic, you'll see. And I'm from New Jersey. So if you've seen the Sopranos, those are my people. So I'm very bold and direct. I don't mind talking when somebody else is talking, but I've noticed here in California, people do not like that. So most of the time I keep my mouth shut. I get into a little bit of trouble because I get aggressive or I'm powerful or I say things like in pretty straightforward fashions, you know, like when you're talking about our stance around diversity, Paul, you know, I thought to myself, yeah, and then there's the day I'm just going to say, as a chaplain, you got to be able to be offended. So I can get a little reductionist and straightforward to just, and I state my opinions really like in a declarative fashion, but please know that from my heart, I welcome the same in you. And my bark is worse than my bite. But I've just learned over the years, just tell people like, you know, I come from such loud, bold, like sassy. We swear like sailors, you know, like just so I was back with family when this happened. And they came in and told me that my ankle was like broken. I was hoping it was a sprain or whatever. And I'm like lying in this thing with like some sort of painkiller. I forget what the nurse practitioner comes in. And he told me I went like this up to the ceiling, you know, and I've been having some conversations with my father for a few weeks, and he was like, I'm not going to do anything about being a chaplain, about this training, about my path, you know, what am I renouncing around work at this stage in my life? So he was like, so who are you giving the finger to? You know, like, let's have a theological discussion about that moment. What was that, Jennifer? You know, and I said, I think that's the Jersey girl who's just like, you know, they're like, it's broken in two places. I'm a little, but I'm the most mellow one in my family, too. And if you need verification on that, when you meet my husband someday, he can tell you, yep, they're all a little brighter, a little louder than Jennifer. And in terms of practicing as a chaplain, what's really important to me and what I hope to bring to you and is hopefully of use to you is, I know that it's a process to become a chaplain. It's not an event. So I commit to supporting you in your journey. Do you know what I mean? And wherever you go, yay. But it's a process of what's called discernment often in ministry circles. You may not have heard this word before. And so now sometimes when I don't know what I want for dinner, my husband will say, are you in discernment about what you want for dinner? So he likes to joke me because he's never heard this word till he showed up, you know, talking to me. So you're all in discernment in my mind, maybe not in yours, you know. And it's an outer and inner, just like the care is outer and inner, the discernment, the learning is a dialectic between the two, which is why you really need each other in this training. You need your buddy, you need your small group. You need to come to the mentor interviews. You need to learn. Yeah. And of all the chaplains I've known in different contexts, my experience personally is in health care, is that one's own spiritual practice is the number one resource for doing the work. We each need an aquifer to fill the well that we can draw from. And the people I've known, or the times that I've struggled the most myself too, is when my spiritual practice was dim or low, or the volume was down. So sometimes when things get hairy, we think I got to drop something, but it's actually, that's the number one thing. And that's also why there's prerequisites for joining this training, that you each already have an aquifer to draw from in terms of the Dharma. You each already have quite a bit of what I would call spiritual formation that's already in the works. And we're going to continue to cultivate that alongside you. And we're not distinguishing between the brahavihara's and the paramitas and the eightfold path. And we're not teaching the foundational doctrine, if you will. And the best chaplains, what was it? Let me think for a second. The best chaplains are the people who study themselves more than study other people, I would say. It's fascinating to think about what is the experience of those people in that kind of crisis. And I see this a lot in healthcare. People get really fascinated around, for example, end of life care, impalative care. It's fascinating, but actually studying the self, knowing yourself is the best way to become a good chaplain, to really study yourself. More so than studying those people over there who are having trouble. They'll always be there. They will always be there. So when I first trained as a chaplain, I was in a Catholic hospital, and I couldn't even tell you that I was a Buddhist. And I had a yoga practice. I was ordained an interfaith minister that year. I had a new dog. I moved to San Francisco. And I thought the Roman Catholic Church was, I had an impression of the Roman Catholic Church that as it turns out was really inaccurate. And so I learned a lot that year. So I wish you all the same in some form or another. I think that's it as my introduction to the work of chaplains. Chaplains serve in lots of contexts, are not always called chaplains, but the competencies are what I really want to impress on you today. And a little bit what the developmental path is like. Because again, like I've said, I think most of you in the interview, after this first class, you might think, oops, wrong room, wrong time. I've got too much else going on. So we welcome your discernment even after today to think, no, this is not the right place. So again, we want to paint out for you what's entailed so you can know with confidence that this is the right room and the right people for you. Which is what my life, what's my guiding star would be like, I'm always looking for the right room and the right people. I don't hardly care what we're doing together, but the right room and the right people is everything to me as a highly relational, highly socialized introvert. Questions, comments, impressions? What's it like to hear me talk about this? What's it like to look at this sheet? Just shout a word and I'll shout it into the microphone or whisper into the microphone. Grounding. Refreshing. Honest. Boring? No, okay. Purposeful. Relatable. Intimate. Daunting. A little daunting. Good. It's always daunting to go from the deck into the pool. That either end, the shallow or the deep. I'm about to be wet and weightless. It's a little daunting. I'm a big swimmer, by the way, so lots of water analogies and a water sign. Okay, so what else? One more word. What's it like to be together and look at this? Heartening. Heartening. Cool. Okay, okay. And the last thing I'll say is it's really nice to be teaching this to you again with Gail and Paul. My brother's in mischief. We entered this with reckless abandon and now it's purposeful abandon and it's a delight. Thanks everybody. Have any of you ever been a recipient of Chaplain's Seek here? Would you like to say a few words about what that was like for you? Where the microphone is. Yeah, I think this is a story which I think might have shared with Jennifer during the interview, but. So the story goes back 10 years ago where I was an avid biker. I used to bike with a nonprofit group for 100-mile bike rides and so on. So I was feeling very good about myself and this is July 2012 where I was mentoring a bunch of other bikers to do their 100-mile bike ride. Got up on the top of this, up to Skyline Boulevard, riding all the way top up. Going up is always easy for me because I can't go fast anyway, right? So coming down, I think I was a little bit not aware of my own body, how I was feeling because we had just come back from a European trip and I was a little bit jet lagged. Coming down the King's Mountain Road at full speed, like 25 miles per hour, and for Jennifer's split second, I misjudged the turn. The next thing I know is I woke up in an ambulance, so basically I crashed. And luckily for my fortune, I was fortunate that my bikers sensed there was something really wrong, so they called emergency care and I ended up in ICU for the next three days. And for, it's a long recovery, but when I was in the ICU, there was one gentleman who came and, you know, he came and just provided, I didn't know who he was, but he started talking to me, and more than anything else, he was present for me. So, and he said a few things about, in a very compassionate way, and I don't know what happened, but my, all my things which were bottled up emotions just kind of floodgates opened. I started crying, and I couldn't control myself, and he said, okay, be compassionate to yourself, it's not your fault. Everything is, you know, the accident is not on purpose you did this, but it happened by accident. So he said some things, a few words here and there, but just gave me so much comfort, and it stuck with me for the rest of my life. I mean, I cannot imagine how relieved I was that day because, you know, I had all the guilty feelings that, okay, I did, you know, completely irrational, completely, you know, how could I be so unaware of the things, you know, I have two kids, I had to take care of it, now I'm putting my family through a rough time. All the emotions came out, so, but he gave me, you know, these things happen, just go with it, it'll be better. So, and that's, that's when I think one of the motivations was, okay, if I could do something like what he did to me, that'll be wonderful for me. So, yeah. Thank you. Another hand over here. So, is there someone else? Well, I used to work with chaplains as a nurse, but then also when my father was dying and when my mom was sick. We had chaplains that were just wonderful and I think because I already had experience with death and dying, it was maybe not as impactful or special for me, maybe I mean it was, it was wonderful, but for my brother and sister, it was really, really great and not so much the religious aspect of it, but helping all of us, well, cope with, I mean, both of their illnesses were very, very different, but both were on hospice at the end. And, and they, my father was unconscious, so it was different, you know, but that was hard for my brother and sister to be with my father, or they, or either that or they didn't also parts of them thought there's no point in being with him because he's unconscious. But I think the chaplain really helped all of us with that and helped us spend time with him at the end and find meaning in that and helped us a lot. And then with my mom, it was really helpful because she had been religious her whole life, both of them are very religious. And then after my father died, she was really, really angry and not able to feel her feelings and just was really pissed off that dad had gone before her. And so she just rejected her whole faith and was really mad at God and so the chaplain was really helpful with that. And we chaplain who was Catholic, because that's what she was, and he really helped her. And then I just want to say when you mentioned, you know, they're not always called chaplains. And we had this amazing caregiver for my mom. Her name was Gracie and she was very religious. In fact, she has a, she's just getting her master's in Christian counseling now. And she was the fourth caregiver because my mom was a tough case. She chased the other ones away. But Gracie was just a saint really so patient and she was literally her, you know, caregiver like taking her to the bathroom and doing her bandages and wrapping her and just living 24 seven in the house and I know it wasn't easy because I know my mom and I was there for a lot of it. So, but that she really brought my mom, she was the one who really brought my mom back to her faith. And it was beautiful. You know, they prayed together and sang together. Fantastic. If I remember the beginning when your first words, you were a little bit diminishing your example, compared to Sri. And it's true that his was exciting bicycle, not many people, not that many people have accidents on bicycles and end up being here, you know, so that was exciting. Yours was ordinary. It was like, you know, if you're lucky, you know, something we were there, all of us are there when our mother are dying or our parents are dying and it's like ordinary kind of thing. But it's ordinary but so profound what it touches in us and to have a chaplain show up at that kind of time. And that sounded like very, very meaningful in this ordinary event. Thank you. So one more I have over here. Three people. Yes, Sage. So I was able to work with the chaplain while I was at Stanford. I had been admitted there for like, mental health related reasons, and I asked to see the chaplain because, you know, the nurses kept coming in and like trying to give me skills and like, you're missing the point, like, this is about skills like you have to like want to live to use the skills. And the chaplain came in and told her like, I'm not like, particularly religious. I just wanted to like talk to someone. And I just started talking to her about what I had been through and like how long I had been in treatment, and how difficult it had been. And she asked me about a spiritual practice and I was like, No, no, like I had been Catholic way back in the day. I like been doing meditation for a long time. And she just talked me through like, yeah, kind of creating your own like reason for living that's like nested within spirituality and like, we talked about like what kind of values like an all the cart spirituality would have and like, and she just sat there and prayed for me and I think it was a transformative experience. I think it's one of the more important reasons why I'm here, both here in this building and live. So just in case I wasn't clear. Thank you very much. And I have a chaplaincy experience from this year. When my mom went into hospice. There was a hospice chaplain that came to see her. And then the hopeless chaplain sat with me a little bit and said one thing that was really helpful for me and right up until the time she died, she said, helpful thing she said. And it turns out that that chaplain went through this program. So it kind of came full circle, right? We trained you and you come in, you might care for us someday. So that's a kind of a very profound this world of chaplaincy and it's a profound the issues, the life and death issues, the existential issues, the connection between us issues are so rich and so deep and so meaningful. Jennifer talked about the necessity for chaplains having a deep aqua for her. Having a deep resource, some reference point that can hold all this and hold the crisis, the challenges, the depth of it all. Not only for the chaplain's sake, but also for that's how people will know that you're a safe person to be with in their crisis. That you're comfortable, you're open, that you're not in a sense not seeing it as a crisis, you're seeing it as one more place where you can demonstrate. And I can't, I don't have the adequate words so you have to do better than me. But demonstrate an ease or a peacefulness or a certain kind of like willingness to be present without being anxious or angry or distressed or conceited around what's going on. And so people pick up the ease, they pick up this alternative way of being that sometimes no one else in their life has demonstrated. Everyone else is just to demonstrate an alarm and upset and angry and you have to find someone to blame or shame or all kinds of things. But someone who shows a whole different way of being because they have that resource, they have that aqua for, they have that reference point for a certain way of being at peace. And even if what is going on shouldn't be, even if what's going on is something that maybe we should change. But still there's this peace that holds it in a bigger context. So what Jennifer talked about this aquifer, I also sometimes also like to think of it as a capacity. Maybe the capacity of the aquifer can be really big. And one of the things we're doing in Buddhist practice is training ourselves, developing ourselves to increase our capacity for being with difficulty. Increasing our capacity to be uncomfortable. So that even if it's very uncomfortable and difficult, that our capacity is so large that it doesn't trigger some of the unfortunate reactions of anger or greed or all the different kinds of conceit that can happen, shame that can happen. And somehow our capacity is to be with discomfort. And some of the discomfort is some of the greatest and biggest things that you might encounter in life. And the injustice that you might encounter in the role of the chaplain, it might be some of the most horrendous injustices. And maybe if you're in the R room, the injustice of what's there might not be what the chaplain is going to actively engage in. Because that's not what's needed for the person who's laying there dying. So how does the chaplain have the capacity to see what's going on and hold it all in some bigger perspective and view to be of serviced and offer some new way of being, a new understanding, a new doorway into a fuller life, a more peaceful life, a resolved life, a life that somehow then maybe dies, if in the ER, dies with something resolved. Something settled. And the issues like, for example, of injustice, maybe that's not the name of the game at that moment. So how do we keep opening and opening and opening? And how do we hold it all? That's all the things that are uncomfortable, all the things maybe that shouldn't be. So it takes a lot. And I would like to think that Buddhist practice or spiritual practice is really, really important for this. There's now a humanistic chaplains who are, there's atheist chaplains. And so we don't have to limit ourselves exactly to Buddhism or to religion. There's other ways of developing this capacity that can hold it all. But this is a Buddhist training, so we use that as a reference point. So the question for you is what, how do you, how do you see that your Buddhist practice or your spiritual practice, if you have another one that's maybe also important here, or your personal practice, whatever that is, maybe you don't call it spiritual even, but what are the practices that you have that are capacity building, that are aquifer building? What are the capacities, what are the practices you have that will, you see as supporting you in doing chaplaincy? That are supporting you to expand your capacity to be with the kind of range of things they're going to encounter, potentially in chaplaincy. How do you replenish, how does Buddhist practice replenish the aquifer? Because it can be sometimes drained. So what's the role of Buddhist practice for you and how do you see that it will support you during this year? Do you have any thoughts about how to engage with it more during this year so that it augments, it supports, it kind of feeds this program. The other thing I think Jennifer talked about was the theory of adult learning as part of this. Adult learning is the theory, I think, is that you take responsibility for your learning. And so what responsibility do you have to bring your practice to bear in this? And that's for you to decide, but we're not here to tell you what it should be. But I thought it'd be nice for you to engage in a conversation about this. Did what I say clear enough and vague enough that you can find yourself, find a way forward with that kind of topic? Is that okay? I like it, questions that are specific and vague, so you feel free to find yourself in the discussion somehow. So I thought we'd just pair up and have that conversation with another person. And maybe since you bunched up before with someone near you, maybe you should walk across the room to find someone to pair up with. And then it will take about 20 minutes for this as well. And maybe it could be like, you can either be, you can decide between the two of you. Do you spend 10 minutes each of you kind of talking about how it is for you with the other person kind of being your support for that? Is it questions for clarification? So you're actively listening and maybe supporting the conversation. Or decide whether it's more like back and forth. But if it's back and forth, be careful that everyone should be careful in a discussion that you have kind of more or less the equal amount of time. And so kind of don't say a lot all at once. Just make one or two points so the ping pong ball can go over to the next person, the second one, and go back and forth more. I think then it builds the conversation. So you decide whether it's more monologue or more ping pong. Is that okay? So if you could just find a partner and go where you'd like. I saw that everyone went outside before. In the cabinet just outside this big door here in the other hall, there's folding chairs. And if you want to take those folding chairs outside, like in the parking lot, you're very welcome to take them out there. So please. So I would like to hear some comments about what it was like to have that discussion. Was there any informative, inspiring, educational? Did it point to areas of growth? Yes. And so if you could use the mic, please. I had a nice talk with my cohort. I thought it was very interesting in that we have a lot of cool things in common, things we've shared kind of on the path here, but have some interesting differences. For example, he had a really interesting practice of naming three things he's grateful for every day in the morning. It doesn't have to be a big thing, even the small things. But I think that's little pearls like that. I think that I learned and I think I can put to use myself. So one of the benefits of having these discussions is that it's always something to learn from the other people here. Great. Thank you. I'm Clarence. Yeah, I let my well, my partner went first and it was really interesting because I had something different. That was coming to mind that fills my aquifer. And then when he shared, I was like, oh, that also fills my aquifer. So we connected on that a lot, which is really nice. Thank you. Thank you. We're checking in about how the conversation went. It's Kay. And yeah, something from our conversation that was interesting. There's the larger ways that we maybe tap into a deep aquifer or fill that aquifer for ourselves. And then there's the smaller ways in the moment of just maybe reminding ourselves, like, oh, right, that's that is here. You know, those little moments of pausing or, yeah, touching into the body or whatever it is that that are these like well drilling moments that bring us back and remind us of that capacity. And that's particularly useful on the spot to do in chaplaincy. Well, the, I hope I would, one of the, some of the things we managed to do this morning is to lay down the kind of foundational learning areas that you'll be engaged in this during this year. Some of that, which we hope that you'll engage in, you know, take some responsibility, learn and develop. And that keep the chart that Jennifer gave you and refer back to it and see what, how you're, how this is going in these different areas and how you're learning. And that you have now from this beginning a clear, hopefully a clear sense of the importance of being connected to your Buddhist practice. Because the interface of your Buddhist practice and this area of developing, becoming a chaplain or learning about chaplaincy, that's where it's going to make most rich in terms of what's called spiritual formation. That this is not just a, you're going to learn a few techniques, learn some information about chaplaincy, that you will be, you'll grow here, you'll be transformed to some degree during this year. And that trends, kind of the, I don't know what, you know, do I know if I call this leavening for that transformation as your Buddhist practice? Or maybe that's the dough and what we, chaplaincy is leavening or I don't know how it works, but they work together. The spiritual practice is a really important component of this inner growth, inner development that we hope you'll go through this year. And that you try to, you know, both in terms of your practice of Buddhism, but if the teachings of Buddhism are important for you, that you're also reflecting on how they fit in or don't fit into chaplaincy and what we're teaching here. And so that you inhabit the Buddhist teachings, Buddhist practice, Buddhist, even your practice community, if you have one, with some of the sensibilities and understandings and dispositions that we're developing here is in chaplaincy training. So to really bring them together. So we have a few more minutes. If you could take out a pencil and paper or write on the paper I gave out earlier, or if you are like electronically, you can just open up a document too if you want to type. I thought we could do a little bit of writing to kind of let some of this content soak in. So I'm going to ask you some, give you some prompts for some reflective writing. And this writing will not be shown to anybody else. So your writing might include illegible handwriting or your native tongue or drawings or whatever kind of creative expression comes to you. So given all that's come so far, if you could write for a few minutes to yourself and answer the question, what has touched me this morning? What has touched me? Or what has struck me? Or what has opened my heart? What has struck me this morning? And you might include why something touched you or stood out to you or opened your heart. What is it about what's happened or what was said? Second question if you're ready. One thing I'd like to remember or pay more attention to is, And why. One thing I'd like to remember or pay more attention to. One thing I'd like to remember or pay more attention to. And lastly, What's the question that if I had the answer would set me free? What's the one question that if I had the answer to would set me free? Or make me happy. Or allow me to die in peace. But since we're Buddhists, we'll go with what question if I had the answer to would set me free. So. So. So. And then in a minute we'll bring this to a close. Pencils down. And then I'd like for you to imagine for a moment. What would it be like to take what you've just written and show it to the person next to you? We're not going to do that, but just what arises for you at the thought of somebody else reading what you wrote. And also imagine what it'd be like if the person next to you gave you their writing to read. What would that be like? The person next to you answered these questions and then wrote them down and then gives them to you to read. What would that be like? And then even beyond that, imagine talking about what they wrote with them. What would you talk about? We're not going to do that right now. We don't want to strain any muscles this first morning, but. The questions I asked you one are chaplain questions. And you're going to learn a lot of really good chaplain questions this year. So you might want to start a little index on. People always say ask open ended questions, you know, but what is an open ended question? Or what kind of questions prompt people into reflection as compared to sharing information? And so what you've done in this writing is what I would call reflective writing. And some of your writing assignments are going to be this kind of writing, you know, reflective writing. And you're going to be giving your reflective writing to somebody else to read. What's that going to be like? This kind of writing, you know. And you'll be reading somebody else's reflective writing. So this is a little introduction, a little taste of kind of where we're going to get to around learning through writing. And also how does it will open you up to what's happening for somebody else and then how to respond. And some of you are probably accustomed to writing about your thoughts and feelings and maybe a journal practice and others would probably rather scrub a sink than write about your thoughts and feelings. So between the two we'll all place ourselves in varying spots over time. There's no wrong answers to any of the questions for today and there's no in the writing assignments and stuff that follows. It's not that there's something wrong. It's just how deep can I go and how clear can I be and what's it like to articulate it even to myself by seeing something in writing. It's really quite stunning. Yeah. I noticed that in doing the box exercise when things I think about myself but just write it on a little piece of paper was just turns the volume up. So thank you for doing that little extra reflective writing exercise with me. We will be teaching you more about how to do this kind of writing if you're not familiar with it. So if this was a real stretch for you, don't panic. We're going to support you in cultivating that. OK. Great. So thank you. And now we're going to hit the pause button for lunch. So there's a few ways we do lunch here. The aforementioned chairs in the cabinet and then the other longer cabinet with a door open right now. One has chairs and one has tables and we can bring the chairs and tables out to the driveway and sit and eat together, which is kind of nice. Or you might want to just take off for an hour and be by yourself. That way is El Camino Real, a major street with eateries along it. I imagine you have a device to get you somewhere. There is a Whole Foods market about a mile and a half down the road. And I've noticed over the years that by like September, people are pretty shy the first day around food sharing. But like by November, I'll be like, who's going to Whole Foods in my car with me right now? And then there might be a Whole Foods carpool and pick me up a beverage, that kind of thing. Just enjoying some, you know, song of time together. When we come back, we're going to have a very dry and hopefully clear cut journey through the components of the program. And then after that, we're going to spend some time doing an exercise on what it's like to meet another in a particular way. There are two microwaves in the kitchen. There are utensils and plates. It's a self-cleaning system. Would I forget anything? Master of the property. Yeah, I think I've, you know, all of us feel some responsibility for caring for the building. So if near the end of the lunch break, if it looks like the kitchen has gotten a little bit untidy, you might want to consider just helping tidy it up some. And then if you want to go someplace with someone here or by yourself that's like a little park bench kind of thing to sit on, if you go up two blocks up Hopkins, you know, El Camino's that way, Hopkins is that way, there's a little triangular park, teeny one. It's kind of like where the traffic has to go around. But in that park, there's one or two benches and you sit under the oak tree there and kind of a little bit away from the drama of IMC. So I hope you enjoy your lunch and. Is that going to happen? Yeah. Anybody going to Whole Foods? 145. Anybody going to Whole Foods for guest food for lunch? Is everybody bringing their own lunch? Okay.
