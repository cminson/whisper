 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. At the beginning of a sitting, it can be useful just to first simply check in. How are you in this moment in a simple way, just kind of acknowledging that you're here in this room, in this space, the space that you're in. And just simply recognizing, not with words, but kind of as a felt sense, feeling into how are you right now. To me, it kind of feels like a gathering or a collecting a little bit, just a remembering of this mind and body work together. And allowing the mind to remember the body that it's connected with. And then perhaps exploring a little bit of relaxation. Relaxation is such a helpful support for this natural capacity that our minds have to be aware. So if we can connect with relaxation, first of all, the relaxation will support our ability to be aware, but also connecting with relaxation is cultivating mindfulness and awareness. And so maybe you can explore with the body, perhaps areas of tension that might be able to be released or relaxed. Maybe the head, the face, the neck, softening those areas. Relaxing the shoulders, the arms, the hands. Maybe the chest and upper back can soften and relax. As I explore that area, relaxing that area, all those muscles around the rib cage, sometimes I find very naturally a breath comes a little more fully, a little more deeply. And that also can support a softening and a release of those muscles, the stretching of the muscles on the in breath and the softening, the relaxation of those muscles on the out breath. And continuing an exploration of relaxation, the stomach, the abdomen. Maybe just as I name those areas, you might notice with the attention, sometimes simply with the attention to those areas, to any area, sometimes the noticing of those areas can lead to a natural relaxation sometimes. So maybe the stomach and abdomen can relax. Maybe the middle and lower back can relax the hips, the legs, the feet. And perhaps there can be also a relaxation more internally inside the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart, the area around the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and intestines can relax. This relaxation of body can help and support the mind to relax. Mental tension is often felt or expressed as worries, concerns, thoughts, thinking about the past or the future, or even thinking about the present. So maybe there can be a relaxation of the thinking, maybe the mind can soften and relax. Having explored relaxation, taking in now, how are you? What is the feeling of your experience now? Awareness of how you are, the feeling of how you are. You don't have to name it or identify it with any words, just connecting, feeling into this body and this mind. Receiving just whatever is available to be easily noticed. That's often our physical body and the experience of hearing. Just exploring, relax and receive. Maybe simple body sensations like the contact of your body, where it's sitting. Touch points of hands or feet. Maybe just something about how the inner landscape of your body feels. Perhaps the breath. Sounds coming and going, the sound of my voice. What is obvious, where the attention lands, may shift, move from one thing to another. That's okay. Can there be a sense of maybe following the attention, not trying to direct it or control it? For a moment there's an experience of hearing and then the attention shifts to body. Seeing if there can be some ease with this shifting of attention. Shifting of attention doesn't mean the mind is wandering necessarily when we can know. Be aware of it. And sometimes the attention will land with something for a little while. Maybe the breath or the experience of hearing, if there's a sound that's kind of continuing. And that's okay too. Being curious about what is received may also be thoughts or moods, emotions. Can those also be received flowing with the attention, perhaps shifting from one experience to another? Cultivating the capacity which we have, a natural capacity of mindfulness to receive and connect with. Whatever is happening in this moment without trying to choose or direct, aim the attention, settling back, relax and receive. And occasionally recognizing perhaps something in our mind that is in relationship to what's being received. Sometimes we like what's happening, sometimes we don't like it, we have ideas or opinions about it. We resist it. Want to hold on to it. And so with what's being received, maybe recognizing is there resistance or holding or ideas about it? Just in a soft way, not trying to look for it, just opening to the possibility that we can know, recognize that relationship to what is obvious. And exploring the possibility of allowing, allowing whatever is arising to be known, including resistance, including holding if those are what are happening. What is happening is already happening. This allowing, this exploration of allowing is opening to acknowledging that's what is here, is already here. Relax, receive and allow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
