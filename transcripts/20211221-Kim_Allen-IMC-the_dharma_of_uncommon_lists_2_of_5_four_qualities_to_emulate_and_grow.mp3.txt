Okay, so this week we're doing a theme that I'm calling the Dharma of Uncommon
Lists and we started yesterday with a list of five and today we'll have a list
of four and so on. So there's a lot of good Dharma in these lists. This one
actually may not be so unfamiliar. So today's list is a set of four qualities
that are praised in lay practitioners like us and they appear together. This
set of four in several different ways. They appear as the basis of spiritual
friendship. They appear as qualities that should be emulated by people and they
also are listed as forms of inner wealth. So these four are confidence or faith,
virtue, generosity, and wisdom. So you've likely heard of each of these separately
or in other contexts but it's interesting to consider them together as a set, if
you will. So here's the quote from one of the suttas that talks about them as the
basis of spiritual friendship. So it says, and what is good friendship? It's when a
person resides in a town or village and there are householders or their children
who may be young or old but are mature in conduct, accomplished in faith, ethics,
generosity, and wisdom. That person associates with them, converses and
engages in discussion and they emulate the same kind of accomplishment in faith,
ethics, generosity, and wisdom. This is called good friendship. So we see that we
are encouraged to associate with and emulate people who have the suttas as
sada which is the quality that can be translated as faith but also confidence,
ethical conduct or virtue, generosity, and wisdom. And all together that set of four
is called conduct. It's said that these are people who are mature in conduct. So
first I'd like to just talk about each one of these and then we'll kind of put
them together. So the first one sattah, confidence or faith. I've come to like the
word faith but I didn't use to and so I can understand if that word has some
aversion for you so it's fine also to use confidence or trust. And it's
typically stated classically in the teachings as confidence in the Buddha's
awakening. That's interesting. So it's not a blind devotion to a
religious figure from the past. It's really the confidence that the Buddha was
able to find a way through the labyrinth of his mind to awaken to a place that is
free of great hatred and delusion. But more broadly, and this is also implied in
the teachings, we could say that faith or confidence is pointing toward a
sincere acknowledgement of higher possibilities, if you will. So it's kind
of the opposite of something like cynicism or sarcasm or other ways where
we diminish our own or others potential. So Gil talked last week about
self-respect, for example. And in my experience, genuine sattah, genuine
confidence is rooted in some degree of self-respect. We have a sense that we are
able to do something good, we're able to meditate, we're able to practice
mindfulness, we're able to be in the world in a way that is somehow
beneficial or at least to intend that, to move in that direction. So some suit
us say that, this is a quote, there are beings who are inspired by things that
are lofty. It's kind of nice. So we recognize, we can recognize that there
are things in the world that are lofty, that are pointing toward something
genuine. And I remember one time being on a retreat that Gil was teaching and he
said that we should feel happy about being on retreat because there are
people in the world who are inspired simply by knowing that there are people
who go on retreat. And so we are fulfilling that for them. So to have this
kind of confidence or faith, I think is a form of wealth. Like it says in the
teachings, it enriches us to have a sense of potential. So then the second
quality, ethical conduct or virtue, translates the word sila. It's fairly
straightforward. The text says, here a noble disciple abstains from the
destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from
sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, and abstains from intoxicants,
which are the basis for hubleness. So ethical conduct is the basis of
friendship. And it's a form of inner wealth because it directly protects
other beings. And it also protects us from our own difficulties and also it
protects us by bringing what's called the bliss of blamelessness. I think you
heard a lot a few weeks ago about sila when you taught for the whole week on
that. So maybe what I'll just say now is that this is a time right now, both
specifically the holiday season, but also this time in the pandemic and our
society, when we really need people who are genuinely positive forces in the
world, beneficial, not the fake positivity of denial or sugarcoating things,
but genuinely possessed of some well-being and some sense of acting
well in the world. And even just just doing our best with good intentions
can do this for us. Ethics is actually meant to be a basis for our own
well-being, which then translates out into the world. So I actually have a lot
of faith that all of us are working in that direction. So then moving on to
generosity, the word that's translated that way is actually chaga, which is
the movement of mind, the intention in the heart toward giving. You may have
heard the word dana, which is more the actual gift that's given. But chaga is
the mind state that informs that. And the text around this, the sort of
classical language is quite nice. It says, here, a noble disciple dwells at
home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, open
handed, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in
giving and sharing. It makes me happy just to read that. You know, it's so
needed at this time. When it is or even feels like a time of scarcity or
threat or a high degree of uncertainty, psychologically, the tendency is to hold
on or withdraw when actually exactly the opposite movement is what is
beneficial. So generosity, this chaga, this inner movement toward giving
helps us to give even when we feel like we don't have very much. So this is a
good season to, of course, reflect on and practice generosity when you can. And
then we go to wisdom, panya. It's interesting that this is placed alongside
the others. Sometimes people think of wisdom as far off or some high
accomplishment, but it's placed right alongside these other three. And the
texts say here, a noble disciple is wise. She possesses the wisdom that
discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to
the complete destruction of suffering. So that's interesting too. Buddhist texts
often equate wisdom with seeing impermanence and constancy. So for our
purposes now, we can point out that people who pay attention to the way, so
many things in life arise and change and pass are more likely to be able to
handle surprises or shocks when they come, people who have a sense of the
flow of life, how things come and go can stay calmer when there are large
shifts such as what we've seen recently in the world. So I think this kind of
wisdom is fairly natural when we've lived a life of awareness, we've paid
attention to things. How can you not notice that they come, they go, even the
even the body isn't constant from moment to moment and surely throughout our
lives we've seen many things arise and pass. But we can have some wisdom about
that, some groundedness, some stability for others. So now let's consider them
altogether as a set. This is a set of four. So we have confidence, virtue,
generosity and wisdom. So you can see that this encompasses both individual and
relational qualities. It has a connection to the material world as well as to the
mind. It encompasses everyday actions as well as penetrating insight that can be
quite deep. So recall that in the discourse about these four as the basis
for good friendship, they were collectively called being mature in
conduct. So there's an element of maturity in manifesting all of these. We
have to have some integration of the practice and of our understanding in
order to be able to do all of these well. And maybe that there are some, of
course, that we do better than others. Another thing about these four qualities
is that they don't decrease if we keep practicing them and they can't really be
taken away by others. They persist and they grow through all the ups and downs
of life. So even if we go through periods where we have more wealth and less
wealth, periods where we're healthy and periods where we're ill, even as we get
older and our faculties just diminish and we can see that the body is winding
down, these four qualities can be continually increasing. They don't
actually decrease. So they're worth encouraging in ourselves and others. You
can see why they're called inner wealth because they are really independent of
the external wealth that we don't have as much control over. So we can also
emulate these when we see them in others. If we see we have a friend who is very
generous, without comparing ourselves unfavorably, we could aspire to be as
free as they are in the way that they give. Or if we see someone who's very
wise and they just seem balanced. They seem able to flow along with
things. They seem clear about what they're seeing. We can consider on how
they seem to really see things well. Maybe I could emulate that also. So
we're meant to help each other in the practice. We're meant to share in this. So
maybe you're visiting with people right now at this holiday time. We often
are. I wonder if you can find one or more of these qualities in some form in
each of the people that you are visiting with right now. So even if you
have a history of a difficult relationship with someone, perhaps you can
think of one way that they express one of these qualities. Maybe they have some
degree of confidence. Confidence in what's good. Or maybe they have some kind
of virtue. Some kind of ethical conduct. You know, they're careful about not
taking what's not given. They're careful about being truthful when they speak.
Something. Maybe they have a streak of generosity in them. A way in which they
give their attention, their time, physical things. Or they have some kind of
wisdom that you see in them. A glimmer of it from time to time. So focus on that.
Focus on the goodness of that person. Maybe even emulate it. They don't have to
be perfect. Goodness knows we aren't all perfect. Or an exemplar of all four of
these qualities. It's good enough if people are showing just a glimmer of one
of them. Take that as the basis for being with them in a kind and clear way.
Or if you're by yourself at this time of year, it's good to reflect that these
four things are forms of inner wealth. And they can be grown through meditative
development, through reflection. So either way, this is a great time to be
growing these particular qualities of faith, virtue, generosity, and wisdom. I
hope this set of four may inform your day and your week and maybe carry you into
the new year. So thank you very much. See you again tomorrow.
