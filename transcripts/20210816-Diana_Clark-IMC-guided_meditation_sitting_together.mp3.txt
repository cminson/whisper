 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good evening. Good evening. Welcome, welcome. Wherever you are, and if you're here in person, live, or if you're listening to this sometime in the future, warm welcome. So we'll start with a little bit of a guided meditation. I tend not to do a lot of guidance. Just maybe dropping in some direction that we might consider. But checking in with the body, feeling connected and grounded, embodied. And feeling the pressure against the body from whatever it is you're sitting on. The chair, the cushion, the bench, the couch, whatever it might be. And then letting the attention rest on the sensations of breathing. Feeling the expansion and contraction in the chest or the abdomen. Or maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose. Nothing in particular needs to be happening. Just being with the sensations of breathing. Feeling the air going in and out of the nose. And when the mind wanders, as it's apt to do, we just very simply, gently begin again with the sensations of breathing. Feeling the air going in and out of the nose. Feeling the in-breath. And feeling the out-breath. And can we acknowledge, feel into, feel into that we're sitting together. Looking at the chat box. From Ohio, Brazil, Seattle, Chicago, here in the Bay Area. Feeling the support of sitting together with others. Even if we are all of us in our own space, still we're sharing this experience. There's a kind of delight to be connected with others while we sit. Feeling the air going in and out of the nose. Feeling the air going in and out of the nose. In some kind of way, we're connected to others who are sitting right now. But also, there are others who have made it possible for us to sit now. Whether it's in a direct way, they're watching the kids or have agreed to not disturb us for this time. Or whatever it might be. Or perhaps a little bit more indirectly. Helped us with the food on the table. The person at the grocery store. The person who helped put the fruits and vegetables. Maybe somebody helped you with your car if you drove. The oil change. The clothes you wear. Repurchased most likely somewhere. A person made them. Packaged them, sold them. Drove the truck. Taking them from place to place. Feeling this connection with others. Can we feel supported in this way? Knowing that even if we are sitting alone in a room, there are ways in which we are connected with others. If someone raises their hands. Any time you touch them, they call a to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
