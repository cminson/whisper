This will be the second  talk on the faculty  of wisdom  – 
paññā . It is part of the field of wisdom  to be motivated  to 
understand,  to be inspired,  or to have  no other  choice  
but to engag e in the practice  of becoming  free of 
suffering.  Suffering,  in one way or the other,  is the fire 
from which  practice , and the interest  in mindfulness,  
concentration,  and being  present  arises.   
 
As we begin  to practice  and are more  mindful,  a very 
important  function  of wisdom  is that we start making  
distinctions.  There  is distinguishing  wisdom.  This is not 
sophisticated  wisdom . Rather,  it arises  out of our clarity  
of mind  where  we’re able to see more  than the big, 
buzzing,  confused  events  of the moment.  We start 
seeing  clearly  the different  elements  that make  it up.

For example,  I’m sitting , practicing , or just being  – and I 
feel terrible.  I guess  it’s terrible  that I’m feeling  terrible,  
but ‘terrible’ is a vague  category.  But it points  to 
something.  As I settle,  get a little bit quieter,  and start 
paying  attention  to what’s going  on, I can start 
distinguishing  that part of this feeling  involves  physical  
experiences  – perhaps  of contraction  and tension.  
Another  part involves  certain  kinds  of thinking.  
Some times  certain  emotions  are present.  To be able to 
tease  apart  and distinguish  between  the different  
component  parts  of feeling  terrible  gives  me a handle  
on the experience.  It gives  me something  to be more 
attentive  to – and to find some  freedom  in relationship  
to feeling  terrible . 
 
It’s a little hard to even  know  what  the concept  of 
terrible  means,  where  to start,  and how to relate  to it as 
an experience.  But as the mind’s capacity  to see clearly  
develops,  we start distinguishing.  If I can see that part 
of my terribleness  is tension  in the body,  then I have  the 
opportunity  to bring  careful  attention  to that tension.  
Maybe  I notice  there’s tension  in the shoulders,  so I 
relax  my shoulders.  Then  the gestalt  of my whole  
terrible  feeling  begins  to shift and quiet  down  a little bit.  
 
Maybe  I notice  that I’m feeling  really  sad. Earlier,  I 
hadn’t really  noticed  that I was sad. But when  I really  
see, “Oh, this is sadness, ” something  releases.  “Oh  
3 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg  yes, that’s what  it is.” I’m not pulling  away  
unconsciously  from the discomfort  of the sadness.  In 
recognizing  it, I say, “Oh, more  settling  – that’s what’s 
happening. ” Then  this gestalt  that I call ‘terrible’ starts  to 
begin  to change.   
 
Perhaps  I notice  that I’m thinking  about  some  of the 
comments  you wrote  here about  background  noise.  So 
I’m having  thoughts  about  background  noise.  What  
should  I do? What should  I say?  I say, “Oh, that’s the 
thought  I have.  I’ll just explain  it.” Probably  what  you 
heard  today  was the garbage  collection  on our street.  If 
it was intermittent,  the sound  you heard  was the 
garbage  trucks.  It was quite  loud.  There  was more  
banging  of garbage  cans  today  than I’ve ever heard.  I 
don’t know  if that was the issue,  but we’ll find out. I’ll 
look into it. 
 
I see the thoughts,  and so the thoughts  quiet  down.  
Slowly , by making  distinctions,  I also start being  able to 
see that I have  some  choices.  The greater  the 
distinctions  we make  about  what’s going  on, the more  
choice s we have  about  how we relate  to our 
experiences . This idea of how we relate  to our 
experience  is also part of this distinguishing  quality  of 
wisdom.   
 
There  are always  two broad  categories  of things  
happening.  There  is what’s happening , and how we  
4 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg  relate  to that experience.  There  might  be something  
uncomfortable  happening,  and in relationship  to that 
discomfort,  there  might  be fear. There  might  be blame.  
There  might  be anger  and irritation.  There  might  be 
distress.  There  might  be judgments  and ideas  about  the 
experience.  This means  that. The experience  and the 
relationship  to it are two separate  things.  We might  not 
be able to change  the experience,  but we may have  
some  choice  with how we relate  to it, and what  we think  
and feel about  it. Maybe  we could be less judgmental.  
Maybe  we don’t have  to be so afraid,  glued  to it, 
attacking  it, or entangled  with it.  
 
There’s being  able to see an experience  – and then 
there  are ideas  about  that experience.  Some  of those  
ideas  might  be true, and some  might  be not be. But we 
see, “Here’s the experience,  and here’s my idea.  Here’s 
a person  I’m seeing,  and here are my ideas  about  that 
person.” It turns  out that this person  looks  like one of 
my eleme ntary  school  teachers  who was really  scary.  
The reason  I feel afraid  of this person  might  be because  
of the associat ion with my elementary  school  teacher.  
 
On the one hand,  there’s my whole  inner  experience  of 
association,  and there’s this person  I’m seeing . By 
making that distinction,  I have  some  choice.  I can see 
that there’s really  nothing  scary  about  this person.  I can 
choose  to look at the person  more  carefully , or I can 
look at myself  more  carefully.

In practice,  the ability  to make  distinctions  and then 
choices  is a very important  part of the wisdom  factor.  
The heart  of this distinguishing  wisdom  is to be able to 
distinguish  between  that which  is healthy  and that which  
is unhealthy.  In Buddhist  language,  it’s that which is 
skillful  or unskillful,  wholesome  or unwholesome,  helpful  
or not helpful.  With our ability  to make  distinctions , we 
become  our own teachers .  
 
I can see that my preoccupation,  judgments,  and fear 
around  the person  who looks  like my elementary  school  
teacher  is not necessarily  accurate  about  the person  I’m 
with. And it is not so healthy,  skillful,  or helpful.  Now I 
can choose  to do something  skillful.  I can be careful  
about  what  I say, about  what  I think , or how I relate  to 
my view of this person.   
 
We sit in meditation , and we start making  distinctions.  
It’s not that we’re actively  analyzing  or trying  to figure  it 
all out. But as the mind  gets quieter , we see more  
clearly  what’s here. It is a natural  functioning  of the 
mind  to be able to make  distinctions.  It will see more  
clearly,  “Oh, there’s this, and there’s that.”  
 
At some  point,  as I settle, it’s really  clear  that if I keep  
thinking  repeatedly  about  all my anger  at the fact that 
some one left a little bit of trash  on the sidewalk  outside  
of IMC, and I find myself  getting  more  and more   
6 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg  irritated,  maybe  that’s not a skillful,  helpful  train of 
thought  when  I’m meditating.  Maybe  the skillful  thing  to 
do is to acknowledge  my irritation  and concern  that 
there’s a need  to keep  the place  clean  and cared  for 
during  this shelter -at-home  time.  Now that I’ve 
acknowledged  this, maybe  the skillful  thing  to do is to 
settle  in – to feel and breathe  with the tension  that I’m 
feeling  because  of thinking  about  the trash.  So I sit 
there,  and that’s skillful.  That’s a good  thing  to do. I’m 
not denying  it. I’m not criticizing  being  this way, but I’m 
finding  a skillful,  helpful  way to be with it.  
 
It seems  like there’s a natural  capacity  for distinguishing  
wisdom  – independent  of doing  a lot of analysis  or 
thinking.  Maybe  we use this natural  capacity  
sometimes.   
 
But this wonderful  capacity  to distinguish  also relates  to 
how we do the distinguishing.  If we keep  seeing  
distinctions , and this makes  us tense  and agitated,  then 
it’s not so skillful.  Maybe  we need  to find a calmer  way 
to do it. Or wait, if this is not the time to do it. That’ll 
come  later.  Or maybe , very gently , we can find a way to 
make  distinctions  that helps us become  more  settled,  
calm,  and quiet.   
 
I’ll end with this. One possible  distinction  is to 
distinguish  between  different  ways  of thinking,  tones  of 
voice  in which  to think,  speeds  in which  to think,  or  
7 
  Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits LK_mg  images  that help us settle  if we think  a lot with images.  
So, rathe r than being  either -or with thinking,  it’s 
possible  to begin  thinking  in wiser,  more  supportive  
ways  for meditation.  We make  distinction s between  
ways  in which  we think.   
 
If we can choose  ways  that help us to be more  settled,  
more  clear,  and this clarity  helps  support  further  
distinctions,  then we’re riding  on and being  supported  
by our capacity  for wisdom.   
 
Because  distinguishing  wisdom  can seem  to be 
intellectual,  remember  that we’re talking  about  a form of 
wisdom  that really follows  on the foundation  of the body  
and being  grounded  – and on our faith,  energy,  
mindfulness,  and concentration.  So don’t be in a hurry  
to do distinguishing  wisdom.  Just use what’s available  
and what  is supportive  for you.  
 
May distinguishing  wisdom  support  you and all beings.  
Thank  you very much.
