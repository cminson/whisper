So turning on the recording. Welcome, welcome everybody.
So I think the truth is that we have this idea that life would be so much easier if there weren't so many dang, difficult people out there, right?
Sometimes we can fall into that kind of thinking, right? Okay, just there's all these people out there. They have these, they're difficult and life would be so much easier if they, if they simply weren't there.
But often, you know, one of these difficult people, you know, I use, I'm being a little bit silly and using air quotes now when I use this word, difficult people.
But sometimes, you know, we do find ourselves in conflict with others.
And often if we look at it or really maybe feel into it, it's not necessarily that it's always about the topic that we are in conflict about.
It's we don't think that we're fighting about this or that or, you know, whatever it might be, right? There's no end to the things that we can fight about or disagree with others about or something like this.
But if we feel into it, if we're quiet and we have some sensitivity, we often can detect that what the fighting is about is often about identity.
That is, we're fighting over this meeting to justify who we are, and they're justifying who they are. Maybe I should say justify or bolster or defend who we think we are, just like they are.
So there's a certain way, I mean, certainly it's the conversation, everything is about a topic. But the fact of conflict is really pointing to this identity and who we think we are, we're the type of person that does X, Y or Z or doesn't do X, Y or Z.
And they have a, you know, they're the person that does ABC or doesn't do ABC, something like that.
And they have this need we want to kind of like defend or justify or something like this, or maybe we have this, there's this, I mean, what I'm pointing to is really subtle here. It is not obvious, it is not obvious at all.
And some of you might even be thinking, I don't know what Diane is talking about, because clearly the dishes should go in the dishwasher with the bowls or in this section, not in the other section of, you know, these things that we find ourselves arguing about.
But there's a way in which we might feel like, well, I have the right to have whatever thoughts or ideas or who I have the right to be who I am, we can feel like we're defending that.
And that they were feeling attacked maybe by who we, not only about how the dishes go in the dishwasher, but how we are as people.
Even kindness practice helps with conflict in so many different ways. But one is that it helps us to soften to lessen any sense of this is, I'm gonna gripping with my hand this is who we are is who I am.
Which I'm going to be filled with righteous indignation, if anybody suggests anything differently.
So loving kindness practice helps us to soften that grip of the particular view of ourselves.
And just recently I got into, I mean, just a feeling of discomfort, when somebody said something, I said, Oh, wow, what is this about my discomfort and my feeling really like a little bit of a loss of what do I do do I speak up do I just let it go what is here.
I just discovered that if I could feel into this. I felt like, Oh, I feel like I was disrespected.
And I feel like I'm disrespected because I have this idea of myself I should be somebody who's respected. And we all should have this to some regards right.
It was not being respected in a particular way that is not worth getting in conflict over honestly, when I really kind of felt into it.
I don't want to say again that we shouldn't respect ourselves and have people respect us that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that I have this kind of inflated view of myself that I felt like the other person wasn't sharing.
It took me a while to figure that out, or, you know, if you, not a long while, but it wasn't immediately obvious. But then when I realized, Oh, I see I have one view of myself and they have another view of me.
And this is where the conflict is, and I can relax about this, so that now I can have a more productive conversation.
Now I don't feel like I have to defend myself. Now I don't feel like I have to boost myself up and make sure that they know who do they think they are don't you know that I'm this right that kind of a tone is often underneath a lot of our conflicts.
So loving kindness practice can help us soften any views of ourselves that may lead to conflict some views that we may be holding on tightly, that may be healthy, but it's our relationship to them that may be holding them tightly.
And I can say, it works both ways it's really something like, because we are holding ourselves a little bit looser.
We're not like, Oh, this is the person that puts dishes in the dishwasher the wrong wrong way. It irritates me so much and we're getting in a fight about something else because of what they did earlier.
So you could follow a kind of that logic there but you know we often kind of have this sense of oh this is the person that does that and we all have this experience, we're fighting about a and then later we can discover what's really about be something.
So loving kindness practice, the softening of the sense of ourself having to be a particular way, we can let them be a particular way to it's then we can be a little bit more open to how they're showing up in that moment.
As opposed to the caricature this is the person that who does x, y and z and which is annoying.
Instead we can meet them for the person they are that moment.
It might mean that we're meeting them with a little bit more openness a little bit more.
Little bit less something that's prone to conflict.
Yeah, so there's seven or more I could say about this but maybe that's all that I'll say for now is this 11 kindness practice can help with conflict, not in the obvious way, it can in the obvious way but not only in the obvious way.
So, let me kind of practice makes us all be mushy inside and love everybody, including all the difficult people, but I'm pointing to some of its power of how it allows us to be who we are without having to bolster it.
Others to be how they are without having to defend and bolster it.
Okay, so with that as an introduction. Let's do some meditation practice.
So, taking a meditation posture, a posture that has some brightness, as well as some ease and softness
and moving into the sensations of the body for this moment.
Maybe that sensations of the chair or the whatever it is that we're sitting on against the body or what's obvious or maybe there are some tensions or tightness that we check in with the body.
We don't have to make all the tensions tightness go away. But is there a way that we can be mindful of them.
Be aware of them.
And secretly trying to push them away or wish them away.
Turning into the sensations of breathing.
Feeling the beginning, middle and end.
Each breath as best we can, without straining, without striving, but in a relaxed way.
Okay.
So mind wanders just very simply, gently begin again.
And then to start our loving kindness practice, bringing to mind somebody for whom it's easy, uncomplicated, simple.
To feel warm hearted torn.
This might be somebody who has touched you in your life with their writings or teachings or maybe a coach mentor, teacher.
Somebody with whom you have a relationship.
It's uncomplicated. Or maybe it's more imaginary or from the memory of kittens, puppies, babies.
Doesn't matter with whom, just a being for whom it's really simple and straightforward for you to have care, warmth, respect, love, kindness.
Bringing this being to mind and connecting with them.
We feel into the experience of our caring, having respect for this lovable being.
There's some softness or ease in our body.
That's part of the warmth and care, some ease for us.
And to support our loving kindness practice, we can say these phrases, repeat them.
May you have a lovable being. May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
And we can extend our loving kindness to a good friend, somebody in our life that we appreciate.
Because I mean our relationship is always perfect, but we care about them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

It seems I've been muted.
I don't know what you all heard.
Maybe I've been muted for a long time. I'm not sure.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
Is there a way that extended loving kindness to ourselves
allows us to soften the ideas we might have about ourselves?
Is there a way that we have to protect and bolster
and make sure other people see the same as we do?
And we have warmth and care for ourselves inside of ourselves.
It becomes less important that everybody see us the same way we see ourselves.
It can be a little more relaxed.
It can be a little more relaxed.
And then to bring to mind somebody who's a little bit irritating.
We care about them, we wish them well and sometimes they are a little bit annoying or bothersome.
Bring this person to mind.
Now we can say this phrase to help us stay balanced.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This idea that loving kindness practice can help us with conflict.
It helps us to loosen up some ideas we have about ourselves.
We don't have to fall into the same old patterns, we don't have to make assumptions of how the other person is going to react if we have this idea, particularly how they are.
It allows people to kind of be a whole range of humans, you know, as opposed to one or two dimensional, but to be a three dimensional person just like we are.
So that's one way in which loving kindness practice can help support us not being in conflict.
Or maybe if the conflict is, maybe I should say it maybe doesn't make the conflict go away because there are differences. It just helps the conflict to not be filled with hostility.
The conflict to not be filled with wanting the other person to be different or insisting that we're different. It allows there to be differences and to talk about the differences without, you know, escalating into something so much greater.
So I think all the conflicts go away, but it really helps create the conditions for a healthy resolution so that everybody feels seen and satisfied with the outcome, as opposed to hurt or running away or something like this.
I would like to put you into some breakout room so that you have an opportunity to talk about this amongst yourselves this idea of loving kindness is softening a sense of self.
And that's how that would affect our, the way that we show up when there are disagreements or conflicts or something like this.
There are also being groups of three or four.
It's helpful to just do this idea or it's a spiral, where you just say one thing, allow it to go to the next person, they say one thing, I would go to the next person, they say one thing and then it comes back around to the first person.
Anyway, it kind of levels the playing field between the introverts and extroverts, and nobody feels obligated to say everything they know and inform, educate, instruct others.
And it's just an opportunity to create the conditions, some warm hearted conditions in which people might be able to share some ideas that they have or an idea or be seen or say something or maybe you'll say something that you surprise yourself with, as opposed to like just informing others,
correcting or instructing others is not what we want to do here.
So if it's helpful, you can go in the order of the last digit of your phone number.
That's how you can choose the order to go in your circles.
There we go.
Welcome back. Welcome back.
If anybody have something they'd like to say, a comment they'd like to make a question or how it was, maybe I could ask you guys, if I earned some immediate questions.
Did you hear any of the guided meditations that I did? Yes, yes, okay.
Okay, good. Thank you.
Did you think about this idea of the part of the way that loving kindness helps us with conflict, helps soften ideas, you know, the stickiness that we might have about how we are or other people are.
Anybody willing to unmute and just say a comment about them?
It's great to soften. Daddy, thank you very much, Diane, for that guidance.
But what worked for me in softening it is to win the difficult person says presents me with a difficult idea, you know, like we all of us good men should have guns so we can shoot the bad men with guns.
You know, I tried to soften the impact that that has on me by looking deeper into them and asking myself or asking them, are you afraid of something, what are you afraid of?
There's a deep fear, I think, that can you tell me anything about it, you know, because, you know, and just instead of just turning around and running away.
Thank you. So to engaging with the individual and recognize that there might be something underneath why they have those views, making them recognize that they're a full human being as opposed to just that person over there that has this idea that's different than our own.
Thank you. Thank you.
I was going to say, Diana, that your little talk at the beginning was very apropos.
But lately when I've been experimenting and responding instead of reacting as they say, that it doesn't have to do with practicing metta towards the other person.
What it has to do with looking at where they're injuring my ego and saying, do I, do I really need to hang on to this ego thing, or is it that I can let go of, I mean, can I just let go of this.
Beautiful. Fantastic. Thank you, Christine. Thank you.
Right. We often think like, okay, if I just send them enough love and kindness things will be different. But if it were that easy, we would have done it already.
Thank you, Christine.
Okay, okay. So, we'll see you guys on Thursday.
Wishing you all a wonderful rest of the evening. Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome. You're welcome. If you'd like to unmute, we can all say goodbye together.
Thank you.
