Warm greetings and happy to be here with all of you and this week where we're
considering exploring the topic of calm, calmness, and one of the frequent
references in teachings of the Buddha to calmness is physical tranquility. So not
just a mental calm, but a physical calm as well. And in preparation for this
meditation, imagine that you are maybe, you know, a little bit tired and worked
hard during the day or something or came in out of the cold and you sat down in
a very comfortable chair and you, and it just felt so good to be received by the
chair and settled into the chair and you can just let go and relax so many of your
muscles and everything. So in the same way, it's possible to take an alert
posture, an upright posture, a good posture for meditation, and then inwardly somehow
and then, you know, in the backside of your muscles or something, have the same
feeling or movement of settling into a comfortable chair. So settling in, even if
your body has some discomfort and takes some work to effort to hold your posture
upright, the something inside of you, perhaps, can have the feeling or allow it
to have the feeling of relaxing into the posture, into a posture that's not
moving, that's still a posture that will receive you, that will contain your
experience, and to settle in and let that the stillness of the body, the calmness
of the body, whatever you can feel, be a support for the meditation. So assuming
your meditative posture and gently lowering your gaze, relaxing your gaze,
and if it's comfortable, to close your eyes. And take a few moments to, with your
eyes closed, or to make small adjustments in your posture, small adjustments in the
alignment of your spine, the positioning of your shoulders. Sometimes
shoulders can come back a little bit, so they're not rolling forward.
Feeling how the weight of your body centers itself on your sitting bones, is
the center of gravity in front of the sitting bones, behind the sitting bones.
Can you make some adjustments so the center of gravity of your body comes
down through the sitting bones?
And then in taking a few long, slow, deep in-breaths, as you exhale, settle
into your posture, relax into your posture as if you're settling into a
comfortable chair.
And then letting your breathing return to normal, and continuing the process
of relaxing into your body, as if the body both relaxes and the body is what
receives the relaxation. Maybe starting with the muscles of the face as you
exhale, relax the face.
On the exhale, relaxing the shoulders, as if the shoulders when they release a
little, are received into a comfortable place.
On the exhale, relaxing the chest, relaxing the chest into whatever support
the torso provides, so the chest doesn't have to work or be tight, and relaxing
the belly. Letting the weight of the belly to be received by the softness of
the lower torso.
On the exhale, relaxing your arms and hands, perhaps all your hands are
received by whatever they're touching. The fingers can soften.
And then relaxing the legs, the thighs, lower legs, releasing any clenching or
holding. And the legs are received by whatever supports them.
And then sitting here, where in your body do you feel the most tranquility, the
most comfortable stillness.
Feeling whatever is calm in your body, maybe there's a particular place
that relative to everything else in your body is the quiet place, the calm
place. And as you're sitting here, let the calm place support a calmness of
mind.
In whatever physical calmness or soft stillness there is, let your breathing
breathe with that, breathe through it. Maybe the exhale settles into that place
of physical calmness. And the inhale somehow begins from there.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles.
The exhale either relaxing into whatever calm place there is in your body, whatever
calmness there is, or if agitation or tension in the body is stronger, every
exhale relax the tension.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
Feeling whatever calmness there is in the body, no matter how small, and see if the
mind can rest in that, the mind can learn from that to also become calmly feeling breathing.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And then the exhale settles into that place of physical calmness.
And imagine that any ways in which the body is calm, tranquil, is a blessing on your heart
to allow yourself to receive that blessing.
And imagine that the calmness of your body, any tranquility in your posture bearing is
also a blessing on the world, in an agitated world.
Some person is of tremendous benefit.
And in whatever way that we can be un-hagitated, may that be the vehicle through which we care
for the world, care for the world with our basic friendliness, kindness, generosity, perhaps
assuming there's more goodness in others than even they realize.
May our ability to be calm be the foundation for living for the welfare and happiness of
all beings.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings everywhere be free.
