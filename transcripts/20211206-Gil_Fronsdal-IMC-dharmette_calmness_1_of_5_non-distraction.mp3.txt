So good morning everyone and welcome to this Monday morning talk.
And this morning, or this week, I'd like the theme to be calmness.
And to discuss five different areas or aspects of calmness.
And meditation is often associated with calmness, but not for its own sake,
though it can be quite nice for its own sake.
But because calmness allows for greater wisdom to operate.
It allows us to greater capacity to see what's happening.
And also it sets up the conditions where it's easier to let go
of things which are healthy to let go of.
There's more space in the mind or softness in the mind
where the clinging begins to loosen its grip.
So to talk about calmness.
And so when I think about this topic, I think about it in relationship also to a distracted mind.
A mind that is caught up in its thoughts and preoccupations.
That the faster the thinking is, the more preoccupied the mind is,
the more chances are that the mind, and maybe even the body, is not tranquil, is not calm.
And what happens when there's an incessant chatter in the mind thinking,
fast thinking, one thought follows the other, thoughts are tailgating each other,
is that our ability to perceive, to understand, to be creative, is diminished.
Because the busy thoughts fill the bandwidth, they fill the space.
And so other forms of intelligences we have, other forms of ways of perceiving and of reflecting,
don't have a chance to operate.
But when thinking, when we're not distracted, then we're also not distracted from our deeper wisdom,
our deeper understanding.
We're not distracted from taking the time to really see what's here.
Recently I heard someone say that the more urgency he feels, the slower he goes.
That was a wonderful principle.
Because when things are urgent, it's probably a time when we have to really use all our mental capacities
to problem solve, to figure out, to understand what's happening, to do things well,
to not be impulsive and make mistakes because it didn't take time to learn what happened.
And so to learn the art of calming ourselves,
learning the art of not being swept away in destructive thoughts and agitated mind,
is one of the great useful things we can learn from meditation and mindfulness.
But it's easier to learn it if we begin to appreciate the value of calmness.
And maybe we can begin by understanding the calmness of a calm mind, or more specifically calm thinking.
It's hard to...
Well, the Buddha talked about the calmness and calming speech.
So if you find yourself speaking very fast, and sometimes when we get agitated we speak faster,
how we speak and the speed by which we speak, we have some control over.
It's easier to control when we speak and how fast we speak than it is to control our thoughts and our thinking.
Because we have to engage more physically with the act of speaking.
To begin experimenting and getting a feel for speaking in ways that are not hurried.
Begins giving you a feeling, a sense of what it's like for the thinking mind to also be unhurried.
And then to begin slowing the thinking mind down, especially when you're distracted.
When you're distracted by your thoughts and concerns.
And so to slow down, calm down the thinking mind, like you would calm down speaking.
So the advantage of this is it's not saying stop thinking, let go of your thoughts.
Which might be too tall of an order for anyone to do effectively in daily life.
But maybe it's possible to begin slowing down your thoughts.
To have a little more space around them or a little more calmness associated with them.
And so how do we do that?
One of the ways is to do it relax the body.
Chances are that if you're thinking in a fast, distracted way.
That something in your physical system is tense, is tight, is pushing or leaning forward.
Or kind of holding on to some feeling, holding on.
So to relax, relax the belly, relax the shoulders.
And that's the advantage of some of this relaxation is they can be done without anybody else knowing you're doing it.
You can do it at meetings, you can do it sitting in traffic.
You can do it standing in line at the store.
You can take a little bit of time to relax.
If you feel like you don't have the time to relax when you're standing in a line, a cashier line.
Check in line at a store.
Then you're probably caught up in some kind of distraction.
Something that is limiting the depths of your wisdom, the depths of your clarity of really seeing what's happening.
So be very careful by the insistent voice in the mind or the sense of authority that distracted thoughts can have.
Like it's really important to think about this.
I have to think about it.
It's so important this concern and the kind of fear and sometimes desperation that goes in or the desire or the greed that might even go into thinking.
It has an insistence in it.
When that happens and you can't standing in a checkout line, can't stand on both feet and relax and just relax your body for a few moments.
Then there's not much, chances are that your innate natural wisdom and clarity of thinking is not going to be available because you're caught in that insistence that push to think.
So you might take, as you go through the day, look for opportunities, maybe secret opportunities.
No one needs to know you're relaxing your belly or your shoulders or your face or whatever your hands.
But look for opportunities to relax and see in that relaxing or that intention to relax if there starts to be a tug of war with your thinking mind.
Thinking mind is kind of doing somehow in some form or other saying, no, no, we don't have time for this.
It's so important to be thinking fast and furiously or so important to be caught up in thinking about this concern.
And maybe that's not the case.
Maybe if you really have an important concern that something that really needs to be thought about, maybe you think about it more effectively, better when you're calm, when you're relaxed.
When you slow down, when the thinking mind becomes slow enough that you can be attuned to what it feels like, that you're in your body, you feel embodied.
Thinking mind slows down enough, there's a space to be aware of your emotions and feelings, kind of the deeper emotional connection to what's happening.
Not the surface emotions of fear or desire, but slow down enough to kind of, those are kind of often symptoms or something deeper.
And if you can slow down and calm down enough to fill in the picture with more of who you are, how you are, with more space for undistracted thoughts, calm, relaxed thoughts that somehow arise from a deeper place of understanding,
a deeper place of creativity within us, often we can find our way better with our challenges in our life than if we have an agitated mind.
So to practice to have an un-agitated mind is the same thing as a calm mind.
And one of the vehicles for doing that is a calmness of body, a relaxation of body, and this wonderful interplay and mutuality between mind and body in terms of helping us be calmer.
If some of you don't like the word calm, there's other words, tranquility, serenity, peace, ease, all these words are kind of like in the same family.
And if you don't like any of those words and you think it's too high a bar or somehow not appealing, then perhaps an un-agitated mind, an un-agitated body,
because when you're agitated, we can't be so wise and we can't be kind.
It's harder to be kind, it's harder to be generous from a place of depth. And one of the wonderful things about becoming calm and un-agitated, our care for others, our friendliness to others, our attention to others,
they'll feel that it comes from a different place in us. It's bigger, it's more richer, it's more connected.
If we connect to others with a calm place rather than a distracted place or an agitated place or this fast pace that some people, some of us can be in sometimes,
where there's not really enough space, let it on for ourselves in a really deep way, but not enough space for others as well.
So calmness. And maybe this week's theme will be useful for you, especially as we're getting ready for this winter season and holiday season.
May you become a student of calmness this week. Thank you.
