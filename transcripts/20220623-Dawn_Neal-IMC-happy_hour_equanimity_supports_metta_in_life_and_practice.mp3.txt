The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Oh, boy, no longer.
There we go.
Welcome, everybody, to Happy Hour.
I'm going to ask you to mute if you haven't already.
And I'm going to start out tonight by talking about loving kindness in everyday life,
which is kind of where the rubber meets the road, right?
Everyday life, everyday interactions, actions,
and the value of invoking the intention of benevolence, friendliness, kindness toward strangers we run across,
creatures in our world, others, any kinds of others.
And it's valuable as a mind and heart training in of itself.
A mind and heart training that also happens to make relating to others more joyful and meaningful.
And it can manifest for me.
And these intentions can manifest just in the mind and the heart, the body, verbally, or through action, right?
So it can be as simple as letting the other person go first in the grocery store line when the two of you arrive at the exact same time.
And then putting the other car on when you simultaneously arrive at a four-way stop.
Holding the door open for a stranger.
Saying hello to someone who looks like they need it.
And the discourse is this kind of friendliness, these kind of cooperation,
the Buddha by some of his monks, very harmoniously living monks, I might add, as blending like milk and water, viewing each other with kindly eyes.
Blending like milk and water. These days we'd probably say milk and coffee or milk and tea.
That blend, that ease, it's not the oil and water.
It's like cooperating, helping each other with simple tasks.
Just like we do today.
These simple acts of loving kindness in daily life can really light up the heart, the mind, make the day feel a lot different.
And they also have another kind of benefit, sort of an attitude of mindfulness of mind or heart practice, to notice the equanimity or the lack of equanimity in your friendly actions, interactions, gestures of generosity.
Equanimity is a really important dimension of Mehta. It's a heart quality that it's one of the four heart qualities, right? But it happens to be present in the other three.
Loving kindness, compassion, and altruistic joy. And then it also exists in its own right.
Cultivating equanimity by itself, a great way to start is with people who are closer to neutral, these strangers, these others that we casually encounter in our lives.
And that's part of why I'm bringing it up in the context of Mehta in daily life, right? Because it's an easy way to start to notice equanimity or lack thereof in the kindness itself.
Just a couple words about equanimity. It doesn't mean non-action. It's not not caring.
It does support non-attachment to outcomes. So that can be an outcome as small as the response of a stranger to a kindness, or a non-attachment to the outcomes of the purpose to which I devoted my life.
Let's start where we're at, right? Like, in daily life, how does it feel to be friendly? How does it feel when it's reciprocated?
How does it feel when it's not reciprocated? Sometimes equanimity is there and it just doesn't matter.
Other times, one might notice a pulse of annoyance or resentment, right?
These little moments, these details, these decisions interacting with others moment by moment, those form the fabric of our lives.
They condition the heart and the mind for how we're going to show up in the next moment, the moment after that, the year after that.
You're noticing when meta is meta, loving kindness with less attachment or no attachment, and when kindness or generosity comes with expectation, stickiness, some other kind of attachment.
Expectations, some teachers say, are premeditated resentments.
So this is part of why it's such a rich place to start with the people who are more sort of the weak ties in our lives, the casual interactions, because then it's really clear that it's about this heart, this mind.
Practicing meta for neutral people on the hiking trail, neutral beings in the forest, unknown people, drivers, pedestrians, anybody, going through life.
All of this can be a daily life practice that transfers to practicing loving kindness at the very deepest levels on retreat throughout a life when it gets really hard.
When it gets really hard.
That thread of equanimity sets the heart free to love to be kind in the biggest, most expensive way.
For meditation tonight, we'll pick up on the theme I brought in last time, last week, which is to introduce calm and meta, tranquility and meta with a calm and easy being, and then we'll move on to others.
The invitation, as we meditate, as you meditate, is if it feels natural just to notice any feelings of equanimity or attachment that arise, not to dwell on them, but just take a moment to notice.
The equanimity is what sets meta free.
Okay, so we're going to transition to the meditation part of happy hour.
And in order to protect our silence, I am no longer allowing people to unmute themselves in case we get some late comers fiddling with their iPad or their phone or whatever.
And protect us from zoom bombs.
And for you, each of you, the invitation is to settle back from your screen.
You can maybe turn off the suggestion is to turn off any alerts, phone message indicators, buzzing, beeping, ringing.
And if it's helpful to turn away from the screen, please feel free, you don't have to.
I will stay on screen or even foreseen interruptions.
And inviting you to settle back into your body.
Soft in your eyes.
Let me downcast.
Can be helpful to start by taking one or two deep slow breaths just as deep as is comfortable.
Relaxing in the opera.
Letting go, whatever it took to get here.
Whatever the day brought.
Then noticing this body, just as it is, where's it at right now.
I'm saying hi to whatever sensations or tensions.
Relaxations.
Openings are present.
Setting the intention was all the next half hour.
To meeting your experience with kindness and mindfulness.
And allowing any kind of equanimity that wants to come.
Noticing the contact of the feet on the floor and pushing.
Noticing the contact of your hands on whatever they're resting on.
Weight of your body.
Supported by that cushion in the chair.
Sensing into the boundless support of the earth beneath that.
Relaxing into that.
Lighting the attention to soak into the body.
Silling this body that we water from the sponge.
And resting.
Noticing the attention, whatever part of the embodied experience feels most soothing, grounding to you right now.
The contact of hands and feet sound.
Like the instructions I'm about to give.
Breathing.
Returning to your life's breath, wherever it's most comfortable.
Resting.
Allowing all of experience.
And resting the attention, the foreground of your attention.
And soothing qualities of this body breathing.
And helpful to put a bit more attention in the outgrowth.
Allowing the settling and releasing into stones.
The end of the outgrowth.
Allowing whatever sensations, attitudes, emotions, thoughts are there to be there.
Kindly acknowledging, including.
The attention to rest in the moment.
This breath.
This touch.
Breathing.
Noticing, appreciating any presence, mindfulness, kindness, calm.
It's already here.
No matter how small, the smallest ever.
Appreciate you.
Thank you.
Letting go, letting go.
Resting.
Breathing.
And as it feels right, gathering the attention.
For it's the center of your chest, the heart center.
Noticing whatever sensations, feelings are present there.
Perhaps there's a sense of sweetness, relaxation, and contraction, and expansion.
So, okay.
Perhaps noticing the way the breath relates to the heart center.
Perhaps soothing, reliving.
Nothing at all in kind awareness.
Now calling to mind, a person, or a being, someone in your life, or known of, a figure.
Someone who exudes a sense of calm, calmness, compassion, kindness.
This other one should be some being you feel safe around.
Perhaps an image of this other one, or a felt sense of them.
Even the idea of them, holding it, holding them close to the heart and the mind.
And offering whatever positive intentions, feelings feel right over this other one.
Kindness or gratitude.
Kindliness, respect. Anything in that feeling.
Imagining these intentions moving outwards from your body, your mind, and heart.
Perhaps like a gesture.
Or on a breath.
And using if it feels right to use words.
Any words that feel fitting to you.
Moving for a few.
Please be creating the measurement.
Be happy.
Be safe.
Be peaceful.
Be happy.
Perhaps imagining these wishes like light radiating outwards from you.
Perhaps a fragrant breeze or fog.
Outwards and down.
Be happy.
Be safe.
Be peaceful.
Be happy.
Be happy.
From time to time.
Checking in quality of your own heart to your body.
What does it feel to be offering these good wishes?
Noticing.
Imagining perhaps receiving these wishes from this other one.
What does it feel to be offering these good wishes from this other one.
Noticing.
Noticing.
Now shifting focus on yourself and this other one.
Imagining the two of you perhaps or them just there supporting you.
Offering kindness to one or two fairly known people.
Representatives of all the strangers and casual contents.
Be happy.
Be peaceful.
Be happy.
Be happy.
Radiating outwards.
Be happy.
Noticing any threads and calm, non-attachment, equanimity, intimate touch.
Allowing, acknowledging whatever arises with kindness.
Noticing any energy or body.
Perhaps ripples of mental kindness and intention.
Like ripples in a clear calm mountain lake.
Or perhaps something stronger.
We commend our life.
We praise how it feels to send these good wishes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We now expanding if it feels right.
The scope, the circle of the kindness flowing through this body and this heart at this moment.
There are any horizons in this mind, tired and lonely, no part left to help in the end.
Including the deeply respected, cared for, being, neutral beings.
And any and all people, creatures, beings, known and unknown.
Anywhere your good wishes want to land, near or far as they want to come.
Radiating like starlight.
Spreading like falling green.
Rippling like water.
Kindness.
Rippling like me.
Rippling like me.
Rippling like me.
Rippling like me.
Rippling like me.
Rippling like me.
For the last few moments of this meditation.
The invitation is to let go of images, imaginings and rest.
Rest in this body, this moment.
Allowing, whatever wants to flow through, to flow through.
Like clouds or birds.
In a clear, vast, open sky.
Nothing left out.
Come with kind.
Rippling like me.
Rippling like me.
Rippling like me.
Rippling like me.
Thank you all for your practice.
So, as has become custom when I teach these happy hours,
I invite you to stay with yourself, stay in that space.
Generating good intentions, good will, willingness.
And take a moment to wish those wishes to the other people in this Zoom room,
your Sangha mates, fellow practitioners.
Wish it to their tile if they don't have their video on,
or to their image if they do have their video on.
The encouragement is to turn your video on, even just for this little bit if you can,
offering and also receiving, willingness, good will, metta.
Each of the other people in this room.
The ear metta is spreading all over the country this way too,
beyond the country.
So, thank you.
So, we have just a few minutes for reflections right now.
Maybe five minutes or so.
If anyone would like to offer how that was,
or have a question.
Maybe we're just over a full page, so maybe use your Zoom hand.
I'll put the things in the chat if they're shy about speaking.
Oh, wait, I need to let you unmute, hang on.
Okay, now you can unmute.
Okay, I just wanted to say thank you. I really appreciated it, and I've been sitting off and on with the Sangha for almost a year and a half maybe.
It's been a while.
Anyway, I really appreciate it, and I just want to thank you so much.
Thank you.
I especially appreciate the heart quality and the gratitude.
That's such a beautiful quality to bring in and to respond to.
Anybody else?
Yes, Anthony.
You've done for the Guided Meditation and the topic on Love and Kindness.
My question is, what's your perspective on when you choose that someone, if it's like a grandmother or someone that's passed already?
Would you say that it's okay, so to speak?
I think it's totally fine to imagine her speaking, allow her to speak.
Not speak, but you know when you have us kind of like visualize that person to give Love and Kindness to, is it okay if it's like a loved one that's passed already?
Yes, absolutely, and I was responding to that dimension of it as well.
In my day job, I'm a chaplain, and so I help people process grief a lot, and a very common way that a lot of people integrate their grief is to have the person become a part of them.
And many people do that by talking to you and even sort of imagining or hearing conversations with their dear departed one.
So I think it's a beautiful practice.
You may have heard somewhere that you shouldn't be generating metta for a deceased person, where that comes from is they are not considered in the commentaries to be a good person to use if you're trying to attain a concentration state, a jhana.
So that's the only time to hold off is if that's the goal in a daily life practice situation like this, that's not usually what we're aiming for, so you're totally cool, you're fine.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Thank you for your question.
Just maybe one more or reflection.
I guess I'll offer a very brief moment of reflection, which is just to observe that in my own experience cultivating calm or equanimity sometimes lends itself to not wanting to be as verbal, and that's totally fine.
And also that this link between the metta, the kindness and the equanimity.
The hope is that the meditation offered a little bit of an exploration of what that might be like in practice.
And that daily life practice is every bit is real. Every bit is valuable in this realm to really taking, taking madden as a cultivation of the heart of the mind and of relationships, all at the same time.
So we're going to move into optional breakout groups. If you want to stick around, but you don't want to be in a breakout group just decline the invitation and all we balance them.
But have you been there for about six minutes.
And if you want to stay quiet and stay here, it's fine.
The invitation you don't necessarily need to follow my prompt, but the prompt I'm going to suggest is to talk about how metta practice, loving kindness practice does show up in your daily life right now.
And how it does, or how it might, and how might cultivating a sense of healthy, non attachment to alchemic, anonymity, hopefully cultivating more of it in your life with others and people.
Okay, so there we go.
See you guys very soon.
Make sure you've got the timing right.
Yes.
So, see you on the other side.
I'll come back.
Thank you Don. It was lovely.
It was a little static I don't know if it's my computer.
While you were speaking.
Rob, did you hear static.
Since we got another person.
You sound fine to me.
Okay.
As just your voice has some static in it on my machine.
Yeah, technology right.
Thank you. It was lovely.
Yes, thank you Don so much.
So, welcome back everybody.
It's so fun to see you pop back in like that.
I have a couple of minutes if anyone wants to give a sense wants to share any ideas or wisdom or joy or anything that came up in the group.
Yes, Jerry.
I must say in this small group.
I'm confessing my sins. We were just talking about the geography of two of us on the group or from Toronto including myself.
And two of us for the other two were from California.
And even and we sort of almost felt like family, even though we just chatting about that and we never really talked about meditation but at the end of it it felt warm and nurturing.
So, there you go.
And yeah, it's not always about the topic right sometimes it's much more about the attitude in our hearts and warmth of the connection.
Very fitting with the teaching on relating to people we don't know very well right in our lives.
Great. Thanks Jerry.
Anybody know which the sangha now.
multinational.
multinational.
Yes, Neil.
So, I thought when you said that we should, when we're giving met to look to see if we're being economists or clinging was a very interesting thing.
You know, in the past, right, I certainly have noticed I've been clinging or right, you know, repelled right I certainly had both of those reactions.
You know, you know, my reaction has always been I'm doing it wrong.
And this sort of like reframed it to, you know, be mindful of, you know, your response right, right, you know, this is, this is what happens, you know, you know, it was just, it was like one of two sentences you said but you know it was, you know, it's sort of like reframed things for me it
was very nice I thought.
And I'm so happy to hear that you took that from it. For me, full disclosure I've had quite a journey with metta starting in 2009, I think.
And so I have plenty of time of thinking like they're doing it wrong part and like it's supposed to be a certain way part and one of the most powerful ways of practicing this for me is to notice everything that's not metta.
And whether clinging is the most powerful thing to notice clinging or aversion, and it is it can be a mindfulness practice.
And it's a powerful heart cultivation, this, I'm no saint, you know, and I maybe there's a saint in this room tonight I don't know but until we reach that level there's always going to be the possibility of something like that popping in so bunch of others see it.
Thank you for that. Thank you.
We have one more minute. So if anyone has a burning comment question, complaint, please raise your hand. Otherwise, I'm going to bring us out with a little bit of dedication.
A little bit of dedication of merit or benefit.
May the practice that we do here together, may this cultivation of the heart of kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, and the seeing of everything else be a benefit to us.
And to all the lives we touch, all the lives they touch, rippling outwards and outwards.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
And may all beings be free.
Thank you for your kind attention and practice.
