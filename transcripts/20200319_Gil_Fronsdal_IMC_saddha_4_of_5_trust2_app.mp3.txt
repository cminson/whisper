Saddhā  (4 of 5): Trust  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on March 1 9, 2020  
 
 
Good morning again. I am going to give the fourth talk in 
this short series on faith  – the Pali word saddhā . Each 
day I am speaking about a different aspect of faith. The 
first day was faith itself, then confidence, then 
conviction. Today it is trust.  
 
In Buddhism t he traditional idea of faith is that saddhā  is 
what gets us started  in practice. As we practice,  it is 
useful to develop confidence in the practice , and in our 
ability to practice. As we practice, there comes a 
conviction that this works  – that this is valuable  and 
worthwhile. And, then as we continue in the practice, it 
is possible to discover a ver y deep trust .  
 
This trust is multi -faceted. It could be trust in the 
Dharma  – the Dharma  being something that is clearly 
larger and deeper than ourselves , our self -concept , or 
our identity  – the sense of me, myself, and mine; our 
sense of agency . These ar e all valid. But it’s also valid 
that there is much more that support s our life.  
 
In its etymology, dharma  is said to come from the word  
meaning  ‘to support ’ – that which upholds something. We are held up and supported by something that 
Buddhists call the Dharma .  
 
As we practice , and discover how to relax, be present, 
be carefully attentive , we discover that more is going on 
within us  – processes  and patterns of life deeper than 
anything we could engineer, organize or make happen 
on our own. The analogy I like to give for this is 
chopping  vegetables and cutting our finger with the 
knife. We have the job of cleaning the wound , and 
perhaps protecting it by putting a bandage over it  so it 
doesn’t get dirty . But the actual healing is not something 
we orchestrate  or engineer. The healing of that wound 
marshals together many aspects of our physiology, 
immune system, and capacities  for healing . It’s kind of a 
miracle how all of these complicated phenomena come 
together in the body without us having to think about it 
too much , or direct the show. Our job is to keep the 
wound clean and protected , so that the natural 
functioning of the b ody can operate.  
 
It also works that way for our hearts, our inner spiritual 
life. We have to keep it clean. We have to protect it to 
some degree. That is one function of the precepts  and 
ethics. It is one function of living a calm, settled, relaxed 
life, so that we a re creating the good circumstances for 
something to arise within us  – for the powerful healing 
processes of the heart.  
 More than just healing, it is also a unification, a 
gathering together of all the disparate parts of who we 
are. The puzzle  pieces of our life have a chance to click 
back together  – in a way,  to reassemble the pieces that 
life has disassemble d from  the wholeness of who we 
are. This process of coming into wholeness is a natural 
process , which our inner system knows how to do  – just 
as it knows how to heal a cut. To trust that deeper 
process of coming into wholeness  – to trust that 
Dharma  practice, fo r example, enables, allows, and 
makes room  for it to happen.   
 
But this process is  more than just becoming healed and 
whole. There is also an inner unfolding toward freedom 
and liberation. When we first begin practicing, we have 
to make a lot of effort. We  have to learn what meditation 
is. We have to sit down , keep doing it, and come back. 
But as we begin settling more and more , and we get 
into the momentum of the practice , then less and less 
agency is needed from us.  
 
At some point , what is most needed is  for us to get out 
of the way  – to not interfere, not try to make things 
happen. There comes a tipping point , from a time when 
we have to make the initial effort to a time when almost 
no effort from us is needed , because there is a deeper 
wellspring of ene rgy, momentum , and the path of 
practice that begins to unfold inside us . We can  trust 
that – trust that something really good is happening here. It’s not really up to us to do  – but it’s for us to trust, 
to get out of the way.  
 
It’s a phenomenal thing to discover this trust , and really 
understand through one’s own experience  that i n all the 
things that surface in meditation – things that are 
difficult, and things that are good a nd wonderful – there 
is a deep intelligence  that k nows what needs to appear . 
It knows  what’s appropriate to face  now, to work with , 
and to work through.  
 
Trusting this process – trusting what unfold s and 
appears in our life  from the inside out – and even 
trusting what comes from the outside in, what happens 
around us  – is one of the potentials of saddhā , of faith. It 
may not seem to make logical sense to trust everything 
around us. But for someone who practices and 
understands the deep wellsprings of intel ligence, 
wisdom, healing, and the movement toward wholeness 
and freedom  – when that process has a chance to meet 
the circumstances of  our life, it begins to transform the 
interface, the meeting place between us and the world. 
Maybe the world doesn’t change  directly , but something 
happens in that interface that makes the situation better.  
 
Sometimes it does influence what happens outside. An 
angry person comes to you , and you are able to meet 
the moment, trusting t hat it’s ok to open to it and be 
present , so that some deeper wisdom of how to meet this angry person can arise. That person might change 
as a consequence. That’s very different than if you are 
just as reactive as the  angry person.  
 
At some point, saddhā  becomes more characterized by 
knowing that there is something we can trust. We know 
that something supporting us in our lives is really good. 
It’s not exactly personal , but it is within us. It’s not 
exactly what we would normally identify as ‘me,' 
because  it isn’t something we necessarily do , but it is 
certainly something intimately a part of who we are : 
close, valuable, and powerful.  It isn’t something that 
only we ourselves have . Everyone has it if they tap into 
it, open to it, and  allow  this process to come into being .  
 
To trust th e depth of what is possible  – and to trust it in 
other people. To see it as something beautiful and 
valuable in others. They may not even know. 
Sometimes, giving space to other people , and getting 
out of their way may enable s omething deeper in them 
to surface. Buddhists might call it the Dharma  – other 
people might call it something else. But  something living 
in them comes more from the wholeness of the ir human 
being , as opposed to the more limited domain of who 
we are as represented by attachment to self  and our 
self-preoccupation s when i t’s all about me, myself, and 
mine  – and I have to do thin gs. That is a brittle world. 
That is a world we can’t really trust.  
 But we can trust this deeper place – the Dharma . It is a 
little hard to articulate. Maybe it is mostly something that 
we discover for ourselves over time. As the practice 
deepens and develops – starting with faith, inspiration, 
confidence , and conviction – then, when the time is 
right, we discover and recognize something that we can 
trust. And then, the task of practice  – of what we can do 
(there is always some role that we have)  – is to trust it.  
 
Or perhaps more interesting and more challenging  is 
that we can begin recognizing all of the unhelpful things 
we are trusting in our lives. Even though most people 
don’t use the language of trust, in some sense , people 
trust their anger , their sadness , their bank account , the 
economic system  – or the y trust that if they’ve got the  
right relationship , everything will be good . People can 
be oriented toward , attached to, or looking for all these 
things as the solution for how to be happy. One way to 
understand  that kind of expecting external things to 
make us happy is that we grant them a certain level of 
trust. We trust that that’s  what is going to do it . 
 
As we begin discovering something really trustworthy 
within  – something like the Dharma  – the task of 
practice is to begin seeing , “What is it we trust that is 
not so useful, or helpful, or maybe not even accurate ?” 
Then we learn to come back to the place we trust , and 
let that be the foundation of our lives. We o pen to that , 
allow that ,  and reorient ourselves  – almost to a new life, a life where the depth of the Dharma  within us, the 
depth of our humanity, the depth of our goodness has a 
chance to surface and grow.  
 
In this regard , it is interesting to think about how our 
emotional life has basically two layers  or levels . There 
are the afflictive emotions  – those that cause suffering , 
such as anger and greed. Those are the surface  
activities of our life . They are loud. What we are looking 
for in Dharma  practice is not to reject th em, but to 
discover the beneficial emotions  that operate at a much 
deeper, quieter, softer place inside : kindness, love, 
generosity, equanimity, and patience.  
 
One value of trusting the deeper aspect of this practice 
is so tha t the center and heart of our life , that which we 
most trust , is at the core of who we are  – as opposed to 
the afflictive emotions on the surface. Then we can hold 
the afflictive emotions in a kind , generous , and 
supportive  way, without  having them control  us. Trust.  
 
What do we trust? What do we discover through 
Dharma  practice that is really worthwhile to trust? Then, 
how do we stay close to that which we trust? That is the 
task of practice.  
 
Thank you all for listening, for meditating. I appreciate 
the sense of wide community and connection through 
this vehicle of electronics that connects us all. I appreciate that you’re here.  
 
We will continue this five -part series tomorrow.  Thank 
you.
