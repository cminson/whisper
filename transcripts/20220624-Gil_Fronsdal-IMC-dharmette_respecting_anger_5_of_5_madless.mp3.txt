The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Good morning. Good day. Here we are at the last talk about anger. And anger
might arise out of a particularly incident in the moment. And even if it
does, if it lasts, it has moved from the world of immediacy and aliveness into
the world of our memory and thoughts, ideas, story making in the mind. And it
turns out that a lot of anger, anything that's chronic resentment and
irritation has a lot to do with the world of aboutness, the world of
thinking about things, the story making that we do. And the more intense and
involved we are with anger, the more there's a diminishment or a loss that
we experience. There is a kind of suffering, a kind of pain and stress
that comes with being angry. And there's also the more stronger it is, the
more there's a preoccupation with something about something. And that
preoccupation means that we're not available for a wider range of our
emotional, spiritual, inner life. An outer life, that to not be cut up in
anything, we're available for a range of responses, a range of empathy, a range
of perception of what's happening. And that gets diminished the more we get
preoccupied. And the one way to get preoccupied is around anger. And at
times it gets quite intense. And it really diminishes our capacity to feel, to
sense, to experience, to perceive the world and ourselves as the world of
anger tends to get reduced more and more. And it gets reduced often to a
world of aboutness. Even if there's a mood that's kind of angry,
irritated, hostile mood, it's probably being fueled by some background story,
belief, idea that's going on. And to have the courage to drop the beliefs, the
courage to drop the preoccupations, the stories in order to be present more
fully for the aliveness of our life. So in this week, one of the things I hope
that I've conveyed is that anger is a worthwhile subject for attention, for
mindfulness and for study. That rather than having some blanket policy that the
anger is bad and we shouldn't be angry, we don't need to have that policy
because we have a mindfulness practice that can help us find a way through the
anger. And we can understand what is dysfunctional about anger, what is
causing our stress for ourselves with anger, what is unnecessary, what
diminishes us. We can kind of use that as an object of mindfulness to reclaim our
freedom, our independence, our ability not to be caught by it. And in the process
of that, we learn a lot. And so using anger as a means, a medium for learning
about the grievance we have, about the difficulty that's happening, about
the challenge that's somehow or other represented by the anger. And by
studying it, we get to distinguish between where the essence, the
essential part of study is. Sometimes we have to study what's happening
externally and understand the situation better. And sometimes we have to
understand ourselves better because that's really the genesis or the active
kind of center of the anger. And that's where it's productive to bring our
attention to. So as we, as I bring this to a conclusion, this topic of
anger, I would like to offer you an acronym, a bit long maybe, and the
acronym is MADLESS, to be without mad, without anger, becoming to
madlessness, madless. And if you're looking at this at the YouTube now, in
the, underneath the photograph where it says a few information about IMC and the
information square, I have written out the acronym. So the M is
motivation. The A is attention. D is to diffuse. L is to learn. E is empathy. And
S is to have story substitution. Change a story. And then the second S is to
speak. We don't want to be mindful and resolve our anger and then become silent
when the world needs us to speak. The situation needs us to speak about what's
going on. We sometimes diffuse anger so that we can address a real world need.
So motivation. Anger itself. Think of it as a motivational feeling. What does it
want? What is it trying to do? What's really happening there? And are we trying
to get rid of something? Are we trying to change something? Are we trying to get
away from something? Are we trying to attack someone? Is there hostility,
which is kind of a motivation? Are we trying to harm someone, hurt someone with
our words maybe, get back at them? And or are we trying to change a situation that
needs to be changed? Or what change are we trying to evoke with anger? Trying to
make happen? So to study what is anger about? What's its purpose? And is it
really the purpose we stand behind? Do we have another motivation that's more
valuable for us, more important that comes to the surface? We spend time
looking at the purpose, the motivation of the anger. Attention is to really bring
a lot of attention to this experience of anger. One of the fundamental aspects of
mindfulness meditation is mindfulness of the body. So bringing attention to the
body. If we really feel our body when we're angry, it tends to dissipate, it
tends to create some space for it. It also teaches us a lot about how we're
involved with the anger, that we're contracted and tight and leaning forward
or pulling back. Whatever we're doing, maybe we noticed our fist is clenched. So
to keep coming back to the body, I've been angry in the past where I didn't
know what was going on with my body. Many years ago I was really angry with
someone, I didn't know it. And there was a pause, the person had to go away to do
something. And so then I noticed my body. And I noticed that I was leaning forward
and tight. And so then I came back into myself and made a huge difference. And so
we use attention to notice what's happening here for us. And all these
different practices of madness all require some use of attention. And then
to diffuse it. To diffuse means to, I use these terms in terms of not so much to
take the fuse away, but just to dissipate or to reduce the tension that's there.
And the less tension there is in anger, the wiser will become, the less we're
under the influence of the anger. So to develop and learn skills of diffusion,
of relaxation, of calming, breathing deeply, relaxing the body, taking a posture
that's stable and strong, that allows kind of, you know, different kind of
attention where we're more present in a, in a, in a way that we're in charge. We
were more capable of making wise choices. And then to learn. I think this is one of
the great principles around anger. Always when we're angry, there's something to
learn and take the time to learn it. What's the lesson that's here? And now for
many of us, I think there's a huge lesson to be learned within ourselves. What
is the attachment that triggered the anger? What's the place inside the
belief, the sense of self? What's the history we have? What's the wound we
have that's been now touched by the incident around us, the unattended
unresolved wounds we carry with us? And so to learn, what's going on? Sometimes
we're going to learn outside. And one of the things to learn outside is to learn
what's going on with the other people. What's really happening there? Many years
ago, I read about it, that in New York, the bus system, they gave as kind of a
training for bus drivers. They showed them a video of people who get on the
bus who are very annoying to bus drivers. That they just have behavior which is
kind of troublesome, difficult. And they interviewed or described or talked to
these people and found out that they had all kinds of personal circumstances. Very
difficult learning disabilities, maybe all kinds of personal challenges that
were not obvious on the surface. And as soon as the bus service began looking
at these personal challenges these people had, their anger and annoyance to
people who were difficult in the bus decreased dramatically. That if we take
time to learn about who people are, maybe there's much less reason to be
angry, though there might be reasons for compassion and care and having a
strong conversation. And then to have empathy, to care about others, to have
love, to have kindness, to try to kind of follow up what I just said about learn.
Really get to know people and understand more deeply what's going on
with them when they behave. Even people pay very difficulty. But not
so much because they deserve it, but because it's actually better medicine
for each of us, for ourselves, to have degrees of compassion, love, kindness,
and empathy than it is to do the opposite, to be closed. And something
grows in us when we take the time to be empathic. And then to a story
substitution. So many of anger has to do with some story we're telling ourselves.
And I've had anger with people and I had the wrong story. I had made up the story
which was an interpretation that wasn't really what happened. And to be
very careful the stories you tell yourself. The fish gets bigger, the more
they tell the story, they say, what stories are you telling? And are they
really accurate? Check out the story. Find out. Say, this is what I understand
happened. And maybe it didn't happen that way. Or maybe there was more to it
than meets the eye. And then speak. I talked about this yesterday. And as I
said earlier, mindfulness meditation, this Buddhist approach to anger is not
to make us passive, mute, silent, uninterested, and uninvolved with the
world and other people. Most anger is social. Most anger has to do with
people around us, especially if it's really intense and simmers and
lasts. The anger we have for technology or the weather or something doesn't
have the same power as the anger we have with people and social
circumstances. And so it implies that sometimes it's very important in the
social world to speak. And what do we speak? How do we speak? How do we speak
with kindness and clarity and purpose for bringing the welfare of everyone
involved? And so that I think is one of the principles I'd like to end this
discussion on anger. The principle that we live a life that looks for what's
best for everyone involved in the situation. We don't look at just what's
best for ourselves. We look at what's best for everyone, surprisingly, even for
the people who've harmed us. What's best for them? Because what's best for
ourselves and best for others fits into what's best overall as we create a
better society. I'd like to end with a quote from Mahagusananda. He was kind
of like the Mahatma Gandhi of Cambodia. After the Khmer Rouge, the
genocide there, he was the Buddhist leader of Cambodia, Buddhist monk. I met
him, a lovely man, very peaceful, very loving, full of smiles. And he wrote,
I do not question that loving ones are oppressors,
Cambodians loving the Khmer Rouge may be the most difficult attitude to achieve.
But it is a law of the universe that retaliation, hatred, and revenge only
continue the cycle and never stop it. Reconciliation does not mean that we
surrender rights and conditions, but rather we use love in all our
negotiations. It means that we see ourselves in the
opponent. For what is the opponent but being but a
being in ignorance. And we ourselves are also ignorant of
many things. Therefore, only loving kindness and right
mindfulness can free us.
So to practice, bring anger under the purview of our practice, our
mindfulness, and maybe we can negotiate with our enemies
with love. So speak. So thank you. And I have a
couple of announcements. One is that I'll be away on vacation
next week. And so my friend and wonderful Zen
teacher, Paul Haller, will come and teach this
seven a.m. this this sitting starting Monday.
And some of you remember Paul. He came and did a week
back last April, April, May, when I did the Zen Vipassana kind of retreat.
And so I'm very happy he's coming. And the
tomorrow IMC's earth care group has a wonderful teacher named
Tenisera coming to give a Dharma talk. You have to go
on to IMC's website. I think it's listed under what's new.
And finally, I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, I think,
that I'm doing a day-long retreat on online on July
9th. And I think it was not so easy to find where you'd register the
information about it. It should be easier now because now it's
in the what's new section of IMC's website much more clearly.
And eventually it'll be clearly, I think, on the calendar as well.
And for now it's, you know, in the what's new and the homepage.
So thank you. And I look forward to coming back in a couple of weeks.
And I'll be here on the 4th of July. Thank you.
