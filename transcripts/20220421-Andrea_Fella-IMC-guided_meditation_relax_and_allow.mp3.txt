 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Connecting with yourself here and now. Aware of the body sitting here in this space, in your space wherever you are. And this time, it's beginning to collect. And arrive with yourself. And it can be helpful to start with bringing attention to the body and encouraging or supporting a relaxation of body. So maybe the head, the face can soften and relax. And often start with the head and face because there's such a connection between body and mind in the face. When the face can soften and relax, it often can support our mind to soften and relax. Seeing if there can be a softening across the forehead, around the eyes, the mouth, the jaw. Maybe the neck, the shoulders can relax. The arms and the hands. Maybe upper part of the torso, all those muscles around the ribs. Maybe there can be a softening there. Maybe there can be a relaxation in the lower part of the torso. Maybe letting the stomach and abdomen just hang forward and relax. Sometimes we hold tension there, almost subconsciously. Maybe the middle and lower back can relax. The hips. The legs and the feet. And maybe too there can be a little bit of softening and relaxation inside the body. Just seeing if you can kind of let your attention land in each of these places that I name and see what happens. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. Maybe there can be a softening and a relaxation through the whole body. Maybe too there can be a little softening of any holding or tension in our mind, any worries or concerns, thoughts about past or future. Maybe there can be a little softening of the mind. Maybe the brain can relax. Sometimes there's a little bit of relaxation in body, in mind. There can be a more natural capacity to just be with ourselves, to know the experience of what's happening right now. So maybe there can be a kind of a settling back and connecting with how are you in this moment. However you are, it can be held with a kind attention. Like a dear friend might just be with you however you are, our mindfulness can be like that. Oh, it's like this right now. It doesn't need to change, there's nothing that needs to be fixed. It might be pleasant or unpleasant. It might be kind of neutral. Can there just simply be the recognition, it is like this and that's okay. That perspective or attitude of it's okay of allowing whatever is happening to be here. That perspective is so supportive. It allows there to be a flow, a movement and a witnessing of what's here. We can simply settle back and rest and see what wants to be seen, what's obvious in a moment and in the next moment with that allowing perspective. It's like what wants to show up and be seen right now. This can be just a very relaxed receiving of ourselves, of our human experience. And sometimes it can be helpful to connect with the simple experience such as the breathing. If that supports you to stay connected with being here in the present moment, that's also fine. It's just a little premium and Jackson rotates punished. Sometimes you might notice thoughts coming through. That too we can simply know, be aware, thinking is happening. It's just another experience like a sound or a sight, a thought. Receiving and being aware. Neither needing to hold on to a thought and think about it or push it away. And sometimes we get caught by thoughts, we get lost in them, lose sense of being present. At some point the mindfulness will come back. At that point. Notice the return of mindfulness. Notice that you have become aware again. That's what happens when we notice that we've been lost, is we've become aware again. Mindfulness has re-arisen. And how are you in that moment? Much as we started our practice with checking in, how are we connecting to relaxation of body? That's useful when we return, when mindfulness returns. Check in again. What's here now? If there's tension in the body, it's fine to take some moments to relax again. And reconnect. How are you right now? With that friendly, kind, allowing attention.
