 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There. So, hello and welcome to Happy Hour. So, for today's practice, I wanted to seed something and to seed this couple of things, actually. One is the sense of this invitation for considering that our intention, really, everything, we lead with our intention, with everything in our lives, in the world with our intention. And intending, inviting ourselves for this cultivation is really the very first step. So, I want to share a poem that's written by someone, a practitioner, who I'd like to share with you. It's inspiring, it's beautiful. The poem is called A Prayer for Awakening. So, this sense of intention, this prayer for awakening. So, here we go. And I'll share it when we're practicing, but just to drop it in. May my mind be expansive enough to hold whatever comes to visit. May my heart be brave enough to face all that is before me. May my eyes be sharp enough to see whatever is there. May my ears be keen enough to hear all that is said. And may my arms, may my arms be long enough to embrace all that needs comforting. Hmm, this invocation, this invocation of may I, may I cultivate, may I cultivate my heart myself in these beautiful ways. So, it might be you to consider, may I, you know, what invocation do you have, the invocation you have for your heart, your life as a practitioner. And another thing I wanted to see is, besides this idea of intention, actually connecting it with intention is that tomorrow in the West, especially in the US, it's considered the same to Valentine's Day. And that actually can bring some sadness for many people. Oh, I don't have a Valentine, a partner, and there's so many beautiful ways to construe, to perceive this idea of love. So, let's celebrate St. Valentine's Day tonight being the eve of it tomorrow, the day of it as a way to celebrate self-love, as a day to celebrate this beloved that is ourselves, this being that we usually forsake for another. We just forget, there's this wonderful being that that needs, appreciates love the first and foremost, and also to celebrate it as a day for universal love. It doesn't have to just be this one person and it's tit for tat and I like you and if you do this for me, if you love, like, no, can we just be kind, can we be loving to whoever shows up on our path could be the grocery store clerk, can we share our good will, metta as good will, a sense of interconnection we have with every human being instead of just thinking this in this limited way of just one in a particular way, etc. So really expanding, expanding this, this idea. So, happy St. Mehta Day, that's what I like to, it's St. Valentine's St. Mehta, it's really St. Mehta Day, it's metta, it's metta by any way, shape or form. I've said plenty, so let's practice together. So, invite you to land, land in your bodies, to arrive, to arrive with your invocation with your intention. Whatever it is in this moment, maybe inspired by the poem I read from a fellow practitioner, maybe their invitation, their invocation, this is seed for yours. May my mind be expansive, expansive enough to hold whatever comes, yours it. May my heart be brave enough to face all that is before me, resting, breathing with that, yes. May my eyes, my inner eyes be sharp enough, open enough internally to see whatever is there, whatever arises, whatever is here, clear seeing. May my ears be keen enough to hear all that is said, all that is communicated, internally, externally, deep listening, deep listening to myself, to the universe, to others. And may my arms, my proverbial arms, be long enough to embrace all that needs comforting, which I'd start with my own heart, myself. I may need comforting in this moment, this body, this heart, as well as others. Nothing, nothing with the body, with our intention, with the breath. May my heart be limitless, knowing it's exultant, boundless capacity for care and love for all beings, for myself, for others. May I accept and love myself just as I am. Thank you. Thank you. Connecting with the breath, with the body, with intentions, with goodwill. If thoughts are arising, entangled, if you find yourself entangled in thoughts, it's okay. And we gently let them go and reconnect with our intention for presence, for kindness and goodwill, starting with this being here and now, breathing, alive, just as breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May I love and accept myself just as I am. May I love and accept this body, especially if it's having challenges right now, just as it is. With each breath, relaxing into, opening to, whatever is arising in this moment, may I meet this moment with kindness. May I meet this moment, this body, this heart, this mind. May I meet all that arises with kindness. May I meet myself, as I am. May I meet myself as my Valentine. A beloved other. May I open my heart to myself, fully loving, accepting, cherishing. May I meet this complex human being that is me, who's doing their best. Who in the words of Suzuki Roshi are perfect, this being who's me is perfect, just as they are, just as I am. And there's always room for improvement. And I open my heart, this being here, fully in this moment, just for a moment, risking it for just a moment. And I always step back, let's step in for just a second and see what it feels like. Thank you. Thank you. Love heals. Love heals. May you offer yourself some healing love. See the good. See the good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now expanding our hearts, they are expandable. What if we meet someone, someone we know or maybe don't even know? What if we meet someone, someone we know or maybe don't even know? What if we meet someone, someone we know or maybe don't even know? What if we meet someone, someone we know or maybe don't even know? What if we meet someone, someone we know or maybe don't even know?

What if we meet someone, someone we know or maybe don't even know? What if we meet someone, someone we know or maybe don't even know? What if we meet someone, someone we know or maybe don't even know? or whatever it might be. There's no right or wrong. It's just beautiful to see our intentions. And if you like to speak to it as much as you like, or as little as you like, honoring each other. And also, if you want to show up with silence, that's fine. So in small groups, one person, the first person will share something about their intention. Just a short, maybe 30 seconds, or at most a minute, and then the next person, and then the next person I'll come back to. So we'll go around and around, make sure everybody has time to share, only speak from your experience, not guiding, not directing, asking questions from others. Just show up as you are. And if you want to see paths or hold space, silent space, that's perfectly fine. But such a beautiful opportunity for receiving support, giving support, recognizing, acknowledging, just very take advantage, take advantage of this. So I'm going to create the breakout rooms and take care of yourselves with kindness, take care of each other with kindness. Okay, so here we go. Hi, and welcome back. And if you'd like to share any reflections, you can raise your zoom hand or type them in chat, either about the guided meditation or small groups. What did you notice? What arose, especially if you haven't spoken in this group ever, or for a while, you're welcome to share your reflections to step forward. We'll take one or two reflections. Ali, please. Hi, thanks, Nikki, for doing this and creating this space for us. So it's interesting, because the inner critic and all that that I do participate in, that I have organically, you know, I do mindfulness and then the loving kindness arises out of that. I don't repeat the pattern, I mean, the saying that much, but then out of the blue, for some reason, I started kissing my own hand like this. I have no idea where it came from or what it came to, but I like it. But when I remember, you know, to be kind to myself, I don't know where that gesture came from. I don't know, maybe I cook for myself so much. That's why. So I kissed, you know, kissing my own hand like this, but that's a nice gesture. I've never had it before. And then the other insight that came, that I just immediately went to find out where that came from and all that. That's not really important at this point. I mean, I'm just enjoying it. I remember to do it. That's sweet. That is so sweet. Thank you for sharing that, Ali. That just gladdens my heart so much. You know, these physical gestures, sometimes giving ourselves a hug or just appreciating putting your hand on our hearts. Oh, this is, oh, I just tried it. It's so lovely. Just, oh, sweetheart, thank you for doing all these things for me. Dear hand, it's also thanking your hand. Like, oh my God, I just feel this appreciation for this hand that types and cleans and cooks and just does try it. Everyone it's, it's pretty wild. It's the sense of appreciation. It's very sweet. Come on. What do you have to lose kissing your own? It's very sweet. Thank you, Ali. Thanks for sharing that. Just such a beautiful gesture of appreciating this person who serves you, takes care of you. Yeah, that's very sweet. Thank you. There's a lot of cooking, especially in the pandemic time. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Ali. And Jesse says, thanks, Nikki, for an amazing practice. I am so excited for St. Metta Day. Oh, that's great. Love that. Thank you for that, Jesse. Yeah. Maybe we'll make space for one last reflection, if anybody wants to share or ask a question. Are we close? And for those who haven't been to Happy Air for a while, I'm experimenting with a, you know, 50 minute, five, zero minute format instead of one hour, just to see what it feels like. And so far, it felt a little lighter and felt good. So yeah, there are quick reflections, questions. What was it like for you to have your intention witnessed? Or shared by others? Was it empowering, supportive, scary? I know you have thoughts. Fred, please. Thank you, Nikki. Yeah, I find it powerful and important to actually say I want to live with a more open heart, to have an aspiration that's really unrelated to any that I might have had as a younger person that has nothing to do with acquiring or building a career or anything like that. And that there's a kind of seriousness about the intention that is increased by stating it and stating it in public that, yes, this is actually what I want to do with my life now. There's sort of a boldness about that. And I like that. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, beautiful. Thank you, Fred. There's a boldness about that. Yeah. Yes, may we all be bold? I see a couple more hands. And so let's just honor those and then close. But I'll ask. See, Claire, and even before that, I think people are in chat are telling me that Jeannie is waving her physical hand. But Jeannie, I don't see everyone. So can you possibly? Oh, here, I see you there. OK, you can unmute. There you go. Yes, I don't know how to do this hand raising. I've got this little iPad. So I was just my experience was that my partner was very gracious. Listen to me. It was really nice to share my kind of a new understanding of thought I had. Then I was going listen, wanting to listen to him. And we ran out of time. And so I didn't, you know, so I'm not used to the time thing. I haven't regulated it well to so that, you know, we kind of know internally how much time we have and how to, you know, when to change off or switch. Yeah, yeah. I hear that. I hear you appreciate that. They listened to you with care. And there is a regret. I still wanted to listen. And I wish I had regulated my time or I still haven't got that done. I think what helps Jeannie for you and also for everyone else is what we're doing here in the group is to turn to before we used to do monologues. Like one person would talk for a while, but now we've changed that. So it's more a spiral. So each person, as I mentioned, shares just 30 seconds or at most a minute, just a tiny little nugget. Yeah. And then the next person, person shares and then the next person so that everybody has time. But I do appreciate your wish to have honored them. So I'm glad you said that so I could bring that up. So sure. Okay. You get the last word, Claire, and welcome, Stuart. First time here live rather than a recording. Yay. How wonderful. Welcome. This is great. Yay. Live is good. All right, Claire. Just to follow up on your discussion of the way the groups work. We were a three person group. And in fact, we did sort of stick to the 32nd principle. But what was really nice was that each person seemed to build on the person preceding them. It really was sort of an upwards spiral. It was really very lovely. Beautiful. We all felt that we were giving each other something to each other. Yeah, yeah, great. You can have said it better. The, the idea of this, the beauty of the spiral is the uplift that happens, especially when you talk about your intention. So beautiful. Like it just it's, it's a virtuous cycle. It just keeps going around and we give each other gifts. So that's exactly the idea. Thank you, Claire, for sharing how beautifully that that worked. Lovely. So, so thank you all. Thank you all for your practice. Thank you, Jerry. Happy Metta all year around. Exactly. Happy Metta all year around, everyone. Thank you all for your practice. Thank you for your cultivation. May you be well. May you be happy. May all beings be well and free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Take good care. Be well. See you on Wednesday.
