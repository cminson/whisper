So the purpose of a body scan is to simply become aware of the physical sensations that arise moment to moment in our bodies. 
We're not trying to change the sensations. 
We're not trying to replace the sensations. 
We're just fine-tuning our awareness of the body. 
So when you're ready, you can bring your attention, bring your awareness to the sensations in the toes of the left foot. 
Just notice, what do they feel like? Maybe it's not clear. 
That's okay. 
Maybe wiggling the toes is helpful. 
Now you can bring your awareness to the top of your left foot. 
What does it feel like right now? Just noticing whatever the physical sensations are. 
Tingling, throbbing. 
Or maybe you're not sure. 
Maybe it can't quite feel anything. 
That's okay too. 
See if you can hang in there with us. 
And noticing the ankle of the left foot. 
Just the raw, simple sensations. 
You can bring your awareness to the lower part of the leg. 
The shin, the calf. 
Scanning up to your knee. 
Noticing whatever is present in your left knee. 
Bringing your awareness to your upper leg. 
The left leg. 
The thigh. 
Now scanning into the top of the right foot. 
You can start with the toes. 
Guiding the awareness to the top of the foot. 
The ankle. 
We're not trying to force anything. 
We're not trying to imagine things. 
We're just gently placing our awareness and noticing what we notice in these different areas. 
You can bring your awareness to the lower part of the right leg. 
The shin, the calf. 
Into the right knee. 
Bringing the awareness up to the right thigh, upper leg. 
Scanning up into the hips. 
The belly. 
Are there any unpleasant sensations that are arising? Can you notice any tendency to push these away or skip past them? Can you rest and noticing what it feels like to want to push them away, to move faster? Bring your awareness to the sensations in the chest. 
And the back. 
Now guiding the awareness to the fingers of the left hand. 
Noticing what they feel like. 
You can start at the tips of the fingers. 
Feel the palm of the hand. 
With a wrist. 
Bringing awareness to the forearm and the upper arm. 
It may be that you don't feel a lot, but you're not even sure. 
That's okay too. 
Now bringing awareness to the tips of the fingers on the right hand. 
The palm of the hand. 
The wrist. 
The forearm, upper arms. 
Scanning up to the shoulders. 
Guiding awareness to the throat. 
The back of the head. 
Through the face. 
The jaw. 
An area around the eyes. 
The scalp. 
And the top of the head. 
Then we can begin again. 
Starting with the toes of the left foot. 
And this way just very gently scanning through the different parts, the different regions, the different areas of the body. 
Some areas may be alive with sensations. 
Some areas may not. 
It's perfectly fine. 
Maybe through different passes through the body you might find that the changes. 
So now I'll be silent so you can do a body scan at your own pace. 
Trying to cover all areas of the body. 
In a way that is gentle and kind. 
And allowing without trying to force anything or change anything. 
As best we can. 
As best we can.
