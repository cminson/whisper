 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, good day. Hello everyone. We come to the end of this series on the six qualities of the Dharma. Five qualities of the Dharma. And one of them is that it doesn't belong to time. There was a, I mentioned yesterday, a story of a celestial being that challenged a young monk and said, you're young, you should enjoy sensual pleasures. And you're pursuing things that are taking time. Pursue something that's immediate, sensual desires. And the monk says, no, it takes time to pursue sensual desires. I don't know about time. I'm not living in time. I'm just being here present for what takes no time. And so this idea that this Dharma is something that's immediate, that's right here, implies that it is here in some way. And I think it's probably fair to say that when we're often too preoccupied with our concerns to see the Dharma operating right here. And how do we see it? One of the most common ways in which these ancient teachings of the Buddha emphasize is we see it by first seeing that there is attachments, greed, aversion, delusion, that there is conceit, there's concern with self, self-preoccupation. Often our preoccupations are centered, and the main character is me, myself and I. And we see that clearly. So there's an honesty, and this is what's happening. I see what's happening as opposed to being pushed around by it, being carried by it, and kind of involved participating in this stream of thoughts and preoccupations. You just really see it all. This is what's happening. And at the same time as seeing what's happening, seeing there's something about that's here now which is not caught in it. Something which is not right now, which is not involved in greed, in hatred, in delusion, in conceit. Right here, our preoccupations are not the whole picture. There is available right here something which is not preoccupied, something that's not involved in conceit. And one of the clues, one of the aspects of this is the simplicity of awareness itself. The more simple we can be aware of what's actually happening, we sense that in what's happening, in that awareness, there's no preoccupation. That's where the timeless, immediate Dhamma is found, in seeing that contrast. Oh yes, I am caught up. And yes, there's part of me that knows that, that's not caught up. To see what is not caught up. And sometimes our caught-upness goes away, and we just see and clearly know that which is not caught. And I liken it to, if we're holding something in our hand, we might be so concerned with the object that we don't notice that we're grasping it. Noticing we're grasping it, we might notice, I don't have to grasp it, I can hold it with an open hand in a relaxed way, just hold it up, the hand upright, and hold it there. And then I'm so aware of the relaxed hand, I'm holding it and there's a relaxed hand at the same time. So to see those two things, we see it, and to experience this for ourselves, to know this for ourselves, the Dhamma that's immediate, that's here, to be known by the wise. So take heart in your meditation that if you should get caught up in preoccupations, those preoccupations are the stepping stone to freedom. By seeing clearly, oh, I'm preoccupied, and then appreciating that, oh, maybe here, in addition to being preoccupied, there is a place of not being preoccupied in the knowing, in the peace that's there. So I hope that makes sense, and with that we'll begin. And again, for this day, we'll just sit quietly and you're left to yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, when there is no time for the Dharma, because the Dharma is always here, always with us, always onward leading, in that it shows us where attention needs to be so that we can be free. If attention is caught and involved in our thoughts, we're not free. If we're thinking, but also know we're thinking, we can also know the timeless freedom of now. And in a sense, you need to give time to experience the freedom of here and now. You have to give time to experience the timeless freedom of here. That means there has to be some stopping of the incessant leading forward, preoccupation, rumination, just enough so you can see clearly what's happening. And in that clearing, see the way forward to be free. And may it be from what we're learning through this practice that we create a clearing for others, we create the time, the presence, the sacred pause, the sacred openness to the moment in which we can receive others, know others, that they can have the experience of being known in freedom. Maybe they won't recognize it exactly what's happening. But something in their hearts will know that they're being received and known by a person who has space, openness, awareness of them without our neediness and greed and aversion and judgments, resentments, without our fantasies and imaginations and delusions. What a great gift to give others. May it be that through this practice we give people the gift of freedom and attention and respect. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may our practice contribute to that. Thank you.
