The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So a couple of questions that came in this, so well actually one of them came in a while ago
and I hadn't had a chance to get to it yet. And it's about kind of in this time,
the amount of time we're spending online and navigating that. So that seems relevant.
I will start with that one and then move to another one that I've heard from several different
directions this week. So it seems like maybe it's relevant, maybe it's in the air.
So the first one, the question is, I feel the pressure to be online more than ever with work
and news and staying connected with family and friends. It becomes a habit.
It seems to become a habit to paper over loneliness. Do you have any advice on balancing it with time
for silence, self-reflection, and being fully present? So I think it is important.
I mean, I think many of us, especially if we live alone, I live alone.
So it's like my entire social life has come to the computer and going grocery shopping.
That's pretty much it for me. And so there is, and all of my information that I get.
So just as this question says, my work, my staying connected with what's happening in the world,
my social interactions, everything is this screen. And there is some tension there.
There's some stress that comes with that. And so it is important to know what your limits are,
I think. I've certainly seen it's helpful to switch up the interactions.
I will use telephone often for talking to my friends.
And in some ways, in a funny way, it feels even more intimate in a way.
You just got their voice in your ear.
So I find switching up the interactions helps.
What I hear in this question, though, there's a little pressure to be online.
And that it's kind of like almost like a drive or something that is,
there's a question about it, papering over loneliness.
And so if that's happening, you know, to be curious about what is your motivation,
why are you going online? Is it to avoid something?
Is it because it's hard to deal with what's happening in your present moment experience?
So that's something to really check in with.
I think that's a key for balancing our experience with getting everything online
with our time for ourselves, for silence, for reflection,
is to look at what's the intention behind checking in, going online.
Like, for instance, if you check the news, is it just out of boredom?
Is it because you're kind of at odds for a few moments and don't have anything to do?
So you just kind of go to the habit of, oh, I guess I look on the computer right now because that's what I do.
So being aware of that, you know, be aware of your motivation.
And if you find that the motivation is coming from a place of kind of wanting to not meet something that's happening in the present moment,
if there's a kind of a little bit of avoidance happening there, then maybe that's a good time for reflection.
Maybe that is a good time to kind of let yourself sit for a few minutes with that feeling.
Instead of immediately going to something that will paper over it, the loneliness as this person points to.
So I think it's important to balance, always it's important to balance a time for ourselves and time spent with others.
And particularly with this, with everything going through the computer with many of us.
I mean, some of us may be, you know, isolating with a family that you're kind of going nuts with and like the computer becomes then a respite from that.
So, you know, there's many different experiences people have, but I think whatever your situation is,
looking at the balance between what you're experiencing in your home with your family, with what you're experiencing in your environment,
with what you experience on the computer, and what are you giving yourself time to be with yourself, really?
Are you giving yourself time to settle and connect with what's happening for you?
There's a lot happening for us right now.
I find the kind of waves of energy and emotion are quite, there's quite a lot happening.
And if we're immediately just jumping to, you know, oh, let me do the next thing online, we are missing a lot of the unfolding of what is, everybody says that this is unprecedented.
You know, this is really, really unusual.
I was talking to somebody earlier this week who was saying they were confused and they were lonely and they were, you know, it's like,
and the way this person expresses it is kind of like, there's no playbook for right now.
And it's like, he realized, oh, yeah, there isn't a playbook for this.
This is like completely new.
And that allowed him to kind of land a little bit more with like the confusion and the loneliness and just recognizing the emotions that are going through.
They're not just yours, they're not just about you, they're kind of the conditions not only of your own experience, your own past experience, but also the conditions of the moment.
One thing I found in this time is like habits, really old, deep conditioned habits that had been really in many ways had been much weakened through the practice.
I'm finding them resurface.
And it seems there's something, you know, I think, and I've talked to quite a few people who have said this kind of thing or it's like, oh, you mean that's not like, I'm not the only one that's happening to know, you know, this is this is a very
broad thing that's happening for a lot of people that the conditions are so stressful in a way that we like revert to some of our old conditioning.
And so if you're noticing that, if you're noticing old habits and patterns come up, really give yourself some compassion, give yourself some space for feeling that.
I feel for feel like there's some things that I'm feeling now that's like, wow, I haven't experienced that since I was in the Peace Corps, like, you know, that was like 25 years ago.
My goodness, you know, just some of those, those feelings are so, you know, it's almost like they're unfamiliar because I haven't felt them in so long.
But then it's like, no, this is familiar, I know this.
So it's, it's a habit and then there's the understanding of the conditions of this time contributing to that.
So it's really important to take the time to not judge ourselves for all of the feelings that are coming up and to give ourselves space to kind of like ride those waves.
Be with those waves and see if there can be some compassion and some holding of that.
Then one thing I will, I will say the very last part of this question, do you have any advice on balancing the time online with time for silent self reflection and being fully present.
Well, the thing that I will say there is we can be fully present with anything.
Being online doesn't mean we can't be fully present. In fact, I hope you're exploring being fully present when you're online.
And to, to, to like, just if there's any sense of somehow the avenue of connecting through the computer being antithetical to being fully present, let that thought go.
It's, it is possible. It's different. It feels different.
But it is possible to be fully present with, you know, like the mind trying to get these the cues that we're used to and not seeing everything.
So there's, there's, there's, there's, there's a lot that we can be aware of the discomfort of not being able to fully read people seeing how we respond to
when people have their, have their, you know, their camera in a certain angle or it's, it's like there's a lot, a lot to be aware of.
So being fully present is possible wherever, whatever we're doing. So I just wanted to put that one in there too.
Then the other question that came up was about thoughts and in particular repetitive thoughts, looping thoughts was the way the person expressed this.
Did you talk about the phenomena when the mind gets caught in repetitive thought loop and how to mindfully address that situation.
So this person talked about it happening a lot in work situations and in particular this person explored or mentioned the
going back and revisiting something that has happened. So it's a loop about the past.
And just to say, I mean, I've experienced loops about the past loops about the future. So it's not just about the past, this kind of habit can happen.
We can have a habit of using thought to try to solve problems. And I think in some ways the, the capacity of our minds, we have this capacity to think about
experience, whether past or future, to think about experience and use that to learn and to plan and to model.
So it's, it's a function of our, of our human system that has this capacity to use thought in this way.
But it does sometimes get kind of on overdrive, you know, that, that it kind of gets out of control. It keeps repeating back on something.
It doesn't just reflect on it, think, oh, that, that's interesting. I've learned something about that. It keeps revisiting it.
And maybe trying, sometimes I've seen kind of the mind kind of like going back over the past, as if the going back over it could change the past.
You know, like it's almost like a trying to control the past by thinking through it in a different way. Or, you know, if I had only done this, then, you know, then this is what would be happening now.
And so, so the, the mind kind of can get stuck in that place.
And again, it's, it's connected to that, that capacity that we have to reflect and to learn from our actions and the consequences of those actions.
So we, we, we think back on things, we see what's happened and we think, if I had done this, maybe it would have played out this way. And so that's a kind of a learning mechanism that we have.
But it tends to get caught up in views about ourselves, views about what we want to happen.
And one, one pattern that I see often, particularly about the looping in the past that I've seen for myself and maybe happening with this person in a way.
It's like,
when,
when we see that the situation that's happening now, you know, maybe connected to the past, whatever's unfolded from the past, maybe we don't like what's happening now.
There's, you know, it's kind of like we, we feel, gee, if I'd made that decision differently, something different would be playing out now.
In a sense, perhaps that we don't like the outcome of our past choices or the past situation. We don't like that outcome. And so the mind goes back, trying to revisit what would have made a better outcome now.
So the, the, the, the what's happening there sometimes the reason why the mind is revisiting the past is because it doesn't like the present.
You can't be able to kind of go, yeah, this is the present. Those were the choices. This is the present. And so that's an important piece to explore.
So we can explore the kind of the looping quality of the mind, but what is that looping, like, motivated by, and, and often it's motivated by wanting a different present moment.
So can you open to or allow yourself to open to that experience, whatever it is, I mean, the, sometimes we're kind of like almost in denial about what the present moment experience is, is we're looping in the past.
We're not able to really fully open to maybe their sadness or grief or a sense of loss or confusion or anger, you know, a whole bunch of different emotions might be there kind of situations might be there that are a result of what happened in the past.
And the mind is kind of like in denial or, or, or saying, you know, this is not acceptable. And in order for this not to be happening them, I have to go back and change that so it kind of, it kind of goes in loops in that way trying to kind of
change the present by revising the past in its in the mind, it gets very confused in this in this situation thinking can actually change the past by thinking about it.
So the, the one thing to kind of be curious about or explore is the, the thought emotion thought cycle, because the thoughts about the past are coming up.
You know, and they're, they could be one at one thing they could be based on is a kind of a rejection or a not able to really fully land with what's happening now.
And so the, and sometimes the feelings that are happening now, the anger, the confusion, the loss, the sadness, the grief, the, the, it's like we're, we're not so comfortable being with some of those feelings.
And so the those emotions actually want to be felt emotions often actually want to be acknowledged and felt and open to.
But they're, but often when they're uncomfortable, we don't kind of want to go there.
We don't want to go there. And so what happens one teacher, one of my colleagues guy Armstrong has used the phrase, thoughts come off of emotions, like mud comes off a flywheel.
So the emotions are kind of spinning the emotions are there. And if we're not aware of that pattern, then what it's doing is it's spewing off those thoughts.
Another way I sometimes think about it is that, you know, emotions kind of wanting to be felt or known, send up thoughts as flares when we're not able to really be with them.
Now, they're kind of like saying, Hey, you need to pay attention to me, only the thoughts are what catch our attention.
So we, we get looped into the thoughts instead of where the thoughts are coming from, from the emotions and attending to the emotions.
And so if you have some looping repetitive thoughts that can be useful to check into, well, what's happening now in the present moment, connected to that pattern of thought, in terms of emotion.
Is there something like if there was something in the past, if it's looping from the past, then perhaps there's, there's a kind of a result of that experience that there's an emotion connected with that might be useful to kind of see if you can land with.
Can you be aware of that be feel it in your body actually be aware of the emotion of, of sadness or loss or grief or anger or confusion, can you be aware of that now.
Often we're kind of like there's a part of our mind that's a little afraid to be with some of those emotions, but we have more capacity than we give ourselves credit for.
And if we can actually open to it sometimes it's more, there's more of a kind of a relaxing into it's like, oh yeah, that's, that's what's here and it almost feels like we're holding ourselves like we might hold a child who's frustrated or confused you know where we can hang out with ourselves in that way.
And when, when that emotion is met in that way, then it often doesn't need to send up those flares anymore. And so that pattern of the looping thought can diminish when those emotions are are connected with.
There's a lot of other thoughts to, to say here maybe I'll just bring in a couple of others before kind of opening it up to reflections in the group.
The loop about the past. I think it often it can have to do with a bunch, a couple of different things you know it can, it can have to do with ethics, you know that we've done something that created harm.
And that has happened. That's really worth attending to because our minds will will kind of loop trying to what I've seen my mind do is it kind of tries to either figure out how it wasn't so bad that I did that thing, or that it wasn't, it wasn't my fault that, you know, some
condition that led to that so there's like a kind of a not wanting to take responsibility when there's been a kind of an ethical breach. And what I've learned over these years of practice is that aligning myself with acknowledging yeah that was, that wasn't skillful.
The system can begin to land in. Okay, this is what it's like to have done something that caused harm. And that feeling, you know that feeling of this is what it's like to have done something that caused harm is very similar to what we call shame.
It's a slightly different quality, shame's got that looping quality, shame's got that, you know, trying to figure out how to get out of it quality, but the quality of, oh yeah, this is what it's like to have caused harm there's more of a sense of openness and compassion for oneself, and
others who have been harmed. And then there's a way forward. So if the looping is around some kind of an ethical breach. It's really important to kind of own that to own that piece.
The loops about past and future can have to do with wanting to control the situation, a feeling of, you know, if I'd only done it this way then I'd be in more control now or loops about the future of often loops about the future have to do with uncertainty
and anxiety of that not knowing what's going to happen. And that often links in with the wish to control the wish to, to know how things are going to unfold. And with that it's really useful to open to that feeling of the vulnerability of not having control.
It's true. It's true that, that there's that inherent vulnerability we can navigate our way towards some measure of seeming control at times that we can do things and affect the outcome.
And there's a very deep pointing to the truth of the vulnerability that we are as human. It's just vulnerable human being that we are that, you know, we don't know when we're going to die we don't know, you know, it's like a choice a simple neutral
choice of whether I turn left or right at a corner may have life or death consequences. We don't know we don't know that there's there's so many things that are out of our control.
So aligning with that truth is something that the Buddha pointed to in some of his deepest teachings around acknowledging the impermanent unreliable not self nature of experience he pointed to recognizing the uncontrollable nature of experience as being a way to
kind of align with those truths. And so some of the looping might have to do with not wanting to acknowledge that vulnerability. So that's another another key kind of place to explore is
can I be okay. That I don't have complete control. That vulnerability is actually, it's actually beautiful. When we can really open to that vulnerability.
It's very tender. It's, it's, it's, it's, it opens us to, I guess the reason it feels tender is because when we see that vulnerability deeply in our, in our practice we understand that it's not just us that's vulnerable.
It's everyone that's vulnerable. And so that opens us to compassion, kind of a sense of tenderness for just how vulnerable and fragile, we are as living beings.
It's a beautiful, a beautiful place to land in our experience.
