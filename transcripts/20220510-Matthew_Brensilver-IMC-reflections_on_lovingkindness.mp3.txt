So, it's nice to practice with you.
You know, I know I said, ever pretend in your practice, something like that, but then you know what I thought of? I thought of Carol Wilson saying, fake meta is better than real aversion any day.
That stuck with me. That's true.
But kind of kidding aside, I do feel like we want to be careful about pretending.
And sometimes the Brahmavihara realm feels like a zone where we're being enlisted to pretend something.
And the heart rebels against that sense of inauthenticity.
And so the encouragement is to find our own ways, like how can we have this really intimate encounter with the moment and find ways of practicing that feel real, alive, true.
So, the Buddha suggested that fear and wanting are two sides of the same coin, the coin of clinging.
And sometimes I don't like to kind of trot out neuroscience so often, but sometimes I read something that reminds me a lot of Dharma.
So the point is not to get the science exactly, but to hear the resonance with what this tradition offers is Shelly Warlow and her colleague Ken Barrage.
So motivational salience can occur with either positive valence as incentive or negative valence as fear, and it's possible to flip the valence between the two forms under some conditions.
Despite being affectively opposite, the two may still share some neural and psychological features.
Neuraly both may engage mesolimbic systems, including dopamine signals in the nucleus accumbens.
Consistent with an amygdala role in bivalent positive and negative motivational salience.
Some neurons can respond to both aversive outcomes or rewarding outcomes or to their predictive cues.
Rather than strictly encoding only reward or fear per se, some neurons might integrate sensory information, context and motivational state to assign motivational salience with positive or negative valence.
These are particular targets making them either wanted or feared.
Wanting and fear.
About as far apart as possible, but maybe they're closer siblings than they might appear.
Scientist K. Tai, she says, fear has an authoritarian command over the rest of the brain. And Tich Nhat Hanh said, fearlessness is the ultimate joy.
Meta practice is heart practice is really about stepping out of wanting and stepping out of fear.
And sometimes we step out of that and there's just love. But sometimes meta practice, of course, is we step out of wanting and fear by getting really close to it.
So, anxiety depends on avoidance to some measure and the medicine around anxiety is actually to approach the feared experience we drain the effective emotional charge from our anxiety and avoidance by doing the opposite by moving towards and mindfulness.
Mindfulness is one way of moving towards it's an approach orientation, all of mindfulness is an approach orientation we permit our pain into awareness.
But in a sense, love is like the fullest approach we can make with our pain.
With our love we get so close to what is unresolved in our heart that we begin to habituate to it and that pain loses some of its electrical charge.
We start to, the meta actually starts to be a way of digesting fear. This is one of the classical ways that meta is prescribed for fear.
We're stepping out of fear and out of wanting or controlling because we know there is attached love.
A love that includes some measure of possessiveness and there's a love that is a pure giving, no controlling.
Yeah, and attached love, that sounds bad in Buddhist spheres, right, but it's okay, like we're going to have to pick our spots, I feel, as humans, maybe especially as lay people, people with partners or children, parents and commitments.
So some measure of attachment is, I think, inevitable.
A friend I've known for many years now and I've known his daughter, who is now 13, since her birth. And I asked him, you know, how are you?
And he quoted, I think it's Susan Orlean, the writer.
He said, a parent is only as happy as their least happy child.
And I don't even have kids, but I know enough to just be touched by that sentiment, you know, okay.
Yeah, only as happy as a least happy child, you know, some measure of, I don't know what we want to call that, the complexities of these bonds, these karmically rich bonds with people that I don't think can be purified of all clinging or something like that.
Can we consent to that? Can we bear that with grace?
And we cultivate the love that is without conditions, that is a warmth without control or possession, the warmth, the kindness of metta, which is a kind of simple friendliness and kindness while wishing.
The proximate cause being seeing the goodness, seeing goodness, love in the face of goodness.
That's an image of a mother cow gazing at her calf. And sometimes we're the mother cow, sometimes we're the calf.
But we sense goodness, yeah, there is well-wishing. And just for me, amidst this kind of cycle of grieving, you know, I've become so sensitive to goodness.
Like, just little bits of it that I see in others, you know, if I'm going to cry, that's what's going to make me do it. Goodness is going to make me cry.
And there's a phenomena in psychology known as moral elevation, where witnessing acts of moral beauty inspires and elevates us, and we become more devoted to goodness in seeing it.
We become the kind of wholesome, prosocial movement of our own heart is drawn out by witnessing it, right? We become very, this practice makes us very sensitive to goodness.
And loving kindness is being moved by your own goodness. It's being moved by it.
It's not the goodness we put on our resume or something.
And as I said in the sit, it's not even like, well, I'll offer this love because of, yeah, you get into the because of, and then there's always the contradictory whatever, you know, you get into debates about worthiness and deserving and all this.
And it's like, no, no, no, not because of I'm just offering care, yeah, being moved, moved by your own goodness.
And to abide in this is very healing, very healing and not self-indulgent.
It will connect us more deeply with all beings and a sense of warmth of radiating from our heart.
There's sometimes just so we get quiet. There's nothing but warmth. There's nothing on the other side of our love and emerging from that, emerging from that.
It really dramatizes the pain of hatred, of divisiveness, of separation, of aversion.
Hatred becomes less and less tenable. That's in less tenable.
And so sometimes met is abiding in love and sometimes it is lowering our, our resistance, bringing love to what needs love.
Because the truth of dukkha that needs to be mourned for a long time.
And that takes love.
It really is often almost unbelievable that being human is like this. Being human is like this.
That's going to take some love to open to.
And the met practice, it helps kind of, sometimes we just cannot feel something until the love falls out something in our heart.
And so in these ways, metta is both, it's a purification practice and it's a practice of cultivation, many, many blessings of metta.
So stop. And yeah, wish you all much, much goodness today. Yeah. Let us, let us be attuned to the signs of goodness in ourselves and others.
Open our heart to that today. Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
