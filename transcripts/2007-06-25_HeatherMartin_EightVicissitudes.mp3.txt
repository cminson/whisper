 So I have a question before I get started. Who was here yesterday morning when I was here? A few of you, not so many. Oh, that's good then. I can repeat some of the things I said. I wasn't exactly up. You can go now. I wasn't exactly making a elaborate dormitory. You can imagine I was sleeping most of the day. But what I'd like to do is sort of take on, continue on some of what I was saying yesterday, which I'll just recap briefly. I was talking about how we, in theory, understand about the eight vicissitudes, pleasure and pain, loss and gain, praise and blame, fame and distribute as our general experience and how these things are constantly coming and going in our lives. And we know this in one way on a certain level, intellectually, theoretically. But most of us, most of the time, don't really behave as though we know this. Because what we do, of course, is we want just four and not the other four. We want the nice ones and we don't want the other ones. Not just that we don't behave that way. When things are fine, pleasant, when there's praise and so on, we tend to go into kind of cruise mode. Everything's great. It's how it's supposed to be. And yet, as soon as we experience loss or blame or pain or anything else, we immediately become very alert and try and do something about fixing it, blaming, frustration, etc. We get very charged up when we suffer from the downside of these ups and downs of the world of our experience. In spite of that, we should know better that we understand the theory. We behave a lot as though we've forgotten that this is inevitable and part of being a human being, living on this plane. So what I'm thinking about tonight is, of course, me suffering in pain today and yesterday and what it's like being on the downside of, you know, physical health, for example, which mostly I'm very fortunate to say I'm really healthy and I don't get sick very much, so I'm not very good. But it comes to suffering in this way, not that it's been too deadly, but it's been really, really uncomfortable. And, you know, we all know what that's like, everything aching and squirming around in bed and everything. So the thing about when we experience the difficulties of this world, as I just said, we get very motivated to engage ourselves with something. What I heard years and years ago, apparently, when I believe it was Kalu Rinpoche, was visiting Salt Spring Island where he eventually had a three-year retreat, one of the first in the West three-year retreat sites up on a mountain on Salt Spring. While going nearby on a ferry with a few of his devotees, he said, beware those sleepy southern Gulf Islands, because those lovely southern Gulf Islands, of which Salt Spring is one of them, they're so lovely, it's such paradise that beware, you tend to go to sleep. We tend to not wake up when everything's fine. We go, great, this is how it's supposed to be, and then I can kick back. So it's really important actually to keep being aware of, am I taking things for granted, am I cruising here or am I actually still looking at what's happening, am I waking up, do I know what's going on? As I said yesterday, it's absolutely essential for us to remember this and to get this more than in theory, to just really keep being aware of it so that it sinks into our experience, so that it governs how we live, not just days up in useless theory, is that the ups and the downs belong to each other. You cannot have ups without downs. And as I said yesterday afternoon, it's like a wave, it's like a lot of waves, but when you have a wave, a wave has got two sides to it, it's got an upside and a downside, and you cannot have one without the other, it's not a wave. We don't like this, we don't agree with this, we don't want this to be so, we want just the four and not the eight. So this is just a little story about how motivated we get when we struggle, when there is trouble, how immediately it calls forth a lot of energy for ourselves and a lot of reactivity and a lot of activity and so on. And this is one of your stories, and this was probably some of you have read this, and it was from the San Francisco Chronicle, and it was just before Christmas a year and a half ago. I'm going to read it to you, it's called The Bound Whale Freed. Do you remember this story? I'm going to read it anyway because it's such a sweet story. It was December the 14th, 2005. There was a female humpback whale who had become entangled in a spider web of crab traps and lines. She was weighted down by hundreds of pounds of traps that caused her to struggle to stay afloat. She also had hundreds of yards of line wrapped around her body, her tail, her torso, and one line tugging in her mouth. A fisherman spotted her just east of the Farallon Islands outside of the Golden Gate and radioed an environmental group for help. Within a few hours the rescue team arrived and determined that she was in such bad state that the only way to save her was to dive in and untangle her, a very dangerous proposition. One slap of her tail could kill a rescuer. They worked for hours with curved knives and eventually freed her. When she was free, the divers say, she swam in what seemed like joyous circles. She then came back to each and every diver one at a time and nudged them, pushing them gently around. She thanked them. Some said it was the most incredibly beautiful experience of their lives. The guy who cut the rope out of her mouth says her eye was following him the whole time. He will never be the same. May we all be so blessed and as fortunate in the new year to be surrounded by those who love us enough to help untangle us from that which is binding us and to remember to thank them. Such a sweet story. But I just think of how much energy went into that particular situation, which of course was called for. She was in such dire straits. But how typically we don't put a lot of energy into times when everything's fine. We just take them for granted, you know, we just familiarity breeds content and everything's okay. Let's not bother about the whales. We only get excited about them when they're in really bad shape, don't we? So it's just a way to think about how we respond to the world. We react when there's difficulty. We get all excited and dramatic. When we meet people, we don't say, you know, how are you doing? Oh, I'm fine. Everything's great. Weather's pretty benign. We just immediately launch into what's dramatic and what's problematic. Oh, you'll never believe what happened to me last week. We just tune out a lot of the time. And this whole practice is about waking up. So it's just useful to be aware of how we do this. So today, especially this morning, I was really, really uncomfortable. I try not to treat drugs, you know, I try to keep that really to a minimum. But by 10 past 11, I was just really going through it this morning. So I took my Tylenol. But you know, I was so practicing. It was fantastic. I was really able to be with this is what's happening. The truth is, this is uncomfortable. These are the sensations. This is what they feel like the bare experience of the discomfort. And so I did not proliferate into Oh, my God, what am I going to do? Am I going to make it that tonight? What are they going to think? I did not need to. I was able to call on my practice and just be with the discomfort, you know, and the unpleasantness and finally decide when I needed to take a pill and stuff. And I just I'm so grateful for being able to not get all upset, which is course what we tend to do when we get up when we when we suffer, when we struggle. When I was in Burma, last November, which is the first time I had ever been to Burma. Second time I'd ever been to Asia, I went to a little atram when I was 22 or something in India to to guru and was all very cushy. And it was very well received. So this is the my second trip. And it was actually really quite challenging, I have to say. I mean, it was very uncomfortable. It was filthy. It was hot. I was sweating. There were flies everywhere. The radio was on sometimes, especially the first few days I was there. You hear about these stories and if anyone's been to practice in Burma, but the local people, if you have if you're lucky enough to have electricity, you turn on your radio for your neighbors within a mile or two. And they tend to do everything active wise and about between four and six in the morning because it gets really hot later. So four a.m. blaring radio just nearby, you know, really, really, really loud. And there's three things you hear on the radio in Burma, at least when I was there. One is music, which, you know, everyone has their own kind of taste of music. That wasn't my taste of music, have to say. After a while, it gets a little bit not enough. Party political broad, basically generals doing a bunch of political talk and then chanting the Dharma. Amazing. The refugees and the precepts pouring out across the fields, you know, and then back to some political stuff and then music till two o'clock the next morning. Then I took a while to learn how to keep the mosquitoes out of my mosquito net. I didn't know that you had to tuck it in underneath your mattress to keep them from getting in there. So I just dropped the mosquito net and trapped in with me all the mosquitoes that were now living underneath my bed. I mean, it took me a while to learn all this and clean everything to my satisfaction and so on and so forth. So I was really struggling for this first period of time. And then the it's not a translator, the interpreter, Martha, who was here last week, who was here when when they were here? Not that many of you, some of you. Well, anyway, her name is Martha, his interpreter. I spoke to her after about, you know, a week of this struggling and not sleeping and, you know, discomfort, everything. And I said, I'd like a private interview because I'd like to leave. I wanted to say my respects and pay my money and get out of there. And unfortunately, I took with me a lonely planet guide. So I was busy reading all about much comfier places in Burma to go to practice, you know, where it's quiet and where it's cool and where it's beautiful. And so she was amazing. And she said to me, I understand, I understand. And then she said, Can I ask you a question? I hope you don't mind. She's very sweet. And she said, Do you think it's possible with the music and the sweating and the mosquitoes and the dogs and the smoke and just think it's possible to be OK? And I kind of went, Why did I come to Burma anyway? Did I come to Burma to be comfy? I came to be free, you know, like this is perfect. Here I was totally caught up with the pain of it and the problem of it and making all my plans about what to do and how to get out of there. And instead of, Oh, right, can I just be here with this? And of course, I could and did and stayed and was really glad I stayed, needless to say. We tend to not be aware when it's difficult. We just get frustrated, get trying, get away from it. The difficulty is actually incredibly valuable. In fact, Utejani himself, he would say, struggle is good. And he'd, you know, rub his hands together gleefully. There was a woman how it works in his monastery is that we would have an interview, but there would be a group of us and there would be like five or six of us together and we'd go and have this interview with him and talk to him about our practice and questions as tough for his mom as we could, you know, an hour and a half, two, two and a half hours. This one woman in our particular group had a roommate come. Mostly they were, we had two people per room and she was by herself for a while and then she got a roommate and he is not at all rigid about do this, don't do that, sit for an hour, be quiet. He's just like, do whatever you do, but know why you're doing it. You know, so if you want to talk, know why you're talking and know what you're saying and know what's coming up. So, you know, use anything as a way to wake up and see what's going on. And so when this woman was saying that she was really, this roommate had come, the roommate wanted to talk to her all the time and she didn't want to talk. She wanted to practice. She was only there for three weeks. She wanted to be quiet. And so he'd say, great, as soon as your roommate arrives, fantastic practice. As soon as you see her, now watch yourself. Are you full of aversion? Are you judging? Are you trying to scheme out of order or are you noticing what you're doing? These problems in our lives serve to help us if we don't get caught, see what's going on, see our reactivities, see our blaming, see our stuff. We can see it with the pleasant, but we tend to not notice it so easily because it's more mellow. So we tend to fall asleep in those sleepy Southern Gulf islands. So use the difficulty because we're less asleep then so we can really see how reacting to things. What happens is if we do this, just looking at the clock and realizing how am I going to keep talking for another half an hour? Oh well, I'll answer questions if I run out of things to say. One of the things, there are three aspects of behavior which really are helpful in this, in looking at the difficulty. They are three of the parmies. The parmies are those 10 ways of behaving which we can work on and develop and perfect. That said, the Buddha was perfecting in all of those lifetimes before he became the Buddha. Three of them are extremely useful when we are dealing with difficulty. One of them is kindness. Because it's difficult to be in the difficulty or the pain or the upset. It's a really good, it's useful habit to get into as soon as we're struggling to bring in kindness. Be kind, be sympathetic for the fact that we're struggling. It may be, have some compassion for yourself, it may be be kind for yourself for having God all upset, maybe forgiveness because you blew it and you got mad at somebody or something. But bring some kind heart when we are suffering. It's said to be a soothing practice. And it does, it's totally reassuring and calming. And as you probably know, Thich Nhat Hanh says that when we're upset, it's like we have a three year old that's crying. And meta or kindness is like what we would do to that three year old is crying. You'd rock it, you know, you'd reassure it, it's okay. You know, you just stub your foot, you'll be all right. It's that attitude of friendliness and forgiveness and being on your side. That's invaluable when we're encountering difficulty. Another one is being with things as they actually are truthfulness. Like this morning when I was there thrashing around in bed and being miserable, being able to say this is this, this is a headache, these aching joints, I'd just be able to be with my aching joints just as they were just aching joints. This is just uncomfortable. The whole thing of truthfulness, I mean, it's an enormous topic and I won't go into it in detail, but our practice is to is to be with things just as they are without all the proliferation, without all the reactivity and everything. And this is extremely essential when we're facing difficulty, whatever that may be, loss, you know, somebody's blaming us or we're in an argument, that kind of a thing. It's like, okay, that's what's happening. I'm arguing. It brings us into the present moment and brings us back from being caught up in all of our strategizing how to fix it, how to get rid of it, how to improve it, how to blame and so on. So truthfulness, just the facts as the judge in court says, just the facts, please. So useful. We tend to add all the extra on top of the facts and just keep it to the what's going on here. It's really useful. Truth telling meditation. It's actually a huge relief because we cut through all of the extra embellishing and just get down to what's what's going on here as I'm frustrated. Oh, right. It just diminishes immediately the drama that we tend to build around it. And the third one, which is invaluable, is patience. Here we are in the midst of whatever the difficulty is we're in. And we need to just be able to hang in there with it. So we really need a lot of patience. I used to hate this whole idea of patience. I mean, when I, one of my earliest cine films that my father used to take, cine films way before videos. And I was a little girl with me stamping my foot and pounding my fist. Like I'm just not a patient type of person. And the idea of patience drive me crazy. I asked my mother twice, I remember asking her, what does patience mean? And being furious at the answer to that too. I don't like this kind of thing. So patience, patience, though, it doesn't, it doesn't really mean put up with so much as it's a kind of unglamorous courage. I love that phrase. It takes some strength to hold steady. You know, it actually is a very strong force to be able to just be here with this. So it patient, it isn't about wanting it to be over and going ahead in time and either impatiently or patiently waiting for the next thing. It's much more immediate. It's just hanging in here, just being with this. And when we, one of the things I find the most useful is remembering that everything's going to change. And this is not how it's going to be forever. This is just a time to be here. And I think it's a very important temporary situation. And of course, emotion, which is so dramatic for us is just, you know, coming and going. So the remembering that everything will change and like these are weather patterns is really allows us to just hang in there when it's difficult. It's really useful, not long suffering, not resignation, not grinning and bearing, not pretending that it's okay when it's not okay. But just like, okay, this is difficult. This is right in the midst of this. Tell the truth and just gently stay with it. Stay with it. We don't, we do everything we can to get away from it. And if we can't get away, we blame people. We justify that all of that. It's much simpler than that. Tolerance is the word Suzuki Loshi uses for this. And I think that's a good word being it. Can we tolerate this? Can you handle this? Like she said to me in, you know, can you be okay? You know, still have the radio blaring at four o'clock. What is it possible? Of course it's possible. Way more as possible than we think. So yeah, I can handle that. It's just that. It just means the capacity to just hang out with the difficulty. We need to learn that we need to train ourselves to be able to do that. And then it's okay. You can put up with it. Krishna Murti said, do you want to know what my secret is? I don't mind what happens. Brilliant. Rilke says, let all things happen to you, beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final. The trouble for us, of course, is that when we're in any kind of a state, we solidify that state and we believe because of the way our minds work, that this is it. And we believe this is our reality and we forget that it's just a temporary experience and it's passing. And so that's what makes the difficulty so hard to bear because we just feel we're stuck in it and that's it. Of course we never are, but that's what we tend to believe when we're in the middle of it. So no feeling is final, says Rilke. Of course, how we function. This is what I was saying yesterday, because this is how we've learned to be as human beings, how to survive is that our happiness and unhappiness, we pin on the changing circumstances. We really believe that if they're up, if we get the four nice vicissitudes, then we're happy. And if we get the four bad ones, then we're not happy. We completely depend on these changing circumstances for our well-being. That's the problem. So what we need to do is instead of focusing on the circumstances, is focus on how we're responding to them. How many times do we need to hear this? We need to hear this thousands and thousands and thousands over and over and over because we don't, especially when they're loaded. So if they're pleasant, we may, but probably not notice, oh, I'm fine. I'm cruising. I'm feeling good. But as soon as they're difficult, we really focus on the difficult thing. The person, the person who's being so nuisance, argumentative, the sounds, whatever, we just focus completely on these difficulties and we won't actually be able to handle them. If we do that, what we need to do is to notice how am I now with this? We won't have tolerance. We won't have patience. We won't even have kindness. If we just look at the problem, look at yourself, how are you now? That allows us to have some space from the problem, but we focus right on the different, right on the pain, right on the pain in the back, whatever it is, the headache. If we cannot do that and look at how am I, how's my response now? Am I struggling with this? Then we're removed somewhat from it right away. We're not like, you know, it isn't right in our face and challenging us. We've taken a step back and then immediately it's subsided somewhat. And then we have some choice, how do I want to be with this? Utation here, always saying, I mean, his main teachings are, there's the objects of our experience and then there's the mind that's aware of them. Focus on the mind. Everything happens in the mind. There's all these things happening endlessly and your mind is what you make of them. Well, instead of focusing on all the things that are coming and going good and bad up and down, focus on your mind because that's where you get to experience how you experience it. He says your mind is like the office. You go to a factory and you want to know what's going on there. You don't go to the, you know, the back corner of the factory. You go to the office and find out what's going on. Well, it's your mind. That's where it's all happening. So notice that. What I'd like to do is not continue too long because I'm not very well, but I'm just going to finish with this little story and then I'll be happy to answer your questions. Do you have any questions? Here's a little story. This is, I'm deciding to read it to you because I think it's relevant to illness. It's called dirt exposure boosts happiness. Exposure to dirt may be a way to lift mood as well as boost the immune system. UK scientists say. Lung cancer patients treated with friendly bacteria normally found in the soil have anecdotally reported improvements in their quality of life. Mice exposure, the same bacteria made more of the brain's happy chemical serotonin. The Bristol university authors told the journal neuroscience common antidepressants work by boosting this brain chemical dirt play. A lack of serotonin is linked with depression in people. The scientists say more work is now needed to determine if the bacterium mycobacterium vat guy has antidepressant properties through activation of serotonin neurons. The lead researcher Chris Lowry said these studies help us understand how the body communicates with the brain and why a healthy immune system is important for maintaining mental health. They also leave us wondering if we shouldn't all spend more time playing in the dirt. The work could also help experts understanding of why an imbalance in the immune system leaves some individuals vulnerable to mood disorders like depression. He added there's a picture of a pig here. This is happy as a pig. I just think about immune systems, you know, having been ill a little bit here. I actually believe in that. I grew up in the country and was often messing around in the soil, so I think that's a good thing. So thank you for listening. I hope this is helpful. Please ask me some questions about any of this. Yes, hi. Bill, could you wait for the mic? I can't resist chiming in about the dirt. Have you ever heard of Howard Lyman and his book, Mad Cowboy? No. He's the guy that went on Oprah and got them both sued by the Texas cattle industry for talking about the possible dangers of eating cattle. Oh, oh. So he was a fourth generation, I think, Montana rancher. And first three generations, no chemicals, small family farm. But he went to college and learned factory farming. And he said there was never a chemical I didn't like. And he went on and on like that for decades and it almost killed him. And then he saw the green light and flying there in the hospital bed. You didn't know it. He's about to become a vegetarian. In fact, a vegan, he's, you know, he reflected on the horrible quality of the earth after all those years of pesticides and whatnot. It just turned into just dust, nothing. And he was lying there and thinking back to when he was a kid and how he just loved, loved to run his hands through the dark, gloomy earth to the point that when he went to a friend's house again, when he was a kid, his friend's mother was rather fastidious and told him, you can't have dinner with us unless you go wash your hands. And to him, it was no brainer. He just didn't eat. How healthy was. Yes, please. I'm not sure how to ask this question, but it has to do with the different lineages or the different kinds of teaching you trained initially with Goenka and then with other lineages. And I'm I just came from a three day sitting course with Goenka and was reminded of not with him, but assistant teachers and was reminded of the insistence of using just this one technique. And I'm aware that especially here, there are so many different techniques that are open and look at how your mind is reacting and that. And on one hand, I see that they all sort of say the same thing, but on the other hand, the teachers of them or at least Goenka and others say, no, this is this is the way that you really need to follow. So I wonder if you could speak to that. And ultimately, I believe that we are our own author. We need to decide what's the best thing for each one of us. And we do have both the blessing and the curse in the West of having all these different things we can find what suits us. And it can take us a long time because there's so many. I found myself, for instance, that doing that practice my first 10 years or so was unbelievably useful because I really did learn concentration and I really did learn how to calm down and to get very steady and stable and to really direct my attention very specifically. So it was an excellent, excellent practice. But then I kind of felt like I grew out of it because I wanted some other aspects to be noticing as well. And I didn't even in my case, it wasn't like I went looking. I just found myself under retreat with some Western teachers and the language that they used and the way they described being present was so much more friendly. And I felt like I could really understand it. I thought I could relate much better. But I think I may have been more lost if I haven't had such a good foundation of concentration. So I think we need a good foundation of some thing. And I don't, there's different ways we can use, but staying with something for a good period of time and getting pretty steady and stable because we need to train this very scattered mind. And then when it's more stable, we can then with that now useful tool start looking at different aspects of our experience. And sometimes we discover that we need a lot of meta, for instance, which we never had done before. We never had realized that that was a part that our life was missing, for instance. So now we might find that's a really useful way of practicing for a while. Or we may, so what I have done, once my mind was more steady, then I could look at some aspect of practice and be able to really check that out and say, I'm just going to work on the hindrances for this next little while and see what that's like and understand how they show up in my life and what I make of that. So I think that initially to go all over the place is too distracting and too complicated. So I would say pick one or two things and go for them for quite some time. And who's to say what quite some time is, of course, because it's different ones, minds are really different. Some people need a lot of training because their mind is a really, really scattered kind of mind. And some people's minds are well behaved minds. They don't need quite so long. But until the mind is able to do what we want it to do, and to look at and see what we want it to see, to become our servant rather than our master, I think it's a good idea to stay fairly simple. That's my advice. And so you're the only one who could know that. So if you start exploring some other aspect of practice, some different way of looking at things, but you discover you get all over the place and scattered, that might not be the right time. Maybe you need to simplify. And so actually balance balances everything in practice. And at times, even in not just in the length of your practice over years, but in any moment, what do I need to be in balance now? Do I need some kindness? Do I need some interest? Do I need some staying close? You know, that's connecting and sustaining the attention. What do I need to be really here? And we, you know, we need to all the time be exploring that not get locked into one method. I think we have it's a huge advantage to have different ones, but not right off the bat. I would however, Ute Jania, for instance, he says he doesn't teach concentration in beginning, he says even he used to, but he says even the beginning people, he just teaches them to keep consistency. Watch a consistent watch over your attitude all the time. For him, concentration is all the time being mindful, continuous mindfulness and not just mindfulness, but mindful of your attitude all the time. That's concentration to him. It's not staying noticing one thing. It's just noticing any of the different things that happen, but keep paying attention to how your mind is with them all. And he teaches people right from the beginning how to do that. Rather than stay on your breath or stay in your body or keep repeating your meta phrases. He just says it's not necessary to be that concentrated. Concentration is consistent rather than limited, narrow. Interesting. That's a whole topic. I'm happy to talk with us about that at some point about the difference between the pros and cons of deep concentration practice or more open receptive practice. Because I learned a lot from being with him in that way. I've done a lot of concentration practice myself, Jana practice and so on. And I learned a lot about the disadvantages of one of the advantages of that. But for me, I really have appreciated first training and getting more clear about my mind being better behaved. And then I can open up and look at different things and be able to see them clearly. I think that's very useful. I just wanted to make a comment on Mr. Niyo's question and just my experience. I think two things about what going as he says bother me. One is that this is the only way. And there clearly isn't. There are lots of ways and we know that people attain our hardship through lots of different ways. So this clearly cannot be the only way. Especially when the Satipatthana Suta itself mentions all all sorts of ways of doing meditation with us. Main Suta on which all the teachers supposedly quote and based their practice on the second thing that really bothers me about the going technique is this. It is taught by teachers and implemented by teachers who are not necessarily gone very deep. It's taught by that gone very deep. That's done by especially people who are implementing discipline are actually very shallow and they cannot really exemplify what you are trying to achieve. So whereas so I would say try and at least find somewhere where you can work with monks or work with teachers who have a twenty thirty year practice and who say I would like to be like that and over kind and at least open to other things I would be very skeptical. And I mean I really deeply appreciate what going that she has done especially in India and most of my family has really benefited. But these two aspects of his teachings really bother me. And when you go and work with especially with monks even from a discipline that is very strict and I have worked with Upandita and his disciples and people have gone into monastery at age of six or seven and worked on themselves for twenty six years thirty six years. It's just it's beautiful to see. Never mind how strict they are. They might be there were people I just came back from a retreat as somebody you know that she used to come as I was I was in a tent so he could stand out of the tent and say Yogi it's 5 a.m. and one day I was tired but I respected how he was so much and that he really really really cared about my practice that I would get up at 5 a.m. and I did not mind his coming and waking me up. He was very strict but there was just incredible amount of kindness and he really really cared for every student and their practice. So I would say just definitely try out something else especially because they told you this is the only way I would I would get up and walk out. I do and worry about somebody saying this is the you know this is it because it depends on the person and there are different people who need different things that's clear to me. You know our minds are all slightly different we're all wired differently. It was great for you. Yeah yeah I really appreciated it and I found that there were some limits there that I didn't appreciate that I rebelled against after a while. Yeah over here hi. Okay when you say that you transcend that transcending the pleasure and pain clarity is beneficial. Would you say that's attributed to a rigorous thought process or rigorous feeling process and let me say why I'm phrasing it that way. I'm at a point with myself where I'm so reliant upon feeling and I thought I would get a feeling that transcending pain and pleasure like I would I would have a feeling that would show me that wisdom and I'm not much of a rigorous thinker with myself it's all feeling based and now I'm trying to figure out is it a rigorous thought process and not a feeling that would get me to that aha moment where I just accept the mosquitoes and the coldness and getting out of bed and whatever. You know really and truly in my experience it's a result of years of practicing rather than a thing that I can make happen and so I find myself like this morning I found myself not complicating the fact that I was having a painful time. It wasn't that I got myself there so much is that I was just grateful that I was able to know this is painful this is unpleasant this is painful here without proliferating in a bunch of thoughts because I have practiced for a long time not proliferating thoughts so then when I was with this particular thing I didn't then roll in a bunch of frustration or any extra. The simple practice of being in the present moment and not rolling in for puncture and not getting reactivated not adding all the extra mental stuff and all the extra emotional stuff just keeping coming to this moment bears fruit and then the fruit that it bears is then when we're in the midst of even difficulty and pain it wasn't like I would say it's stringent what was the word you used vigorous rigorous rigorous that sounds goenka like well I guess I'm going from hearing you your response that I literally have feel like I have to muster motivation to transcend pleasure pain I would you're saying there's no I don't think that's wise myself I think what's really helpful is kindness and curiosity and not not the driving thing I think there are too many of us in the west who are strivers and I think that the pushing it's always goal oriented it's all I want to get this together I want to be better I don't want it's all ego you know really what reveals how things are is if we if we look honestly kindly with some gentleness about it and really be interested in what's going on here it reveals itself to us we don't have to the have to part is extra and it's actually doesn't work it's miserable and then it's really sets us up for judging failure it's a tyranny of idealism is one of my phrases and I think that's you know we need to be realistic you know so we see in a moment I'm struggling and we see that and we get oh and as soon as we see that moment of struggle it subsides because we've seen it even if it doesn't completely go away it subsides somewhat the reason things proliferate is because you don't realize we're doing them so look and see what's happening that's all just look and see it's way simpler how many times have you heard this it's way simpler than we think we're just wanting to be with what's happening just see what's happening and then as we look we see oh I'm adding all this extra oh I'm off in the future I'm full of anxiety oh that's what's happening but there's this kind of like oh it's not like oh I shouldn't do it's more like oh that's interesting there's a kind of lightness about the whole thing it's got that flavor of freedom freedom isn't driving and you know rigor freedom is just like oh well thank you I feel better I didn't hear you what do you say so that good good all right okay so um just two little things I would like to say at the end of our evening um one of them and I won't say this in future but I just want to say this one time as I'm first here anything that you give me in the way of Donna to allow me to be able to come here and be with you and to teach in this way I just want to say how lovely it is to be able to be given to to support me this is my livelihood it's such an incredible thing to actually be given to instead of charge anyway thank you so much whatever you do offer me and the other thing is whoever would like an interview at any time for these next two and a half weeks that I'm here you can come and speak to me but the best way I don't have a cell phone that works here I don't have a cell phone and so my email address hmartin heather martin at salt spring that's the island where I live wireless dot com hmartin at salt spring wireless dot com Inus knows that Cheryl knows that um I don't know who else knows that anyway speak to me again if you can't remember that but that's the best way to contact me if you want to make an appointment for an interview at some point or any such thing sorry oh good okay so I'm accessible if anybody wants a conversation with some teacher other than Gil have a lovely week thank you so much nice to be here
