the Mind

One of the very important  and useful areas of 
mindfulness is called mindfulness of mind. It’s one of 
the four foundations of mindfulness : the third 
foundation . It involves  not so much looking at the details 
of what goes on in the mind , like the trees, as I said 
earlier , but rather loo king at the forest  – looking  at the 
quality of the mind. Our mind always has some kind of 
quality . It can be spacious ; it can be constricted ; it can 
be anxious ; it can be relaxed . The general mood of our 
mental state can be  in the background . It can be qui te 
subtle, but it  is there informing the way we see and 
understand things, and it can have a tremendous 
influence on us.   
 
The quality of the mind  is something to pay attention to. 
It is probably the most valuable resource that you have . 
Buddhism sometimes puts a lot of emphasis on inner 
wealth . So we focus,  not on outer wealth, which can 
come and go, but on becoming  a custodian, a caretaker 
of our inner wealth . This  inner wealth has t o do with the 
quality of your mind , the quality of your heart.   
It’s easy to sacrifice that quality because all kinds of 
things seem much more important . For example , it’s 
much more important to worry , isn’t it [laughs] ? People 
then sacrifice their peace  or their beauty . Or they 
sacrifice the  relax ation , or the love, or the compassion 
that can be the quality of the mind, because they need 
to worry . It’s really important to worry . Or it’s really 
important to crave, to desire, and to want . It’s really 
importa nt to hate, to be angry, and filled with regret.  
 
We might feel that we don’t have much choice around 
fear, or anger, or desire . Often we don’t feel like we 
have much choice  about these things , because we don’t 
see the place of choice . But part of the function of 
mindfulness is to sit quietly enough to see : “Where do I 
have choice? What am I picking up? What am I focusing 
on? What am I emphasizing  here? ” 
 
We pay some attention to the quality of the mind, which 
is closely connected to the attitude that w e have or bring 
with us , and we become  the caretaker of that quality . 
No-one else is going to do it for you . Sometimes, 
relationships can create  feedback and put us in a good 
or a bad mood, but really, in practice, we try to become 
the custodian , the perso n responsible for our quality of 
mind.  
 
For people who meditate, o ne very interesting exercise to do is to meditate in such a way that you’re a little bit 
calmer after your meditation than you were at the 
beginning . It doesn’t have to be dramatic, but just  a little 
more calm, so the quality of your mind is a little calmer, 
more settled, more at ease, less agitated . Then, as you 
leave meditation, that’s when you’re meditation really 
begins. So as you leave your meditation session, pay 
careful attention to  what causes you to lose that calm, 
or that peace, or that sense of well -being that you 
touched into when you  were meditating . 
 
It is really interesting is to take your time in leaving 
meditation, and notice the first time that your mind gets 
agitated or caught by something. Rather than go along 
with it , and continu ing your life being caught , stop in 
your tracks . Sit down and check -in. Notice  what just 
happened . What was that about? Why was I willing to 
sacrifice my peace for this thing, whatever it might be? 
Have I picked being  in a hurry ? Am I wanting  to get a lot 
done , or to worry about something, or whatever it might 
be? Really take that transition time coming out of 
meditation, in a slow, careful way, so that you can stop , 
look and see what happen s – to see when you first lose  
your peace, or your inner sense of well -being, or 
whatever it might be . Then  see if you can regain it . See 
if you can let go of something, or settle back into the 
calm that you had , and get back in touch with it.  
 
Those two exerc ise are really important . The first is  to look and see and understand really well what it is that 
you’re sacrificing  – what  it is that you believe is so 
important that you’re willing to give up your well -being 
for.  
  
The other important exercise  is to lea rn to let go and fall 
back into the well -being . Maybe it’s not always easy to 
fall back . It depends how quickly and how much you got 
pulled in. Do this exercise  in the transition out of 
meditation , because once you’ve started your full -
fledged life , running around, doing what you do , it might 
be hard to do because you ’re already  caught up in 
many things . That transition point  coming  out of 
meditation is a very valuable time  in which you can 
learn a lot about yourself. If you do th is on a regular 
basis , then you might be able to stretch how long you 
stay peaceful, easeful, or contented . You can extend it 
longer and longer into the day , and you don’t have to 
lose it one minute after getting up . Maybe y ou’ll lose it in 
five minutes  – that’s 500% better ! Then you keep 
working on it , and it become s ten minutes , and then an 
hour . . .   
 
Some people  may feel that emphasis on caring for the 
quality of your mind, the quality of your heart, is selfish , 
and i t may be a form of self -preoccupation. Hopefully, if 
your mindfulness is strong enough, you’ll see if it’s 
selfish . If it’s self -absorbed, you’ll feel t he suffering of 
that, and you’ll actually feel that it’s not a very good quality of mind to be self -concerned in that way.  
 
The best quality of mind comes when we’re not so pre -
occupied with self -identity, trying to do something  for 
our own sake . It helps  to understand  that a good quality 
of mind is not something to do just for yourself  or for 
your pleasure . But when you do it so that you can be 
more helpful to the world around you , then  you can be 
more peaceful, more settled, and less gripped by greed, 
hate and delusion . And t he encounters you have will be 
so much richer and more beneficial for the people you 
meet. The motivation behind caring for the quality of 
your hear t can be inspired  by having something good  
and beautiful to do for other people  – you’re not just 
doing it for your own sake.  
 
A fascinating thing about turning the attention to the 
quality of the mind is how attention  – being  aware of 
something  – tends  to make more space around the 
mind. W hen the quality of the mind is contracted, 
constricted, or tight, and when we become  really aware 
of this, then suddenly there’s space in the mind . Even 
though you might still be constricted, t here’s more room 
in the mind , and  the constriction doesn’t defi ne the mind 
anymore . Awareness becomes bigger than the 
constriction. Making a lot of space and room is one of 
the exercises in paying attention to the quality of the 
mind . So notice when the mind becomes expansive . 
And expansive doesn’t mean that the detai ls – the trees – have to go away. It just means that the forest or the 
space around it has become really big. This idea of 
using awareness – not to get rid of something – but to 
expand the mind and make it big enough so the mind is 
no longer troubled by a particular tree  is a wonderful 
way of caretaking for the quality of the mind , for how we 
are.
