 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Here we go. Okay. All right. So welcome you all. Welcome everyone. Wonderful to see you. Always happy making to come together with the Sangha to practice. So tonight's practice, the theme I'd like to invite us to practice with has been requested both on Friday when we had our happy hour. At the end, I stayed a few minutes extra for those who were here. And a very important question and conversation came about how to hold compassion, equanimity with these hard practices with very, very challenging times in the world. If you're in Ukraine, for example, how would you go about that? How would you hold that in your heart? And the same time also another aspect of what I want to bring in tonight is one of my students sent me an email and actually I wanted to be part of their email asking. And as many of you know, I am Iranian. I was born in Iran and there are very challenging times right now in my country of birth. So the student wrote and asked, in your talks, could you kindly suggest ways for Buddhist Iranians and Ukrainians who practice metta, how to use their daily practice to bring more peace and love for themselves and others around them during these challenging times. Also how to approach activism with metta. I so appreciate these questions because this practice that we cultivate, we do together five times a week, it's not just about easy times. It's not just about sitting and wishing well. It's also irrelevant, important, or perhaps even the most important practice in challenging times, whether our heart is breaking with the news of the world or if we are ourselves in challenging situations with injustice, etc., etc. So both how to hold it, enabling transcription there. Somebody asked you to enable transcription and I just did that. So with this, I want to say a few words before we get into our practice tonight. And I so appreciate these questions and the care that has come with the interest of how do we engage, how do we engage. So two aspects I wanted to address very briefly before we get into the practice. One is this concept of compassionate activism. And activism with anger can be corrosive. This is something that many activists in the world know. Anger can bring up a lot of energy, can bring up a lot of energy to do a lot in the world, but it's also corrosive. However, being an activist out of compassion, it brings people together, it sees all sides, not to condone the harm, not to condone the pain, not to condone the injustice and the harm that's being done. But one gets to see the humanity of all sides. Again, not to condone, but compassionate activism is a way, really is the way through this. And just to say a little bit about my own reaction as I read the news, for example, as I was reading the news from my homeland earlier tonight from the country of my birth, I was grieving and my heart was broken. I was grieving for hearing how peaceful activists in an elite university in Iran were beaten up or taken away with a lot of violence. And what I noticed both in what was coming up for me was grieving for the pain of the people who were hurt, as well as grieving for the perpetrators, for their karma, for the pain that they are causing. So there is grief with compassionate activism. There is a sense of grief and sadness, compassion for all sides. It's not a separating of us against them. Of course, not condoning the harm. And there is action, there is action, but it doesn't come from a place of hatred. It comes from a place of, and of course the action might be, this is not right, this is not appropriate, stop as a way of defending and not allowing the harm to happen. However, it comes from a place of love for everyone involved, not a place of hatred. And I acknowledge that this is a very, very high bar to set. And yet this is a high bar that the Buddha sets in the sutta, the Samili of the Sa, where he says, and I'm sorry, this is very graphic description, but he says that if the bandits are cutting off your arms and legs, still, if you are following my teachings, you will have compassion, you will have metta even in that moment for them. So for all sides, again, you'll protect yourself. You won't be a, you know, oh yeah, just do anything. You will protect yourself with all your might. So compassion doesn't mean that you become a wet noodle or you become submissive, but that act of protection, that act of resistance comes from a place of care and love. And similarly, as one witnesses what is happening with a sense of grief and a broken heart, with compassionate activism also comes a sense of a need for holding oneself with care. Because if you're watching and you are off kilter, there's not much that you can do. You can't do your activism. You can't be a force for the good in the world. You will be wallowing in grief. You will just be lost in grief and turmoil. So wisdom needs to come in to bring some equanimity, to hold the compassion so that there is some stability to have, to be able to engage in compassionate activism. So there is a lot more to say. This feels like such a brief and it might even bring up more questions than answers. But I want to make sure we have enough time for our practice tonight. Well, this is practice too, listening to the Dharma and sharing the Dharma. And yet I do want to make sure that we have time for meditating. So let's turn to meditation and we'll have time for discussion, for questions afterwards. Okay. So I'd like to invite you to land in your body. In this moment in time, in this impermanent moment in time. Landing, arriving, letting go of thoughts, letting go of preoccupations for this moment just so that you can settle, so that you can have an anchor, so that you can have stability, to respond wisely, compassionately to what arises in the heart and in the world. So for the benefit of a wise response, we choose to let go in this moment of all thinking, preoccupations. There's nothing wrong with thinking, with planning, but in this moment we give them away and settle in this moment. Having the body stable, well rooted, upright. A sense of integrity in the body. The feet well rooted to the earth, connected to the earth. As the Buddha said, with the gesture, with the earth mudra, the night of his enlightenment, as earth be my witness, I am here, I belong here. Living, reclaiming your place on this earth. Letting your torso be upright. Sense of integrity sitting tall like a mountain. Even if there is sadness, if your heart is breaking, there is stability in the body to hold it all. Stay in the posture. Letting the breath, letting the breath move through, calm, settle. Nourish, nourish your heart. If you are not nourished, if you don't have calm, stability. You cannot be of support to anyone. So calming, calming the heart, calming the mind as much as possible with the breath. Feeling nourished in this moment. Seeing a bird's eye view of humanity, of all the comings and goings of generations. At this moment, this experience, this breath is part of the stream of humanity. Can it be a breath? Can it be a moment of calm? Of care? Of love, of anguish? To support more love, to support more care in the world? Less hatred, more stability, more friendliness? more friendliness, less othering. And this breath, this moment of this experience here, my experience, be an offering, be an offering of peace, of care to all humans, all beings, may all beings everywhere, whoever they are, whatever their conditions, seeing their humanity, seeing that in their value system they're doing the best they can, they're doing the best they can. Wishing a compassionate heart for everyone, may all beings be awake to see each other's humanity, may all humans see that we are not so different, we all want to be able to be happy, to be free, not to suffer. Breathing peace as if with each breath, we breathe in peace into our heart, the moment of peace, an offering of peace, and breathing out peace unto the world. If only our breathing, breathing out peace and goodness could calm, could soothe the pain of the world. Breathing peace is, we share with each breath our wish for peace, and as if our heart could transform the pain, the injustice in the world. Each breath breathed in, as if the challenges, the pain, the suffering, the gefog, breathed into the heart center, transform this heart of goodwill, this heart of care for the world. Breathing out goodwill for all beings everywhere, especially the places in the world where there's strife right now, there's pain, there is war, there's unrest. To all sides, not condoning the harm, not condoning the hurt. The perpetrators are also harmed. You're harming themselves. It's so painful to harm others. It impacts one severely. So compassion for everyone, for all sides, not condoning the injustice that needs to stop and be stopped. And with each breath, not with anger, but with love, transforming, transforming the pain in the world. Each breath in, the heart center, as if the pain gets incinerated, gets transformed into a soothing light of goodwill, compassion. Breathing in, breathing out, cool, calm, love, care. And if this practice of breathing in or letting challenges be breathed into the heart center transformed and breathe out seems difficult, this practice of tongue-len, and it's okay to breathe in peace and breathe out peace. Breathing in peace, breathing out peace. If only this breath would bring peace to those who are suffering right now. Breathing well with each and every breath, so many people suffering. Sharing care, kindness, goodwill. Compassion feels both the suffering and meets it with goodwill. It's not just empathetic distress. Breathing in peace, breathing out peace, love, care. And imagining that each breath is bringing comfort, soothing hope, restoring, soothing calming. All who are hurting. If at any point it seems too much and the practice of compassion has veered into empathetic distress and it's no longer compassion but just feeling the pain, it's okay to turn to your own heart. Feeling peace with compassion, with compassion, with compassion, in compassion, with compassion, with compassion, with compassion, within compassion with compassion, within compassion, with compassion, of humanity. All the challenges, all the goodnesses in this being human. Comeings and goings, touching into equanimity, offering this moment as a gift of peace, the stream to the ocean of humanity, past, present, future. We have come a long way as humans. We still have a long way to go. Can we cultivate this moment to be a moment of goodwill, kindness, peace? As a gift, as an offering to so many moments of human experience. The tide has been turning of regenerations towards more compassion and wisdom. Humanity at large is kinder. Historians, philosophers tell us the tide is turning slowly, slowly. Let this cultivation, at this moment of goodwill for all beings everywhere, be an offering to turn the tide. If we hate, if we hate, if we join in hating, we are not so different. From those whose ways we want to change, don't give in to hatred. Wishing a well, wishing a well-being, free them from pain, sorrow. For all beings everywhere, including this being, that is yourself, with each breath. With each breath, offering, may all beings everywhere be free from suffering, all beings. May all beings be well. May all beings be free. May all beings, including this one, the being who is me. Be well. Be happy. Have peace. Be kind. Be loving and wise. Wishing a well, wishing peace, with each breath. May all beings be free. Wishing a well, wishing a well, with each breath, with each breath, with the beams of manta, goodwill. May they be calm. May their hearts be touched. May there be a moment of lightness, ease. May their challenge be enlightened. May their love be touched by the power of this radiating compassion, goodwill. May their love be touched by the power of this radiating compassion, may their love be touched by this radiating compassion, may their love be touched by this radiating compassion, The cloth was wide enough to cover, to comfort. It's a wide blanket of metta. Karuna compassion brings sucker to all the hurting beings in the world. As we bring this practice period, the siddh to a close, wishing all beings everywhere, especially those in war zones, living under oppression and strife, wishing them ease, freedom, happiness. May all beings everywhere be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Thank you for your practice. I appreciate all of you coming together and practicing in this way. Not turning away, not turning away. So, we have time for reflections, questions, discussion, conversation. You can raise your zoom hand, please. You can also type your reflections, your questions, your complaints in chat. You can type them to me privately, or in which case I won't read your name, only your question, your reflection, or you can type them to everyone, in which case I'll read your name also. Ise says thank you from Malaysia. Thank you Ise for practicing. Joining on YouTube. Any reflections, questions? Radha. First of all, I just want to say thank you so much for that guidance. And something that came up for me during it was this story that I remember of, like from the Philippines, kind of during the Marcos dictatorship. There was like this kind of turning point in that, in the kind of overturning of the dictatorship where there were these sort of hundreds of thousands of women gathered, kind of facing these soldiers. And it was mostly kind of mothers of that age. And yeah, they were facing these soldiers and they just started chanting, I love you to the soldiers. And yeah, it brings up a lot of emotion for me. And those, that was like a really big turning point in what happened kind of after that was that the soldiers actually, Marcos actually lost support from those soldiers after that happened. And yeah, the rest is history as they say. But yeah, I just kind of found that coming up for me, I think during the meditation I was feeling a lot of kind of empathetic distress. And I found kind of that energy of those mothers and that quality of the strength that I just, I love you. I found that kind of gave me a lot of strength. So yeah, I just wanted to shout out. Thank you so much Radha for sharing that, the powerful story and the turning point. I'm so touched. Thank you. Also sharing what came up for you with a sense of feeling the all sides, both sides and really that sense of I love you. And that can be the turning point, may it be the turning point. I'm so happy to hear that was the turning point when Marcos lost power and may it be the turning point for what's happening in my country of birth. May it be so through love, not through hatred. Thank you Radha. Jamie, please. Thank you for this Nikki. Just such big topics. You know, it actually is, was fairly easy for me to extend compassion to the an oppressor or someone perpetrating violence, because I know there are conditions that led to their actions, which makes me much more hopeless, actually, because I don't need to counter that person. I need to counter the conditions that led to his or her actions. And that seems a lot more complex and a lot harder. It actually isn't. And I'm so glad you raised this, Jamie. This is fantastic because the cause and conditions that gave rise to what happened are three things, greed, hatred and confusion and confusion, delusion, not knowing any better, not knowing that, you know, not knowing what causes happiness, what causes goodness in the world. So it's really these three. Right. And I'm reminded of Joseph Goldstein, who was watching, who at some point in one of his teachings shared that watching documentaries of the world wars, it came up for him that really it's the world wars, all the aggression, all the killing and dying. It's all the expression of these three roots of greed, hatred and delusion in individuals, in individuals. So when you say hopeless, actually, it makes me more hopeful because here you are practicing love. And here when you see, oh, yeah, I can I can love the perpetrator. I can see the conditions. You're already changing the conditions in you. So you're already dispelling greed, hatred, delusion. And that is hope right there. It's one person at a time. I'm not at a point right now where I can see how those three things cause all the pain, you know, that is inflicted on people. It just seems to me like a lot of the time, it's out of love for a parent who modeled behavior that was, you know, internalized and became embodied without ill intent necessarily. So I don't know what to do with that. So I have to admit a long chat came through and there was a process, something that you said that I missed. So repeat that. I'm going to it's hard to handle everything at the same time. So forgive me, Jamie. Repeat. Tell me what is that part. And I don't want to I don't want to take all this time from other people. No, but I do want to hear the. Well, I just think if I'm going to say, you know, let's let's take a soldier in Iran who's beating a protestor. His actions might have been a result of the love for his parents who had very strong beliefs and a certain set of behavior that he took on board and emulated and internalized. And I don't see how that is read hatred or delusion. Yeah, yeah, it is delusion. And let me thank you. So thank you for repeating that. So so this is what the delusion is. The delusion is is not seeing the common humanity. That is a delusion when you don't see that people, the person you're hitting or beating is just like you. But you're beating them up and not seeing and not being able to take their place, not being able to empathize and see and listen to them and othering. That is a delusion. The delusion of othering. In the fundamental sense, those. So thank you for that, Jamie. Ah, yeah. Let's see. OK. Hugh says compassionate activism equals nonviolent resistance as taught by Martin Luther King, Madhma Gandhi and Take Madhant. Yes. And Dave says, thank you, Nikki. And Nikki is attempting to direct our gaze over there and point the finger of blame at an other, especially when the media are full of stories of the official enemies du jour. But. See, but as as the land acknowledgments remind us, we are in the US are are seen as the perpetrators of genocide, genocidal violence before we accuse others. Let us take a look at ourselves. Yes, it's everywhere. Absolutely. It's everywhere, David. It's it's. There is, I think, once something that your point points to your note points out and I was also trying in taking perspective, the big perspective of this moment is a moment in the wider humanity, the wider humanity of of so much. Perpetration of violence, etc., which has again as historians and philosophers tell us we've become kinder as humans. And of course, we still have a long way to go. And yet, yes, let's not turn our gaze. There's there's plenty. Corina, what days do I teach? I teach Monday, Wednesday, Friday. And there was one other question that came through. Let's see. And I wonder, actually, it's 651 whether tonight, given this topic, it makes sense to stay in the big group. That's actually my feeling right now that we stay in big group. And tonight we skip the small breakouts. And that's my feeling. If what's if let me know if you like the idea of staying in the big group, give me a thumbs up or something. And I'll count a number of thumbs up. If not, I'll see lots of thumbs. Okay, we're going to stay in the big group tonight. Okay. So we'll take more, more questions and reflections. I do want to go back to the question that was put in chat. What should we wish for the knowing perpetrators of violence and suffering? Oh, I think in a way that was already handled. That came through Jamie's question. So I appreciate the person who wrote that. It's really wish that they get to see and also it reflected in Radha's reflection that they get to see that they're they are loved and they can love. They see the common humanity. This is what I wish for the perpetrators of violence, past, present and future. Couple more messages. Gosh, let's see. I agree. Stay in big group thumbs up. Okay, I see that person says thank you. Thank you. I was able to do tongue length tonight when in the past I couldn't. Great delighted to hear that Jerry. I see your hand and then I'm going to go to to actually let me read Jamie's comment. Maybe the delusion in the example I gave in the delusion example I gave of the Iranian soldier is not seeing that they have other options than the ones their parents and role models gave them. Yeah, that too. That too. There's so many ways to see our common humanity and let love lead. Jerry, I see your hand please. Just a comment I read in one of the new services when the initial war started in Ukraine, at least in February was that the Russian soldiers were finding it hard to attack people that spoke their same language. So this issue, of course, for me as a psychiatrist is because they see them as human beings and they're not speaking gibberish to them because they're speaking the language of Russian that both of them overlap. And so it did get to me about your question your comment about well the delusion is is that they. It helps that you don't you do dehumanize the person that you're attacking. So that's my only comment. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And yeah, that is the delusion of dehumanizing of other being they're different they're bad they know whatever different narratives right and that's how. Anyway, it's it's it's happened so often in history of of humanity unfortunately that one group dehumanizes is the other or maybe the people empowered, do that and do that to stay in power. So, comments from YouTube and I see Serena and Charlie's hand. Thank you, John, for joining from New Zealand really appreciate. So, Serena, can ask you to unmute please. Yes, thank you. It was really difficult, I have to say that, to be honest with you was very difficult. Tonight's meditation was very difficult for me. And what I'm really very aware of is that it is really tough to deal with suffering. And in any shape or form, you know, I am having, you know, it's like, yesterday, I had to go and visit my uncle, well I chose to do that, who is in a nursing home type of facility. He hasn't been doing well for a long time. And I had to really get my courage up to really go and visit and to be with somebody who has very little control of his, over his body. And to be there for him. So, so what I'm trying to say is, in my own personal life, I'm just having difficulty just being there for other people who are, and, you know, suffering or are in very very difficult situations. And honestly, you know, like for example when the war and in Ukraine happened. I was really activated, I sent things I, you know, medical supplies, etc. But it's just like, it's hard, I get your I get your questions for you know so so in the benefit of time given the two other people also have their hands right. I hear you. This is hard. This is hard people are suffering and as you said, it already takes a lot of courage to be with suffering, which is close that is close to you people you care about close to you and and. So how to, it seems, it's all it seems overwhelming right. So, so this is what I recommend as a practice for you to have to build that courage to build that stability for you to all to both be with people who are close to you to show up for them and the ability for doing so, and people that are far away is to when it starts to feel overwhelming to back into or to, to, to support yourself with equanimity with expanding your view, get your balance, get a sense of stability and that's what we did tonight and I know practice, and I went back and forth between equanimity stabilizing on the equanimity and then when there's a sense of okay peace, ease, yes, and then opening up again titrating and again, oh, this is overwhelming going back to the community. That's the way then you can expand your capacity Serena to be with suffering, it's not going to happen overnight, but little by little, you're going to expand your capacity and it will both serve you as a in your own humanity and serve others. Thank you for raising that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Charlie please. Thanks Nikki. Thank you again. I guess it's about, I guess there's a rejoinder about myself, you know, may may others, you know, not have suffering, or all beings not have suffering, including myself and I just really felt it this evening and just, just a good reminder to, I guess, to in some ways be selfish, you know, in a, you know, in a skillful wholesome way, allows me to show up a lot better for my family and I've had to tell my kids, you know, that he needs to eat something before he can help you give him five minutes to get some calories, he'll be a much nicer. Beautiful, beautiful. I love that. Thank you, Charlie. Thank you so much for bringing that into the space. It is so important. It's wise selfishness, let's call it, or another word I can I, it's, it's wise. It's wise taking care of oneself. I mean, really, you have to take care of yourself before you take care of others. And in this guided meditation, of course, you need to be included. Compassion is 360, especially if you feel that oh yes, it's overwhelming too much okay. Calm back, calm, sweetheart. It's okay. It's okay. It's alright, calm, soothing, because if, if you don't have the capacity, if you are on capacitated, you can't be available for anyone so you of course you have to take care of yourself so thank you so much for highlighting that. And that's so important in compassionate activism and just caring for others caring for your family. Beautiful. Thanks again. And Diana it is seven o'clock so please say, say it and needs to be brief. Nevermind I can't be that rich so. Oh, okay. So tell you what we're going to respect people's time close but I'm going to stay extra, extra afterwards to hear you out. Okay. All right. So I want to thank you all. Thank you so much for coming to happy hour to practice compassion here for the world for ourselves, turning the tide, little by little by little, one breath at a time. Thank you so much. May you be well. May all beings be well may all beings be free. Thanks everyone, take good care. I will see you.
