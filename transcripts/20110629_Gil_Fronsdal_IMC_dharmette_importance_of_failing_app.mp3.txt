Dharmette : The Importance of Failing

I thought I would talk some more about the importance 
of failing. Hopefully some of you have had the chance to 
fail properly this morning. I think some people are so 
focused on success that it becomes a hindrance in their 
spiritual practice. They’re measuring themselves. “Have 
I succeeded? Have I gotten as far as I’m supposed to 
get?” Or they have some abstract idea that there is 
something called success . If they are successful , then 
they’re a certifiably approved person  especially  if they 
succeed in their religion of choice. People want  to be 
certif iably approved. We should pass out certificates  
stating that you  are a person in good standing and are  
certifiably approved in Buddhism. People  also feel that 
they need to do something i n order to succeed in some 
way or reach a certain level of practice . So the 
advantage  of failure , or learning to be relaxed around 
failure is essential if you’re going to do meditation or 
mindfulness practice.  
 
One of the great American sports is baseball. If you are 
an exceptionally good baseball player , you might end up 
in Cooperstown at the Baseball Ha ll of Fame if you fail 
only two-thirds of the time. I f you have a 3.33 batting average, that’s really hot , especiall y if you do that for 
several years in a r ow. But that means you fail two -
thirds of the time when you’re up at bat. A mediocre 
baseball player might fail four -fifths of the time. If we did 
batting averages for meditato rs – in how many 
meditation sessions we re you successful?  I think that it 
would be a very rare person whose batting av erage 
would be higher than .000  [laughter] .  
 
If success is measured by being in  the present moment 
and not leaving  it once during tha t sitting then it would 
be .000  for just about everybody. The idea that you’re 
supposed to be completely present for 45 minutes (or 
however  long you sit ) is absurd . Most people don’t hold 
themselves against that standard , but maybe  
sometim es they do unconsciously or subliminally. I 
mean  I’ve sat down to meditate and felt bad about 
myself after 30 second s [laughter] . Well, I guess t hat 
meditation is shot because my mind wandered off a little 
bit or I feel a little  scattered  or distracted.  
 
There are a lot of things to be learned from havi ng a 
good failure . One is to learn what our attitude is towards 
success and failure. What do we have at stake , and 
how much are we  depending on so me idea of success 
or obtaining something?  Some  people think they’ll only 
be an approved person if they obtain  something. I have 
known  people who  have told me that they’re trying to 
have a good meditation on retreat so they can  show -off when they come for interview. H owever , they don’t say 
it that way. They’re  trying to figure out wha t I want as a 
teacher. They’re  trying to have the right experience so 
that they can get approved or validated.  
 
So see w hat the attitudes are that come into play 
around failure when you have a sense that you’ve  
failed . What are the assumptions behind want ing to be 
successful? Spend ing some really good time looking at 
this is a very important part of life . In growing up, m ost 
people develop certain attitudes towards success and 
failure. A lot of people get elated or depressed 
depending on success and failur e. One of the forms of 
equanimity in Buddhism or a way at being at peace is 
not have you r heart – your sense of wellbeing or ease  – 
dependent on success and failure. Everyone  has 
success and failure all the time in many ways. So wh at’s 
your attitude towards this?   
 
The bigger the challenge , or the more difficult the goal  
you set for yourself, the more likely you can have a 
whole series of failures or setbacks along the way. So 
you tend to get easily discouraged. Does it tie into a 
belief system that says,  ”It just shows I can’t do 
anything . I can’t succeed,  and this just  proves it one 
more time ”? Sometimes the attitudes around failure are 
self-defeating , or – to say it differen tly – self-fulfilling . If 
you have a  belief system about failure , and then you will 
fail because it’s self -fulfilling.   
So look at the attitudes. When you have failed , one of 
the great opportunities is to look at what’s behind that 
idea of fai lure. What are your assumptions and  belief 
systems connecte d to it?  Also what  is the identity you 
have connected to that belie f system of failure  and 
success?  By identity I mean  the sense of who you need 
to be, how you want to represent yourself to others and 
to yourself, how you need to be represented in the 
system of your family  of origin , or your Buddh ist family.  
What’s the identity  that you’re trying to play out , and 
how does that t ie in to y our idea of success and failure?  
 
I’ve failed miserably so metimes in my Buddhist practice. 
It was only when I failed terribly  that I was finally  able to 
see how tremendously attached I was to self -identity 
issues. I saw it very dramatically in one of my first 
sesshins , a seven -day Zen retreat . I was a relatively 
new student. I think it was my second or third sesshin  at 
Green Gulch. They  had this c ustom back then that the 
last sitting of the evening would be open -ended. The y’d 
only end it when the abbo t came in to the room , and he 
would recite a poem  or some other wonderful Zen thing. 
Then  we would be given this hot barley molasses drink , 
which  was supposed to sustain us so that we could 
voluntarily stay up late through the night and meditate 
beyond the last sitting.  
 There  was one time when the abbo t was giving a very 
long private interview to one of the students. This 
interview went on and on , and so he came really late. 
What  that meant was that the last sitting was not just 40 
minutes long, which  is what it was  supposed to be. After  
50 minutes he wasn’t there. After 60 minutes he wasn’t 
there, and after 70 minutes he still wasn’t there. In Zen 
we weren’t supposed to move until the bell rang.  
 
I’ve been told that the  difference between Zen and 
Vipassana is that in Zen if no one rings the bell, no one 
moves. In Vipassana if no one rings the bell, someone 
gets up and hits it [ laughter] .  
 
So I wa s sitting there in a tremendous amount of 
physical pain. I was sitting right in front of the door into 
the meditation hall s o anybody who came into the hall 
would come through a door and basically run into me 
sitting there. I was just miserable in the pain  of sitting  
there. Then  finally it was too much for me  – poor little 
Gil. I completely  collapsed in a most un -Zen like  way. It 
was not a pretty sight if you’re a Zen student. And just 
as I collapsed , the door opened up and the abbot 
walked in. I was a tota l Zen failure, and I actually went 
back to my room and sobbed. Only then could I see 
how much identity  was going on that I hadn’t been 
aware of – how much I was invested in how I wanted to 
be seen and in the idea of success . It was so dramatic  
and in my face that I had to pay attention and learn from it. Having a good failure is sometimes the best thing that 
can happen to people.

So I could fail better? Yeah, I was too successful at Zen, 
so I had to find something I’d fail at better. And I failed 
equally in both.  
 
One of the things I learned at Tas sajara about failing  
was from working in the kitchen there for a year. 
Kitchens are ver y forgiving because you can fail at 
makin g a meal. You can burn the food, put in too much 
salt, or make a lousy meal. The meal gets served . It 
gets eaten , thrown away or whatever , and then  the next 
day you start all over again. So I just loved it. No matte r 
what happened the day before I would show up the next 
day in the kitchen and say, “Great, I get to try again.” 
That is th e idea of just letting go and saying, “I get to try 
again ,” rather than being dragged down by yesterday’s 
failure.  One of the ways to  use failure is to say, “Okay , 
what can I learn from this  and how can I do better in the 
future? ” That’s much more inspiring , I think.  
 
One of the core things about failure  is to learn , “What do 
I need to let go of ? I’m miserable, upset  and feel pulled 
down by this sense of failure  – what am I holding on 
to?” Perhaps  what’s more important th an success in 
meditation is letting go of the attach ments we have .   
It has happened that sometimes I haven’t been 
successful at getting concentrated. So I’m a  
concentration failure. But in trying to get concentrated 
and seeing that I’ve failed , I was successful in letting go 
of a lot of the belief s, attachments, and self-identity 
issues that I had around getting concentrated. I actually 
became  much more peacefu l because I learned to let 
go of those.  
 
The more relaxed you are at failing , the easier it is to be 
successful in meditation. You r ealize  that there are all 
kinds of ways you’re not going to be successful  – your 
mind wanders  off, you’re  reactive.  You s ee these things 
as part of the ecosyste m of what arises and passes , 
and hold them  more and more lightly. Be at ease with 
the so -called failures , and don’t let the judgments and  
belief systems around  failure get in the way . Don’t 
assign mean ing to it. Just accept that you’ll try to get 
better in the future , and  hold it lightly and easily . The 
practice will unfold better with that attitude.  
 
Also that’s really part of the whole function of Buddhist 
practice to begin with. It’s not to get conc entrated , or 
necessarily to get more mindful , but to hold our life more 
easily , and not  cling to it or grasp at it. Sometimes  
failing is a great teacher in learning to let go and hold ing 
things more and more easily, and becom ing freer and 
freer.   
So look very carefully  at the ways in which you see your 
life through the framework of success and failure. There  
might be a lot of unexamined assumptions behind those 
judgments. The very notion of success and failure is so 
black and white . It’s not really  useful if you hold it in an 
all or nothing way. If it’s all or nothing when you sit down 
to meditate – either I’m going to be completely present 
the whole 45 minutes or not  – then your batting average 
will be .00 0. But if your idea of success is , “Wheneve r I 
can remember , I’m going to come back to the present 
moment ,” then you’re more likely to feel that you’ve 
succeeded  than if you set yourself up to be mindful the 
whole time . “Whenever I remember , I’ll do my best with 
this.” 
 
I’ve known a lot of practiti oners over the years. Some 
have it relatively easy in their practice , and others  have 
tremendous challenges and difficulties. I tend to be 
most inspired by the people who struggle  and in 
conventional ways maybe fail. The persistence, strength 
of character, willingness to come back, and the way 
they get mellowed and matured through all their 
difficulties  is quite profound. So if you’re the failing type, 
take heart. It’s okay.  
 
And if  you’re not the failing type, then don’t try to fail for 
my sake now  because I said that I’m inspired by the 
people who fail [laughter] . Anyway, have fun.
