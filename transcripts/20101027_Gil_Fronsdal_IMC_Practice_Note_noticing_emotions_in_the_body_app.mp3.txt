Body

This morning I wanted to say a few words about 
mindfulness of emotions, moods, mental states. Often 
there’s always some kind of mood or emotional state 
that’s present. Sometimes it’s quite subtle ; sometimes 
it’s dramatic. When it’s subtle, people sometimes don’t 
see it as a mood, or an emotional state, or a mental 
state. They think maybe the emotional state is  neutral , 
but it’s rea lly never neutral. There’s always some little 
shade of something going on.  
 
One of the effects that emotions, or mental states, have 
is that they influence us. They sometimes influence how 
we see the world around us. They cast certain color on 
the world . So if you’re sad , it puts a certain color  on 
what  you tend to notice in the world, or on how you 
interpret things. If you’re angry , you interpret things  
differently. If you’re happy, you interpret them  in a 
different way. Your emotions  affect your sight, y our 
perception, your interpretation of what goes on.   
 
Our emotional mood  also affect s our motivations : what we want to do and not to do. If we’re sad then, maybe 
we want to pull into ourselves. If we’re angry , we want 
to lash out. If we’re happy , we might want to be 
generous, and open a door for someone. It influences 
how we behave in the world as well. Those two 
influences on how we see things and how we behave 
also work internally. We see ourselves under the 
influence of the mood , and we behave towards 
ourselves in certain ways. We can often be subtly, or 
grossly, influenced by the emotion. It gives fuel for 
certain ways of being.  
 
Sometimes , we are not so aware of our emotion al state , 
and sometimes we’re cle arly hooked into it: reacting, 
involved, indulging in it, fueling it, resisting it big time. 
One of the great things to do in mindfulness practice is 
to be mindful of emotions , and to notice what emotion is 
going on for us, what the mental state is, what is the 
overall mood we might be operating in, and then try to 
step back. Take a step back, so that you’re not  in it so 
directly . But step back enough so you can see, observe, 
and recognize  it. “Oh now I’m happy. Now I’m sad. Now 
I’m a little bit afraid. Now  I’m worried. ” Really recognize 
what’s there , and then explore, try to discover what 
happens to you when you step back and clearly 
acknowledge what’s happening. This is what’s 
happening now. And as you do that , drop into your 
body , and see what impact, or influence, the emotional 
state has on your body.   
They say that it’s almost impossible to know what your 
mood or mental state is, unless it activates something in 
your body. Some way your body  is energized  – in some 
parts of your body, whether it’s the fa ce, the shoulders, 
the chest, the belly, the hands, or some other part . It 
could be very subtle . It could be a very subtle , felt sense 
of energy. It could also be very dramatic, with tightening 
of the muscles. So to find out : how do you know ? What 
symptoms or signs in your body say that you have this 
emotion ? Then just breathe with that feeling in your 
body. Sense it. Stabilize yourself. Let the body hold that 
felt sense. Let the body help you not be entangled with 
your emotio nal state, but rather to just be present with it, 
and feel it.  Then the interesting thing to do is to see 
what changes as you do that. Does the mood, or the 
mental state, change in some way? Does it get softer, 
weaker, more diffuse? Does it get stronger an d more 
concentrated? Does it stay exactly the same, no change 
at all? It’s very interesting to watch and see what 
changes there might be.  
 
As you’re present for one mood, one emotion, see if you 
can notice if there are other moods  or emotional states 
that swim in and out of it as well. Is it just that you are 
really solidly stabilized in one particular emotion , or are 
other things going on as well? You might feel basically 
happy , and you’re walking down the street , and a dog 
comes barking. You’re basically  happy , but then there’s a little bit of worry that’s flowing through that happiness.   
 
Just notice the different terrain , and see if that noticing 
helps you not be so influenced by the emotion for better 
or for worse. Make sense? That’s the instruction , and I 
hope you enjoy your morning. Thank you.
