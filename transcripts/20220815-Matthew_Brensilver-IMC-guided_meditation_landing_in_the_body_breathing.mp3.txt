 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So hello. Welcome. Good morning to you. Those around this time zone. It is, I know from my nephews, it's the first day of middle school in Berkeley Unified School District. And you have a substitute teacher today. So I'm happy to be with you. My name is Matthew Brinsolver. And yeah, I was, I'm always happy to do whatever Gil asked me to do. I feel inspired by his service. And I'm very happy to be with you and be practicing this week together. And we'll have the usual format. And I will guide us in a meditation for half hour and then offer some reflections starting at half past. So yeah, let us, let us sit together. Thank you. So much of meditation practice is about relinquishing reference points. But it's very useful to have the reference point of love. Love not so much in the sense of some ebullient feeling, but love in the sense of knowing that all experience can soften our heart. That any experience, any experience might hurt, but need not harm our heart. Let me begin with this reference point and progressively surrender so many of the others. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And just taking some deeper breath, spreading your breath through your whole body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We pour the awareness into the whole body. There's no rigidity, but there is a gentle discipline. There's no turning any experience into an enemy thinking or whatever. But we do know why we're doing what we're doing. We're beginning to gather up the fragments of our attention, bring them all right here to the body breathing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The urge to fix and secure our life, such natural urges. It's easy enough we just put this down. We remember in our heart of hearts what practice is about. But sometimes the energy of fixing, of securing our life is so strong that it itself needs the blessing of awareness and love. And so we move the spotlight of attention from our body breathing to the urgency of fixing as it manifests in our emotional body. The circuits that light up with the worried thought or the conclusion we long for. The engine of thinking is affect. And so we imbibe that in awareness and patience. And then perhaps it feels appropriate to return to the body breathing. The field of attention more unified. And so we move the spotlight of attention more unified. you you you you you you you you you you you in meditation we all experiment practice becoming temporary monastics a monastic in the sense of privileging the life of awareness over our life of projects you you you you so to be mindful is actually quite a deep surrender you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
