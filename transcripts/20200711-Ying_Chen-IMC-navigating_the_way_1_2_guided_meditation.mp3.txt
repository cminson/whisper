The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Maybe allow yourself to feel a deeper connection of the bodies with Earth.
Maybe the chairs that you sit on, or the ground, the floor.
Allow yourself to be supported by Earth.
Take a few moments to allow your mind to maybe roam around in the body.
It almost feels as if the mind is finding ways to settle in the body,
as the body begins to quiet and becoming still.
In the first few minutes, let's use our bodies and our breath to collect
various form of energies and emotions in the body.
Allow your awareness to rest in the body.
Maybe rest on the breath.
In this Kalama Sutra, Buddha repeatedly said,
when you know for yourself, then you know what to do.
I'll paraphrase some of the words here.
But when you know for yourself, this is a point in a direction
of becoming really clear about our experiences.
So know what is happening right now.
Have a sense of a clear awareness.
Maybe it's the movements of the breath, the sensations in the body,
or the thoughts that you missed your have.
Know for yourself clearly this is happening right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This knowing that the Buddha is pointing at
is not necessarily narrowly defined by our cognitive thinking, analyzing.
How do you know something through the felt sense in the body?
How do you know something through the felt sense?
This knowing for ourselves is a gradual training.
And we repeatedly allow ourselves to be aware of what is happening.
Sometimes we use our breath and the body as an anchor as we go through this training.
Cultivation of mindful awareness.
And sometimes we may be able to allow our awareness to be more open,
simply receiving what is happening.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sometimes our experiences may be clear and sometimes may not be.
Quite so clear.
No need to make grand conclusions.
Keep looking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Are you aware right now?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
