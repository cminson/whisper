The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
My talk
tonight, not tonight, this morning,
my talk this morning
is called What We Miss.
And the origin of this
talk began a couple months ago when I came
across a quote from Scottish writer
Thomas Carlisle, 19th century
Scottish writer Thomas Carlisle. And the quote was
the tragedy, and what I want to say here also is using
the, what I call it, gender-limited
vernacular of the 19th century. The quote is
the tragedy of life is not so much what men suffer
but rather what they miss.
The tragedy of life is not
so much what men suffer but what they miss.
And this struck a chord
with me, just a kind of a theme of my life and also a
theme of my teaching. And this
also might remind some of you of the famous line
from Socrates. The unexamined life
is not worth living. Sort of a similar sentiment.
Of course Socrates said this while he was in jail
for on trial for being, encouraging his students to challenge
accepted beliefs of the time and to think for themselves.
And in this tradition, maybe what
we would say is the tragedy of the unawakened life.
So I'll talk a bit more about perhaps what
we tend to miss and what it is possible
to see, what's it possible to feel and experience
and what it's possible to realize
as a human. And this does go back to my
childhood. I think this was a theme from very early
on in my childhood. That growing up in the 50s
I would describe it as a somewhat
barren suburban existence.
I had this strong feeling of that something was missing and what I was
being taught and shown and observed around me from
people. And that there was
something, there was more to life, there was more to this experience
of existing than I was being
led on to. And it seemed
to me that there was a lot of what I would call half-lived lives
often a kind of shut down or dullness
around me. And I often went into the little bit
of wild nature that was left in suburbia
to find something that felt more vivid and real
and alive. And it still saddens
me to this day, often the
meeting people and talking to people that
there's a level in which
people are often shut down or cut off
and more and more you see it through being too busy
too distracted, too agitated,
too restless, too impatient. Those seem to be qualities
of modern western American
technological life.
So that to a great degree that
I find that to quote
Mary Oliver
that people aren't here for your one wild and precious life
that people actually miss out
on your one wild and precious life.
Another story from my younger years when I was about 19
and this was a pivotal experience in turning me,
might say turning me towards the Dharma although it was a couple years later
when I was 22 that I actually discovered meditation and Buddhism
but I went on a
five week backpacking trip course
actually in Wyoming through the National Outdoor Leadership School
maybe some of you have done that. It's quite a demanding
training
and for the last week I tell the story
because it has a variety of different points to it so
maybe I've told it before somewhere you've heard it.
The last week of the five weeks they divided us
into small groups. This is in real wilderness
this is without trails. We're not like doing some nice hiking trails
we're bushwhacking. We're using maps and bushwhacking
through the Wind River Range. This is quite
demanding travel
very heavy packs.
So for the last week they divided us into small groups as I recall
maybe four in a group and they gave us
we all had maps. They showed us where we were on the map
and they showed us where we wanted to be in a week
and it was a long way as I recall something like
50 miles and we needed to find our way
to that trailhead and they didn't
give us any food. So we were supposed to
find our food. This is without of course
this is I don't really this to this day
I'm not really sure what they were expecting.
We had no hunting skills or
implement so this meant gathering
and this meant traveling a lot every day and
to make a long story short
we didn't find much food. A few minor
green things or
some puffballs
and made some tea from things we found
so when we actually arrived on the right day
we were in the right place. Very hungry
and actually I was 20 pounds lighter
after the five weeks than when I started and I wasn't heavy
when I started. But we met at the trial
there was a truck there and then they offered us some food, some fruit
and I remember someone handing me
a banana and I remember just for a moment
and if you've ever been I suppose I wouldn't say I was
starving at that point but you know actually after burning that many calories
it's probably as close to the body starting to be in that
mode than I've ever been in my life and
I remember
just first just like just standing there for a while
like wow just this taking in this miracle
of this banana something that prior to that point
had been ordinary and something I certainly took for granted
and I remember this is before I knew about mindfulness and presence
but I remember very slowly peeling it
with a kind of attention
and concentration that I
was intense
and I remember very slowly eating it and I think it was an ordinary banana
but it seemed extraordinary
and one of the lessons of that
of course there's lessons of presence and mindfulness and different things
but one of the lessons of that for me was
to see how much I took for granted
to see how much I wasn't present for my actual experience
and how wonderful and miraculous
ordinary experience can be
and that really set me on a path to find out
how do I
live a life that brings
the richness and vividness and fullness
of life to bear
and I have another story for you
not
my story
some of you may know this story
for all I know the last person to give a Dharma talk here
shared this story you know when you drop in on places like this
you never know what came before you
this is a true story
and this excerpt I'm going to read to you is from the Washington Post
in a Washington DC metro station
on a cold January morning in 2007
a man with a violin played six Bach pieces
approximately 2,000 people went through the station
most of them on their way to work
three minutes after the young man began playing
a middle-aged man slowed his pace and turned to look at the musician
but kept on walking
half a minute later the violinist received his first dollar
a woman threw the money in the hat without stopping
someone actually stand against a wall and listen
a three-year-old boy tried to stop and listen
but his mother tugged him along hurriedly the kid stopped
looked at the violinist again but the mother pushed harder and the child continued
to walk turning his head to look at the musician as he walked away
this action was repeated by several other children
parents without exception forced their children to move on
quickly in the 43 minutes that the violinist
played seven people stopped what they were doing to take
in the performance seven
27 gave money most of them on the run for a total of
32 dollars in change the remaining 1070
people hurried by oblivious to the music few even
turning to look as he finished playing silence took over
no one noticed no one applauded
he received no recognition
the violinist was Joshua Bell one of the greatest musicians
in the world he played some of the most intricate pieces ever written
with a violin worth three and a half million dollars
two days prior Bell sold out a theater in
Boston where the seats averaged $100
the true story Joshua Bell playing a Cognito in the
metro station was organized by the Washington Post as a part of a
social experiment about perception taste and people's
priorities in a commonplace environment
at an inappropriate hour do we perceive beauty
do we stop to appreciate it
if we do not have a moment to stop and listen to one
of the best musicians in the world playing some of the finest music
ever written with one of the most beautiful instruments ever made
how many other things are we missing
in life
so why do we miss
miss much of our life
well as I said in this tradition we often
use the term awakening that we are in a process of awakening
which kind of implies we're all a bit
at least in part asleep perhaps to varying degrees
at varying times there's
a trans-personal psychiatrist Arthur Digmond calls it the trance of ordinary
life and this is a quote from him
so habitual is the trance of ordinary life that one could say the human
beings are a race that sleeps and sometimes
awakens but does not usually fully awaken
because half awake is sufficient for the task
we customarily do few of us are aware of the
dysfunction of our condition
you could say in some ways Buddhism is pointing out
perhaps the inherent suffering or the inherent dysfunction
of our condition of not being awake
and if you know the legend of the Buddha the story of his
path in some ways in the first part of his life he was kind of
in a trance or asleep in
you might say the pleasure realms
until he got some wake-up calls
to look at his life differently
and
the wake-up calls they're called the four heavenly
messengers I like to call them the four heavenly wake-up calls
of aging illness death and
the path of awakening
so I think there's different types of
dharma talks and this type the type I'm giving
today this morning I think of as a wake-up call dharma talk
and I encourage you
to consider this and not have to hit bottom
before we wake up and start to see what's possible
in our life
so another way to put it is many of us are going
along on autopilot or semi-autopilot
sort of humming along through our lives with
not a lot of awareness perhaps being driven
a bit by old expectations
or hopes or hurts or preconceived
ideas or ambitions or habits
and we tend to live out much of
our conditioning conditioning from our childhood
without quite as much questioning of it
as we could or perhaps seeing how much it's actually
driving our life and we spend a lot of time
caught up in the what you might call the ego's small
agenda the small self the stories
the stories about superiority or inferiority
how am I doing story
the stories of safety or danger of
getting or losing of being good enough of success
and failure
Thich Nhat Hanh says we are very good
at preparing to live but not very good at actually
living so much of our life can be kind of a
preparation for living we think we're going to get everything right we're taking care of business
but we actually haven't stopped to actually
live our life fully
so we get caught up in one way I like to say we can fly right past
our destination caught up in our
business caught up in our laptop I like to think of
you know that happened it was the last year
the year before when that those pilots
were on their
plane was on autopilot and they were kind of on autopilot
and they were on their laptops and actually missed their destination
in Minneapolis and flew by
and that's a bit how we are literally often nowadays
caught up on our laptops
not really paying attention to what the
you could say the important journey is and where we're headed
and so we miss it
so
so in doing that
we often sacrifice the possibility and the potentiality
of being human we sacrifice the depth of healing
and transforming of our heart and mind that can happen
and we sacrifice a profound freedom
and joy and happiness that comes
from that and we often
sacrifice that for what I would say a false sense of
security and safety or seeking a false sense of
security and safety because ultimately
any kind of security and safety is rather provisional and limited
and sometimes we're
more comfortable with familiarity and the known
and the
sometimes the dulling effects of that
this is from Anne Wilson Schaeff from her book
When Society Becomes an Attic
it is in the interest of our society to promote those things that take the edge off
of our society with our fixes
and keep us slightly numb and zombie like
in this way our modern consumer society
itself functions as an addict
so we might think what we're addicted to
that keeps us a little shut down or cut off
or numbed to the fullness and completeness
so here
with meditation and practice we're learning a kind of presence
a wakeful, connected, alive
presence that is not driven by conditioning
in the past and all our stories and mental constructions
you could say meditation practice is the art of waking up
of waking up the heart
of not missing what is truly important
of perhaps turning away from our obsession on what is not
important in a kind of direct knowing
or seeing
and as the little prince said
to learn to see with the heart which is a much more open
inclusive direct way of connecting with
what is
and Rumi has a lovely
poem, you may be familiar with this
poem as well relating to this
for years copying other people
I tried to know myself
but then I couldn't decide what to do unable to see
I heard my name being called
then I walked outside
the breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you
don't go back to sleep
you must ask for what you really want
don't go back to sleep
people are going back and forth across the door sill
where the two worlds meet
the door is round and open
don't go back to sleep
so part of this waking up
is to actually see what is true
in our life to see the
unresolvable predicament
of the human life which is
demonstrated in a story of the two tigers
some of you may know this story I think it's a Zen story but I'm not actually sure
sometimes you hear these stories over the years
you don't know where they come from and the story
goes that there's a man or a woman
running in the forest being chased by a tiger
and the
maybe let's make it a little more local being chased by a mountain lion
comes to a cliff
and sees that there's nowhere to go except over the cliff
or to stay with the tiger or a lion
and then it looks over the cliff and sees that there's a few feet down
there's a branch and so it kind of jumps
enough and holds on to the branch
and then the tiger
I mean lion it's the first time I've used lion so I have to
the lion is sort of looking over but realizes it can't actually at this point
reach the person
and then the person looks below
and what do they see at the bottom of the cliff
another
lion
so this person looks above and there's a
lion and they look below and there's a lion
what do they do this is
a metaphor for life for birth and death
our life there's two lions on either side
of our life one end is birth and the other
end is death so this person
is there in this predicament and
they notice that growing out of
the side of the cliff is a beautiful
strawberry plant with some very beautiful
ripe strawberries so holding on
to the branch picks the strawberries eats
them and enjoys them
so we need to face our predicament
and see where we are in the present and live it fully
in the face of the two lions
my first teacher was a Zen teacher a very
dynamic
and
energetic and sometimes unpredictable
Korean Zen master and Sansa name or his other name
formal name was Zen master Sung Sung this is in the
in New England and he would he this is a quote from
him Zen is the great work of life and death
is life what is death
what is life what is death when you attain this
then everything is clear everything is complete
and everything is freedom
so I'm going to say a little bit what is in the
here and now that we miss
well Proust said
the voyage of discovery lies not in finding new
landscapes but in having new eyes
and meditation is really the process of
taking away the veils and the delusions and the confusions
and the habits so that we can refresh
our eyes and to see with more clarity
and directness and immediacy and openness
sometimes people think if I really
do that then there'll be so much input
there'll be overwhelmed I'll get lost in it and sometimes people do get lost in it
and the truth is that there is more stimulus
and more data you might say pouring into us then we could
possibly consciously process in any particular moment
so in although parts of our
you might say parts of our unconscious is doing that
job for us so in essence we
must choose what we pay attention to and you might say spiritual paths
give us the direction of what to choose of what to look
for of what is actually important to pay attention to in our lives
we've been taught and conditioned that there's a lot of
things are important to look at that actually aren't
important to look at to pay attention to to obsess on
to think about a lot
there's so much about how we appear to others how we look
a lot of the superficiality of our culture
has been given a lot of emphasis so the spiritual traditions are saying
wait a minute that's not what's really important here's some
guidelines on what to pay attention to
so I'm just going to mention a few
so what do we pay attention to one thing is we pay attention to the
process and patterns of our experience as opposed to just the content
the storyline the superficial appearance of things
sort of drop down and seeing what is happening here what are the patterns
what's the actual process
and one of those things one of the most fundamental in
this tradition is to watch the process the pattern
of our habits of reactivity
now this one you hear in different ways over and over again in this tradition
to notice our habit of grasping after what we want
of pushing away what we don't of shutting down the rest
so I encourage you just paying
attention to how this pattern of reactivity plays out
and the suffering that that leads to can actually
lead you to a place of letting
go and freedom one of the other things we pay attention to
one is the actual fleeting nature the changing
flux ephemeral in permanent nature of experience
that everything that we can experience is always in a
flow and beginning to then
be able to that helps this process of letting go of opening
of allowing things to be another thing to pay attention to
sometimes called the consequences consequences
of our intentions our beliefs our attachments
actions cause and effect
begin to learn what leads to more
suffering and what leads to more freedom
another thing to pay attention is to the actual process and experience
of the thinking mind most of us how much of the time
are caught up in actual the content of our thinking
being driven by it being lost by it
being confused by it
so can you actually begin to see what is the nature
of the thinking mind what is the nature of having thoughts
what is that experience actually like am I my thoughts
who I am I without my thoughts
very important experience
to look at is how we get caught up in this identification
and fiction of the what I call the drama of me
this story of
constant story of
what's happening to me how am I doing am I doing it well enough
we're pretty much obsessed
with you know what we want what we don't want ignoring the rest
that also much of our life
I'm working with people and I see this even to myself a lot of life can actually be
spent trying to avoid imaginary experiences
that might happen that's called worry
and anxiety
that we create all these projections in the future and then we
kind of like how can I that might happen so I'll do this and so forth
Carlos oh no before Carlos Castaneda
Mark Twain has a wonderful quote I am an old man and I have known a great
many troubles but most of them never happened
and that's true of us how many catastrophic
worries have you had that never happened and yet undermine the quality
of your life Carlos
Castaneda in the voice of Don Juan says
Don Juan the self too much produces a terrible fatigue
and I think we're all a little bit
subject to that fatigue a man in that position
a man or woman in that position is deaf and blind to everything else
the fatigue itself makes him cease to see the marvels
all around him
so we move from just
the story of me what I want and don't want
am I succeeding failing am I liked am I not
liked to what is actually happening to the
wider world we start paying attention to what this
journey is really about and we can pay
attention in that to the actual wisdom and depth and feedback
and information of our own living bodies which have been here
for evolving for a few million years
I think there might be something important there to know so I encourage
that we can pay attention to what is actually
in our own hearts become literate
learn the emotional intelligence
we can as we become familiar with our own hearts we become
familiar with the hearts of others we can pay attention to the natural
world to the more than human world
in some ways the essence of this
path is to see the nature of things as they
are and live in harmony with it
and to do that to actually
observe the more than human natural world
will teach you tremendous Dharma lessons
about who you are and what is happening about the nature of permanence
and interconnectedness
we can pay attention to the simple
joys and pleasures and beauty that abound
you know one thing as I work with people and particularly people who are first
introduced to mindfulness and I also teach mindfulness based
stress reduction is they suddenly wake up and notice that they're enjoying
the smallest, simplest activities of life
of just moments of
quiet moments of noticing what's actually
in their garden moments of noticing another person
and this relates to the
Joshua Bell story and suddenly people start
shifting from giving value over to accomplishing and producing
writing and completing lists to
actually just opening to what is here
the mystic novelist Romaine Rowland said
there is only one heroism in the world to see the world
as it is and to love it
are you willing to try that on
another thing we can notice is the power
of simple kindness
and related to that
opening to the depth this may not seem like something you want to pay attention to but
opening to the depth of suffering in yourself and the world
because that is the gateway to the possibility of great
compassion and wisdom and lastly
the thing I want to mention that we often
don't pay attention to or don't even know how to pay attention to
which to me is what the
perhaps well the gift of any mystical path
and the gift of Buddhist path is we miss our own Buddha nature
and we miss the very magic and mystery
of being we miss the greater
reality than our conventional materialistic
experience and this is sometimes called true nature
the nature of reality I have one teacher called it source
it can be called the absolute nature of mind that's often what it's called
in Tibetan practice nibbana
divine presence could be a lot of different words for it
but our spiritual path directs us to how we cut through
and open up to actually
being able to
apprehend something larger
this is from Zen teacher Tony Packer
the emergence and blossoming of understanding love and intelligence has nothing to do
with any tradition no matter how ancient or impressive
has nothing to do with time it happens completely on
its own when a human being questions wonders
listens and looks without getting stuck in fear, pleasure and pain
when self concern is quiet in
abeyance heaven and earth are open
and this is
right here and right now
the most ultimate and profound
opening, letting go
experience is simply right here, right now
and will never be anywhere else
a little story
metaphorical, it's a true story but I use it as a metaphor
I lived in Massachusetts for 25 years before I moved to California
in 2003 and there
because it's humid and because it's very hilly
you don't get to see big skies and there often aren't real colorful
sunsets so one night I was driving home through this one valley
that was quite open and I lived up in the hills there
where you couldn't see the sky very well and there was the most spectacular
sunset, one of the most I'd ever seen and I've seen some great sunsets
in Colorado and many places and unbelievable
cloud formations and colors and I was sort of like
driving like that and just before I went into the hills
where I knew I would lose it I pulled over
into an area that was a convenience store, a little gas station
and ATM booth
and I just pulled over and parked and I just
enjoying the delight and wonder and the
simplicity of that beauty
and then I looked around, there were a lot of people there
people going in and out of the ATM machine, people going in and out of the convenience store
people doing their car and not one person
was noticing the sky and the sunset
not one person and
I kind of, maybe I should have, I kind of wanted to scream
look up everybody
but I wanted to say that it is a metaphor, it's that simple
it's that simple, we just need to notice what's there
instead of being caught in our habits
in our agendas and getting things done
and so forth
so what I'd like to say in the depth of our practice
that mystery and awe and wonder become our best companions
and so that if we stop to listen, stop now
right now
what Tara Bra called the sacred pause, to stop
listen, open
see the gaps, see the openness and emptiness that's here
to quote Thomas Carlisle
again, he said
I don't pretend to understand the universe, it's a great deal bigger than I am
and I encourage you to remember that daily
it's one reason why I like to go out and look at the night sky
you get a humbling, beautiful wonderful
sense of the mystery, the unknown
something greater is happening
there's actually a show on PBS tonight I think
about
on public TV about the edges of the universe, I like watching
those shows so we need to
actually, again, let go of all our ideas about things
this is from Rumi and I think of this as in stock exchange language
he says, sell your cleverness
and buy bewilderment
and this is what again my Zen master, Sansanim called
Don't Know Mind, it's those moments where we stop
and the mind is open and empty
and actually begins to not
conceptualize and judge and try to fit things in
it can actually begin to see and what it begins to see is a kind of magic
and enliveness and a vividness begins to see the
dreamlike ephemeral nature of this life of
experience, it begins to actually open to the underlying
openness and emptiness, expansiveness, spaciousness
stillness and silence that is our true nature
I have this quote from an Australian aboriginal elder
which I like very much, he says, never forget
everything's a mystery, once it stops being a mystery
it stops being true
and then to really end
this is from
Jack Cornfield
this is from Jack Cornfield
his book obviously Wise Heart
which no matter how much I make photo copies I can't get the whole page on
so I have to bring the book
of course Jack wrote this and I'm envious because I wish I had written this
and I'll share this with you
what is most amazing of all is that we can spend days even months taking the mystery for granted
of course our automatic habits serve us and help us function
we might have a hard time functioning if we are in a constant state of awe
but the all too common deadening of our senses is far
from the middle path, we are part of this mystery
our eyeballs and eardrums, our voices and emotions, our delusions
and awakening are woven together with and contained within the mystery
we are not only witness to this mystery
we are the mystery looking at itself
what he says next is kind of
what I like to see as being a teacher
people who come to Buddhist practice hope that it will help them
with the ordinary sufferings of their life and often it will
but a deeper current flows through Buddhist teachings
when I sit with students I do not just want to help them solve their problems
I want to find a moment
and this is the don't know moment, this is the sacred pause moment
this is the moment of cutting through
I want to find a moment with each person where the mind stops and their eyes open
I want us to be together as if we are lying
on a field on the underside of the earth on a clear summer night
held only by the magnet of gravity looking down into a bottomless sea of stars
I want us to remember together the beauty all around us
Patricia comes in sick and frightened
but if she can let go and sense the preciousness
and ephemeral dance of her days on this timeless earth
see that it's all a blessing if Jalen can step out of being injured child
and appreciate the mysterious dance that led to his adoption
and current search for birth mother his heart becomes wise
if Mary Linda can release her worries about retirement
and sense the grace that has carried her and her children
for 24 years then our work together
is a success
so I'm going to end there
with a little bit of silence
and I've gone over a little bit but I want to have a few minutes
for any comments or questions but
let's just sit for a moment in silence
breathing
just allowing yourself to
as Ram Dass says, plumb the depth of the present moment
opening and being awake to what's here now
