 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So this can be a sitting posture, a standing posture, or a lying down posture. All of these are suitable for meditation. We might start by taking three deep breaths together. Inhaling and exhaling. Inhaling again. Exhaling and a last time. And allowing the breath to resume a normal rhythm. As we begin our meditation, we might consider setting an intention for practice this morning. Maybe to meet the moment with patience and kindness. Maybe just to recognize what's happening at any given moment. And to feel it, to feel it fully in the body. At this time, you might connect with an anchor for your meditation. That might be the breath, the soundscape, or the bodily posture. Allowing the mind to rest and settle on the anchor, on our object of meditation. Exhaling. As we begin to settle together, it can be helpful to notice if there is any extra tension in the body. You can intentionally relax the body, softening the scalp, releasing the temples, softening the jaw. Perhaps allowing the mouth to open for a moment and float closed. So the jaw is relaxed. Softening the shoulders, allowing the belly to drop down and forward. And releasing any extra tension in the legs, the ankles, and the feet. And if there's any tension in the body that won't relax, that's no problem at all. Just relax around the tension. No need to ask this moment to be any different than it is. Reconnecting with your anchor now. Feeling a full breath cycle. Inviting the mind to rest on the simplicity of what's present. Allowing the mind to relax. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. If you've noticed that the mind has wandered, can you gently and kindly return your attention to the present moment? Bringing yourself back to the anchor, just sliding back to the anchor. No need to contract or judge yourself if the mind has gone missing. Just sliding back to the present moment as many times as is needed. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. As we continue staying connected to our primary anchor of attention, the breath, the soundscape, if something else calls your attention, maybe a strong sensation elsewhere in the body, an emotion or mood, a sound, allow the mind to recognize that, such that mindfulness knows what's happening. Sensations in the knee, contraction in the shoulder blade, a sense of peacefulness or dis-ease, just allowing the mind to recognize what's present if it draws your attention away from the anchor. And you can take a few moments to get to know that experience, that which is recognized, which is identified, feeling the sensations in the knee, getting to know them, getting to know whatever draws your attention for a few moments before returning to your anchor. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling. Exhaling.
