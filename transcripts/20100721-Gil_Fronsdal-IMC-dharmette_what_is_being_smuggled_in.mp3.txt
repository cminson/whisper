Dharmette: What Is Being Smuggled 
In?

When I was in Northern Ireland recently I was told a 
story. It was told as if it were true, so hopefully it was 
true. It was a variation of a ancient classic story in which  
the subject was a donkey. The way the story was told to 
me was that t hey used to have very sharp borders 
between Ireland and Northern Ireland , and it was 
basically a militarized zone. People were smuggling 
things. Some people were smuggling guns to Northern 
Ireland , but there were  all kinds of smuggling going on. 
After the border was taken down, a border guard ran 
into a woman  in a wheelchair  and said, “You used to 
come across the border regularly , and I always had the 
impression you were smuggling , but we could never 
figure out what you were smuggling. ” She said, “Oh 
yeah , I was smuggling [laughs] – I was smuggling 
wheelchairs ” [laughs] . The ancient  story had  to do with 
a donkey. For years a  guy goes across the border wi th 
his d onkey. The border guards asks, “What were  you 
smuggling all those years? ” “Donkeys! ” [laughs] . I 
thought of those stories  because sometimes in our practice, we pay attention to one thing , but we are 
missing something else that ’s really going on.  
 
When I was in the  Zen monastery in Japan, the short 
story is I  didn’t like it very much there  [laughs] . I didn ’t 
think it was a good place for me to practice for a variety 
of reasons. I didn ’t think it was  so serious. But I stuck it 
out – the period I comm itted myself to – and then I left. 
After I left , I was so surprised to discover how much I ’d 
been affected and changed from the time in the 
monastery. I hadn ’t seen it when I was there. The 
training in the monastery had been  a physical training, 
training t hrough the body , whereas  I was focusing on 
my mind , on getting concentrated and being mindful. I 
had one idea of what I was developing in  the Dharma, 
but really there was somethi ng else being smuggled in: 
a variety of things in my body.   
 
A lot of Zen tra ining is through the body, through the 
forms that you hold yourself in. You don ’t just walk into a 
room mindfully , but you walk into the meditation hall  
holding your body in a particular way. You h old your 
hands like this. Here , you can keep your hands in your 
pocket s as you come into our hall. In Zen you hold your 
hands like this, upright. It requires a certain kind of 
attentiveness to your bod y to do this. You pass 
someone o n the pathway, and you don ’t just  say, “Hey 
George, ” and give them a high five . You actually bring 
your hands together in a very intentional way , and you bow to them. In that greeting t here’s a physical 
involvement.  
 
In the monastery, t here are many, many ways in which 
you use your body . I was reprimanded when I was 
setting the dinner table for all the monks. We ’d go to the 
kitchen , and get the food , and carry it out to the dining 
hall. I grabbed the pot of rice , and although there were  
two handles , I just held it with one handle – it wasn’t so 
heavy. I was reprimanded because when you carry the 
rice like that, you ’re supposed to carry with both hands , 
because that ’s respectful. You have  to respect the rice , 
so you hold it with both hands – you don’t do it casually. 
But also what it meant was you engaged with your 
whole body, present for what you are doing.  
 
The cumulative effect of this for months on end – having  
this very intentional form w hich you enter into and take 
on – affected me. I t smuggled in a certain kind of ability, 
strength, presence in my body. After I left the 
monastery, I became aware how much more inner 
stability I had – how much more  physical stability I had, 
and how much I was attentive and mindful to what I was 
doing through my body, aware of my body. It was very 
helpfu l because it helped me monitor much better  how 
much I was caught or not caught – how present I was or 
not present I was. It added to my presence.  
 There are a lot of things going on in practice , some of 
which you are not paying attention to. You ’re the border 
guard, looking for something important to happen. Many 
people are measuring themse lves, checking themselves 
out. “Have I made progress – the right kind of progress 
– yet in meditation? ”  Certainly this inner monitoring is a 
very important part of pr actice. But p ractice unfolds in 
many more ways than we often realize.  
 
This is all to lead  up to a point I wanted to make: the 
importance of r egular practice, every day, day in , day 
out, independent of wha t you think might be going on. 
“I’m getting m ore c oncentrated, more mindful ” – 
whatever  it might be – “More  free, more relaxed. ” The 
regularity of the pract ice creates a strength within i f you 
have a  regularity of discipline  and if you do t hat 
discipline with your body, p utting yourself in t he same 
stable , upright posture  whether you want to or not, 
whether it ’s chaotic in your mind or not, whether you ’re 
still or not, whether you ’re broken -hearted or not, 
whether you ’re completely confused about what to do 
with your life, whether you ’re overwhelmed with what ’s 
going on. N o matter what goes on , you don ’t succumb 
to anything;  you don ’t give in completely to whatever is 
going on , but you meet it, you’re present for it with this 
stable, upright posture.  
 
You might think that you ’re the complete Buddhist 
disaster. You ’re a dis aster sitting upright, strong. You think that your life ’s falling apart a round you. You sit up, 
strong – over and over and over again – and something 
that’s maybe not so visible or obvious begins happening 
and shifting and changing within . We come to have a 
certain inner stability, equanimity, balance, and strength 
that we carry with us through what ever we’re doing, 
whatever is going on.  
 
You find that in future situations, you have the capacity 
to meet them  with some way of being stable, some way 
of not be ing pushed around by them, s ome ability just to 
stay and be. You k eep showing up and be ing there for 
that, for that, for that.  It’s kind of dumb Buddhism, in the 
sense that it doesn ’t require a lot of i ntelligence to just 
sit upright  be present. It doesn ’t require a lot of wisdom. 
It’s a physical  thing – almost  brute force.  
 
What I ’m talking about today is physically  showing up 
with your bodies, staying there and being present, 
upright, no matter what.  You want to cry. You could just 
collapse on the floor in a puddle , or you could sit upright 
and be an island in the puddle that forms around you. 
Just let the tears flow. You have  stability, strength, from 
this regularity. H ere you are, in this rootedness.  Slowly 
this gives a person a tremendous amount of strength to 
go through life with a certain degre e of equanimity, with 
balance in the face of  what ’s going on.  
 I was thinking of talking about this today beca use I just 
spent a few days at the  Zen monastery at Tassaja ra. It 
was really obvious there.  I was reminded how that body 
practice worked for me and how much I benefited from 
the forms – and not from what I thought was going on at 
the time.  I could also see from pe ople who had spent a 
year or  two there, and whom  I’d known before . One of 
them had a lot of psychological challenges. The 
psychological difficulties hadn ’t really improved so much 
in the conventional way , but the person had a greater 
capacity for stability , being upright, being present, just 
holding themse lves in an upright way through it all . This 
gave the person a certain strength that wasn ’t there 
before in the midst of the psychological difficulties. It 
took months of Zen practice, sitting upright, holding your 
hands like this, discip line, showing up fo r your job – the 
regularity of the whole monastic life.   
 
Some of that can also happen for al l of us here in our 
regular non -monastic life by simply  having a meditation 
practice every  day – day in and day out – and sitting 
upright. Not giving in and saying, “Today I ’m sitting on 
the couch. Today I ’ll just stay in bed and meditate lying 
down. ” “I’m mindful; I ’m present, relaxed. ” Lying down is 
good,  but you don ’t get that benefit of sitting upright in 
the midst of whatever is going on, good or bad.  
 
Regularit y of practice is so important – when you 
practice every  day, whether you want to or not . Once you st art engaging in this question, “Do I want to? Do I 
not want to? Should I? Shouldn ’t I?” then you lose this 
inner training, this other smuggling thing  that’s going on 
that you ’re trying to sneak by the border guard. Maybe 
the border guard is your usual, conventional 
preferences : what you want and don ’t want to happen. 
Just stay with the regularity w hether you want to or not, 
whether it ’s difficult or no t – just show up. Show up. 
You’re there, you ’re there, you ’re there.
