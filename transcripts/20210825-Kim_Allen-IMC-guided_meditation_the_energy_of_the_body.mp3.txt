 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So we'll go ahead and get started now with the meditation. Just settling in to where you are. Perhaps closing the eyes if that's comfortable for you. Having a sense of taking your place. Finding the spot where you're going to sit. Or stand or lie down. And feeling into how it is for the body to be in that posture right now. Just an overall sense of the body. And then bringing attention to the place where you're sitting, the place that's supporting you. The chair or the cushion or maybe the couch or bed. And just feeling the balance of the body against that surface and letting it support you. Letting go of it to be supported. By your seat and ultimately by the earth. Some balance, sometimes I rock back and forth a little bit or forwarding back just to find that middle point. Or something close, close enough. So that it doesn't take so much effort to be upright. And perhaps taking a breath that's a little deeper than usual. And then on the exhale, letting the body soften. Maybe imagining it expanding a little bit. Softening the face and the eyes. Even softening the thinking muscle in the brain, if you can imagine that. And down through the throat and shoulders. Down into the chest area and the torso. You can help to imagine the spine as a support and everything else relaxing around that. Softening down through the belly. Into the legs. Letting go of any sense of bracing. And on out to include the feet and the hands. As we've been busy up in our head, thinking or reading something on the screen or talking. We may want to imagine bringing the energy down into the body. Letting the energy of the mind spread out through the body softly. Perhaps sensing how there's an aspect of the body that is an extension of the mind. If we have any motion or mood or a predominant thought we've been caught up in, there may be some echo of that in the body. And we just notice that, just have mindfulness of that. Don't need to change anything. So intending to use the body as the main object of mindfulness for this sitting. And if at any time that becomes uncomfortable or difficult, it's possible to remember the ground or your sitting feel that connection. Or to open the eyes. But if you can, staying with the simple energies of the body, the various sensations it has coming and going. It's a very rich area of practice. Just to be with that. Perhaps using the natural physical sensations of breathing as a gentle rhythm in the background. Flowing through the body. Retro Exploring if the space of the body, in the general stillness of the body, can begin to calm the mind even just a little bit. Even if the body is not a very comfortable place today, there's a way in which its steadiness can support the mind. Often the body is moving a little slower than the mind, and that can be useful in meditation. This is a way to calm the mind even if the body is not a very comfortable place...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
