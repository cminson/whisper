 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Thank you. There you go. So I want to, can you hear me okay? Yeah. That's right. That's right. Okay. Can you hear me okay now? Yeah. I'm going to start out by reading you a beautiful passage. So this is the Buddha talking. And he says, fear is born from arming oneself. Just see how many people fight. Not just fighting with each other, but fighting within themselves, conflict within oneself. I'll tell you about the dreadful fear that caused me to shake all over. This is the Buddha talking. It's kind of so sweet, humble. It caused me to shake all over. Seeing creatures flopping around, like fish in water too shallow, so hostile to one another. And I see this also internally, self-judgment, so hostile. We have so many, so hard on ourselves. We can be so cruel to ourselves. So judgmental. Seeing this, I became afraid. The world completely lacks essence, lacks essence, lacks awareness, lacks the ground. It trembles in all directions. I longed to find myself a place unscathed, but I could not see it. Seeing people locked in conflict, I became completely distraught. But then I discerned here a thorn. Hard to see. A thorn lodged deep in the heart. It's only when one is pierced by this thorn that one runs in all directions. Such vivid, beautiful imagery. When one is pierced by this thorn. This thorn, we'll describe it later, this thorn of self, of me, myself, and mine. That thorn, when we're pierced by that, we run in all directions. So that if that thorn is taken out, one does not run and settles down. Who here has crossed over desires? The world's bond, so hard to get past, she does not grieve, he does not mourn. His stream is cut, she's all unbound. What went before, let go of that. All that's to come, have none of that. Don't hold on to what's in between, and you'll wander fully at peace. For whom there is no eye making all throughout the body and mind. And who grieves not for what is not is undefeated in the world. For whom there is no this is mine, nor anything like that is theirs, not even finding selfness. She does not grieve. I have nothing. So this is the central problem in all Buddhist traditions, the problem that we have, this sense of me, self, that there's something real here, something permanent me here, something singular. So it's so important to have some, it's centrally important to have some sense of emptiness, of, even though we don't completely take it in, but just cognitively have some sense that there is, there is no permanent me here. The body obviously isn't me. It's so obvious, the body's always changing. The body is a little child, and then it gets a little older, and it gets bigger and older, gets old age, sick and dies. The body's out of control. You have to go to the bathroom. You can't help it. You've got to go. All the systems of the body, everything is changing in this body. People try to preserve their beauty. You can't. It's just beauty fades. The thoughts, what did you think a minute ago? You don't remember. It's gone. They're like butterflies. We grab onto a thought and we think that's me, especially thoughts that repeat themselves. Maybe they repeat themselves as a problem for days or weeks that keeps coming back, but eventually even that thought that you were so solidly me will go. Think of all the me's that you've had through your life, these solid permanent problems of me that's gone. Feelings come and go. Sense perceptions obviously are not me. You know, the hearing, it's gone. There's not even a present moment. You can't even grasp a present moment. It's gone as soon as you try to grab it. In science, quantum physics, you know, they describe who we are in terms of science. We're made up of atoms that are made up of sub-atoms that are made up of sub-atoms and ad infinitum. And ultimately you cannot see these particles. I know I'm talking very intellectually now, cognitively now, but it's important to take in that we are particles. We are just particles. And these particles, these microscopic, undiscernable particles are 99.9 percent space. So consider you are space. So this is a view, a view of no-self. And then we take this step. So believing that, believing there is really nothing here. That's permanent, singular, and undivided. And then take that certainty into your meditation and try to experience that. And it can be such a relief to removing that thorn, to allowing that thorn to leave, to be pulled out. And even in meditation you might reflect sometimes, where is this self? Where is this self? What is this self? Can you find yourself anywhere? Does this self have a form? Does this self have a shape? Does it have a color? Is there anything graspable about this self? I quoted the Buddha earlier. He said, when you penetrate the conceit of less than, more than, or equal to, when you can penetrate, he doesn't say get rid of these illusions of self. There will be no more suffering when you penetrate it. So say some thought comes up, which it does for every human being. I am less than, a sense of low self-esteem, a sense of lack of worth. And knowing, first of all, there's emptiness here. This is the self is, I am empty of self. So this idea, this conception that I am less than, is a delusion. It's a dream. It's a habit, a habitual pattern that's formed in me. And with great confidence holding that idea, that concept of less than, of low self-esteem, using as an example, it could be anger, it could be fear, it could be any of the obstacles, the obscurations, obscurations of what is really here. Awareness, present moment, awareness is what is really here. So with the confidence, we can hold that. We don't have to fight with that low self-esteem thought. Oh, this has arisen in me. This bubble, this dream has arisen in me. With the confidence, it's a delusion. And then we can hold it lightly and let it be. Maybe even hold it with warmth, with compassion. I'm just this poor sap of a human being that is subject to these habitual patterns, these conditions. Oh, yeah. And we're all the same. We're all in the same boat. We're all... That's penetrating the conceit. It's not getting rid of, it's not improving. To get rid of the conceit, that's more me. I'm going to be mine. I'm going to get rid of it. I'm going to be a better... I'm going to improve it. I had this self-improvement project where I don't have any thoughts of self anymore. That's more me. Just relax and let it all be. Relax into what is really here, what's really here right now, right now. It's so obvious. We're aware right now. We're awake. How beautiful. How wonderful. Just be with that. Be awake. And who cares if a dream of... not as good as, or better than, or all those self-ideas... Just rest. You don't have to do anything. Just rest and let it all come and go. Let the senses come and go. All right. Thank you very much. It's nice to talk with you. Are there some announcements? You want to turn that off? Hello. So it will take 15 minutes for a mindful cleaning of the temple. So let's see, I got a quick headcount. So how about if I can have one person take out the trash and the recycling? And then let's see, three people for cleaning the bathrooms. And how about one vacuum the meditation hall? And one can sweep the community. All right. Thank you. I think we'll skip the outdoors today. Hillary? Oh, you want... Okay. All right. Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
