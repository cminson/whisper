 I feel a little bit shy about the topic that I've somehow decided to think to talk about tonight because it's not something I know much about. And you'll find out soon enough. And it's one that I've been shy to talk about, you know, it hasn't really occurred to me much to talk about this particular topic because it hasn't really, really interested me that much. But somehow it surfaced to the top of things that now interest me to talk about that a little bit. Partly because I feel like it might be interesting for a lot of people who are here, who are grappling with this theme, to hear a little bit the Buddhist perspective on it. And I can certainly offer that. I can offer the Buddhist perspective, what the Buddha had to say or the Buddhist teachings had to say on this topic. My opinion, I don't know if it really counts for much. I don't know if it'll come out this evening. This bench is building. So I thought I'd talk about God. What do you think of that as a topic? What? It's a good topic? You haven't heard me say anything yet. So one of the little catalysts for talking about this was yesterday I was driving up Highway 5 from up to Central Valley. And there was not exactly a bumper sticker because it was much bigger than bumper sticker, but it said, Jesus is God, read the Bible. And so I asked my friend, you know, what's that about? Jesus is God. And she reminded me about the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. And I asked her, what's that about? And she said a little bit about it. And I said, what's that about? And she was raised as a Catholic, went to Catholic school and studied a lot of these ideas. And she finally said, well, it's a mystery. So then you don't say, can't say anything. It's a mystery. And I myself am not particularly interested in this topic because in the sense that I don't really think it has much to do with Dharma practice. Some people feel it's very intimately connected to the Dharma practice, but I don't feel it has much to do with it. So why would I want to talk about it? And people are welcome to be theists and believe in God or not. It doesn't really matter. And actually, I find it starting to delight to know that someone has come here to or come to Buddhism mindfulness practice or meditation practice and have found that it helps them or reconnects them in a healthy way or helps them with their, maybe perhaps their native religion. That somehow by practicing mindfulness, it brings them this gives them the skills, the abilities, the self knowledge that helps them to connect to their sense, their intuitive sense or whatever of God or whatever it might be. I'm delighted by that idea. And in thinking about the topic of God, I'm realizing there's so many different definitions or ideas of what God is that anybody who wants to talk about it in any broad, in non-dogmatic ways and just say this is how, you know, it's going to be in trouble very quickly because of all the different concepts and ideas. But one of the common ideas about God, at least historically, is that God is a creator God and God created the universe, the world, humanity. And we find in ancient India, this idea existed also in certain corners of Indian religion. And the Buddha didn't really address this too directly, this topic, but occasionally he mentioned the idea of a creator God. He never talked about it in supportive or interested terms. We did talk about how sometimes the idea of a creator God can lend itself to problems, wrong views. And one of them would be any kind of idea of pre-determinism. If everything's pre-determined by God, if that, you know, by a creator God, then it could lend itself to some people saying, well, I can, it doesn't matter what I do then. It's all pre-determined and I can just, you know, if I want to go rob the bank, that's pre-determined. I can't help myself. And then someone else would say, well, it's pre-determined that I put you in jail. The other, so the Buddha specifically addressed that kind of theistic idea, creator God. He also addressed the issue of the fact there's evil and suffering in the world. And if you have a pre-determined situation where God is pre-determined how things are going to turn out, which is one of the ideas they had in ancient India, then the Buddha concluded that then it's a wicked God, an evil God, because why would, if it's pre-determined, why would he or she have it, you know, have suffering? There are little hints, you know, in the Buddha addressed this issue. But however, it seemed like the Buddha more often than not wanted to, if it brought up this issue, wanted to make fun of it, that he had a creator God. And now it's not the Jewish and Christian creator God that he's criticizing and making fun of because he didn't know of that one, the particular one. And, you know, there are other ones, you know, so there's a lot of them in the world. So he just happened to pick up the one that he was familiar with in India of his time. And he explained that it was a misunderstanding, the whole thing of the creator God. And so you want to hear the story of why it was a misunderstanding? In Buddhist cosmology, Buddhist cosmology is kind of interesting. And if you're interested, if you like reading Greek mythology and the cosmology of the Greeks that was contemporary to the time of the Buddha, you get a sense of maybe, you know, look at the Indian cosmology from 2500 years ago, what they believed in the gods and the shape of the world. For example, they believe that ancient Indians and ancient Indian Buddhists believe that the earth was flat. So if you want to accept Buddhist cosmology, you have to accept that. If you don't accept that, then maybe the rest of his cosmology is like, well, how do you sort that one out now? But traditionally, 2500 years ago, the earth was flat. And there was this huge mountain in the middle of this flat square. And in the south of that square was Jambudvipa, which is the Apple Rose country, which is now what's known as India. And Buddhas can only be born in Jambudvipa. And then if you go up this big mountain of Miro, then as you get to the higher elevations of it, you get to the six lower god realms. And there are six realms of gods where the gods are very close to being kind of like humans. They have all kind of very similar characteristics to humans. And they're the ones that interact the most with the human world. But they're kind of in this heaven, this high up there, in this kind of realm, in this high mountain. And if you imagine a mountain coming together at a point, then at the top of it, it's kind of like a pyramid. Then there's an inverse pyramid that comes out from the top of that. And that's kind of the unseen world of further heavens and further gods. And above the first six realms of gods that kind of belong to our realm, there are something like, I don't know how many, but 33 realms of gods beyond that. And there's one category of gods which are called the gods of form, which correspond to the form Jhanas, the absorptions. And then you have the formless gods, which have no form, have no body, and somehow are disembodied spirits. And they correspond to the formless, the deepest absorptions. The gods at the lowest realm, I hope this interests you. Hopefully, if this part doesn't interest you, other parts will. But, I'll just talk. So at the lowest realm, those gods are in the human kind of domain realm. At the very bottom realm, they only live for something like 9 million years. The highest realm within our realm, the highest heaven, they live something like 9,000 million years. And then it goes up from there. The highest heavens, they live a phenomenally long period of time. The thing is about the gods in this cosmology is that they all die eventually. They might have a phenomenally length of time that they're going to be gods, but sooner or later they die. And if they're really high, they can only go one way. They have to be born. So if you have the luck of being born at the highest possible realm of formless gods, you live there for 90 billion years or more. And sooner or later you die, and there's only one way to go. And that's to go down to a lower realm. And depending on your karma, and what you've done in your life, and the karmic momentum of your life, you go lower. You might go really low. You might end up going into hell for a while. Because Buddhist cosmology also has hell, which also has layers. And you certainly wouldn't want to be born in the worst layer, the bottom layer, which is... They have hells of ice and hells of fire, and it's their awful. The advantage of Buddhist hells is that they're also temporary. And if you happen to get reborn in the bottom most hell, the worst, most awful hell, which also uses a long time of suffering, when you die there and you get reborn, you get to go up a little bit. So it's not a lost cause. And kind of in the middle of all this is the human realm. And the human realm is considered to have a combination of a little bit of everything. A little bit of divine qualities, and a little bit of hellish qualities. And depending a little bit on your state of mind. But the human realm, because it has a little bit of all of it, the right balance of it, is considered to be the best place to practice for liberation. If you're... The gods are so blissful there as gods, that there's no reason, they're not motivated to do anything else but enjoy their bliss. So I've been told by Dharma teachers that people who live in Hawaii, when they try to schedule one day sittings and different Dharma events in Hawaii, people don't come. They go to the beach. So if it's too blissful, you're not motivated. But if it's hellish, your life, it's really too difficult, then you don't have the ability or the interest, or too many hindrances to give you the time and the ability and the mental state to be able to practice. So the human realm, where there's kind of a balance, is ideal. So you want to be very careful that you keep getting to be born as a human. Because if you do too many bad things, then you go in hell, and too many good things, which is kind of nice. It's not terrible to do good things, but in Buddhism it's a little bit, you know, it's nice to be born up there, but it's really second best. So, okay, so you're following this a little bit? So, add to this huge cosmology, the yo-yo theory of the universe. That what the universe is, it just goes on forever, there's no beginning of it. But it just expands and contracts. And when it all contracts, all the matter in the universe somehow evaporates or disappears or becomes this kind of liquid or something. And all the beings, all the animals and people and gods, they all get temporarily reborn in the very high realm of being a formless God. And they hang out there until the expansion begins again. And as the expansion begins, all the parts of the universe begin to reconstitute themselves. But before the earth gets reconstituted, the more ethereal, kind of heavenly realms get reconstituted first. And so slowly they get formed. At some point, the heavenly realms of the human realm, human kind of domain, get reconstituted. And the first thing that happens is that Brahma, the great God of the overlord of these six heavens in the human realm, his palace and throne get made. Because that's just what the universe does. And then at some point, one of these formless deities, high up in these highest heavens, dies, because they die eventually. So the first one dies as the expansion begins, and it's he. But he gets reborn in Brahma's palace on his throne. He's the first one there. He looks around. This is nice. And he thinks. I'm kind of lonely. It would be really nice if there were some other gods. Coincidentally, when he has a thought, and other one of these formless beings happens to die and get reborn in his palace with him. And he concludes. This is the misunderstanding, right? He concludes that he was responsible for the creation of this being by having his thought. It wouldn't be nice if they were there. Because he doesn't remember that he used to be a formless being. He doesn't remember, he doesn't carry him over well enough. So then he has more thoughts like that. It just happens as the world is expanding, his palace gets more and more populated. And then he thinks something like, well, yeah, it's kind of nice here, but it'd be nice if there was more entertainment. We don't have television yet, but let's have, we can have this human realm down there. That's very entertaining. And it just happens to be that moment the universe is expanding enough that the earth kind of gets consolidated and humans appear. Well, first humans don't appear, but just the earth. Now it happens that one of the people, one of the gods in his palace who was born, when they were born there, they said, well, what happened? Where did I come from? And he said, well, I created you. I had this thought, and you appeared, and I created you. I'm the creator. And then I had this thought, and this earth down there appeared. And so one of the people in, the gods in his palace dies, and gets reborn as a human. And being reborn as a human, that person practices meditation and gets into a very adept meditation, a great ability to concentrate. And one of the abilities that's said, and traditionally, that you can develop it through deep concentration, is the ability to remember past lives. So this guy remembers his past life as a monk with Brahma. And he remembers how Brahma told him he was the creator. So he said, oh yeah, so there's a creator of the universe. It's Brahma. He told me. But his concentration is not that good. So he doesn't remember his lives before that. All he remembers is he goes back one. And so that's how the notion of, in India at least, of a creator god arose, and it was a misunderstanding. So, you know, what to make of the Buddha telling the story? I don't know. But who knows why he told the story. That's the story he told. So, now the other notion in Buddhism about theism is that, in a general sense, theism in Buddhist tradition, especially in modern Buddhist tradition, is sometimes seen looked upon favorably. Not because Buddhists are believing, are theistic in terms of believing in a creator god. Buddhists are polytheistic. They have all these gods, right? And one of the modern scholars says that Buddhism is actually trans-polytheistic. Because, traditionally in Buddhism, in ancient Buddhism, they believed in this huge pantheon of gods. But it wasn't such a good deal to get born as a god. You really wanted to go beyond even the gods. And a Buddha is someone who's gone beyond the gods as a human being. Buddha's never stopped being a human. But he's gone beyond the gods, these Indian gods at least. And the Buddha doesn't worship the gods. The gods worship the Buddha. So there's another story. There's a monk who has this question. Where do the four elements cease? Where does nature end? Where does all the experience of earth, water, fire, and air, where does it end? So this monk has great concentration abilities and is able to go visit in his concentrated meditation of Brahma. He asks different gods, he has to ask Brahma. He knows everything. And Brahma is still under the illusion that he's the creator. So he proclaims, I am the creator of all, I know everything, I'm the mission, I'm the victor, I'm the greatest of the great. He's kind of full of himself. It's kind of like the Greek gods were kind of full of themselves in all kinds of ways. So the Indian creator god, he was kind of a little bit too proud. So this guy went to Brahma to ask him this question. Where do the four elements cease? And Brahma replies, I am the great Brahma, the ultimate Brahma, the creator of all, the knower of all, the victor, the supreme creator of all. And he says, I am the great Brahma, the supreme one. The monk asks again, where does this four elements end? And he gets the same, it's like a politician, you don't get the right answer. I am the great, the wonderful, the most spectacular, I know everything. And so the monk asks a third time, and this time Brahma says, come here, pulls him aside. This is rather embarrassing. All my people in my heavenly realms here, they look up to me as being the great creator and the knower of all, and I told them this is the case. And I don't really know the answer to your question. And you're a Buddhist monk, and it's just really inappropriate of you coming and asking me, and making this embarrassing situation for me at my court. You have to go to ask the Buddha. So the monk goes back and asks the Buddha and gets an answer. So there are these stories in the Buddhist traditions about God, the Indian God. So the idea of being a creator God doesn't seem to get a lot of good press in the Buddhist tradition. The idea of, kind of the idea that I think sometimes exists is that everything arises out of something else, but there has to be a first cause out of which it doesn't arise, without first cause doesn't come from anywhere else. And so God has to be the first cause. God doesn't come from anywhere. But in the Buddhist tradition, the Indian, ancient Indian idea is that the world has no beginning and no end, just endless cycles of the world. So they don't have to come up to this conclusion that there is no first cause exactly. In a little while, in case any of you are getting tired or bored of all this, because I'm a little bit self-conscious about talking about this as you... ...is I will end with a Zen story. You find, especially in Sri Lankan Buddhists in the modern era, writing a lot about Buddhism and theism, because Sri Lankans, more than any other form of Asian Buddhists, had to really contend with Christian missionaries. The Portuguese were there for a long time, and the English, I think, and I'm not sure the history, but... ...and the Portuguese and the English, for about 500 years, I think. 400 years, maybe. And so they had to contend with these powerful missionaries that would come. And so they wrote a lot about how...and they wanted to often distinguish Buddhism from Christianity, mostly. And they often talked about how Buddhism doesn't have a God or just not theistic. And one of the things that Sri Lankan people would like to say is even the idea of God being kind of like a Godhead or a source of being or a universal principle... ...is not compatible with the Buddha's teachings of impermanence, that everything's impermanent. In Thailand, one of the greatest Thai teachers of the last century, Ajahn Burdhasa, who wasn't contending with missionaries, didn't have all the political and military difficulties of the oppressor, colonialists... ...he was much more kindly disposed to the God idea. And he said, great! He read the Bible and he said, great! And he said, oh, God is the same thing as what we Buddhists call Dharma. And so he wanted to make an equation there. And Dharma is not a permanent thing in a sense. Dharma is a principle of law of cause and effect, law of causation. And one of the reasons why theism is not seen as a wrong view is because theists, which usually live ethical lives. And one of the reasons why some people want to believe in God is that the only field that only through their belief in God can there be the motivation to live an ethical life. So like the Woody Allen movie where the family's having a Shabbat dinner and they sometimes have a certain amount of ceremony part of that dinner. And it seems that in some American Jewish families, part of the ceremony, part of the ritual is to argue about how long the ceremony should be. And so there was a father, the patriarch of the family, who wants the full-blown ceremony and the progressive liberal daughter who wants to do as little as possible. And so he's doing about this. And finally the daughter says, what would you rather have? God or truth? And the father says, God. Because without God there would be chaos. So the idea of people, so one of the justifications or reasons why some people want to have the notion of God is because it seems to be kind of an ethical motivator for how we live our lives. If we didn't have that then things would be in trouble. And living ethically is a very high ideal in Buddhism. And if you create good karma by living ethically. And if you're a theist, if you believe in God and live an ethical life, you can get reborn in one of those really great heavens. You can get really good karma for yourself. So just believing in God doesn't cause bad karma for you. It's your behavior, your actions, how you live that's important. And when I was a kid, these Mormon missionaries would come to Italy where I was living and we'd have these conversations about God and stuff. And I was like 12 or 13. And I remember my understanding, without having read the Bible or anything, I couldn't understand why God cared about the Christian God. Why he would care so much whether people believed in him or not. It seemed like what was the big deal. I thought he probably really liked it if people lived ethically. And I was into the idea of being living ethically. And I was like, as long as I'm living ethically, if there is a God, he's probably delighted. And I thought that's enough. But then I found out later that apparently in the Bible it says other things. And then I studied religion in college and graduate school. And it's very interesting to study religion in graduate school. It's very challenging for people to have very fixed ideas about what their religion is. Because one of the things you realize is the tremendous diversity of belief systems that human beings are capable of having. And when you put your particular belief system in together in this amazing spectrum of all these different kinds of beliefs, it becomes, well, how do I fit? How does this fit in here? And the notion of God is one of those. Because there are so many amazing different kinds of definitions and ideas and concepts of God. And that's not to say that any one particular one is not the right one or the true one. But you have to kind of contend with this tremendous diversity. And so even if you can kind of bracket and put aside your particular notion of God, the question then is, well, how can it be all this diversity of notions of God out there? And then what the social scientists who study this in the last 150 years have come up with, some of them at least, is that it seems that notions of God have a lot to do with the projection of human ideals and hopes and human images onto this figure. And Durkheim was a great social scientist who kind of started this notion. He actually thought it was a collective projection. And it had a very important function for society to have this projected kind of reference point that people circulated around. But for him it was still a projection of the mind often. So it's not a criticism of any particular one, but it's very interesting when you see the great spectrum. So then the Zen story. The famous Zen master named Ciao Chu. And a student comes to Ciao Chu and says, the ten thousand things return to the one. Where does the one return to? So maybe in Western translation of it we could say, the ten thousand things, or all things, all the diversity of life has its origin in God. Where does God come from? What does God return to? All things have their origin in God. What's the origin of God? So the ten thousand things return to the one. Where does the one return to? And Ciao Chu says, When I was in Qingqiao, I made myself a hemp robe that weighed seven pounds. All things have their origin in God. Where does God come from? This morning I was able to install a new light in my basement ceiling. So how do you understand that as an answer? It's as bold to try to answer a Koan that is to try to talk about God. But I think the Koan is pointing towards this moment here, the present moment. And the only place that's the beginning and ending of anything for us in our experiential immediate life is right here and now. Everything returns to the present. And there's something very precious, something amazing, something of experience of grace, something. The experience of the divine, the experience of emptiness, the experience of liberation, the experience of the ultimate, somehow gets reduced, is found in the present, present. And then you can say, well, it's some great... Yes, it's in the present, but it's this fantastic, amazing, mystical experience of oneness with Brahma or whatever. This morning I was able to put the light in my ceiling in the basement. Does it have to be something amazingly mystical? There's a miracle in being alive. It's a miracle in sensing and feeling and thinking and being conscious in this very moment sitting here. And I believe that some of the Christian mystics will point to God as existing right here. My sense of Buddhism, Buddhism actually is not interested in God. I'll give you an opinion here. My little bit of contact I have with Christian mysticism is that you empty yourself. There's at least one tradition of Christian mysticism where you empty yourself of everything, even your notions of what God is. And then you can have a kind of experience or union with God. You have some kind of experience. Buddhism doesn't really state very much what happens, but it puts a lot of emphasis in this emptying process. Emptying yourself of your attachments, your grasping, your defilements. And then something happens, something amazing happens when you don't have any of those filters across your eyes. Sometimes it can feel like a mystical experience. And it's very easy then to come to an interpretation of what that experience means. Or to use the ultimate reference points that our society gives us and put those reference points on that experience. That experience is an experience of X. Because in my society, it's as ultimate as it can be. Buddhist meditation, when you're very concentrated and very still, it does an amazing thing. And that is, it shows you the moments of when you make an interpretation. And you see it as an interpretation. You see the arising of an assumption, a projection interpretation. We have this experience of oneness, which is a genuine mystical experience that Buddhism acknowledges. This could happen to you. But if you're very well trained to watch your mind, see how your mind works, then as you're in that meditation or you leave it, you watch the bubbling of the surface and the explosion in the mind, the arising of a thought that says, oh, this is oneness with Brahma. And you see that, you say, upon what authority do I have that as being that's the case? It's just a thought, it's an interpretation. So the tendency in Buddhism then, because of that kind of analysis, that detailed watching of the authority of where our thoughts come from, and seeing perhaps how little authority there can actually be that substantiates it, is to be content with leaving those kinds of interpretations alone, and being content with becoming free. And that experience of freedom can feel like experience of grace, can feel like an experience of the divine, or can feel all kinds of different ways. But for Buddhism, the important point is this freedom. And whether you become free as a theist or you become free as a non-theist, Buddhists don't care, as long as you become free. So, now it's your turn to. I'm a little bit worried what's going to happen now. Next. So, comments, questions, objections? Yes? Yes. The rabbi at the temple was giving a series of talks about God, and I wanted to find out what he had to say. And the most important thing that he said was, not only do we need God, but God needs us. And at that point, I didn't comprehend any of why this whole knowing, whole seeing, you know, everything. It was me, us, and I didn't get the rest of it, but that, I didn't go back the rest of it. I'm not in any way qualified to respond to that. But I mean, you know, I have a lot of respect for Christians and Jews, for many reasons, a lot of respect, deep respect, and appreciation of those traditions. And I've met people who I feel their spiritual life is very, very deep and very profound, and they're very transformed in ways. And there are ways of understanding God, the notion of God, which inspire me. And there are ways that don't do anything for me. The ministers have sold us this church here, you know, we're Christian ministers who believed in God, and they spent a lot of time tuning into God's will. And in fact, when we've been buying this, I like to say, respectfully, we like to say that there were three parties in the negotiation. There was us, the ministers, and God. And I was really inspired by these people who were not doing things in, you know, materialistic ways, or kind of at a greed, or we were tuning into something larger than themselves and kind of getting really quiet and very still, letting their mind become very, very quiet, and then stillness, intuiting or sensing some deeper kind of truth. And it was beautiful. And so there's so many different ideas of God that we have to be very careful to, when we have trouble with someone's notion of God and don't understand it, to go back to them and kind of really hear them out, because it could be if they explicate what they're talking about, that you realize, well, this is just like the Dharma. Maybe God is Dharma, or maybe not. Yes? One of the sort of concepts of God is the creator God being a fixer of things that people pray to him or ask for intercession of some sort. And to me, that strikes me, and I've done it in the past and during times of disaster or great sadness, but it seems to me that it's the pretty serious form of self delusion. To worship or to pray to a divine being or help. Can you come up with us? Oh, Buddhists do it too. We have, you know, Buddhism, traditionally in Buddhism, they have all these gods. And in addition, later on, some centuries after the Buddha, they had these god-like figures called bodhisattvas, and Buddhists pray to those all the time. Is it healthy to have that illusion that somebody can change something for you if you can be big enough? I think it can be unhealthy. It can be unhelpful. But I'm loath to want to make some, you know, I'm willing to say sometimes it's unhealthy. But I'm loath to make any categorical statement on it. Partly because my preference is to respect everyone in their beliefs. And if someone actually comes to me with a belief, you know, I'll try to listen to it and see is there some way in which people are holding this belief that keeps them in their suffering? And then I'll try to maybe try to help them understand how it may be keeping them in their suffering. But if it's not, I mean, you know, I prefer just to respect it and honor it and give it some kind of benefit of doubt. That's on your hand. I was going to say about intercessory prayer. You're also going to be writing lots, not many western Buddha's do it on a recent trip to Japan. I saw a lot of Buddha's temples, and every one of them had some arrangement for physical prayer. Sometimes there was a rope and tug to get going and get Buddha's attention and said something more or other with these little rats where you tie the book. And the papers, strips of prayers written on them, and people were using them very carefully. I was thinking of the main activity of Buddha's temples was tying your wishes onto a tree, I wanted to interact with something like that. And so one of the interesting things, I think, about the American convert Buddhism, the kind of Buddhism that we're part of, is that I've never heard in all my many years of listening to Dharma talks. I've never heard anyone talk address this issue. It's really not that, as a scene, as a spiritual tradition, it's not really that significant to really bring up as a topic, because it's the practice which is important, there's other things which are much more important. And I'm not sure of the wisdom of me bringing up today, but I thought some people really would like to know about, you know, what does the Buddhist tradition say about this. So I could point you back a little bit to the early tradition for your reference. Steve? Was that, a seven day Christmassy, a ten minute retreat, he gave this talk on God, and I think you do a very controversial one of his talks. He actually put it somewhere in the sutras, where he said, Buddha said, I have become God. And all of us look really strange. It's actually an interesting talk, but it's the basic premise, was it's not something you really know God, so you wrestle with it, and once you realize you can't know what you're relaxing about, the whole thing is the real peace that comes over you. Two more, and then we should stop. My point of comment is that in this country of God is one of the other things we polarize around, and that divides us. So it's an interesting subject to bring up here, because most people are on one side of the polarity. And for me, there's no need for more polarity. And so when I talk to people who are people, neighbors of God, I just turn my ears on it for a while, and try not to react. And I learn a lot that way, and it's some of the things that you've talked about. And also, particularly from elderly people, who are at the end of their lives, and have had a fair amount of suffering, and are releasing that suffering because they believe in a life after. And while I don't believe in that, I see how much comfort it gives elderly people who are not well, who know they're facing the end of their life. And I sort of feel like, well, that's not that bad. It's not that bad. And there certainly are plenty of things that are around that create negative people. There's certainly some good things. I resonate a lot with what you said about not wanting to be part of that polarity and that tension. And I would like to think that the Buddhist tradition is not in that game. It's just not involved. It doesn't play the game of war against this issue. But sometimes, other people put Buddhism in a camp. When I was in Turkey, I learned very quickly that I shouldn't tell people I was a Buddhist, because people assumed that you were an atheist. And if you're an atheist, then you are God-fearing, and you do evil things. I've read Buddhists who are very uncomfortable, don't want to be called atheists, don't want to be called theists, but don't want to be called atheists either. Because there's connotations with atheism in the wider society that sometimes they don't want to go along with. So trans-polytheistic. I want to clarify your cosmology. You said that the first God in the higher realms that would die was the lesser one because the one that lives the longest is the best. But then if that one became God, then why wouldn't that one die first and become human? Let me try then. I'm not really that familiar with all the levels and grades and details of the Buddhist heavenly realms. But let's say it this way. In the world system we're in, there are six heavenly realms. Beyond that, there are another 33 realms. The last four of those 33 are the formless realms, where you live for a really long time. So you're up there, you're hanging out there during the contraction part of the universe. When the first Brahma gets reborn, he gets reborn in the top level of this bottom six heavenly realms in our world system. So there's nothing in our world system particularly until it gets consolidated enough. So Brahma is at the top of the six heavens in our world. So he's like the greatest in our world. But there are gods that are greater than him, the higher realms. And there's no ultimate Supreme God. All these guys and gals who hang out at the highest realm for a few billion years. So I hope this has been interesting. More to the point, I hope it's been helpful in some way or other for some of you. And if this has aroused some deep concerns or deep questions for you to look at, that might be really great. And if you feel like you want to talk with me about this further, I'll stay for a while here and we'll continue the conversation. And I really do think the best approach is to have a lot of respect for everybody's religious points of view. And then maybe to explore it together and have wonderful inter-faith dialogue. So, thank you.
