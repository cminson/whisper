 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So we can start with settling into the meditation posture. I'll be breathing in a little deeper and out two or three times. And on the out breath we can let go of any tension, wondering thoughts. And then when we've returned to our normal breath, we can tune into the body. And do a simple body scan to help us relax. Just pay attention to the body starting with the head. The head as a whole. And I'm zooming into our head. This feeling that simple attention for this part of the body can help relax it. The muscles around your eyes. Jaw. Down to the throat and neck. Shoulders. Just a kind and gentle attention for this part of the body. Arms and hands. Chest and upper back. Feeling whatever is there. Belly and lower back. And further down to the hip area. But I can't see all around the hips. Down to the legs. Just a gentle attention for this body part. And ankles and feet. Full body. Body as a whole. And gently shift our attention to whatever arises not only in the body but also in the mind thoughts, feelings, emotions, moods. Maybe things at other sense stores like hearing, smelling. When we attention to whatever is most predominant in our experience. We can't be aware of our attitude towards what is happening. There are also attitudes. Just okay with whatever is happening. Maybe just appreciating it. Curiosity around it. Late backness. Equanimous. Unwholesome quality of wanting things to go away. Not wanting. Aversion. Or craving wanting something to manifest in our experience. Maybe more peace, less thoughts. Graphing silence. We can be aware of these qualities in the mind. Our attitude towards what's happening. Once we notice our attitude, get a clearer picture of what's going on. Sometimes they stay unnoticed. Then they just kind of run in the background, running the show while we don't really see it. So being aware of the attitude, the grieving, or aversion. Or just okayness. And help us to see clearly what is going on. Thank you. Okay, once in a while we can ask ourselves the question, what's the attitude? Is there anything that needs to be different, whether it's something you want or something you don't want? Or is it just okay? Then just notice this attitude. We don't have to change it. We can become aware of it. We don't have to wonder all the time what our attitude is, just every once in a while. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you what's the attitude right now? is there wanting, or should, or canes? one of these last minutes of the meditation we come still with our eyes closed and some well wishes to everyone meditating together here, some metta or loving kindness may we all be happy, just like we want to be at ease, may all of us be at ease may for all of us be so that the effects of the meditation, the wholesome effects ripple through into our lives, ripple out into our lives, touching ourselves in many moments and touching others. Maybe wish this also for everyone listening to this at a later point. Maybe we could also share the goodness, the wholesomeness that comes from meditating together and share this with all beings everywhere. May all beings everywhere benefit from the wholesomeness, the goodness that's generated through our meditation today. May it contribute to their freedom, their awakening. May it contribute to their freedom.
