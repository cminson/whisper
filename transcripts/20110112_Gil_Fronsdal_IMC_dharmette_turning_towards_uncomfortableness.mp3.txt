Uncomfortableness

An important part of the training in mindfulness practice 
is to learn  how to turn toward s what’s uncomfortable.  
Certainly , if you think that by meditating or doing 
Buddhist practice , you’re only supposed to be blissful, 
floating on clouds  two feet off the ground, and 
surrounded by light, then you might not be willing to turn 
towards that which is difficult or uncomfortable. So 
mindf ulness training involves learning how to do that.  
 
Wisdom is different from mindfulness . Wisdom te lls us 
when to change something – to do something about 
something. For example, if I have a thorn in my foot , 
then the wise thing to do is not to keep  walking on the 
thorn , but to pull the thorn out. If you break a bone in 
your toe, then  the wise thin g to do is go get it fixed. 
Don’t just be comfortable with the pain. But, if you have 
a spasm in your foot and your m uscle is contracted and 
seized up, it might hurt to walk on it. Then the  best thing 
you could do may be to gently  walk on it , and be willing 
to feel and massage  the place that’s  uncomfortable . 
Just be with it , over and over again, until it begins to  2 relax and cease. Wisdom  tells you what the p ain is, 
what  the situation is, and  to know  whether this needs to 
be fixed, something needs to be let go of , or you just 
need  to be present with it. If the sp asm needs to be 
massaged out, then you have to stay present and  feel it 
carefully in your foot or wherever the pain  is so that  you 
don’t overdo or under -do it. J ust a real strong presence 
is needed.  So wisdom can hopefully help  us know 
what’s needed .  
 
With mindfulness , it is often useful to turn towards  
difficulty . Certainly part of mindfulness  training is to 
learn how to be comfortable with discomfort, how to rest 
with it, and how to turn towards it in a way that is useful. 
It’s counter intuitive for many people to do so , because 
they think that whenever something is uncomfortable , 
the purpose i s to fix it, to do something about it, to get 
away from it, or to push it away.  There are all these 
attitudes that get in the way of  turning towards 
discomfort  in a useful, productive  and non-conflictive 
way. The approach in mindfulness is to develop a 
willingness to turn towards the uncomfortable. Often the 
uncomfortable is where we have the most to learn  and 
to grow. So there  has to be a willingness to see : Where 
am I uncomfortable ? Let’s look and be with it , as 
opposed to flee it and go to where it’s comfortable and 
safe again.  
  3 Learning to turn towards the discomfort will hopefully 
give you a  lot more information , so that wisdom can 
operate. The wisdom can say that’s enough of going 
towards it, and I need to go to the doctor. I need to do 
something else here besides just be with it. But in 
mindfulness, it’s training to learn how to be in a 
nonrea ctive mode – to feel, sense and experience 
what’s there . Because when we are reactive towards 
something , then wisdom doesn’t operate very well. So 
to let wis dom operate the best is to discover this 
nonreactive mode and to just be with it.  
 
In mindfulness meditation , it’s often useful , if you ’re 
uncomfortable in some way, to choose to move towa rds 
the discomfort and to learn what it’s like to be 
comfortable  with it, how to rest in it, and how to feel and 
be with it. Because even if you don’t  work through it , 
what you learn about how to be with it in meditation 
might serve you really well in some life situation outside 
of meditation , where you have no other choice  but to be 
with the discomfort. N ow you know how to do it.  
 
Doing it in  meditation  is like doing  it with training wheels . 
Most  of us need training wheels at first, and then we 
learn this is how it is and how I react – run away  or 
attack, blame  or close up, or bury my head in the sand 
like an ostrich. This is what I tend to do , and then let’s 
try not to do that so I can really see it and be with it.  
  4 One of the things that I find most he lpful in this regar d is 
to do it with the body – to feel in the body where the 
actual physical felt sense of the discomfort  is. Generally  
in an uncomfortable situation , there will probably be 
some signs of dis comfort that appear in the body . If 
there is emotional discomfort, we may be nervous, 
afraid  or upset . If th ere is physical discomfort, 
sometimes it’s useful to go into the body. One of the 
reasons for turning towards how it is experienced in the 
body is that it’s much more immediate than go ing 
towards the thoughts, ideas  or interpretations of what’s 
happening , which is where some people tend to go.  
 
Going  to the felt sense, the physical experience o f how 
it is in the body , can sometimes make us more 
uncomfortable . Because  to feel it in the body sometimes 
makes us feel more vulnerable , open or receptive. But 
that is a good  thing generally, especially  in meditation.  
 
Some people feel un comfortable being vulnerable. T hey 
feel unsafe that way. So what do es it take to learn to 
stay and rest in feeling vulnerable?  It is one of the great 
skills in life to learn how to  be vulnerable and feel safe. 
It seems like a paradox , right? But be present, drop in to 
your body and feel it  in the pit of your  stomach, in the 
fluttering of your heart, or some tension some place in 
the body – just hold it, feel it, and be with it.  
  5 Taking into account knowing that it’s there, if you have 
to act and speak in the world, knowing that it’s there , but 
being  clearly aware of the discomfort, sometimes even 
naming it, can make yourself or someone else say that 
I’m uncomfortable right now. I’m trying to find my way 
with what to say  or do, but I feel uneasy. That’s just 
what part of the picture  is here, and I’m trying to  find my 
way. Just admitting it  is a wonderful thing , I think . Not 
everyone is going to be receptive to you admitting it. It’s 
probably not the best place to say  in a job interview  that 
I’m fee ling really uneasy [laughter], and a ll my 
insecurities  have come up. Probably that’s  not the place 
to be so public about it. But there are times when it’s 
actually very he lpful publicly with friends and people to 
actually say that I’m uneasy. If you have good friends , 
they will hopefully help you stop and take a look at 
what’s going on and be present.  
 
I find that a variety of discomforts are very useful 
messages that something needs attentio n. If we’re 
ignoring how we’re uncomfortable , then we’re ignoring 
that message that says some thing needs attention here. 
But what  kind of attention does it need?  What are we 
supposed to learn, resolve or dea l with when we’re 
uncomfortable?  That’s  not always so obvious . But it 
becomes more o bvious if you can learn how to be still 
and quiet.  For example , in meditation, to learn how to 
be present for discomfort and that you are  okay ; it’s 
safe, and you’re  comfortable with that. It’s  okay to let  6 yours elf just be uncomfortable , without having to react 
or do something about it, believe it, be pushed around 
by it, or act on it right away. Just feel, experience , and 
be with it.  
 
What I find often happens is , if I feel discomfort in the 
body and allow i t to be there in some general way – just 
breathe and be present – then nothing is fixed , and 
things start shifting on their own. I don’t have to be the 
one in charge of fixing or changing it . But I can be 
present and feel it , and usually something begins to 
soften and open up. Sometimes  by just being present to 
what the discomfort  is or what’s going on  here, the 
situation is understood much better and more clearly .  
 
Sometimes discomfort is a slow but  powerful teacher . It 
takes it s time , so you have to be willing to hang in there 
with it. My wish for people who do mindfulness practice 
is that they learn a wise way of welcoming being 
uncomfortable. I hope that you don’t go looking for 
opportunities to be uncomfortable. That’s  not so useful ; 
don’t go looking for trouble. But if it ever should happen 
that you find  yourself uncomfortable [laughs] , then turn 
towards it. In a certain way , be welcoming of it , as 
opposed to be ing hostile , afraid, closed down, or spin 
out in stor ies, or blame some one else because of it. 
Instead , learn how to hang with it, be with it, and be 
open to it.  
  7 So those are my thoughts for this morning.
