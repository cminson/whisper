It's so great to see all of you, our Sangha, our Senior Sangha.
So shall we meditate for a little while while others are arriving?
So shall we meditate for a little while while others are arriving?
Sharing our hearts and sharing our minds.
Interconnected, so relaxing into the body,
dropping the thinking mind into the body,
into the base of the spine, and lift at the energy, go up the spine, vertebrae by vertebrae
by vertebrae by vertebrae by vertebrae up to the neck.
So we straighten a little bit, feeling that.
And opening the shoulders and the shoulder blades and the belly
and relaxing the hips and the thighs and the legs.
And just being here, relaxed,
dropping all cares and concerns.
Open, easeful.
And maybe being aware that you're here today because you want to be happy, a little bit
happier, we meditate because we want to be happy, content, at ease, whatever you call
it in your own words.
And this desire to be happy is love.
Feeling it, this impulse that we all have, we all share.
Maybe easier to access this when we think how we want our loved ones to be happy.
We want them to be happy.
We want them to be content.
We want them to be, that urge in us, that impulse in us is love.
And we have it for ourselves.
It's in our fiber.
It's in our essence.
Essence, love.
And let it be felt throughout your body.
This essence love, this desire to be happy, penetrating all your muscles, your tendons,
coming from the core of your being.
And basking in that, bathing in that.
And we suffer, and we don't want to suffer, we want to be free from suffering.
Take respawn to this and that position, power, fame, material things, comforts, pleasures.
And we suffer, and we don't want to suffer.
We want to let go of our suffering.
Compassion, kindness, tenderness of heart.
Is essential to who we are.
Like we don't want our loved ones to suffer.
We don't want our family members, our friends.
Compassion, kindness is part of our nature.
Also to our being.
If you can, feel your own kindness, your own compassion, empathy.
And we want to use love to be free from suffering.
And as you slowly open your eyes, look around, look at all of these faces.
Maybe choose someone and look in their eyes.
They don't know you're looking, you don't have to be self-conscious.
And realize this person just like me really wants to be happy, really wants to be content.
This person just like me has this essence love, has it, we all do.
And this person wants his loved ones or her loved ones to be happy and to be content.
And this person has compassion, doesn't want to suffer just like me.
He doesn't want his or her friends, loved ones.
He's full of compassion or she permeated with love just like me.
And as you're looking at this person, if you like, you could wish for them, wish for you
to be happy, wish for you to be content, wish for you to be at ease, wish for you to be
free of suffering, whatever causes you difficulty, pain, irritation, fear, anger, grasping, may
you be free from that.
And maybe we can, if it's not too abstract, just kind of look around the whole, the group
that you can see on your computer and extend your wish, may all of you
be happy, feel this love, may all of you be free of suffering, be liberated for the rest
of your days, may all of you let go, and let go again, and let go again, and let be
so that nothing will ever get in the way again for you.
When the Dalai Lama gets up in the morning, the first thing he says is this prayer from
Shanti Deva, an eighth century Indian master, may I be a guard for those who need protection,
a guide for those on the path, a boat, a raft, a bridge for those to cross the flood,
may I be a lamp in the darkness, a resting place for the weary, and a healing medicine
for all who are sick for as long as earth and sky endure, may I assist until all living
beings are awakened.
So you might think, how can I help them be free, I can hardly help myself, but it's
this compassionate intention that really helps you and everyone else, getting in touch with
this essence of love in you, the empathy in you, so thank you and welcome.
Robert is coming a little late today, so I'm on my own with the breakout cruise, I'll try
to do the best I can.
So the prompt today was about enlightened intention.
And whatever that means to you, I don't think we should get too concerned about exactly
what that is in a technical way, just whatever it arouses in you.
Do you recognize this intention in yourself, some enlightened intention?
Rajan Shah famously said, when we let go a little, we'll have a little peace, when we'll
let go a lot, we'll have a lot of peace, when we let go completely we'll have complete peace.
So what does that mean, let go, and what do we let go into?
What is there when we let go, and can we have confidence in what is there, can we recognize
something about what is there?
We have all kinds of identities that we recognize, all kinds of roles that we play in life, all
kinds of different personalities in different situations, but when we let go, what's left?
Who are we?
All our suffering is caused by grasping on to self, grasping on to wanting something
for me.
So when we examine, when we let go a little bit, and look within, maybe you could close
your eyes now for a few minutes, and look within.
What is there?
Where is me?
Where is there a me?
Who am I?
Who am I?
We know just common sense and from science that we're not our body, this body keeps changing.
Every microsecond changing, and in a macro way, we understand we're getting old.
It's out of control, it gets sick, despite our best efforts to keep healthy, it'll die,
and this body's changed since we were little, since we were born.
It's changed out of our control, and we are not our thoughts.
Some researchers said, we have 70,000 thoughts a day.
Which thought is me?
And our emotions, our feelings are changing all the time too.
Is there something here that is me?
There seems to be this awareness, this knowing quality, knowing thoughts, knowing sensations,
knowing sounds, knowing tastes, sights, feelings, knowing all these changing things, and the
knowing doesn't seem to change, the knowing seems to be stable, and always here.
Ever since we were small children, I remember I had this knowing back when I was a child.
I remember walking home from school and seeing things, knowing this kind of brilliant, luminous
quality.
Is that me?
Can you find it?
It doesn't begin, it doesn't have a middle, it doesn't have an end, it has no location,
it has no color, it has no identity, yet it's always here.
When we say the words, I am, there's a presence.
Do we need anything more than this?
To be happy?
Do we need a layer of fame, recognition, anything at all?
And those are always eluding us, there's nothing wrong with them, but you can't count on them
because they're always changing.
But we can let go into this awareness, we can let go completely, and if we let go completely
and let be, nothing will get in the way ever again, writing the awareness.
Words are not a problem when we're not chasing after them, there's an expression, we look
for stones and pebbles, and we should really be looking at the gold.
This often compared to diamonds, a beggar who has diamonds in the walls of his hut, he doesn't
know they're there.
We have this diamond, so close we can't see it, so simple we can't believe it, so deep
we can't fathom it, and so good we can't accept it.
The goodness of our essential being, awareness, love, and compassion, how fortunate to have
this life with this gold, just waiting for us to take that backwards step and open to
it.
Okay, thank you.
So, let's see, I'm going to try to do this, break out into small groups, and so there
are a couple of prompts for discussion in your small group, and maybe we'll take some
time, maybe 20 minutes if that's okay, and I'll just mention these questions.
I don't know how to write them in a prompt right now, but maybe, and it doesn't matter
really, just so you have a good discussion, that's the main thing, but do you recognize
some enlightened intention in yourself?
What is it, and how do you nurture it?
And the second one was, how does this practice, or your practice, how does it help you?
It's important we know clearly how our practice benefits us.
If we know how our practice benefits us, we'll want to do it more, and we'll know the right
direction.
So that's a worthy exploration.
And if you have time, or if you have the inclination, who are you?
So I'll break us up into groups of say four or five, and if you could maybe choose or
someone could say it volunteer to be a representative of your group when you come back, and maybe
just briefly tell us some essential point or two that was discussed in your group, if
that would be okay.
All right, well, I hope you have a wonderful discussion with each other.
See you later.
I think we're pretty much here.
So I hope you had good discussions.
So any volunteers to share?
Just go ahead whenever you unmute yourself.
I'm through Eddie, David.
Please.
Our discussion was so good that I was wanting it to go on and on.
And what came out I think most was how important our relationships with other people in our
daily lives are, and that involves mindfulness of how we may be projecting onto other people
and how in assuming things.
So in a lot of that wanting to do what we can to help people and do less harm in the
world and more kindness, more compassion, that just kept coming up again and again.
Listening came up a lot.
Letting go of preferences and just letting go, yeah, of our ideas of how things should
be, that came up.
Wanting to meditate more and develop that even more and more, and yeah, that's a summary
in.
Thank you.
Okay.
Our group just was a sweet sharing about the benefits of practice to actually sort of see
a change.
It could be as simple as less reactivity, less, and all the different ways people were expressing
that.
Or someone just said, you know, I just keep coming back, I don't know why there's something
drawing me, you know, that maybe inexpressible pull to practice, and then just seeing the
fruits of it.
So expressions of different ways of seeing the fruits of practice, it's very, very touching.
Thank you.
I might follow with that because a couple people in our group talked about being aware
of their own sense of peace or happiness reflected in those around them, and one person talked
about noticing our habit behaviors, and when we see them more clearly, it's easier to let
go.
So we talked a bit about letting go of the freedom and the relaxation of being able to
let go.
So we commented on how the last couple of years have been a wonderful opportunity for
practice, and particularly Gil's 7 o'clock meditation and Dharma talk every morning,
and the hope that at least some hybrid of that will continue after this is over.
Also somebody mentioned that Gil had said at, I think in a retreat or somewhere, that
when the conditions are right for awakening, it will happen whether you want it to or not.
I thought that was rather reassuring.
When the conditions are right, it could be said by a lot of things, I guess, when conditions
come together, it'll happen whether you intend it or not.
It really helps to practice along the way.
That's part of the condition, yeah.
So it occurs to me to say that letting go, we're developing a new habit.
Letting go can be a habit, and compassion can be a habit.
These are habits that free us.
Thank you for that.
Hi, David, hi, Robert.
Our group had a very interesting conversation and actually started out with a little bit
of discomfort, and feeling like we could have used more context for what is meant by enlightened.
I don't want to speak for the whole group, but I think we ended up finding our way to
our own personal definition, which really was very much embedded within the Eightfold
Path and the idea of meta and bringing this intention to relieve suffering in ourselves
and all living beings, but also kind of taking that 30,000-foot kind of idea of intention
and bringing it down even to the mundane activities of our lives.
I think we had some great conversation about the phrase, the road to hell is paved with
good intentions, and kind of recognizing that any behavior that we have, any way that we
act in the world is dependent on all these preceding steps, one of which is intention,
and that if we don't get intention right, then action will not follow in a way that
we would like it to.
We also had some really great conversation about how our practice and how our being in
the world provides learning and learning in terms of our ability to hone our intentions
and learning in terms of seeing the consequences of our actions.
So it was a great conversation, perhaps a little bit different than in some of the other
groups as I've heard them presented.
Thank you.
I'll join in on our group with echoing a number of things that have been said already.
First of all, what a rich experience it is to hear from other people on this path and
with focused questions because we have quite a wide variety of ways to interpret interacting
with the questions.
Starting, we started with, well, I started with the question number three about who am
I and there was some agreement on my statement that I don't have a clue at a deeper level
and there are layers of identifiers, especially around usself.
We had some real deep appreciations overall in terms of our practice in general, not being
able to imagine life without it.
Gratitude for the Sangha, again, because it's very, very supportive.
One theme was appreciating the stage in life that's so different from previous stages where
there, I mean, not that there's not a lot going on now, but what was going on in earlier
stages was quite different and so for some, this is quite a luxurious time to be able
to devote to practice in a more focused way, more time, if we're so inclined to devote
to practice, formal practice.
The theme of mindfulness came up as a focus of real appreciation and knowing we can be
mindful of anything if we just remember to do it.
I always liked that thought.
Anyway, wonderful group, wonderful to hear from everyone, but I always get attached to
my breakout group.
Thank you.
Thank you, Hiroshini.
I can share what we're talking about, the common thread that came up for all of us,
I mean, not a few of us in the group, it was five, was the truth-telling, whether that,
you know, be in resonance with the garbage of the Buddha or not, whatever we are experiencing,
the truth-telling of that, not necessarily, you know, gold might not be there for all
of us to, you know, but pebbles and stones, we can relate.
And then the reactivity team that, you know, they also mentioned before of how to deal
with the people, and then also it's made us more kinder, the practice has made us more
kinder.
Let's see what else.
Yeah, and then sharing of being calm, and then one participant was saying that she was
with Tick Naut Hanh, and how just being with her in the 90s, just, you know, just being
in the presence of someone like that produced calmness, and, you know, it's a mystery of
how that comes about.
And then also at the end, it was interesting that we closed the death and dying, team of
death and dying, that so many of us, I mean, all of us, but this group particularly is
closer than some of the other part of the population.
So yeah, that's what I think, but the common thread among few of us was that truth-telling,
whether that be a Buddhist verbiage or whatever is our own experience, not necessarily in
the gold in there.
Thank you, Aldi.
Thank you.
Someone I read recently recommends that you tell yourself every day five times that you're
going to die, I'm going to die, just to let that come home.
Because death makes us let go, it makes us let go.
So why not just go ahead and do it now and enjoy the rest of our lives?
I think we have one or two more, no?
Maybe that's it.
We had my group, I guess I'll go for talking about that.
You guys had a lot of rich discussions, I'm kind of, I'm amazed.
I think the first thing that we discussed was really kind of unpacking the question a
little bit more because I think some people more focused on the enlightened part of the
question and other people like me more focused on the intent part.
And so, and then we kind of went back and we realized, oh, there's two parts, but they're
very entangled together, you know, do you recognize an enlightened intent in yourself?
So is that an intense for enlightenment or is that an intent that's already enlightened?
You know, so just kind of like unpacking it a little bit more, I think our group talked
about that and I think the consensus was more not focused on the enlightenment part.
You know, not focusing on an outcome so much that the intent is to be more, for me specifically,
my comment in there was to be more pragmatic like looking at the six parameters.
Another person said they were more conscious to be present, to be here now was their enlightened
intent, you know, looking at the words more together.
And then being, you know, being here and being in the present, the present moment and being
here now, that was, that was seemed to be a pretty shared experience about that enlightened
intent about being present and being here now and not focusing so much on the outcome
and the enlightened, you know, part in quotes, but more on the staying present and being
in the moment.
Thank you.
The last parameter is wisdom.
Yes.
All of them include wisdom.
There was wisdom in generosity, giving it all away, wisdom in ethics, not harming, we're
all equal, there's wisdom in all, wisdom in joyful effort to be here.
Patience to not cause, to not act out.
Yeah.
Great.
Thank you so much.
Is there one more or have I, we, I think we're done.
So great.
Thank you for all those wonderful comments.
By the way, we do for some, for those of you who are new, we have small groups as well
that are the formats very similar to what we do here.
I lead them and, and it's like a big breakout group.
It's about the same size, six to eight people.
And I think people find them very meaningful.
So if you're interested in joining a small group, we meet every couple of weeks for our
15 minutes.
And if just right to the website IMC senior sangha, we will get back to you with the logistics
of how to get into a small group.
So let's take a 10 minute break or maybe an eight minute break.
If we could be back, it looks like it's 1208 now.
Maybe we could be back by 1215.
Okay.
We'll see you soon.
So hi everyone.
That was a lively conversation.
And I'm sorry that I was in a work related meeting and I couldn't be here at the beginning.
So I came in about 1140 and missed David's, David's presentation and his talk and meditation
much to my chagrin.
I missed it.
So I'm not exactly sure what he did.
I have a little bit of an idea.
So if I am in line with what he did great and if I'm not, just cut me some slack since
I'm coming in sort of flying blind here.
So what I want to do is I want to spend just a few minutes with you talking about something
that's been up for me and something that's up in some of the programs that I teach.
I'm sort of focusing on this topic right now.
And I find it really fascinating.
And I find it really important, really subtle and really nuanced.
So having said that as an introduction, just in the spirit of transparency, if what I'm
going to talk to you about, you have a question about, please just hold your question until
the end because we'll have a chance to debrief after we do a breakout room.
And I will put you into a breakout room as well.
So what I wanted to talk about with you this morning is it's building on the theme of awareness
and the particular aspect of awareness that I'm wanting to direct our attention to is
the sudden shifts in awareness where we're aware of something and then there seems to
be a moment where something happens and in the very next moment we're off on some sort
of a daydream or a memory or we're planning.
So there are these sudden shifts in awareness that are really difficult for most of us to
catch.
And when this happens, it's almost as though we fall asleep in that moment and then we
wake up, we think we wake up, sort of we've been swept into a daydream and where we were
is completely gone and we're caught up in a thought or an emotion or a mind state.
And what has happened is that we've lost mindfulness, the mindfulness and the lucidity of what it's
like to be present with ourselves and we've slipped into a state of mindlessness.
In that gap, there's this, it's kind of mindlessness.
It's like we have literally fallen into a daydream.
Literally, one moment we're fully present and the next we're gone.
We're lost in some fantasized memory about the past or some fantasized planning about
a future of our own creation.
So there's these sudden shifts in awareness, I'm going to just go over this again, these
sudden shifts in awareness that are truly difficult for most of us to catch.
This is what we practice.
In our practice, we begin slowly and gradually to sort of look at that.
I don't know how many people have said, wow, I'm aware and then the next minute something
else has happened and I know that there's a gap there.
But how do I recognize that I'm in this period of transition so that I don't fall into the
old habits that I fall into over and over again?
So if you are somebody that's given to anxiousness or somebody who's given to anger and one moment
you're feeling one way and everything is normal and fine and the next moment you're
ready to explode, something happens.
So you're just minding your own business, having a cup of tea, sitting in the garden
and suddenly a thought crosses your radar screen and you feel this contraction in your
solar plexus or you have a body, mind response, which is where did this come from?
So it's like we fall out of lucidity or the ability to be aware that we are present with
ourselves and what presence feels like and then we wake up in a dream or we find ourselves
in a dream that we, when we're dreaming it and we don't realize that we're lost there,
it seems like it's real.
It's like we're really a main character in this unfolding drama and it's generally about
some fantasized memory, some memory of something that happened and we're replaying it in our
mind according to the conditions that are present in our mind because of the way that
we're thinking.
So if we're thinking in a negative way, those memories are going to be difficult and if
we're thinking in some lovely ecstatic happy way, those memories might have that kind of
a spin but that's basically what's happening and there's this quality of the dream feeling
real.
So the question that comes up is when this happens, how do we return from the daydream
to actually being present with lucidity or knowing that we're present and conscious
and not drifting along or being pulled into some daydream or mind state that we mistake
as being conscious.
So when this happens to us and it happens to all of us, we could just go back, we don't
have to go back, we don't have to go forward, we could just know that this is what it's
like.
We're present, we're reading a book and then suddenly our mind is off somewhere else and
it takes us a moment to remember, recall that the focus of our attention was on what we
were reading or we're driving along at a high speed on the freeway and we wake up after
some time, like how did I get from here to here when I was lost in that thought, how
did I drive this distance, it's kind of shocking when that happens.
So when this happens to us, we lose ourselves in something really that's akin to daydreaming
and this is habit and this habit is hard to recognize and it's even harder to change.
I don't want to say that we can change this just by wishing it to go away.
We can wish it to go away and we can have the intention to be aware of it and even when
that happens, the momentum of the habit that we've built up over our long lives is hard
to change.
So the program is set and while we think we're in control, the truth is we're being carried
along by the forces and in the context of what we're doing here in terms of this dhamma
group, we're being carried along by the forces of karma or karma.
So I don't want to go off into a big discussion about karma but I do want to say a few things
to just punctuate the importance of cultivating this quality of awareness and this quality
of a sense of what our mind states are like.
So there are four forces of karma at work during any moment of transition, you see.
So whether it's falling asleep at night, we're awake and then we fall into sleep.
So it could be a moment-to-moment transition, it could be a day-to-day transmission or to
what David just mentioned about the importance of reflecting on death, it could be if you
buy into the idea that there may be life after life, it could be the transition from life
to life.
So these four types of karma that I want to highlight are referred to as the first is
heavy karma and that's the force from our most powerful good or bad deeds or impactful
states of mind.
In other words, the deeply, deeply embedded traits in us.
And they could be positive or negative, you cultivate the quality of generosity and you
practice it over and over and over again and this becomes a trait, this becomes heavy
karma in a very positive way and if you cultivate a negative quality, the conditions for that
negativity are ripe and the results will, you'll get the results of what we seed.
So the first is heavy karma, the second is proximate karma and that's the state of mind
that's present in any moment of transition.
So the state of mind that's present in any moment of transition.
So taking a concept from like the Tibetan Mardau system, the last thought or feeling
that you have before falling asleep at night into a dream or at the end of your life into
whatever may come after that, but the idea is that the last thought or feeling that
you have tends to reincarnate or be the first thought or feeling in your next state of consciousness.
So if when we go to sleep at night, if we go to sleep with a pleasant thought in our
mind or, you know, we're peaceful and resting, the likelihood that we're going to have sweet
dreams is enhanced and if we go to bed churning over something, ruminating, you know, we're
likely to wake up in the middle of the night ruminating, I certainly know that has happened
to me.
So this proximate, this is what's called proximate karma, habitual karma is the force from our
ordinary habits, you know, what would be an example of an ordinary habit, you know, I
like certain things for breakfast and I like my breakfast at a certain time and something
like that.
So things that you do over and over and over again.
And then the fourth is random karma, which arises when these other three kinds of karma
aren't in play.
Now what does this have to do with this moment of transition?
Well it really has everything to do with the moment of transition, because the proximate
karma is the one where we have the most control, so if we learn how to control our minds, if
we learn the ways that our minds are programmed, so to speak, or we start to pay attention
to those moments of transition and we don't lose mindfulness and just over and over and
over again slip into fantasies of this, that, or the other thing, we can actually transition
from sleep, from waking state into sleep with a kind of presence or lucidity.
We can know that we're sleeping in other words.
So as we approach our death, we're advised to work with this and there's a phrase that
was coined by Alan Ginsberg that was taken up by Trungpa Rinpoche when he was alive
in teaching.
It's called last thought, best thought, or proximate karma.
This refers to how the last thought on our mind before we transition into sleep has a
big impact on how we fall asleep or how we die.
So all of this seems pretty heady in a way, but when we're practicing whether we're sitting
in meditation or we're making an inquiry into the nature of our experience and we notice
that we have lost ourselves, it's just to remember yourself and start again.
Just do it over and over again as David said, practice helps and over time if we are patient
and we cultivate this quality, we will reap the rewards of insight into the nature of
our own experience.
We've talked about this, I mean in all my years of practicing, teachers have been talking
about this in all sorts of different ways.
So I'm not presenting anything new here, all I'm doing is pointing out, my intention is
just to point out how important it is for us to be kind and compassionate and patient
with ourselves because that moment of transition from lucidity to mindlessness to losing our
mindfulness, that gap where that happens, happens to us day in and day out and without
catching it, this is how habitual karma happens.
We tend to do the same thing over and over and over again.
So by paying attention to this, we can bring more awareness to not just what's happening
but the effect that that has on us.
So really what I'm pointing to here is this quality of, for most of us, it's not knowing,
we don't know when this happens to us, it just happens.
And when we start to pay attention, we realize that something has happened and still, I still
look for the gap in my meditation and I can tell you it doesn't show up very clearly for
me when I want to be aware of it.
I try, sometimes I catch it, sometimes I don't.
But I've caught it enough to know that that actually is what's happening.
We're actually moving, our awareness is losing lucidity.
We don't know, we're aware but we don't know that we're aware and in that process there's
something called not knowing.
And if we can accept this not knowing and not demand that it do react in a certain way,
then maybe there's a possibility for us to relax around it a little bit.
So with that, and there may be questions that I'm just going to ask you to hold them, I
want to put you into a breakout room and I'm going to put you into breakout rooms of four.
And I was in a class with one of our teachers here at IMC, Nikki Megaforou.
And she did a breakout room which was really fun and interesting.
So I want to do the same breakout room with you and the prompts I'm going to use are similar
to what she did and I'm just modifying it for our purposes.
So I'm going to put this prompt right now into chat and let's see if I can get in everyone
in the meeting here we go.
So those are the prompts.
Now what I want to do is I want to give you the instruction on how I want you to do it.
So I'm going to put you into breakout rooms of David, can you form breakout rooms of four?
Yeah.
Okay.
So in breakout rooms of four and this is like serial rounds where there'll be four of you
and you'll start somebody volunteered to start.
And then one person will say the question prompt one is how do you experience not knowing?
So I might say I experience not knowing as feeling kind of anxious.
And then that's it.
That's all I say.
And then the next person might say thank you and then they would say I experience not
knowing as in this way and then the third person will say that and the fourth person
will say that and then you'll just keep circling through your group for about three or four
or five minutes and asking that question and then I'll prompt you to move to question
number two and then if we have time I'll prompt you to move to question number three.
But let's try to at least do the first two questions and again it's a serial thing.
You just say one thing and then the next person will say respond how they experience not knowing
and the third and the fourth.
Is that clear?
Clear everyone?
Thumbs up or thumbs down?
Thumbs up.
Okay David are you ready to send them to the room?
And have fun with this.
All right so we only have about five minutes here and if you look at the very bottom of
your screen where it'll say on the far right it says leave and then the little move to
the left and there is an icon that says reactions.
If you click on the reaction you can raise your hand, anyone who wants to do that and
then you'll get put into a queue and then I can call on you efficiently since I can't
see everybody.
Ali thank you.
Thank you Robert that was really a great session I'm wondering and that was a wonderful
talk you gave on that subject I'm wondering if you have any books that you can recommend
for us and this particular subject of that which is really a key factor of how what's
the origin of the thought that it comes to you at this point or later or whatever I can
not put you on the spot but thank you wonderful subject.
You're not putting me on the spot I'm having a little trouble with your audio but I think
what you asked for was are there books on this subject and there's libraries of them
but was your question about the four comma I put it in chat so that it gives you a kind
of a brief definition of them so if you open it open your chat icon at the very bottom
of the screen and then scroll down to the last entry and that's it's from me to everyone
and there's there's Robert it's not there he's asking for a book recommendation Robert
do you know any books well there's many books why don't you stay on for a few minutes yeah
happy to happy to Robert I just want to be giving you feedback Robert that there is whatever
you put in the chat is not right now it's not showing up correct well it shows up in
my chat I guess when we go to breakout rooms once you if you've done it at that time then
it won't be on here all right just a second so so once we came back that chat's gone
he wrote down the four comma let's try this again did it show up yes yes yes okay thank
you oh thank you welcome all right um anybody else I mean time is short what was it like
you actually do this exercise about not knowing and to do it in that particular way what did
you notice I did this last night in a group in Nikki's class and it was really fascinating
no it didn't it didn't fascinate any of you it's hard to answer about the it's hard to
answer about the topic versus the technique Robert okay so I'm a I'm a I just want to
offer you I'm a professional educator I teach teachers how to teach better so if you ever
want to contact me about that but I like that I appreciate your offer yeah thank you I appreciate
your offer gail thank you the main feeling I kept coming to was openness it just it was
a very opening feeling was losing ideas of what was going on and in that way they were
open to possibilities and awareness just especially losing losing the ideas was was an opening
and good experience a little scary but seems beneficial great thank you thank you so just
being present with that quality of being in a place where you don't actually know what's
happening yeah not resisting okay so maybe maybe just as a thought what's being known
there is this quality of non-resistance you see where you're not pushing against something
you're just allowing whatever is happening to happen because awareness knows what's happening
but we think that something should be happening and when it's when we think it's not our thought
that it's not is an expression of resistance and that is where mindfulness gets lost or
recognized thank you gail Gloria so I really like this exercise and I found that we could
each go deeper and deeper into the exploration and a lot of different feelings were involved
maybe way down underneath was fear but on top of that could have been anger anxiety shame
and so forth but really came back to beginner's mind and just being okay about not knowing
being a beginner and start anew right and that's the whole that was the whole point
of the teaching that I gave when this happens you just meet it with beginner's mind instead
of the mind of the expert and you start anew as I shared with you on previous occasions
Bicubodi says the secret to enlightenment is to start and continue over again start
and continue I love it okay so we are after the hour right now and I want to honor our
closing at one I wish that we had more time I will stay on for just a few minutes afterwards
if people want to hang but for people who need to leave please feel free to do that
and please join us next month again and if you're part of the book groups and groups
that meet with David enjoy the next meeting which I guess will be in two weeks David were
there any announcements that you wanted to send anybody off with or you're on mute brother
I just just like to make a dedication of whatever merit has accrued here whatever wisdom or warmth
or compassion or kindness or freedom whatever merit that has been felt here that has been
accumulated here may we dedicate this merit to the happiness of all beings may all be
everywhere be happy may all beings everywhere be liberated from their clinging from their
suffering may all beings everywhere abide in a happiness that knows you may all beings
everywhere abide in equanimity free from clinging and free from hatred okay thank you all it's
a great to have you here together with us and hope to be able to see you see you next
