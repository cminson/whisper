 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Warm greetings. And from a dark morning in Redwood City, California at IMC, Insight Meditation Center. And from this kind of seat in the middle of IMC, Dharma seat, seeing all your names and greetings, and I kind of imagine that IMC has stretched and stretched and stretched in circles of the community and now extends around the globe. It's a very nice feeling. So, for the meditee, no sound. One person says they have no sound, but it's only one person. It probably has to do with them, their technology rather than here. So I'm going to continue. And so, one of the... I'd like to say something that maybe is a little bit... Hopefully, in a good way, kind of provocative. And maybe make an impression on you for this meditation. Maybe help you become quieter or think less and more be curious. What you're capable of discovering or being when there is more silent awareness. In the way that if you listen to a sound, you don't need to be thinking to hear the sound. When you're tasting food, you don't need to be thinking while you're tasting it. In fact, if you think distracted thoughts, you might miss the sound or miss the taste. So in the same way, the thinking mind is not needed for the deep awareness that's possible. In just the deep kind of silent and wonderful awareness. And that this awareness that we're capable of is kind of a natural functioning of our minds, our being. And if we can leave it alone, but if we're alert to it, alert to awareness. In that state of awareness by itself, just kind of attending to it, in the silence of it or the stillness of it or whatever, there will be no complaining, no blame. And in that lack of complaining and lack of blaming, there is something in the family of love. Exactly what that is, it would be very from person to person, maybe just a simple tenderness or a sense of gentleness towards all things or warmth. Maybe it's compassion, kindness. Maybe it doesn't need to have a name. And this wonderful vague English word, love, is all we need to know. So what is it when you sit and are alert to awareness? If mindfulness is very simple and open, receptive to what is, how is it that there's no complaining and no blaming in that? And instead, there might be something in the family of love in that. Could it be? How is that? And I'm hoping that this evocative, maybe evocative introduction doesn't lead you to do a lot of thinking about this, complaining about what I said, for example, making exceptions and all that. That can be for later. There's plenty of times to think it out. But maybe there can be a curiosity as you do your practice and show up for your experience with this clear awareness. In that awareness, is it characterized by an absence of complaining and blaming? Might it be somehow, maybe subtly, characterized by love? So to begin with assuming a meditation posture, and maybe the somewhat silent sensing and feeling of the body can be how you begin your meditation. To sense and feel your posture, your body in your posture, making small adjustments to your posture in ways that support the body to be more aligned, more settled, more at ease. And gently, closing your eyes. And perhaps with a curious quietness of mind, or with a quietness of sensing and feeling the body, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. Stretching the torso, the rib cage as you breathe in deeply. And let go, relax, settle on the exhale. Letting your breathing return to normal. And on the inhale, emphasize the way the body can feel and sense itself. Not really needing the medium of thoughts, ideas, images. On the inhale, feel where the body might be tense or holding tight. And on the exhale, allow the body to soften around that area. And for the next two or three breaths. Feel your whole body as you inhale in whatever way that is easy. And as you exhale, see if you can quiet or let go of your thinking. Letting go into your breathing. Letting go into your body. I meant to say, letting go of your thinking, letting go into your body. And as we continue with whatever capacity you have to be aware without needing to think about it, hearing sounds, feeling sensations of the body, simple knowing, simple registering of emotions and thoughts. Being alert to a silent awareness, thought free or thought reduced awareness. Perhaps being aware out there in that awareness. There's no complaining, complaining or blaming. Even if some other place like in the place of thinking there might be, go to that place where there's no complaining, no blaming. Being aware in a quiet way. And in that quiet, might you find something in the nature of love within that awareness, accompanying that awareness, supporting it. And as you continue this meditation, stay close to the awareness that doesn't complain. The awareness that is associated comes with something in the family of love. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In awareness. Where there is no complaining, no blaming. Might there be some place of awareness, which is in touch with qualities of kindness and goodwill, love. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, imagine that you're sitting on a park bench next to someone, maybe a friend or someone you know. But after some conversations and talking and there's no need to talk anymore, feels very content to sit quietly and imagine in this quiet, silent way of sitting with a friend next to each other. That you are aware of them. You even think of them without any complaints, without any blame. But rather with goodwill, not a goodwill that is a doing something, doing goodwill, but rather from a place where awareness has tenderness, gentleness, goodwill, love, care, something like that within it. Maybe your care, your love can be private. You don't have to tell them you're sitting quietly. And maybe in this privacy of sitting quietly next to each other, you can allow yourself to feel fully the warmth, the care of this other human being, love, that maybe now can extend outwards to the park, the trees, the children playing, the people strolling. Head out into the world. There is a way in which a quiet mind can give room for the heart's capacity to quietly love, generously love. And may it be that our capacity to do this practice, to free ourselves from complaining and blaming, hostility of all kinds. May it be so that we can promote the welfare and happiness of everyone. May it be that we learn to live effortlessly with the welfare and happiness of everyone. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings be free. Thank you.
