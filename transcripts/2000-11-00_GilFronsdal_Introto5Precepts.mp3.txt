 In the next five weeks, we'll give a series of talks on the topic of virtue. In talking about virtue, we'll talk about what's traditionally called the five precepts. Virtue is one of the foundations and fundamental aspects of the path of spiritual practice taught by the Buddha. There were three tripods, three supports or three aspects of the Buddhist spiritual path. In the Buddhist language of Pali, these are known as Sila, Samadhi and Panya or Prajna in Sanskrit. These can be translated into English as virtue, meditation and wisdom. The cultivation of these three qualities is really essential. You need to cultivate all three. You can't expect to develop wisdom and meditation without developing your virtue. You can't really develop your virtue to understand the depth of its possibility without some understanding of wisdom and meditation practice. The topic of virtue is essential to Buddhist practice. It's one which perhaps is not talked enough about by myself and about many of the American Vipassana teachers because of strong emphasis of talking about the second two legs of the tripod, talk about meditation and wisdom. The word Sila is maybe best translated into English as virtue. There's no good translation. Part of the difficulty in looking at virtue or ethics in the Buddhist tradition is that the Western categories of ethics, the Western ideas of ethics, don't translate evenly or easily into Buddhist concepts of ethics. When people hear the word ethics in Buddhism or precepts or even virtue, often they have Western associations with the word and then they react to it or respond to it according to the Western understandings and therefore can often end up being somewhat confused about it. For example, I believe to a large degree Western ethics has a foundation in the notion of commandments that come from God and notions of right and wrong and good and evil and other associated ideas that connect you to that. Sin being one of them. And with that comes some sense of this kind of absolute standard, absolute rules or laws, commandments that we have to live by. And so the idea of guilt is a very pervasive one I think in Western culture, partly because of the way that ethics is sometimes understood here. In Buddhism, the foundation of virtue or ethics is not based on right or wrong or good and evil, but rather is based on the notion of those kinds of actions and behavior which lead to suffering and those kinds of actions or behavior that lead to happiness and to freedom. So you end up with a very different sense of the importance of virtue or ethics in Buddhism, I believe. When you have almost a pragmatic foundation for understanding what is ethical behavior and what is virtue, is the behavior I'm doing now, is the action my choice is I'm making, leading to increasing suffering, increasing hurt or pain for myself or to someone else? Or is it leading to increasing joy and happiness for myself or that for others? And with that I think comes a lesser tendency towards guilt because of this very pragmatic approach. And also things don't have this kind of absolute standard where things are pre-decided how they should be, how we should act, but rather the idea of being more situational ethics is much more appropriate than looking at Buddhism. There might be some principles of virtue that are applied, and one of the principles is the principle of not causing harm, not causing suffering. So how is that principle of not causing harm applied in the actions and choices we make? And the idea of precepts, the five precepts in Buddhism, have underneath them the principle of not causing harm. So, Sila, often translated as virtue, it's sometimes said that the etymology of Sila has literally the meaning of a bed or foundation, the foundation upon which the rest of our spiritual life is built. And sooner or later I think anyone who develops deep sensitivity to life that comes from mindfulness practice will discover that without some foundation in being virtuous, in having qualities of virtue within one, that it's very hard to continue developing increasing depth of sensitivity to our life and to ourselves. Now the word precepts, the five precepts, is also a kind of Western word, precepts, and actually it doesn't translate all too well the Buddhist equivalence, so-called equivalence. And we might start by saying that there are in Buddhism five things, and actually the Buddha talked about, used that very expression, the five dhammas, the five things. And one thing is the thing of not killing, another thing is the thing of not stealing, another thing is the thing of not involving sexual misconduct, and another thing is not lying, and another thing is not abusing intoxicants. So that's a very strange way of talking, what does that mean, those things? But by using that kind of language it kind of frees us up maybe for a moment, a little bit, from some fixed idea of what these not killing, not stealing, and so forth are, how they function. There's actually in the teachings of the Buddha three different ways of understanding these five things. So please bear with me. One of them is as rules of behavior. One of the rules that we use to guide our life is we don't kill, we don't steal, we don't misuse our sexuality, we don't lie, and we don't abuse or take any intoxicants at all perhaps, understood strictly. When the Buddha talks about it as rules, it's not absolute commandments from God or some relationship to absolute truth, you know, this is the way it has to be, but he very specifically calls them training rules, these training precepts. It's for the sake of our spiritual training that we take these on as a discipline, and we take them on as a support voluntarily, for the sake of our training, for the sake of our spiritual practice. And that has a very different feel, I hope you can sense, than saying thou shalt not kill, that shalt not steal. But we say, oh, it really has a benefit from my development of meditation, of mindfulness, of concentration, of wisdom, of compassion, not to go around, you know, stealing from my friends, not from going around being involved with these kinds of activities. And there's many benefits to just taking these things on as training precepts, very many pragmatic benefits. One of them is that they offer very powerful forms of protection. When I give the five precepts, so-called five precepts, these five things, to children, I call them the five protections. And that avoids kind of moralistic understandings that the kids might pick up. I'm going to teach you some five really great protections that can protect you through your life. When I taught it last time to the kids, I said, I talked about how from the time you get born until you get older and older, you're less and less protected by your parents and by the adults. At first you're completely independent and protected, and slowly you become more independent, and you have to take care of yourself more and more, and you no longer have the protection of your parents at some point when you become an adult. But one of the replacements in part is these five protections. And they love that idea. This is what you can do to protect yourself. I told them primarily you're protecting yourself from yourself. And I know many adults who wish they had that protection. I've personally experienced a tremendous amount of distress and suffering that are a result of my not having been skillful with my behavior in those ways. I remember when I was about 20 in periods of youth indiscretion, which once you become old and start getting grey, you're not judged anymore by youthful indiscretion, right? So I can tell you about it. I remember once having, the only time I had an affair with a girlfriend of a friend of mine. And there was certainly some real affection there between us, but it was also a great impulse and passion and spontaneity involved in it. And it was quite nice in the minutes that it lasted. In those very minutes, I had no regrets. But then it followed with periods of fear and periods of concern about being found out, and periods of deceit and confusion about deceit. I'm trying to remember what the deceit was. It's a lot easier to be honest because it's less to remember. And then finally, the situation being found out. And that's causing a lot of suffering for all three individuals involved. It got to the point where I was basically almost not given the option. I was challenged to a fistfight. And the guy was a lot bigger and stronger than I am. I remember I was out in a farm. We were living on, we were farming together. And I was out with a woman doing the farm work. And we were on the top of the tractor. She was kind of on the field. I don't know what she was doing. But we were plowing or doing something. And he came stalking across the field towards us. The way he was stalking towards us, this meant something. So I got down from the tractor and stood there waiting. We were kind of waiting for him to show up. And I got closer. I intuitively, somehow or other, I don't know why. I got down on my knees to wait for him. On one knee, I think. And then he told me to stand up, put his fists up and say, I'm ready. And being on my knees, I spread out my arms kind of wide and in a very vulnerable position on your knees with your arms out. And I said, I can't. I can't fight. Here I am. And he walked away in disgust. Anyway, so, it was just one example in my life of... I wish I had been protected. And how the short-term wonderful, delightful thing led for a long period of suffering and pain for many people involved. So the idea of precepts as being precepts of protection, the rules of protecting ourselves, is commonsensical rules. But even more deeply, as training rules, as part of our practice, they're understood as rules of restraint. They're stated in prohibitive language. For the sake of our training, I vow not to kill. For the sake of our training, for my training, I vow not to steal. And in this sense, it's actually very, very powerful. Because one of the aspects of this is that we agree to hold back, maybe momentarily, a little bit, on our first impulses to act in certain ways. And this can create a tremendous tension inside a person, especially, I think, sometimes in certain cultural values people have. There's a kind of desire, I think, almost that we should be able to follow freely on whatever whims we have. Let's not have any restraints on how we behave. Let's follow on our impulse. And there's a great kind of spectrum between following freely on our impulse and then living kind of blindly by some fixed rules, so we don't understand. And we have to understand that there's some other alternative between those two, and that our whims are necessarily to be followed freely. And rules of restraint is, okay, I commit myself to restrain myself, at least briefly, from just following on this whim to get to kill this mosquito or to steal pencils from work or to whatever it is that we do. And hold back for a little bit, and let me try to understand more deeply what's going on with me. Let me bring mindfulness to this, because one of the things many people do is they feel some discomfort with life. And then from the dis... they react, they recoil from the discomfort and want to act kind of impulsively. And all too often our unethical activity, we harm ourselves or others, arises as a reaction, as a response, as an impulse, as a recoiling from feelings of lack of content or from a sense of unease or discomfort. So one of the very interesting exercises that you might do in this next week, the next weeks as we explore virtue in the Buddhist tradition and in your lives, is look in situations in your life, look for opportunities to notice situations where you get uncomfortable, and then start noticing what are the patterns of how you respond to your discomfort in these situations. Are there some common responses, some common patterns, ways in which you're more likely to respond when you're uncomfortable? Does your stomach tighten up? Do you begin assigning blame? Do you start fidgeting with your hands or start pulling your nose or your ears or something? What are the common physical, emotional, verbal, cognitive ideas that arise in response to you being uncomfortable? I read a study some time ago, but some psychologists who went and interviewed, I think it was, I remember by thousands of prisoners in California prisons, and asking them a very simple question, you know, why are you in jail? Why are you in prison? And the great majority of them blamed their lawyer, the police, their childhood. I think that's very interesting. Without taking responsibility for themselves, what they've done. And I think it's very hard to develop a strong sense of character, a strong sense of strong character, a strong spiritual development, without beginning to take responsibility for ourselves, for our own actions, and certainly our own discomfort. And not to assign blame somewhere else, not to lash out. One response to discomfort is desire. One response to discomfort is aversion. And there's many different responses. What is next week? Why don't you begin looking? Make it a really careful assignment, mindfulness practice, that's more focused maybe than the usual mindfulness practice, to begin being very sensitive to discomfort in your life, and see if you can discern any patterns about how you respond to the uncomfortable situations. In doing that investigation, you might discover not only how you tend to respond reactively, but you might then discover the space to realize you don't have to follow through on those impulses. You can let the impulses just kind of move through you. This is a wonderful expression to ride out your desire. It's great, you feel the desire rising, it has this great imperative, and it has to happen right now, and nothing else counts, and it seems like it has absolute value. After all, it's my desire. And then you don't have to act on it, and at some point it peaks, and then it wanes. Wow, I didn't have to be a slave to it, I didn't have to act on it, it's just like a way that passes through it. It feels very necessary at the peak of it, but it's great practice to ride out desire. Look for opportunities for it, it's really fun. Maybe it's not quite as fun to ride out anger, but you should try that too. So by a precept of restraint, of not acting unconsciously or automatically, on actions at least that causes this kind of harm, actions of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, intoxication, to use those as restraints, not because it's moralistic to do that, not because you're bad because you're doing those things, but to use them as mirrors. You hold them up, I'm not going to act on this, and I'm going to use this as a mirror to look back and study myself and find out what's going on here. Am I responding to discomfort? Am I responding to some sense of lack? Am I responding to some sense of groundlessness and trying to get my bearing? Do I have a whole philosophical system that justifies selfishness? What's going on here for you? So one of the ways in which the Buddha talked about these five things was as a rule of training, actually as a rule. And maybe to inspire us a little bit in that direction, there's a wonderful place where the Buddha talked about these five things as, he said, there are these five gifts, you can call them the five things here, the five gifts, there are these five gifts, five great gifts, original, long-standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated, unadulterated from the beginning, are not open to suspicion, will never be open to suspicion, and are unfaltered by knowledgeable and contemplatives around the world, which five, abstaining from killing, abstaining from taking what is not given, abstaining from sexual misconduct, abstaining from lying, and abstaining from the use of intoxicants. The one who does this gives, this is the gift part, gives freedom from danger, gives freedom from animosity, gives freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings. In giving freedom from danger, freedom from animosity, freedom from oppression, to limitless numbers of beings, he or she gains a share in limitless freedom from danger, freedom from animosity, and freedom from oppression. I love it, it's wonderful, it's a gift, that's what the Buddha said. When you follow the rules of restraint, you give a wonderful gift to the world around you. This ties into one of the purposes, one of the pragmatic purposes of following the rules of restraint, and that is to bring joy to our life. To bring a kind of joy to our life, which is a support for meditation practice. It's really invaluable for the deeper practice of meditation, to have joy, to be happy. Many people come to meditate because they don't have joy, they're unhappy, and that's fine, that's quite appropriate. But are there ways in which you can cultivate more joy? Are there ways in which you can appreciate more joy? One of the ways that the Buddha talked about is living a virtuous life, can bring joy. As I often talk about, when I first encountered this idea in Buddhism, I thought it was crazy. The idea that your moral life, your following and living by these rules of restraint or virtues, can bring joy, I thought, you know, it was only weak people who lived by the precepts, you're kind of goody-goody. But the more I practice, the more I really get a sense of the joy, I feel joy, in kind of a purity of heart that comes from wanting to live this way, knowing that I haven't intentionally harmed anyone, you know, today, at least. This is a wonderful kind of Christian, I guess, or the at least theistic prayer that goes something like, oh, thank you, God, for on this day, I have not harmed anyone or sworn in anyone or stolen from anyone, or been grumpy towards anyone, not been critical of myself, oh, thank you for this wonderful blessing. And now that I'm about to get out of bed, I need all the help and all the help you can give. So the idea that actually brings joy, and I think it's valuable to look for opportunities to feel joy, to appreciate whatever joy, we tend to overlook our joy, we tend to overlook small joys in our lives, we're so driven in our culture, and we're so looking ahead and so preoccupied sometimes in these big issues, or the big existential or psychological unks that we might be struggling with, that we often don't take the time to notice even the small things that we can bring us joy in our daily lives. I was reminded yesterday when I was giving a talk about an expression in English, maybe it has many applications, but I think it applies to this issue of joy, appreciation of joy. Use it or lose it. So if you don't spend some time appreciating joy, you might lose that potential to appreciate it. So the rules of restraint are powerful mirrors, and in that way they're powerful ways of understanding ourselves. And in that they are a gift that offer protection to an infinite number of beings and to ourselves, they can also be sources of joy. So the first aspect I'm talking about here of these five things is as rules, but not as commandments, but rather training rules, pragmatic, useful tools to help us live wiser lives. The second way is that the Buddha talked about these five things, is as principles, principles of virtue. And the fundamental principle that underlies all five of them is a principle of not causing harm. And that principle arises very much out of compassion. So one of the aspects of the precepts of virtue in Buddhism is that we live by them, we're interested in them, out of compassion for others. It's a gift of compassion to others. Out of the sense of the suffering of others, and out of the sense of the possibility of others being free of their suffering and being happy, and for ourselves to have compassion for ourselves, we want to be really careful with our intentional actions, really careful about how we act, how we speak, and even the kind of thoughts and ideas that we pursue. We might not be able to have much say about which thoughts and ideas surface in our minds. So Buddhism is very accepting of the ideas that bubble up. But maybe you can be a little more careful about not necessarily what bubbles up, but which of those thoughts and ideas you pursue with your thoughts. Are they causing harm? It's very important to bring the training precepts together with the principle of not causing harm. So the training precepts don't get reified into the solid ideal, this is the way I have to live without any wisdom or understanding. The humanistic or the human side of the precepts is a side that brings in this studied investigation, what is causing harm here? Is there something that's causing harm here? Am I causing harm to myself or to others? That's why in terms of sexuality, Buddhism as a kind of wide tradition has been very lenient towards all kinds of different sexual orientations. Basically, there's a kind of way in which Buddhism adapts itself to some degree to what's considered to be the sexual orientations of the culture it enters into. Maybe that isn't always the wisest thing to do, but some understanding of what causes harm is very much connected to how a culture understands, how sexual relationships should be conducted. So it's gone into countries where there's been polygamy, countries where there's been lots of husbands, polyandry. And that's completely fine, what's the problem with that? And it might be a problem in some other cultures, but in those cultures where those are institutions, that's fine. Homosexuality has had mixed teachings in Buddhism about that, unfortunately, but there's often a strong tendency in Buddhist cultures to be very accepting of homosexuality. It certainly was a common feature in many of the Asian Buddhist monastics settings. So is it causing harm? If it doesn't cause harm, then what's the problem? So I think this understanding as a principle brings a lot of humanity to it. So the five things are principles, and as principles are the principles of compassion, principles of generosity, principles of not causing harm. The third aspect of these five things is the Buddha talks about them as virtues or as qualities of a person's character. So when the Buddha was talking about someone who was well-developed in their spirituality, some person who discovered some level of personal freedom, he would describe them as people who had these five virtues. They were people who weren't going to kill. They were people who weren't going to steal, people who weren't going to lie, people who weren't going to be involved in sexual misconduct, people who weren't going to be involved in intoxicating the mind. And there's nothing moralistic about it. There was nothing about rules of restraint or anything about this way of stating. He's just having this kind of byproduct of being well-developed spiritually, the byproduct of being well-developed in discovering degrees of freedom. A person like that won't do that. The Buddha said that once you reach a certain level of liberation, of awakening, it's actually not possible to do those things. And what he meant by that, it's not possible to do them intentionally. And part of the principle of the precepts is a principle of intentionality. What is your intention? Is it your intention to kill someone or to kill something or harm? Is your intention to steal? If it's not your intention to do such a thing and such a thing happens, then karmically, you can feel bad about it in a sense, but karmically there's no karmic consequences for that. So if you're driving and you happened to someone in Arsanga some years ago, they ran over a fox up in the skyline. And part of the great pain this woman felt was because she felt personally responsible. There is some degree of maybe responsibility, but if there's no intention to have hit that fox with a car, then there's a level in which that role or that element, that person's virtue is perhaps untainted, untarnished. And so you don't have to personally feel guilty for their action. And this looking at the intention of our actions can sometimes make the complexity of moral issues and ethical issues a lot easier to address. What is our intention behind what we're doing now? So for example, in the question of, maybe this is not a good example, but I think it's useful in the question of euthanasia. Which many people in our society now face, for loved ones or under parents or something, and they've given instructions, you know, that please don't take me off life support if I get to a certain condition. So then people will sometimes come and ask a Buddhist teacher or something, you know, is this okay? Is this violating the precept? One of the very important questions to ask is, what is the intention behind pulling the plug? And sometimes the intention can be the intention of aversion. We can be so uncomfortable in a situation that we really want to just be free of it, we're going to get away from it. And so let's just pull the plug. Or I've heard stories, I don't know if they're true, I've heard stories where they said, oh, I had such difficulty with my siblings because, you know, they wanted to pull the plug on my father. But really what they wanted was, you know, they were just getting tired of this endless, you know, hospital visits, and they were so eager to get hold of the money. I don't know if it was true, but that's how they were perceived. So what's the intention? What's the motivation behind euthanasia? That becomes really important in Buddhist practice. And the intention can be wisdom and compassion. And it can be something much more unwholesome, unskillful. If the intention is one of greed or of aversion, that will bring on further suffering for the person who acts out of those intentions. And the channels in our psyche, by which that suffering will perpetuate, is not always so clear. But for example, very simply, if we continue to act on intentions of aversion or greed, there's a certain level of numbness, certain level of contraction, certain amount of habit formation that gets created from those actions, that it becomes a lot easier to do that in the future, which causes more suffering. And we reinforce our tendency to recoil and react impulsively on our discomfort. Maybe to such a degree, we don't even know we're uncomfortable to begin with. So these five things can be understood as rules of training. They can be understood as principles. And they can be understood as descriptions of what a person of virtue is like, what a person who is getting awakened is like. Not as a should, which is a matter of fact thing. This is what how people are, is they become more and more liberated, they're free, more sensitive to life and to themselves. And I find it to myself, another source of joy and delight to know that there are people in the world who can be described that way. And maybe they're not saints, maybe they certainly can make mistakes still, but they have a tremendous intention, they have a tremendous sensitivity to life, a tremendous purity of heart. They are really hard to imagine, which, you know, I'm really, have some kind of confidence in them, some trust in them, that they have those kinds of virtues described who they are. That to me is a great source of joy. And to know that this is a possibility for myself, I'm not going to claim that I'm a very virtuous person, though I have had my youthful inscrations. But I remember the great delight and awe and inspiration I had when I had another kind of, you know, again, you have to allow my youth for it. I remember when I was, you know, many years ago, I was in Japan, and I met this lovely Japanese woman, and we spent some time together, and I was kind of interested in pursuing a relationship with her, I was kind of an attraction, I liked her, and she was like a very nice person. But underlying kind of my attraction to her, I realized kind of after a while was basically lust, and I was looking forward to the chance of getting to bed with her. But it didn't happen before I went off to Thailand, and I went to Thailand for, I set my first repostal retreat, which was ten weeks long. And periodically through the retreat, these lustful ideas of this woman would arise. And slowly they began to wane. And at least for a time during that retreat, near the end of it, there was this tremendous purity of heart, this great peace and peace in my mind, and ease and kind of delight. And when I had thoughts about her, the idea of lust just seemed so far away. There was none of it. And I mostly had this wonderful, the thoughts were of appreciation of her, and looking forward to seeing her in a sense, but mostly this kind of appreciation. And it felt like such a violation, so foreign to me in that state of purity, to have lust for her, which felt very kind of painful just for myself, just to have those thoughts and feelings, actually felt kind of painful. In a way that when I was lost in the lust, I couldn't even see the pain that was in my heart having those kinds of feelings, because I'm so directed at the object of my lust, and the kind of pleasure that can might arise out of it. And I noticed the difference between the state of lust I had, and the state of lack of lust, instead of this kind of purity of heart. This is where this great delight, this is a possibility, this is a potential. I was so inspired by this, I could discover this for myself, wow. Now, it was just a phenomenon of retreat, right? The retreat was over, and some of my old ways came back, not necessarily the ways, but it was really inspiring to me. And more and more as I practice, I see this possibility as an expression, as a virtuous quality, as a beauty, coming from a purity of heart, a purity of mind. So, in the next five weeks, I'd like to take up each of these five things, and we'll spend some time discussing the issue of not harming or not killing, and not stealing, not being involved in sexual misconduct, not lying, and not intoxicating themselves. And I hope that as we do this, that you come. I hope that the idea of spending five weeks on ethics and virtue is not oppressive to you, or discouraging to you, or I hope that we can share in this discussion five weeks of some amount of joy and delight in these, and some period of really being challenged by them. If you're not challenged by your spirituality, you should go home. You know, it's your spirituality, including other things, being inspired and being supported by it. It also needs to, hopefully, is challenging you, and I hope that discussing ethics is also a challenge for you to look really deeply at yourself, not in ways to cause more suffering or more guilt or more shame or more embarrassment or whatever, but rather the opposite. As you encounter yourself, encounter maybe awkward and difficult motivations and tendencies, to see that the other side of that, to see that the very investigation of it, is a source of great joy and delight. That's my hope. So, I hope we can do that. And so, I hope that in the next week you look at least at what is it? How is it you respond to discomfort? What are your common patterns, personal patterns of response to situations of discomfort? Does that seem like okay? Yeah. Great. Thank you.
