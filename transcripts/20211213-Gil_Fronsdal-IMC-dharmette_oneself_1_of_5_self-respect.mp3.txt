The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So for this week, the theme will be oneself.
So the focus is on relationships with oneself.
And I was a little surprised that this came up as a theme for this time of the year.
I thought perhaps this was a better time for something like loving-kindness, or compassion, or generosity.
So we get into the holiday season.
But then I thought that, no, I think that a focus on oneself
is to kind of come into a better space, a better way of being with oneself.
Can prepare ourselves to be in the social world.
Those of us who are going to be more social perhaps, or more interactive during the holiday season.
So oneself.
It's a little bit of a surprising theme for Buddhists sometimes,
because of sometimes an excessive emphasis on not-self.
And it seems like we shouldn't talk about self at all.
But if you find in the look and the teachings of the Buddha,
he often talked about, used the word self, the Pali word is atta, atta,
in positive sense.
I believe without any fear, concern, that it would be misunderstood as being a metaphysical self,
or being some kind of permanent self, or permanent existential self.
That somehow the ordinary idea of oneself is a valuable and useful reference point
for understanding ourselves and our lives.
And I think that to some degree, there is this wonderful interactiveness
and balance in ancient teachings of the Buddha,
between a certain kind of individualism, and a certain kind of collectivism,
certain kind of emphasis on personal agency, and what we can do,
and an emphasis on being open, receptive, connected with others in the world around us.
And the combination of those is a fascinating way of living this life.
And I'll say more about that in a couple of minutes,
but I wanted to read a passage from the Dhammapada, where this word self is atta, is used.
And here it's being translated as oneself.
If one knew oneself to be precious, one would guard oneself with care.
The sages watch over themselves in any part of the night.
So I think that sages often stay up and meditate through the night,
so they're caring for each other, caring for themselves.
This idea of one knew oneself to be precious, one would guard oneself with care.
And it also goes on and says, oneself indeed is one's own protector.
What other protector could there be with self-control when gains a protector hard to obtain?
So having the agency of being one's own protector and what other protector could there be,
many of us are hoping others will protect us, others will make us safe.
If only these other people would behave in a certain way, then we would be safe.
And it's common these days for plenty of people to say that they're not safe
and then insist that others change how they are to make them safe.
And there's some value to that, and we don't want to discredit its importance of doing that at times.
But there's also something very important about learning how to be one's own protector
and learning how to find safety within.
And here it's obtained through self-control when gains a protector are hard to obtain.
So one of the ways I would like to present this idea that each of us for ourselves is precious,
each of us for ourselves is dear, is through the notion of self-respect, respecting ourselves.
And respect has this wonderful combination of having agency, we're doing something,
and also a kind of openness, a kind of making space for, kind of letting go of conceit and self-concern
for something that we respect to give some kind of care to it or deference to it.
Generally we think that it's easier to understand with other people or some other parts of reality
if we respect for it.
So to respect someone is a powerful act that we generate from inside of us when it's done wisely.
And then at the same time as taking agency for this respect, having this respect for someone,
there's also a kind of putting oneself a little bit aside, hopefully in a healthy way,
a little bit of a deference to the other, making space for the other person that we respect.
It's kind of like hospitality as one of these things where these dual activities is there.
Then on one hand we are the agent of offering hospitality to someone,
and in offering hospitality there is a kind of self-forgetting, a kind of putting oneself aside
for the purpose of supporting, helping, hosting someone else.
I think generosity also has this dual action of agency that we do, but also a giving away.
And perhaps compassion is the same way that we can generate compassion, care for others,
and at the same time it is caring for others.
And a certain kind of healthy way we're putting ourselves aside are preferences and things.
So respect is that way, and the dual kind of relationship can be towards ourselves.
We can have agency in deciding or having respect for ourselves, giving ourselves respect.
And at the same time as doing that, letting go of conceit,
letting go of certain kind of preferences for what we do and what we should do
so that we can really know ourselves better, feel ourselves better, be present for us in a bigger way.
And so this idea of we are important enough, we're valuable enough,
that we are an appropriate object of our own respect.
And just like everyone we can respect, there is a certain kind of way of valuing
and seeing the worth of every human being and not to leave ourselves out of that
to have respect for ourselves, to have care for ourselves.
The movement of love in Buddhism is not a movement where everyone is loved but oneself,
but it's a movement of love that includes ourselves.
So I think of sometimes as the heart, the emotional heart being kind of like a light bulb,
and you turn it on, the light, maybe it's filled quickly with light,
but if it went, the first light shines on ourselves, and then it shines on what's around us.
The love, the care, the respect first goes through us and then into the world around us.
And it's my hope that if we have self-respect, we actually have more substance in ourselves
for respecting others, that we show up more fully when we have self-respect.
And the more fully we show up, the more we're there to care, love, be friendly, supportive, kind to other people.
Self-respect that we're allowed to live, we're allowed to be.
We don't have to be apologetic for ourselves, defend ourselves.
We don't have to be self-effacing. We don't have to kind of not count.
We're allowed to count so that we can let everyone else count better.
We're allowed to be worthy and full so that we can offer the gift of attention and presence and space for other people as well.
So this idea of refuge.
One self is the refuge of oneself. What other refuge can there be?
So again, the idea of protector, whether our own protector or our own refuge.
And so how do we make ourselves a refuge for ourselves? How do we make protect ourselves?
So I would like to say that it takes some agency.
It's not kind of just trusting that we're innately good or that everything is wonderful about ourselves.
Which some people are so eager to feel because there's maybe such a low negative self-image.
That's a bomb. It's a kind of medicine to hear that you're worthy and wonderful.
But the way to give substance to it is through agency.
And the Buddha gave a number of things.
One was through living ethically.
And the more we can live ethically, the more self-respect there can be.
So we kind of create the conditions to have self-respect.
And in that regard, one way to develop self-respect is not that we are automatically ethical,
but rather we have a commitment.
Some people would say a vow to live as ethically as we can.
And to learn from our ethical mistakes to try to do better in the future.
That kind of attitude, I think, warrants more self-respect.
And so the idea of making a commitment, making a vow, is a very, I think, powerful thing to do.
The other thing for making ourselves a refuge or self-respect is to develop mindfulness.
To have the self-awareness, enough self-awareness to see how we undermine ourselves.
How we criticize ourselves. How we doubt ourselves.
And then not believe it so much.
Be able to see it clearly enough and fully enough that we begin trusting the seeing, the knowing, the perception.
While there it is again, that habit of mine to be self-negating.
But I see it.
And the word respect, as many of you know, comes from the word to see again.
The Latin word, re-respect.
And so to this idea of mindfulness, really being able to see.
And see with care, see with kindness, see with a certain kind of openness.
So that there's this, we're not caught in the negative self-talk.
And begin having respect that we can do this. We can meet our negativity with kindness, with care, with openness.
That's respect worthy.
And so to, and then the last one, I think the last one I want to read here.
Is a fascinating poem by the Buddha verse.
A person should not give oneself away.
Should not give oneself up.
Beautiful speech should be released.
Malevolent speech should not.
So this, so this idea of one should not give oneself away.
To have self-respect, we never give ourselves away.
Though we might do that dual action where there's self-respect.
And we get out of the way to, we get rid of, we let go of our conceit.
We kind of respect powerfully with agency, put aside our own preferences sometimes for the benefit of others.
But we're not giving ourselves away.
We're not giving up on anything, not giving up on ourselves.
So the theme for this week is oneself.
And the topic for today is respect, self-respect.
And I suspect that not many of you have thought about this in relationship to yourself.
Some of you probably have.
And maybe for today you can reflect on this idea of self-respect.
What does it mean for you?
Maybe talk to friends and family about, you know, what it might mean and how this idea of self-respect can be beneficial for you.
And maybe significant, maybe even powerful for you to live with greater self-respect,
to find how to have self-respect, to tap into self-respect.
So reflect on this topic and look at it and live with it for the day.
And then tomorrow we'll go on in other aspects of focusing on oneself.
So thank you.
