The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
That way tonight, there we go.
Okay, so welcome. Welcome to Happy Hour, everyone.
So, and I'm going to mute everyone here.
Just for audio quality, yes.
So, the theme for tonight.
Actually, part of me doesn't want to start speaking about the theme.
I just want to invite you into a meditation tonight
and for us to explore and discover it as we go along with no expectations.
Maybe that's the theme. The theme is no expectations.
There it is. How's that for a theme?
Living this precious moment without any expectations.
It's always improvised anyway.
So, let's practice without any expectations.
Put on your no expectation perspectives on and let's get started.
Settling. Settling.
Settling in this body.
Letting go of any expectations for what this moment is going to be like.
What life should or shouldn't be like.
What does it feel like to, in this moment, take on the perspective to embrace,
to fully embrace no expectations?
What relaxes in our bodies, in our mind?
As if you're holding a balloon, a helium balloon, and you just open your fist.
You open your tight fist. You don't hold on.
You let it float. You let it float.
So much space.
So much sky.
And as you figuratively open your fist of no expectations in this moment.
Letting the body relax.
Let the body drop into itself from the inside.
As if weights of expectation are being put down.
One pound weight lifted off your shoulders put aside.
Ten pound weight off your chest.
Just to be light in this moment.
Just to experiment what it's like.
What it's like in just this moment. No attachment to outcome.
No expectations.
And simply inviting the breath as it moves through your body on its own.
Breathing hundreds, thousands of times happening on its own.
No control of the breath anyway. No expectations.
You might think you're in control of the breath.
You might think you're in control of the breath.
See if you can allow this perspective to land for you in this moment. See what it's like.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
See if the balloons of thoughts and plans and memories come up and you notice yourself holding onto them.
See if it's possible to open your hand in this moment.
Rest, rest with the body, the breath moving through, taking a moment of refuge,
tilling the soil, one breath at a time.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
Just receiving the breath, sitting, receiving the breath, attention, awareness,
through gentleness and kindness, one breath at a time, that's all.
No expectations.
On what should or should not happen, what may or may not happen.
Putting down the weight, the burden,
clanging to expectations in this moment.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
See if you can allow this perspective to land.
As you sit and breathe, or as you sit and rather let the breath be breathed.
See if a perspective, feeling in the body of putting down expectations,
whether it can be freeing, opening, softening, relaxing, nurturing for your heart,
instead of feeling bleak or dry, but just a sense of freedom and kindness.
If you let go of the taskmaster for a moment, what would happen?
Just this moment, not to say your entire life, but just to experiment.
Can a perspective of no expectations, no attachment to outcome,
be nourishing, supportive for you in this moment? Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Not expecting this said to be good.
Not expecting it to be any particular way.
Deep, calming, relaxing, nothing, no expectations at all.
Explore for yourself.
Just being with the breath just because.
No reason, no expectations.
Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Can there be an appreciation of things just as they are in this moment?
Not expecting them to be any different.
Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Is it possible for the mind in this moment to open up to another dimension of Okaness
and appreciation without needing or wanting a sense of Okaness that comes
from lack of contraction, relaxing, the tight fist.
Explore for yourself.
Explore for yourself.
Notice, if any one thing is arising, wanting the experience to be different, further to
be less distraction in the mind, less sleepiness, less anxiety, or if the mind expected, wanted
a different instruction tonight, something different, not what's happening right now.
And can this be seen?
Can this tendency be seen and just simply held with kindness as if it were held with
a smile?
Oh, dear heart, dear mind.
How you suffer wanting this and that.
Thank you.
This moment is like this.
Thank you.
I'd like to share a couple of invitations and drop them in if they work for you and if
they don't, just let them go.
Don't get entangled.
Drop into your body this reflection.
What if everything in life that you're receiving and have received, both the beauty, the grace,
the love, as well as the challenges, they're all gifts.
And what if you opened up your heart to this richness, cornucopia in your life, just for
a moment without expectations of anything more, anything less, as if life doesn't owe
you anything, what it's given you is just a miracle.
Give me to every moment, this moment, the freshness, newness of a newborn with eyes
of wonder, not knowing what's next.
Feeling inspired, odd, but no expectations for it to be any particular way.
Thank you.
Meeting this moment as a child of wonder.
Thank you.
And for the last moments of this practice period together, holding yourself with kindness
for whatever arose or did not arise, whether you met a lot of expectations or nothing,
skillfully, unskillfully, just appreciation for having shown up as best you were able to
without attachment to outcome.
It showed up like this, can you be grateful for that?
As wonderful as it could have been, it could have been any differently, it would have been,
it could have been, it could have been any different, it could have been any different.
Thank you.
So, the scene for tonight, no expectations meeting this moment with likeness, and if
there are expectations smiling at them, opening the fist of attachment of wanting things to
be a particular way, then seeing, just being curious, if the sense of wonder, freshness
in meeting the moment, might perhaps, might perhaps allow the mind to open to another
dimension, this other dimension of wonder, awe, ease, freedom in the moment without
clinging, just for a millisecond, being a child of wonder.
So, if you are moved to share, either a word or two, you can put that in chat, or if you
want to raise your hand, I unmute you, or you can unmute yourself now, just to share
what's coming up for you perhaps from this practice period, and anything is fine.
I'll start by sharing, for me there's a sense of spaciousness, and I was leading this
meditation from my own experience in real time.
The sense of awe, wonder in this moment, of being alive, just the wonder of it all
without any expectations, I've been able to control how life has led me to this point
and this sense of curiosity, freshness in it all.
So, if anyone likes to share, it'd be lovely if you're moved to.
Trudy, please, I'll unmute you.
Whoops, there you are.
Yes, I'm just feeling a great deal of gratitude and appreciation.
And I'm very, very grateful for this experience, this meditation.
It has been, for me, especially touching and beautiful.
So, thank you.
And your words, Trudy, are specially touching and beautiful as they land on my heart.
No, I'm glad.
Thank you.
Yes, Yak.
Hi everyone.
Yeah, I was moved by that praise of being a child of wonder and another dimension.
I feel like the more we get older due to the circumstances and situations in our life,
it's harder to access different aspects of our lives and in your words, dimensions.
But listening to you today was very letting go.
So, I felt that deep sense of letting go and just feel expensive.
Lovely, beautiful, expensive, letting go, dropping in.
Thank you.
May we continue to discover that in every moment, in the middle of it all, in the middle of the craziness.
Thank you, Yak.
And Lisa says in chat, settled in the body.
Thank you, Lisa.
Lovely to be settled in the body, rooted, grounded.
Anyone else moved to share what's coming up or what has come up?
Any questions or comments?
Or complaints?
Vicky offers.
Letting go can also fear empowering.
Absolutely, Vicky.
I completely agree.
Yeah.
It is empowering because the needs, the need for things to be a particular way, these clingings,
these expectations, the weight of them are not weighing us down anymore.
So, it is empowering.
There's a sense of empowerment, freedom.
Beautiful.
I appreciate you using the word empowering, which is what came up for you.
Yeah.
Yes, Susan, please.
Thanks, everybody.
You reminded me about the fact that I'm not in control of.
Which something for me.
So, and there was a big relief.
Of, oh, I can stop trying so hard right now.
And then the clarity of, oh, then I better take, I better be in this present moment and
take care of the causes and conditions for if there is a future moment for it to be more
of my liking, perhaps.
So, there was a lot of freedom and letting go.
And so, I got to settle and enjoy that spaciousness.
And then the insight that, oh, and also that we'll free up more space for the joyous things.
So, it's kind of a double win.
It's fascinating how that happens, right?
We feel like if we cling and make things happen, we'll be happier and we'll be more joyous.
But in fact, it's the other way around.
Thank you for speaking to that insight, Susan.
It's lovely.
Thank you for helping me get there.
You got there yourself.
Just the doula here, just helping you push.
You're doing all the hard work.
Ah, so lovely.
So, this is a lovely time to transition to holding each other.
In just a few minutes, it'll be just six minutes of interacting with others in small group,
if you wish.
And see, if you take on this perspective of no expectations, going into it without any
expectations for what you're going to say, that you're not going to sound smart,
you're not going to sound impressive, no expectations of yourself.
What is it going to be like if you interact with other people without any expectations?
And they have no expectations of you.
You could just be silent.
And that's fine.
See what comes up.
Experiment, this is such an interesting sandbox to experiment with another couple of human
beings for just five minutes, maybe also at the time we've been shorter today.
Just experiment and see what it feels like.
And if it's not for you tonight, it's understandable, but I suggest try it out.
Where do you get to improvise and practice lack of expectations in any conversation?
You can just sit and look at them and that'd be fine.
No expectations.
No expectations.
So let's check it out.
So I'm going to create the breakout rooms now.
Here we go.
And the prompt is, how are you in this moment?
Well, how are you in this moment?
Or what came up for you in the practice?
You can take it anyway.
But basically, how are you?
What came up that?
And no expectations.
So here we go.
Let's see.
Yes, I have the rooms.
And let's make sure the numbers are working.
Yes, I'm going to start them and you could time yourself.
Here we go.
Let's open all rooms.
Everyone.
Yeah, it would be lovely to hear what was this like for you to engage with others with no expectations of yourself and no expectations of a yes, please.
And what's your name?
Hi, Charles.
What does it say?
It says iPhone 7 plus new as your name.
Hello, iPhone 7 plus new.
How's your day?
I like Charles.
So Charles.
Thank you.
I like you too.
Yeah, I mean, I like the break out sessions actually was going to share that.
Yeah, I think they should be longer actually.
Tell me more.
Oh, it's just great getting to hear about, you know, other people's experiences, I think with it, you know, with the, with their practice and how they, they felt through it.
And then also it's nice to share too.
So, yeah, I think with a little bit more time, maybe we'd be able to hear more and also be able to exchange, you know, share more.
Great.
I so appreciate you saying that because, you know, I don't want to, you know, I'm trying to make it as little as possible to kind of for people to overcome the barrier.
I don't want to do it.
That's where I am.
So it's so it's so helpful for me to hear the feedback of actually, you know, longer would be more helpful.
Yeah, because I feel like the people may be more hesitant or just kind of just dropped.
Exactly. That's right. Exactly. So the people who stay want to do it anyway, so might as well give. Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah. Let's experiment. We're all learning together. Yeah. Thanks for that.
For that reflection. Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you. That's great. Wonderful. And let's see.
Yeah.
I can't. It's a some it's a long Gmail name. So you have to tell me your name if you would.
Nervia.
Nervia. Hi. Oh, beautiful name. Hi, Nervia.
I just wanted to share building on my childhood. This was actually the first time I joined the breakout rooms.
I always been like, oh, I have this resistance to it.
I said, we'll just go on with no expectation of yourself. I was like, well, okay, I can do that.
And I really enjoyed it. So, so thank you.
Awesome. Thank you. Delighted to hear that. So, so, so this is great. So you're one of the people who would have signed off.
You stayed. So how long was the length for you? I'm curious if you would tell me was it just about right too long too short?
Maybe it's just about right, but there are only two of us. So.
Got it. Okay. Yeah. Just two of you. Charles, were there two or three people in your room?
We had two.
You had two also. Okay. I'm just collecting data as you can see you guys doing my research. This is great. Thank you so much.
Yeah. And yes, you have your hand up. Please.
The, the person I was with, I wanted to say sorry because my battery died. The connection.
So, yeah, other than that, it was nice to connect one on one. So yeah, thank you.
Nice. Thank you. Yeah. And these days with the connectivity going and coming, I think we all experienced some finickyness part of it.
Yeah. It's nice to hear it was nice. Nevertheless, anyone else.
What was it like for you to go in with no expectations of yourself and of the other person?
It was scary. It was terrible. Come on. Bring it on. What was it like? Megan, please.
I joined late and I was like, oh, should I, should I do the zoom tonight or go for a walk? And I was just super exhausted, but so glad I joined.
And then I almost dropped out before the groups, but so glad I stayed.
I met Kristen, who's an Episcopal priest on the East Coast. And I think it was Matthew.
And it was just so lovely to hear them talk about their practice and just to like kind of connect in an informal setting and talk about my practice in life and everything.
And so it was just very, very nice. And like, I feel very grateful.
Oh, sweet. Thank you. Megan, the way you talk about it, it makes me want, I wish I could be in the rooms myself, but given how the structure of zoom works.
I tried it once and everything went to heck, basically. So I don't dare, but I feel so much mood, so much happiness for your happiness and everybody else's joy of connection.
And for you to be able to do that, to be able to connect with each other in this way.
That brings up grace and beauty and gratitude and care for each other across all the locations in the country that you're connecting in this time.
Yeah, thank you, Megan. Anyone else would like to share or ask a question or anything?
Yeah, Bupal.
Yeah, Nikki, just a quick feedback on the breakout rooms. You did say you were allowing shorter, allocating shorter time, less time today. And I think for two people, it was just about right.
And you thought about what?
For two people, it was enough. I think if it were three, it would have been maybe a little bit different.
A little tight. Okay, good to know. Great. And is that what you felt, Bupal? Were you in a group of three?
I was in a group of two.
Ah, okay. So that felt about enough time.
Yeah, felt about it. Yeah, you know, with the zoom, it gets funny with the counts, you know, many groups. How about groups of three? Let's hear from the groups of three.
Yeah, how was it for the people in the groups of three? Would you share, Megan? How did the time feel?
I thought it was okay, actually. I think we could have probably gone longer and maybe had some more general discussion, but I think for individual check-ins, it was okay.
Okay, that's great. Okay, that's good to know. Thank you.
You know, maybe somewhere around, you know, I hadn't heard a complaint when it was at six minutes, so today I experimented with Lord just to get people who would, you know, on the line.
So, like, Nervia, who stayed just because he was shorter and no expectations, it's all great. Fantastic.
Any other last-minute reflections about the practice of no expectations in your daily life, in the guided meditation, meetings, anyone who hasn't spoken yet? We'd love for you to hear your voice.
If you wish.
Yeah, Ariana. Hi. Thank you, Nikki, for this practice.
I've been in SITS with you in person where we've done breakout rooms, and I liked, I miss that. I do miss that.
The instructions for me were, I really had to pay attention. I found myself having expectations kind of every other sentence, like, oh, I'm expecting to say something that is profound or something that has a conclusion.
And I was in a room with Charles, and he was very receptive, and I really appreciated his feedback and presence there, because he made it much easier to let go of those expectations.
It just buoys my heart, the connection you guys had in the moment, and really practice together, really practice with, as you're describing, Charles offering you just presence and kindness, and you offering that to yourself, like, oh, yeah, there's expectations.
So that mirroring, that holding that Charles offered, it allowed you to be more gentle with yourself and see the expectations as they go, oh, that's just lovely. It's just beautiful.
Thank you for sharing that. He's so happy. Well, it's 7-0-1. It's happy hour. I'm happier now than an hour ago when we started. Yay.
So I thank you all for your deep practice for being here, offering this to yourself and to each other. It's just so beautiful.
May all beings be happy. May all beings be well. May all beings be free, including us.
Good care, everyone. Bye.
