The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Hello everyone and welcome. And here we are the the fifth of these five
part series on I'm Calling Locations for Awareness. And one of the kind of maybe
difficult things to understand about awareness is a degree to which it's a
conditioned constructed phenomena that the mind in some degree and to some degree
constructs its ideas of what it means to be aware. And so the idea that there's
a location for awareness has some truth and it also has some sense of a choice
and a construction. And what happens when awareness is not constructed, when
it's allowed to just be. And this comes into play particularly with the idea
that there's a here and there, that there's a place to be aware from, and
there's something that we're being aware of. And at times this is completely
normal and natural to have that sense. And there are times when the mind gets
quiet enough or still enough that we're very aware, but awareness has no
location. It's just everywhere in a sense if or nowhere. We're very aware, very
clear. There's a lot of clarity. And but the objects of awareness are not objects.
There's not like awareness and then objects. There's just things that
are known and the knowing arise together. And it can be a little bit
feeling like, you know, like, you know, objects in space. Deep and darkest space,
I suppose, there's just something exists without any reference to anything else.
So an object can exist without any reference to anything else. Exists in
awareness and attention. So it might be a little unusual to understand what I'm
trying to say, but we'll do a little meditation and see if maybe you can get
some feeling for this. So to assume a meditation posture and to gently close
your eyes and to gently become aware, gently, gently come aware of your body.
In feeling the substance of your body, the weight against your chair or your
cushion.
To feel the weights of your hands. And if their hands are resting upon something,
feeling that resting of the weight.
And then within this body to take a slow, long, slow, deep breath. And as the torso
expands to feel it as a massage from the inside, a stretching and opening. And as
the inhale as the torso contracts again, feel it the other half of the rhythm of
a massage. A gentle, caring for the body.
Letting the breathing return to normal.
And as you exhale to relax,
the body, soften the different parts of your body, scanning through.
And then gently as you exhale to relax the thinking mind, the energy,
agitation of thinking, any sense of contraction or pressure, coagulation,
and the thinking mind.
And then at the end of the exhale,
a really feeling for a while, the exhale, whenever you're exhaling, a heightened
kind of sensing, the physical experience of exhaling, how the chest moves, the
diaphragm, the belly.
And when you come to the end of the exhale, for a second or so, pause before
you inhale. And in that pause, maybe you can let go more, relax more, for there to
be more of the exhale.
And if that happens, then pause again at the very end. One way or the other, let
there be a pause at the end of the exhale, feeling the sensations in your body
where that pause occurs, and then allow for the inhale to begin. Allow the
sensations of inhale to come into awareness.
If pausing at the end of the exhale causes some discomfort in breathing that
throws it off a little bit, let there be almost a pause at the end, so that there's
a little heightened ability to receive the inhale.
And allow for the exhale. Allow the body to release as you exhale, receiving the
inhale, allowing the exhale.
Noticing if more your awareness is in the sensations of breathing, awareness is
more maybe in the head or the knowing of breathing.
Is there a distance between awareness, knowing, and the breathing?
Is there a sense that there's an object that sensations to be aware of, and you
being aware. And if there is, what are the sensations? What's the feeling? What's the
location of the you that's aware? What's the feeling? What's the sensation of that
which is aware? That which is receptive? That which is allowing? And if there is you
or that which is receptive or allowing? On the exhale, let that relax, let that
soften.
Letting the sense of a doer of mindfulness recede into the background, let it
evaporate. And there's no receiving, no allowing. The sensations of breathing just
are, they appear in awareness. No distance between awareness and what you're
aware of. The sensations of breathing appear in vast space. Each sensation,
each experience of breathing just is. An awareness of breathing just is, is
inseparable. Knowing has no location apart from the sensation. Each sensation, no
need to, for it to exist in a reference to anything else. Breathing, breathing
itself. No watcher. Just aware. No distance.
Just awareness.
No location. Just awareness.
No receiver of experience. No victim of experience.
No actor of experience. Just knowing, just awareness, experience by itself.
Breathing by itself is not thinking. Breathing is free of thinking. Thinking is
an overlay, is a separate process than breathing. To be aware of breathing
without thinking, that reference to thought. Just breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing. When there is no thinking or beyond the edges of thinking, the awareness,
experience just is. Without location, distance here or there, thought about,
conceived, conceptualized. Awareness without self, experience without
a experiencer. Nothing extra, nothing added to the basic simplicity of experience.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
Breathing.
And then as we come to the end of this sitting, to take a few moments to relax on the
exhale. Soften whatever is energized or contracted or
on the exhale, relax deep inside. Settling in deeply.
And without any sense of distance, close or far away, no sense of receiving or being
active. Allow there to rise some notion of care and kindness. Kindness that for now has
no object, not thinking of anybody. Just kindness which has no reference point of other people,
other places, other times. Just kindness, care, love, love within an object. Maybe love that
has no location because it's everywhere. Everywhere in the field, the range, the range of how
far away you can hear or sense or feel or imagine that love is part and parcel of whatever way,
whatever field of awareness there might be here.
And in this objectless love or care to fill it with universal goodwill for others,
may all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be peaceful,
may all beings be free, and may all beings be known peacefully within this, within the range
of awareness, within mindfulness.
Thank you.
