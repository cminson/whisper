 I'm opening this up now really for the next half hour or so just to allow you to feedback questions or comments that you may have had and I'll do my utmost to respond to them intelligently. I'm feeling very tired so may not be so intelligent. Intelligence has to come from you. And we'd like to use the mic so we'll pass it around. Okay right who wants to start? Yes lady here. I found myself thinking about capacity and whether or not do we have a relationship to capacity? Can we develop it? You know is that part of the process of well we can think of this as let's just to realize a capacity often requires that we take a risk. Like we you know I've been drawn to many things in my life and let's say for example okay just to give a totally here and now type example I've always been drawn towards film, movies. I've always wanted you know at least a fantasy part of myself has also wouldn't it be great to write for cinema and create a movie. So this we all have the capacity I'm sure to do that but it requires to actually actualize that capacity requires that on the one hand you affirm the value of what it is that you seek to do. On the other hand you also have to override all of the resistance you have to doing it. And in the case of the movies you know I've got to a point in my life where I don't have anything else particular to do. I had an idea for film so now I'm figuring out how to do it. I'm writing a screenplay at the moment. I'm working towards writing a screenplay. So I have the capacity perhaps to write a screenplay but in order to realize that capacity not only do I have to affirm the value of it I then have to learn the various skills and tools required. It's not just a question of sort of starting to write you have to study screenwriting which I've been doing a great deal of reading screenplays getting you know educating oneself in those areas and in doing so perhaps learning what the difficulties are what how you know where you can go wrong in this. And at a given point I'm then going to have to create the time in my life where I'll say okay now I'm going to do it. And I'm not yet completed this project so I may never complete it but the fact is that a year ago this was just a capacity now it's becoming a reality. When you raise that question it also made me think of a very dear friend of mine who's now retired. He's Swiss he lives in Switzerland. He's about 80 years old and he was a professor of radiology at a university hospital in Switzerland very successful career and but when he was training as an intern in radiology he was in New York in the early 1950s 1951 52 and by chance he stumbled across lectures on on Buddhism which were given by DT Suzuki and Columbia University which are now sort of one of the key moments in the transmission of Buddhism to the west and you know John Cage was there this is a very very hot time and Suzuki took a great liking to my friend and encouraged him to become a trainers as end priest in Japan in the early 50s and my friend said he thought about it he really wanted to do it but he said no I can't do that I have to I have to become a radiologist and he became a very successful radiologist immensely success successful very honored in a very fine career but now when he looks back on his life he says you know I had the chance to do that and I didn't do it and he regrets that now he took the safe route he took the route of a good conventional Swiss person would take you know nice secure career in radiology but there's a part of himself a capacity that was opened up in those times that he never really fulfilled and he and he now somehow looks back on his life and and that's an area in which he feels you know he he didn't really respond to something very deep within him and he regrets that so yeah we have capacities I don't think capacities are themselves developed it's more the fact that we have to at a given point in our life risk following those intuitions those feelings of what we could be what we could do what we could become and sometimes casting all hesitation to the wind doing something which may be judged to be foolhardy irresponsible in more or less what my family said to me when I became a monk you know they were horrified right but now of course now that I can register achievements on their scales of success and I publishing books being on the radio traveling around the world then of course Buddhism is now fine but but there was an enormous impediment from their side not that I sought their approval to pursue this this capacity in my life but we also have to be realistic I mean I would like to win Wimbledon but I'm I'm the thing I'm sensible enough to realize that I don't stand a you know dogs chance in hell so I'm not going to try and realize that capacity maybe I don't have that capacity I certainly don't now there's no way I could beat Andy Roddick or but but I think that's part of the practice in a way you know this is this practice is when you sit in meditation and when you open yourself up like this you also begin to open up to an awareness of what it is that you intuitively and most deeply feel your life could be or what it could become or what you might do and that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to become a monk or a nun but it might mean that you might choose to you know be a poet or an artist or whatever it is I don't think one should privilege certain things over others but to realize a capacity requires often taking a rather scary leap in the dark we need the microphone I intuitively feel that we are endowed with inborn capacity for awakens as well as a capacity for not seeking for safety and security and you seem to say we also I wonder you saying it's we are also the born with a capacity to make a decision ability to making a risky decision to which way we want to go is that the right way to look at it yes I we have it I think we all have a capacity to you know take difficult decisions but I don't think any of us has the capacity to know whether that's the right decision or the wrong decision that's the problem we would love to know before we make these leaps in the dark exactly what's going to happen after we've made that choice but we can never know that I don't think okay we might throw the eching or have a horoscope reading or do anything to kind of try to give us the security that this decision will be the good one my sense is that part of the very nature of that kind of decision-making is being willing to engage in a risk and not know the outcome a lot of people are drawn to meditation because they they come at it at a point of crisis in their lives or crossroads and they think that well if I could look deep and hard enough inside my mind then I would know at some point exactly what it is I should do I'll be able to resolve this this lobjam this vacillation this uncertainty and some little inner voice will say you should do X there may be there are stories of people to whom that happens like mother Teresa for about how and he was sitting on a train in Yugoslavia somewhere and then she just had this flash which she interpreted as divine to go and help the poor so she did it and that those I think are very moving stories and very wonderful but I think they're probably the exceptions that prove the rule namely that we do not probably have sufficient certainty in any choice we make as to the outcome of it and we are as it were just challenged to act rather than to not act a lot of people I know who use meditation to try to make decisions like that very often find that instead of getting clearer about what they want to do they find that their indecision is just magnified it's like putting a magnifying glass onto their own uncertainty and you just feel more paralyzed you realize how profoundly undecided you are but at a given point I think it's far better to act and then subsequently say actually that was a mistake than to not act at all and just remain as it were confined within one's own uncertainty yes this lady and then this lady and then this gentleman well I was a little confused by two different metaphors for the Mara nature to me when you use words like barren you know first of all that tends to be very negative but they also speak to an inability in the individual themselves to be able to do something while as the images of the demons outside is an external image that you may have the capacity to deal with or not deal with and I'm curious whether you think of that as more of an external or an internal thing well I don't actually well both the certainly the language of Mara as somehow attacking one or Jung's idea of the neuroses as autonomous complexes is purely a kind of figurative language of course these things are internal that they're part of oneself but then somehow not integrated into the structure of your consciousness in other words they appear they feel as though they break in and the part of the the pro process of of the cultivation of awareness or consciousness or mindfulness is actually to extend the field of one's awareness so that we are more and more including and embracing all aspects of ourselves I think there's a part of ourselves as part of our psychology very often to dis identify with certain feelings and emotions that we can't accept within ourselves and then we try to sort of block them out we try to repress them and so on and so as Freud and others have shown they almost invariably come back in in another form I found someone cited to me a passage from gospel of st. Matthew the other day and I can't quote it verbatim and I don't have the text to have anyone have a bible maybe not but there's a beautiful passage where Christ says something to the effect that you know if you if you get rid of one demon from your one unclean spirit he says from your house then the unclean spirit will wander around the earth in seeking nourishment not finding it he will then return to your house with seven other unclean spirits and I like that idea because it again suggests that mara is not overcome by just sort of casting him out but actually by learning to say this is my nature that this is the stuff of my existence that fear and and aggression and and all these things are not different from what I am they are capacities likewise they perhaps originate from ones from our evolutionary past but they're very much integral to one's being so the thing with mara whether it's in buddhist or as I just cited that passage from the gospels there seems to be in the utilizing of figurative language of metaphorical language like thinking of mara as some sort of personified being who interacts with buddha there's a if you take that literally then I think you actually create a big problem but if you take it as a mythic language then you can learn to value how that sort of those sort of images communicate a richness and a complexity of our experience that analytical discourse fails to catch so I found a great deal of a great richness in these dialogues between the buddha and mara which I haven't found in these highly precise abidamic this is a form of buddhist philosophy buddhist scholars again monks tended to um unpack mara and reduce him to psychological functions on one level but in any case to to somehow break him up in a way that would then by be more intellectually intelligible so you get a doctrine of mara you get the doctrine of the four or sometimes the five maras which is conceptually very useful but it lacks that sort of language however conceptually precise it might be fails to capture the tricksterish quixotic voice that you hear in the dialogues that somehow speaks to us in a more total way and in a way that we can't necessarily reduce to theory but a way that we can hear and perhaps relate to with the whole of ourselves it's you know it's the same with uh you know when you see a very powerful play or or read a very moving novel um what is communicated is often some very deep truths about your own experience but there's no way you can you can uh repeat you can express the truths of that novel or that play in an abstract way there's something about the literature itself or the the form of theater itself that has is a medium of expression that has its own peculiar way of communicating something that mere theorizing cannot so buddhism i think sort of oscillates between these two sides um and i think we just have to learn to differentiate between when an expression is being used metaphorically and when it's perhaps being used more literally now i think you can see mara as an external um uh you know a force from outside um i mean a very simple example would be um we could not be if we lived in in iran we couldn't be doing this we couldn't be having this discussion we couldn't meet in a group like this we wouldn't have access to buddhist texts in other words our ability to pursue this interest would actually be curtailed by the uh religious law that operates in that particular islamic country or under soviet communism it doesn't doesn't i'm not trying to say anything against islam but the point is there can be forms of society forms of politics um perhaps also forms of sheer poverty i mean in african village also the sheer pressures to simply survive would preclude um are being able to talk about buddha nature it wouldn't it just wouldn't have a role in that society so so mara we can also extend to anything that somehow stands in our way of realizing what we value what we consider to be good how we may evolve and develop as individuals and that can come you know from external forces as well as it can from internal forces um but i think we need the the important point is is is to is to recognize metaphor when it's being used metaphorically and not to literalize them so intimidating i had a question just about perception shifting perception and you were talking about um sort of the structure of the organism like changing maybe the structure of the organism to allow a shift possibly in perception i understood you correctly something along those lines yes i mean is that is um what allows for a shift in perception what what can one do to what can one do to shift well um well the example i gave of the fellow who's in the office and not doing his job well in order to shift the perception all we needed was a brief bit of information and that's often the case um we just have to learn something be told something and suddenly we look at it in a totally different way and it's kind of it's kind of surprising that because you know when we um you know we so what we seem to do so readily is that we very quickly form an opinion about a situation or a person for example we meet someone we don't know and there may be something about that person that reminds us of someone else we didn't like or you know how it is you meet someone and you immediately go don't quite not feel comfortable with this person and what we do then is immediately kind of go okay that's then we've now defined them on the basis of an extremely limited encounter as being a particular way now we might do this i mean this is what happens in racism for example or any kind of sort of gender or or religious stereotyping we so easily and so this is mara very much at work how without consciously wanting to think a particular way about something we find ourselves locked into a perception of let's say you know nowadays i think muslims have a hard time because as soon as you're done and defined as a muslim the person will go oh right people who fly planes into sky skyscrapers it's it's a terrible thing and yet it's such an endemic function of our mind but all it is is perception it's the way perception is just a way of talking about how we um how we ascribe meaning to our experience in other words what we see is organized and rendered meaningful by a highly complex cognitive operations that are rooted in the brain in our education in our culture when i look at that word up there for example amata datu it it you know it looks as though the word actually is jumping out from the wall amata datu if i were a chinese native speaker and never learned the roman alphabet that that would be just a bunch of squiggles on the wall in other words every situation we come into we immediately um uh identify it recognize it and organize it configure it in terms of our perceptual habits which are likewise informed by our religious our cultural our social conditioning and upbringing and so on and thereby the world appears to us as having as already saturated with meanings but those meanings are not given in the world they're given by us and therefore what buddhist practice could perhaps be thought of is learning to uh give to the world another meaning the meanings that in a way instinctively come at us from the world is that the world is more or less fixed things are more or less the same all the time if we identify a person as of a particular religious or ethnic identity that we have an aversion towards they're stuck in that and thereby the world somehow seems to us to be composed of fixed discrete more or less constant units and things now this is something that goes very deep and buddhist practice and perhaps all spiritual practice at one level is it begins to attract us when we begin to think well do we have to see the world this way particularly when we have experiences that show suddenly that the world is not actually that way for example when someone very close to us suddenly dies in a motor car accident or something like that why we i think we're shocked about that or we find that very difficult to process or handle a sudden death of a friend for example because that it completely undermines our assumption a deep-seated perceptual assumption of the world being more or less fixed in place suddenly a crucial element of it is taken out and it's very interesting when a person like that dies how you know you wake up the next morning and you you're immediately thinking about that person as though they were still alive you can't quite you you know there's this whole psychological you know psychotherapeutic process and how to help us do that but what it shows is the extent to which our perceptual conditioning defines our world in a way that's very makes it very real for us the buddhist were the one of the key things the buddhist was that the origin of a great deal of our suffering emerges because we misperceive things so he i mean the classic formulation is that we take the impermanent to be permanent the suffering to be happiness and the selfless to be self vipassana meditation is a systematic attempt to inverse that process so we systematically pay attention to the impermanence of things the unreliability of things the selflessness of things now what that and the reason you need to do that over time rather than just believing it which is easy is because you are working with deeply embedded perceptual habits and so to change perception at that level requires i feel the sorts of disciplines that one works on in meditation practice or particularly say on a retreat but really it's a long-term commitment to a certain way of seeing things and again the effects are not necessarily immediately forthcoming in that process you may have to work quite hard for a long time my own sense i mean i've been working with this stuff now for maybe 30 odd years i think it has had a quite a considerable effect i i'm so saturated with the idea of impermanence for example and all of these key buddhist ideas that i think they're actually now more and more and more becoming just part of my perceptual apparatus more so certainly than they would have been in the past and i find that kind of weirdly liberating in a way but it does take effort it does take commitment it does take time and mara which is a way of talking about the psychophysical organism as given is resisting this all the time the mara nature is one that that doesn't want the world to be broken down from its apparently fixed manageable convenient things and objects so we're i mean the buddhist said at one point he says there's nothing there is no power in the world equal to the power of mara that mara is is the most powerful force that is that one works against and i think again i would argue that the reason for that is because these the the mara habits are actually deeply embedded in the structure of our neurobiology that's my my sense on that one this gentleman had a question then we'll move around here yeah i think you already answered my question kind of two questions back but i'll proceed anyway um so the other night at black oak i was asking you that issue of buddha mara kind of the dichotomy and is the is the you know the power in the mara you remember that question um so today you're talking about capacity and buddha nature and it led me in a similar direction of thinking about identity and this also relates to kind of eastern models and western models so thinking this week about marla marando and you know in one way i'm thinking if he was in the zen hall i would go with an arrogant guy he is you know but and maybe i would judge him for his ego that could be some kind of false eastern way to look at it but i'm not you know i was looking at marlon brando and the qualities he had of rebelliousness and this and that and now i'm looking at the buddha statue and kind of right now going well you know what i think right now i'd like to be marlon brando so it's in in my question is the fear of a kind of asian normalizing or leveling that we all our boot we would all become this same kind of buddha thing and uh you know so wonder if you have any comments on identity and you know marlon brando and my one question that you could answer is where again were those mara dialogues what texts oh okay well let's do okay the easy question is the last one they're they're in um well there's the dialogues of mara occur right through the pali canon but there is a very there's one section in the sanjuta nikaya which is translated in english as the connected discourses of the buddha in two volumes by wisdom publications in samovil in massachusetts volume one about pages 100 to 200 there is a section called the mara sanjuta in other words the connected discourses with mara there are about 30 or 40 episodes connected together and that's a major source but there are many others probably an equivalent number of other passages elsewhere in the canon but you can find that out if you just look up the index and look for mara the um the other question there about identity um remember that the buddha in the early buddhist tradition there was a refusal to depict the buddha in a human form and i think that probably does have to do with a certain sense of identity in other words it's so easy once you have something like this to think oh the buddha's like that and all of the associations both the skills of the different artisans and craftspeople and the iconographic tradition that then emerges around that allow us to think of buddha in a kind of anthropomorphic way as being a particular kind of person as it were and i think that's useful but i think it's also in a way perhaps equally problematic i'm particularly keen on the early an iconic tradition of buddhist art precisely because it it allows us to think of our identity as an open possibility rather than anything that a fixed state at which we might arrive now that doesn't mean that there wasn't an iconography before the buddha image was developed and there was there's a pre-iconic buddhist art this went on for about 500 years no buddha images no buddha statues but the buddha was represented by an empty throne or footprints or a tree the body tree in other words as an empty space as a space that had gone on that a person who had left a trace but was no longer there it was actually under the influence of the greek communities in india that the buddha image first arose when the greeks were cut off from their sources of culture in athens and greece they then sort of they had no choice really but to become part of the indigenous indian culture they converted to buddhasim as a rule largely because i think they had no option to joining the caste system it's not something you sign up for and to represent the buddha they then envisaged him in the form of the god apollo if you go to the asian art museum here in san francisco you can see some early gandharan buddhist imagery in which you see these buddha images that look like greek gods it's quite amazing but of course what has happened is that you know this is a long way from a greek god this has evolved and changed and so i have an ambivalent relationship to around icons i would rather like a return to that pre-iconic imagery i think it's very powerful very powerful and it gets us out of this problem of ascribing and fixing identities to such images but again i think probably if we didn't have any buddha images we'd still have you know people like with dalai lama and others who again would somehow be a buddhist identity we can never get around that entirely actually if you remember in some asian buddhist traditions in shrillanka i think maybe in bharma when the monks give dharma talks they cover their face with a fan so there's no this sort of impersonal thing um but i think if i did that here you probably wouldn't uh it wouldn't go for it much but it's probably again it's an attempt to somehow depersonalize de-identify with the figure of a teacher or a monk or whatever and um the ill i mean marlin brando of course is a kind of iconic figure in in in in 20th century culture his his face the roles he's played you know we identify with that we're we're drawn to that we empathize with it we somehow see that as a kind of role model and i think all cultures have to have role models probably probably but at the same time i think a religious tradition can also um you know maintain a certain weariness and caution about identifying too readily and too uncritically with such figures yes oh you were first okay microphone well last night i was watching um flamenco dancers on television i don't know if anyone caught that show but um and i noticed it's sort of related to the marlin brando thing because i noticed that at one point the fat singer okay the singers are tend to be not they're not they're the dancers they're the singers they're the guitar players the singers are the clappers too and so the singers are very erotic you know they're not dancers and the dance and everything the whole nature of flamenco dancing the gypsy culture is very erotic and i notice that everybody participates everybody's involved in it and and you're you're you're watching everybody you're not just watching the dancers at one point the heavy set woman i'm not saying fat is bad but it's just in in juxtaposition to the thin beautiful exotic comes on the stage and starts clapping and dancing with this gorgeous you know woman and it's extremely sensual and beautiful and everybody is the whole audience is involved in and it's it made me feel and i i was writing at that time and just kind of seeing that everything is so interconnected in this in this cultural kind of sharing of everybody together doing this thing and and i and i find that you know you know we're all sitting here and you know we're all kind of doing this this one thing and and relating to the marlin brando thing you know the reason i relate to marlin brando and relate to rebellious figures and relate to gypsy music is because specifically because it is not a static thing to have it is sort of the mara yet the the excitement of mara you know and at one point there was this guy dancing and he was completely showing off and they were encouraging him to show off it was the opposite of the fan no fan it's like i am going to be as erotic and as amazing as possible and everybody's going to look at me and it made me excited you know to i just curious what you're talking about you know well i would be very careful now it's a good it's a good point the you see i think buddhist tradition probably like all traditions has it's not reducible to a kind of stasis a kind of static but that does seem to be you know a kind of very common image that buddhist the people who sit still and close their eyes and you know don't do anything particularly erotic that that's for sure meditation is not a big turn on in that sense but you also find that buddhist tradition has generated an extraordinary you know profusion of art and literature and poetry and so forth and so on which is very very very playful and very very dynamic and i remember again and again i remember again in when i was in korea in the monastery there our zen master had a birthday party and all of the kids from the villages and everybody came and everyone was dancing and everything it was really very very very dynamic and rich so i think really the um i think it's a little simplistic to you know to sort of split you know to think of this in purely black and white terms but the um you know i get frustrated with buddhist and sometimes as being a bit stuffy as a bit sort of static as a bit kind of unworldly as a bit you know the monks are not allowed to participate in dance or music or anything like that and so you get the sense that that stuff somehow somehow bad but you also get periods in buddhist history where that kind of you know moralistic maybe rather rigid strict way of doing things becomes unsustainable and you in it generates a kind of a backlash it generates a rebellion and you and i think in early zen is a very good example of that the the early zen monks deliberately behaved in a way that somehow was making fun almost or being very disrespectful of that rather strict severe ascetic morality of the monasteries and in india this i think it was even more pronounced in the movements of the tundrick tradition that emerged around the fifth sixth seventh centuries where a lot of people had had been monks you know abandoned the monastic life returned to the lay life did kind of outrageous things and wrote about their buddhist understandings in often very explicitly erotic ways but of course what happens is that that tends as the as that teaching becomes somehow you know institutionalized then it kind of closes down again but what i find interesting with the buddha metaphor is that buddha does i think if mara is death i think of mara really as restriction and closure and a kind of paralysis and i think of buddha as really what a life that is that unfolds when those inhibitions and paralysis fall away now that doesn't mean that one just somehow gives free rein to every impulse and desire and fantasy that comes that's clearly not what's meant but nonetheless it is an affirmation i feel of the spiritual practice being one that leads you into a fuller and richer engagement with your creative potential of your life and i would very much and for example this movie i'm making that's something or this screenplay i'm writing is is to me a very exciting process that leads me to work with imagery with drama with tragedy with lots of action and and to me that in a way speaks the truth of the buddhist tradition in a way that i think sometimes gets suffocated by an excess of doctrine and dogma and yet of course there are extremes either way i mean the buddhist idea is always somehow to hold a balance between between all polarities really and of course at times when we feel trapped then we we yearn for a kind of outburst of release and of dancing and all of that stuff but on the other hand very many people i think come to meditation precisely because they they experience an excess of the other two you see they need stillness calm focus clarity you know you know the hippies in the 60s you see a lot of them were really into all that stuff and yet many of them then many of my generation you see that came out of the sort of Dionysian excess of the 60s ended up you know in buddhist monasteries and likewise perhaps as we move out of that we move back into another engagement with the world i think it's i see it very much as a rhythm rather than i think rather than thinking well it should be like this or it should be like that and again if you look at the history of buddhist cultures you see an enormous diversity and richness and change and flow and so on periods of exuberance periods of introversion and so it's that whole patterning it's the flamenco dancing but also the absolutely solitary still monastic contemplative they're both necessary parts of the grand drama of life thank you you have a question yes and then this lady i wonder if you've encountered the dialogue that's been taking place in japan and over the last few years or debate over whether buddha nature is buddhist oh i've heard of this i've not been following it could you could you sum up some of the points there it's quite interesting there's a couple of japanese rather provocative japanese scholars have written something about this right ishi shudo has challenged the philosophy of nishida kitaro my god and several hundred years of maijana tradition of course uh one way to frame the issue that might go to the duality of buddha nature versus morrow nature uh would be to look at whether or not um our inherent ability for enlightenment uh glosses over some of some of the behaviors that have taken place in the buddhist context i think everyone's school has encountered some issue and it's not particular to the japanese school the soda school that it came out of although um for example uh i think uh the soda school for example has apologized for it the role that it played in the war in the war um maybe i'll shift it just a little bit okay i think of you a certain way as a part of a number of writers and speakers yourself brian victoria um ishi shudo um david brazier um david brazier what you have in common is you've all been labeled heretics and you have something uh you've challenged a certain static position about about buddhism how does it feel to be a heretic um well first of all let's think what heretic actually means at root heretic comes from the greek heresias i think which means to make a choice a heretic is a person in other words who chooses to think other wise than the orthodoxy so for me i mean heresy is again one of these horribly loaded words that it's very difficult to somehow celebrate being a heretic without that being a terribly kind of uh self-indulgent kind of thing um but what does it feel like to be taken to task well i've often been condemned as someone who's no longer buddhist you've seen i can't be a buddhist because i don't believe in a b c d or e um and that um is both um you know that is a very challenging thing to be said because i do think of myself as a buddhist i feel myself very much rooted in a buddhist tradition that i've been admittedly i was not born a buddhist but nonetheless my whole adult life has been within a buddhist framework i've trained as a monk and a priest and so on the um so when someone says i i'm not a buddhist um you know i i feel that um um well it forces me to then ask the question well if i am a buddhist what does that mean for me and i guess all of my writing is a way of trying to articulate that um i certainly don't like being um i don't think anybody likes being condemned it's not a i i i i wish that didn't happen but on the other hand it perhaps gives me at times a sense of of clarity about where my deepest convictions lie and um a willingness um maybe even a sense of of mission in a sense to to communicate that but you see as a heretic let's say i'm a heretic you get it you get you get you get thing you get you get feedback from both sides i get far more feedback from people who write to me almost on i say a weekly basis saying i read your book x um this was the first book on buddhism that ever made any sense to me um i've been thinking these things all along or some people will say i've been in you know in my buddhist group belonging to llama x or roshi y uh we were looking at your book and so many of us felt that this is actually what we felt we think all along but would not not allowed to say so i'm aware of the fact that in in in broaching these ideas in raising these questions in articulating these doubts i'm actually speaking on behalf of a much wider community of people who in a sense perhaps do not feel uh either willing or able to articulate themselves as they really feel now that's very affirming you see at the same time i also get flack although a lot of this flack actually comes in a rather sort of insidious stabbing in the back kind of fashion on the internet there's very what i what i feel disappointed by is that you know i've made these comments about rebirth and reincarnation in one of my books but no orthodox buddhist has published as it were uh or has attempted to write or persuade uh a readership um of the other point of view i mean why aren't the books out there somehow you know demonstrating how central and how important and how true rebirth and karmara that they remain silent you see and yet so the attacks are very often um you know often behind the back and that i don't like if you go to the bookstore there's all these refutations of the da Vinci code there are a lot of the da Vinci of the da Vinci code there aren't i agree there aren't a lot of refutations of uh of what you've had to say just rumblings uh count me in as among those who find it um it's you're among those who make it possible for for me to be engaged in this well thank thank you very much i mean that that is the sort of thing that makes my work worthwhile to hear that thank you uh this lady in pink and then the fellow behind her i think it works if you put the microphone um i have a three-part question okay the first part um which i thought you were saying when you were talking about buddha nature or buddha womb was that the buddha womb is our physiological being in our you know circumstance here yes and it seemed even though you didn't say it that it only would make sense that the buddha womb is the mara womb it's the same yeah yeah and and as much as you talked about mara being something that shuts you down the implication it seemed to me was that they really weren't separate that's correct yes absolutely so maybe i just didn't hear you say that explicitly yeah well that's what i meant this organism i gave the example of the valve a valve can be shut or a valve can be opened there's no difference in the valve in being shut or being open it's a different modality of a single thing right but i thought the implication was that it's maybe i'm projecting it seemed like the implication was it's much better if it's open but from what you were saying it seemed like to function well it had to open and close oh i see what you mean well the reality is you see okay this does bring us on to i think an important point um there could be no buddha without mara and not just in a you know in a kind of mythological sense but if there were not restrictions if there were not limitations in our life there would be no possibility of opening up into a more unlimited perspective if there was no if there was no bondage or entrapment there would be no possibility of freedom if there was no confusion or chaos or delusion there'd be no possibility of enlightenment or awakening you can't have one without the other and our actual moment to moment experience is one in which both of these are necessarily operative the danger is when you we hive off buddha nature as some kind of privileged bit failing to see that what a capacity is always entails um what it always entails being able to somehow work within the hesitations and the limitations that prevent you from working with the capacity that the capacity or the potential is always within a restrictive condition otherwise we you know we just do it so in that sense i'm trying to suggest in this book particularly the buddha and mara enlightenment delusion these things are just two parts of the same process and we have a freedom we have a capacity to to go one way or the other and if we value such things as love as wisdom of freedom then from a buddhist perspective at least this means seeking to optimize that mark that buddha capacity and not to succumb or give in to that closure that resistance to the realization of such values but all of that is operating you see conceptually we inevitably make distinctions that are not um reducible to some actual thing in the world or some state of being and yet words inevitably draw lines across this seamless fabric of life the practice operates within the within the realm of life but life again you see is inseparable from death if we think of buddha as life and we think of mara as death then just like life and death you cannot have one without the other life is what it is for us because it is um it is moving inexorably towards its own end that is what life is if we were immortal we wouldn't feel about our lives as we do now again it's probably unconscious largely but the very value we have of life is precisely because we instinctively and intuitively know that it will end mara is the end buddha i would understand to be um the realization of what life can be at at its best these are metaphors but the process i think will always entail both and in that that that sense we have to be sort of grateful to mara as it were um the other thing that came up for me um and this emerges a lot when i'm listening to people are reading um that um when i was listening to your ideas about buddha womb and you know i was very taken by them or they were appealing to me and so in a sense you know wouldn't they be the little fish hooks that you're talking about that i cohere around yes and fix around but then okay so i i enjoy those ideas they for me they in a way they aren't opening but that opening is maybe a official well this is the problem you see the there is nothing in the world that cannot become a function of mara a there's a passage of lynchie that i quote in here he says if you desire buddha then you are caught in the grip of the buddha mara he uses that expression uh if i can find it i can never find things doesn't matter but that's what that is a very telling quote um you can look at how the notion of i mean the story of teh shan another zen master chinese who became who started out life as the as the great buddhist defender of the doctor of emptiness and anybody who's the pronounced any teaching that was in contradiction to his understanding of shunyata that person had to be condemned in other words you can turn anything into a form of tyranny even the most enlightened thing the buddha the emptiness freedom all of these can be used as as ways to oppress others who don't hold your views for example so you can take any idea and it will have potential within it both to free you or to bind you any doctrine any teaching any term any word is both potentially liberating and potentially uh entrapping and that is the nature of the conditioned world it's the nature of life and the thing to the the practice is very much learning to to work and live with that rather than trying to hive off those acceptable parts of yourself and demonize the others or the acceptable parts of our society and demonize the others the the mara power runs through everything maybe we were running out of time we could just shift back to this fellow here and then i'd like this to be the last question then i'd like to conclude with some silence yes okay uh since you've been labeled a heretic uh i'm curious of your ideas of reincarnation and uh and if reincarnation is true um as some groups state that one of the greatest things possible is being born a human and that only in the human life can you realize all of this so if that's true how come uh humans can also uh give out so much pain and violence and destruction if they're the most you know the highest group of people in the universe well let's leave reincarnation out of this i'm i'm i'm somewhat agnostic i'm agnostic about that it's not an issue that i think is really important um in fact to be quite honest i would go further than that i don't believe in reincarnation rebirth same thing i don't believe in that either i don't think i think that's a semantic distinction that you don't find in the classical texts i think it's very unlikely you can't disprove it but i think the weight of the weight of what we now know about the way in which human beings and other forms of all of sentient life have emerged through the processes of natural selection don't really leave any room for a kind of disembodied consciousness that somehow inhabits the organism and then passes on i think that's a relic of an animistic way of thinking so no i don't believe in any of that stuff but i do believe in karma you see i do believe that the actions that we do will have an impact after our death i think that's self-evident to be honest i don't think it's a great revelation in other words our responsibility is not just for our world now or our our circles of friendship our community our responsibility is just as much for those who will inhabit this earth after our death and i don't think you can actually have a truly engaged vuddhism if you if you persist in holding out the the the the opt out of okay if we mess if we destroy this planet we'll get reborn somewhere else if you think that then i think you'll never be totally committed to working with what is calling for our attention and care and survival on this world this world as far as i know as far as any of us know may have be the only world like this that has ever been and that ever will be and i think it's crucially important in our times that we cultivate a spirituality that is utterly secular in other words of this world and that means that our actions need to be considered in terms both individually and collectively of the consequences that they will bear on those who will live after our death those who will continue to have it inhabit this world now human beings in the traditional buddhist theory are considered to be the only forms of life although sometimes they'll say some of the lower devas can do it but basically the human being is considered to be a highly precious occasion short-lived but one in which there is sufficient leisure sufficient freedom to be able to see clearly what's going on and not be compelled to live a life of just foraging for food for example but it's also a life in which there is significant degree of of anguish of suffering of pain in which we can begin to in which we don't lapse into a kind of complacency and in which we begin to ask deeper questions as to what this life could be about and for that reason the human rebirth is considered to be a kind of crucial kind of occasion or opportunity in which we can rise beyond we rise above our purely instinctive nature and reach heights of cultural and spiritual insight and understanding and of course though no buddhist teacher would be so naive as to think that human beings are not capable of extraordinary acts of violence, destruction, evil and so on I mean this is self evident but it's the freedom of the human being in a way that allows those possibilities you see we can construct worlds like Stalin and Hitler constructed or we can try to create a pure land on earth we have the freedom we have the possibility the capacity to do either and that I think therein lies I think the what is peculiar about humanity is the fact of our self-referential awareness and consciousness that is able to somehow not be totally tied to sheer physical survival but to inhabit a history to inhabit a potential future to participate in worlds of meaning and culture all of that gives us this curious capacity to create a world to create a kind of being of ourselves that is not given purely by our biological reality
