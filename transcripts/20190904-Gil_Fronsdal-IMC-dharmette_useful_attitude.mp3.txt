The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, a huge part of meditation is the attitude with which we meditate.
Some people get caught up in the technique or the idea of what they're supposed to attain
before they've kind of established a useful attitude about how to be here with their stuff.
Some people bring with them all kinds of attitudes which are habits that they have,
attitudes which they've somehow cultivated, received, lived with for maybe a lifetime.
So, some of these attitudes, the attitudes like this, I'm being asked to do something
and I have to succeed and I can't fail.
Some people, it's the attitude that there's something fundamentally wrong with me
and maybe meditation is going to fix it, but I'm so wrong that it's probably not going to do anything for me.
There's kind of this background kind of attitude that just kind of lingers there.
So, a long list probably of attitudes.
So, sometimes it's useful when we meditate to actively reframe the attitude in which we're going to meditate,
to actually think about meditation, not just kind of show up for meditation with all the old habits and attitudes
as if that's kind of second nature and they just come along, of course that should be that way,
but actually consider a little bit what would be a useful attitude to have when you sit down to meditate.
So, one of them which I mentioned earlier is the idea that when you sit down to meditate, you're in your safe place.
You're safe.
I think it's kind of like in Monopoly.
Isn't there home in Monopoly?
You know, you get all the way around, you come to home and at home no one can get you,
no one can do the Monopoly thing with you.
You can't go to jail, you can't, whatever.
When you're in the home, you're really safe.
So, when you sit down to meditate, it's your safe place.
So, that's an attitude.
Here, now I'm safe, this is good.
But part of that is the idea that something's wrong with me and all the different variations of that can be not good enough or something.
That meditation is a time to assume that you are good enough.
That who you are and the way that you are is fine, that you're allowed to be yourself.
That this is the one place where you're allowed to be yourself.
And if you sit down to meditate and you're enraged in a way that most of your friends and family would be horrified to know,
when you sit down to meditate, you're allowed to be that way.
Because in meditation, you're not going to hurt anyone.
You're not going to say anything or do anything.
You probably should not be planning revenge in meditation.
But to simply allow how you are to be there as if this time, this safe place, I'm allowed to be this way if you're afraid.
Or if you, whatever way you are, this is a time you can assume that you're okay.
Almost like assume there is no problem here with me.
Occasionally we meet people who treat us that way.
And I'll tell you a little story from yesterday that was a little bit inspired this idea.
I met this woman who said, earlier in the conversation, said she was really practicing now to learn to accept all people.
And this is a person who has a background or in our society would generally not be accepted by a good percentage of people in our society.
That's just how the person walks in.
A lot of people wouldn't.
Enough people wouldn't.
But her practice was to accept everyone.
So she said that earlier in the conversation.
Someone else in the group commented about her clothes, how wonderful her clothes were.
And they were rather flamboyant.
And then I said, and I'm just, I wear kind of boring, as a Norwegian, I wear kind of boring clothes.
And she looked at me in the most kind of kind, generous, simple, relaxed way and said,
you're wearing the clothes that are just perfect for you.
And I realized that I had just put myself down a little bit.
Maybe I was trying to maybe be socially doing something and make her more comfortable.
I don't know what I was trying to do.
And she kind of looked at me like, you don't have to do that.
That's your way. This is how you are.
And I thought, wow, that was pretty cool.
She's practicing her acceptance right here.
So the attitude of sitting down and offering that to yourself.
Start as if there's actually nothing wrong with you.
If there happens to be something wrong with you,
you're probably giving yourself lots of time and practice to believe that, to think that.
You're allowed to not do that nonstop.
You're allowed to sit as if there's nothing wrong.
And if what's happening are tears, what's happening is joy.
If what's happening in your mind is racing and you're thinking a lot.
The kind of mind which most people would think is not a meditative mind.
It's not calm.
Maybe you don't have to fight that or see that as wrong.
That's how it is now. This is what's happening now.
This is how your life is now.
This is your way now.
And that attitude that you have, there's nothing wrong with you.
And this is just what's happening.
This is what's happening for you now.
It's like there's no mistakes.
This is what the deal is for me now.
Hold it as if this is what's supposed to happen.
It's going to be kind of like someone coming up to you
and just unconditionally caring for you and loving you for the way you are
and something inside of you relaxes.
Something softens.
The defensiveness.
They're trying to prove ourselves.
They're trying to fight against ourselves.
Like I had yesterday, this woman said,
The way you're dressed is just you're away.
And I kind of was delighted by this.
I was kind of like, wow, this was cool.
And so something can shift and move and unfold and heal
with the attitude of there's nothing wrong with me.
This is the way I am.
This is my way.
This is my functioning in this particular time and place.
This is my way of suffering.
And now this is, you know, okay, I've heard that people suffer
and this is my way.
Then hold that and be with that.
If you can cultivate that kind of attitude,
then it can be much more appropriate or easy or useful
to maybe try to cultivate more stability in practice
or try to get more focused or try to do loving kindness practice
or to kind of, you know, engage in what you call maybe a technique
of meditation practice.
But the technique is really on a foundation that actually
I don't have to be successful in this meditation.
I don't have to do it right.
Even if I don't do it right, it's, well, I guess it's just my way.
And I'll learn and practice and find my way.
And so with that kind of attitude, there's also a good,
there's a little bit of, you know, learning from that,
what it's like and learning then, you know,
how to navigate your inner life in such a way that you're more relaxed
and not fighting it, not struggling with it, not holding on,
not giving in to some of the habits of mind and attitudes
which are actually hurting you.
But not because you're fighting them on conflict with them.
It's because you see what you're doing and you hold it
in a kind way and accepting way.
Oh, this is how it is now.
There's nothing wrong here.
It is just a little bit weird, maybe.
But, you know, we're all odd.
So it was just kind of, okay, this is how it is now.
So you don't have to go into meditation
to sit down to meditate
and carry with you, maybe unconsciously,
all the regular attitudes about life and yourself
that you carry with you through your life
often kind of unrelectively.
You can sit down and consider what would be a wise attitude
to have here, to meet here.
And then what's a wise attitude to have
that is not going to be in conflict with all the other attitudes.
And one of the attitudes I'm proposing here
is the attitude that there's nothing wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with what's happening right now.
And then with that foundation, maybe you could start meditating
and opening and relaxing with what's here
and find your way forward.
And in any case, it's probably true
that there's a lot less wrong with you than you realize.
It's probably true that you're much more beautiful
and precious than you realize.
So may you relax.
