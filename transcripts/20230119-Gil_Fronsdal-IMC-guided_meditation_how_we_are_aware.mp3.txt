 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello and welcome. And welcome to a meditation session. Welcome to yourself. May you welcome yourself here in the meditation we're doing. And perhaps this expression of welcoming yourself is relatively novel in the context of meditation. So it represents a reframing, a kind of like a little switch in the mind. Oh, something a little different than business as usual, activity of the mind as usual, a kind of different perspective. And in doing meditation, it's often useful to put a question mark after any kind of common way and perspective in which we see our lives, to see things in a new way. And one of the interesting analogies for this is some of you might have had the experience of driving a car, maybe driving long distance, and so focused on the road that you don't notice that the windshield is steadily getting dirtier and dirtier. And then finally something happens, maybe a passenger points it out to you, and you shift your gaze from the road out there to the windshield itself and say, sure enough, it's quite dusty, quite dirty, and then you clean each thought the car and you clean it, and lo and behold, it's amazingly clear. So the same way in meditation, we can be so concerned with our concerns that we don't see how we're concerned. We don't see the windshield through which we are looking, the filter through which we're looking at our concerns, our challenges, what's happening for us in our lives. And that can be internally with ourselves. We could be sick or have pain, some kind of inner distress, emotional difficulty, and it could be things externally. And in no way to diminish the value and importance of these challenges, maybe because they're important, it's valuable to really be clear, understand the nature of the filter through which we're seeing. The windshield, driving safely is phenomenally important, and if the windshield is really all fogged up and dirty, maybe driving becomes dangerous. So there's a simple, but maybe not easy way of looking at this, how we are. It has to do with, is the way in which we are concerned about anything, are we harder or softer? Are we more contracted or more open? Are we more assertive, involved, entangled? Or are we more receptive, available, soft, ready? So this is something that we can feel and sense in the mind, in the mind's eye or the mind's way of perceiving. We can see that we're perceiving through a kind of hardness, through a kind of the seeing, the perception is soft. We're asserting, we're receptive, we are closed down, we're open, we are, there's an ouch in how we're aware, or there's an ah. So, in today's meditation, I'll guide you into a little bit of this attention to how we're aware, not just what we're aware of. And it begins kind of immediately, it's kind of like all of meditation in a sense can be understood as a settling opening of the how we are. So assuming a meditation posture, that the posture itself manifests a certain degree of embodied alertness, even if you're laying down, there's a way of adjusting the shoulder blades and the upper back, maybe letting shoulder blades kind of somehow let them come down the back and the chest to come out a little bit. If the feet are laid straight, pull the feet up so that your knees are up closer to the ceiling bent. And then gently closing the eyes and spending some good time at the beginning, relaxing the body. The more relaxed we can become, the clearer we can see how we are aware, how we're concerned, how we attend. So taking a few long, slow, deep breaths and relaxing on the exhale, relaxing the whole body, relaxing the mind as you exhale. Taking a few, letting your breathing return to normal and relaxing the muscles of your face. Almost as if the muscles gently fall away from the skull, softening around the shoulders, releasing the shoulders. And maybe a small adjustment in the hands where they are, their position can support softening of the shoulders. Softening the belly. And then in the most matter of fact, simple way as if nothing is wrong, notice that if your body is bracing itself or pulled in tight anywhere or activated in a kind of upward direction. And if it is on the exhale, soften all that. And then taking a look at your mind, mental activity, your thinking mind. Is that activated? Is it energetic and busy, fast thinking? Is it tight or narrow? And riding on the exhale, can you let the thinking mind soften, expand? Relaxing the source from which thinking arises. And now calmly become more fully aware of the body breathing. And notice how you're aware. Is how you're aware simple and relaxed? Or is there any strain or tightness, resistance? Any way in which you're aware, attitude with which you're aware, which has some form of ouch in it, something unpleasant. Or is there anything in how you're aware that has an awe, that is pleasant or has a good feeling? Maybe awareness feels receptive or open, soft. Maybe there's a gentleness. How you're aware is like the windshield. Any way that you're aware that has any ouch in it, any stress or strain in it, that's the dust on the windshield. Relax, soften how you're aware. See if you can feel the awe in being aware. That's not dependent on being able to stay present continuously, but is dependent on whenever you come back to being aware that you do so in an easy relaxed way, as often as you can. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. How would you characterize the way that you're aware? Is it more on the outside or on the outside? Are you aware in a way that you enjoy? If not, how can you shift how you're aware to be more enjoyable? One way to do that is to shift your attention away from your concerns, away from your attitudes. To the simplicity. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then as we come to the end of this meditation to check in with yourself again to the how you're aware. Are you aware through any filters of tension or strain or resistance, any fear or desires? And if that has to be for now, can you relax around those ways? It's okay. It's okay to be how you are. And maybe that's okayness is its own perspective, its own way of gazing upon yourself. And then in the same way to gaze upon the world, it's okay. Whatever attitude you have or reaction you have to the world, it's okay. But in that okayness, is there a softer, more receptive way of being present for the world and others? What can you learn from meditation? About a way of perceiving the world, being present for the world that is beneficial, that's generous, that allows you to see things more clearly as they are. And perhaps for that way of seeing, that way of seeing can be a channel for your goodwill, for your kindness, your care, your love. And maybe these words can carry your goodwill and love out into the world. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be safe. May all beings be free. Thank you.
