 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So someone wants to ask a Zen teacher, possibly Suzuki Roshi, what is the essential teaching of Zen? And the reply was an appropriate response. So we'll be talking this week about five Dharma resources that support our ability to meet life well, maybe to produce an appropriate response. And they're inner strengths that can rise up to meet the moment. And they come forth in happy times as well as amid suffering. But they're especially useful if we encounter something that is confusing or alarming or painful or just outside of our typical experience. So I'll name them all first. They are confidence, virtue or ethical conduct, listening and learning, generosity and letting go, and discernment. So this list of five is actually from the suttas. It appears in a variety of suttas in Pali Canon, at least 10 that I counted. And to name them in Pali, these qualities are sata, sila, sutta, chaga and panya, which will go through this week. So in these various discourses, they're not always applied in the same way. Let's say the Buddha called them types of wealth, ways of fortifying the mind, modes of spiritual growth, accomplishments and inspirations. That's kind of a range. But I like to sum up all of those diverse terms into the single term Dharma resources. So resources from which the heart draws to respond well to situations both on and off the cushion. And we can strengthen these through practice. And we can also observe how they might naturally arise to meet situations. If we're mindful, you all have the basis of mindfulness. And the stronger that they become in our heart, then the more readily available they are to meet life. So today we're talking about confidence, sata. I just watched a new film that was made about the founding of the Insight Meditation Society, IMS, which is kind of the mother institution of insight practice here in the West. I think it's fair to call it that. We have several long and long standing institutions now, but IMS was the first that was aimed at training laypeople in the practices that the founding teachers had learned in Asia. And it was formed in the late 1970s. So those founding teachers are Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, and Sharon Salzburg, and also Jacqueline Mandel was involved at the time. So, and then Joseph is kind of the one who Joseph and Sharon remained at IMS, and are the kind of grandmother and grandfather there. So what's striking about the film is how much trust and faith and confidence were needed to create IMS and the insight retreat form that we have when there was really nothing like that in the US before. These were young people in their 20s, and they had just come back from Asia, and they were buying a huge Catholic novitiary for a lot more money than they had really dealt with before. And there, you know, they came, they've been looking at a bunch of different places but they saw this one one morning, and they were pondering. Well, is this the one because it, it seemed to meet all of their needs, although it was really a lot bigger than they expected. But they thought about should we buy it. And so they, they went into the town square in Barry Massachusetts, which is where IMS is located. And they were kind of hanging around and they noticed that there was a statue in the middle of the square that had the town motto on it. The town motto for Barry is tranquil and alert. So they thought, perfect, perfect for a meditation center. Let's go for it. So they, they tried to you know they went forward they signed the forums, but they didn't have all the money for the down payment yet. So they did some fundraising, but they were still short eventually by $15,000, which was a lot of money in the mid 70s and it was a lot of money for a group of essentially hippies in their 20s. So, you know how to get $15,000, no clue, but Joseph at that time was teaching at Naropa in Colorado. And he was there for an extended period doing some classes and living in an apartment there. And a woman came to his apartment who had been to one of his classes and she said, I'm wondering what to do with some money that I inherited. It's about $15,000. What do you think I should do with it. And he said, Well, I have an idea for that. So, you know, it kind of appeared for them. And then of course so then they bought the building. I have a lot of stories today, by the way. Once they had the building they were learning to operate it and keep it going. And they found that it had three massive oil tanks in the basement, 60 feet long, and it was not even possible to remove them from the room where they were. But it turned out as they checked them that only one out of three was actually working. And so the facilities person was a little worried about this. You know how to three, three tanks only one functioning can't even really get them in or out. So he was a little bit at wit's end. And he said to Joseph, what are we going to do about these tanks and you know what if this one doesn't work anymore. And Joseph simply asked him, well, is it working now. And he said, Yes, Joseph said not to worry. There will be a way, something will work. So people repeatedly in this in this film referred to Joseph's faith in slowly growing IMS. To him it was just doing the next thing during the next thing and somehow it all worked out of course there were many problems along the way but you know this kind of just meeting the moment, this kind of sincere confidence is often behind institutions that actually endure and evolve over decades or longer. And we can see some similar things, think in the evolution of IMC where, where this, where we're based here. Just one small example maybe is the financial model at IRC insight retreat center that's associated with IMC and the financial model there is that the, you know, there's no registration fee and the retreats are offered on the Donna basis and the donations that people make somehow pay, pay it forward and keep it going. And I've heard people talk about gills faith in this regard it's, it's not really a common business model in the world to, you know, not charge for what you offer. And many people said that it wouldn't work. And yet, it does. So, this is yeah, this is meeting the moment as it says in the comments. I'm not sure I'm talking on an institutional scale but it can work on a personal scale to remembering talking with Ayatata Aloka, who's one of now the very senior nuns in the koonies in the western world. And she wrote, you know, way back when she was thinking about or dating very young in her 20s. She was going back and forth should I retain is it not what should I do with my life. And she happened to be flying back home to, which was in Portland at the time, Portland, Oregon, and she got off the plane and that was in the time when Nike had their, their first flight to Portland, just do it. And there were all these ads in the Nike airport in the Portland airport from Nike that said just do it, just do it and then she walked off the plane and saw all these signs. She said okay, I think I'll ordain. Just do it. There's a way that honest openness to the Dharma connects us into some larger flow. I've heard Gil call this hidden pathways that we don't know are there. Sometimes this approach of simply having confidence is a way to meet the uncertainties of life. And it's not even that we have confidence or trust in some specific thing that we could mean. We just have trust. There's a saying, the Dharma supports those who support the Dharma. And, you know, this has to be done with some sincerity and humility, we can't rely on it from a purely cognitive perspective, or we can't have a demand or an expectation in following that, that maximum in our life. And it's useful also to remember that we might not get the exact solution that we were imagining, but there will be some shift that addresses our problem you know if we take this approach of meeting life confidently. So here, I want to give a somewhat pointed example that I heard from another Dharma teacher in a Dharma talk, and I found it striking. They were saying, suppose a person has the problem of wetting their pants when they get nervous in public, and they desperately wish to end the suffering of this terrible condition. And so they place their trust in their Dharma practice. And instead of stopping the wedding of their pants what they find is that they become a quantum is about doing it. So, either way the suffering subsides I mean it's kind of a humorous and somewhat overblown example but it points toward the idea that we can't quite demand how the issue is going to be addressed, but we can have confidence that the Dharma will find a way to ease the suffering. Maybe things change, or maybe we just learn not to be so concerned, or any other of a myriad possibilities. We may not even be about a, you know, we may not even use this approach just for problems, per se. I know somebody from a Sangha in another location, who was sometimes asked to give Dharma talks when the teacher was away. And one time she was asked and she said no because she didn't really have any ideas for a talk. So that's one approach. But another approach is to just say yes and trust that because the talk is on the calendar, an idea will come. You don't need an idea for a Dharma talk when there isn't one coming up on the calendar. But as soon as there is, then maybe an idea will come. So, I don't know, do you have examples of this from your own life? You want to say ask that as a question for your contemplation, have there been examples of that that you've seen. There's even a story from the suttas about this. Laha Kasapa, who was one of the Buddha's chief disciples. He knew from an early age that he wanted to ordain as a monk, but his parents wouldn't allow it. And he ended up marrying. He didn't want to get married, but he ended up marrying, turned out a woman who really wanted to be a nun, but her parents wouldn't allow it. So they did their best to being married and running a farm to make a living. But eventually the calling to the spiritual life was too strong for both of them. And without even having met the Buddha, you know, he had never met his teacher, but he just knew he wanted to ordain, he wanted to live that life. So without having met the Buddha, Kasapa and actually also his wife, they just put on the yellow robe anyway, kind of effectively ordaining themselves and set out on the road. And the Buddha had sensed at that point that a great disciple was in the area and was coming and he went to meet Kasapa, but Kasapa couldn't have known that when he set out. So this quality of confidence, sadha, sometimes the best approach is to just go forward sincerely, not knowing how it's all going to work out, but trusting that we'll be able to meet it, whatever comes. And it may be pleasant, maybe unpleasant, but we trust that we can meet it. So, confidence becomes a Dharma resource when we have some clarity in our heart about what we're devoted to, or what we're following or what we're aspiring to. We have some clarity, like we want to build a Dharma center in America. We want to orient our life around practice, we want to find a way to meet a terminal illness, something, and then we step forward, and we need the next moment and the next. We maybe have a big picture in mind, but big pictures come about moment by moment by moment. And there's a way that we can bring our full heart to that. So, may you find that confidence is a Dharma resource for you today and broadly in your life. Thank you.
