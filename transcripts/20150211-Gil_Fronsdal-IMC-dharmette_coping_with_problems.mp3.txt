Dharmette: Coping with Problems  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

There are many concerns that people have – all kinds. 
A concern is something we are thinking about or 
preoccupied with. Certainly , some things need to be 
thought about, need to be considered. This i s part  of 
human life. Then there are things which  may need to be 
considered or thought about, but we’ve done it 332 
times in the last twenty minutes, over and over again. 
Maybe we don’t ha ve to think about it that often. There’s 
no need to.  
 
Then there are some things we are concerned about 
that don’t really need to be a concern at all. But 
regardless of what the concern is, we can be come 
aware of how we are relating to the concern . How we  
are holding it ? How we are thinking about it ? What is 
our attitude towards it?  
 
You could be thinking about getting the oil changed in 
your car, because the oil needs to be changed. It’s just 
a thought that goes through , and very quietly you 
wonder, “ Where should I get it changed? When do I 
have time to do it ?” – very simple thoughts. Or there can 
be anxiety about it : “Oh No! I have to do this. If I don’t do it soon, my car is going to come to an end. I better 
do it soon. But I better choose the right pla ce to change 
my oil , because then people will know I make good 
choices in my life. There is a lot at stake in choosing the 
best place for an oil change . Now I have to look it up all 
of the places  on Yelp . It’s reall y important I get it right !” 
So, there is this intensity around just choosing the right 
place to change your oil. There is a difference between 
that intensity of choosing the right place to change your 
oil, and calmly thinking about it : “I should think about it , 
and find  a good place to c hange my oil. Maybe I should 
check Yelp , and see if the local place is w ell Yelped .” 
 
How we relate to something is something we become 
aware of as we practice. How are we holding it? What is 
our attitude? Sitting  down to meditate  is a great 
laboratory to see if there is tension, or contraction, or 
intensi ty around our concerns. The intensity, the 
contractio n, the tension is different than  the concern 
itself. They are two different things.  
 
Especiall y in the context of meditation , this can  become 
a safe, ap propriate place for the intensity of the concern 
to begin to relax. The concern still remains. But the 
intensity of our involvement with the concern begins to 
relax  – maybe enough  so that we realize we have some 
choice whether we pick i t up or not. Maybe w e could 
say, “Actually, for this half hour meditation , I don’t think I 
need to keep thinking about this. I’ve thought about it a lot before. I can think about it again later. But I don’t 
have to do it now. Maybe there is something better to do 
right now than to keep  churning away on  the same 
thing .” So the intensity,  the tension,  the contraction falls 
away. And with that, sometimes thinking about the 
concern falls away. And then we may have a fresher, 
more relaxed viewpoint . We have a different 
perspectiv e, from which we can  later go back and look 
at the concern.  
 
A very important distinction that mindfulness practice 
can reveal is the distinction between our concern and 
how we hold it – between our concern and how  we 
relate to the concern. A  huge way of finding freedom is 
not to solve our concern , but to dissolve the intense way 
we are caught in or involved with the concern. Maybe 
the concern will remain. If it’s an appropriate concern , 
you can pick it up with a more relaxed mind, and look at 
it.  
 
But so metimes , you’ll discover that the problem you had 
didn’t really exist in the first place. There’s a saying 
attributed to Mark Twain : “I've had a lot of worries in my 
life, most of which never happened.”  And so, anxieties , 
and problems that have to do with anxiety, are  often like 
that. We are worried about some imaginary future, 
some imaginary outcome. Sometimes we don’t even 
know what that outcome might be. We don’t even have 
an idea of it. But still, we are relating to some m ythical problem in the future that is going to befall us.  
 
Sometimes we do have a clear image of what’s going to 
be. And sometimes those things come along , but 
sometimes they don’t. We spend a lot of time imagining 
something that never happens – or it hap pens , but it 
doesn’t happen the way you anticipated. So the idea 
that some of the problems we have are not real 
problems is a very interesting thing to consider. As the 
mind  gets quieter , maybe you can ask,  “Is this problem 
a real problem ? Does it really e xist?”  
 
The problem that I need to find an oil change place that 
is going to protect my status as one of the most 
significant meditation teachers on the corner of Hopkins 
and Birch – is that really a problem? If I get really calm , 
relaxed , and mindful , I think I’ll see through that one . I’ll 
see that  it’s not really a problem I need to have. I don’t 
think I have to worry too much about how people look at 
me here at the corner of Birch and Hopkins.  
 
What are your problems? We all have problems. But 
can yo u take a new look at them? Is there a different 
vantage point from which to look at them? One vantage 
point I’m suggesting  today is how you hold your 
problems , how you relate to them. If only you look at 
how you relate to them, maybe it’s okay to relax som e 
of the intensity around them , and the way we hold them. 
Then you can look at the problems themselves , and see how much they belong to an imaginary world, an 
imaginary outcome, what you think might happen – as 
opposed to what really happens.  
 
If I have a  flat tir e, that’s a real problem. S ometimes it’s 
good to worry enough  about getting a flat tire that you 
make sure you  have a spare tire in the car , or you have 
AAA to  take care of it.  I have in fact worried about flat 
tires in my cars for many years with out getting one. But 
if I’m constantly worryin g about  a flat tire , it is an 
imaginary problem.   
 
So, it’s possible that some of your problems don’t have 
to be problems. They might still be real enough that they 
need to be addressed. But maybe they don’t have to be 
problems. Maybe the idea that there is a problem is a 
problem. Some things are imaginary . Some things are 
guesses that we are living under.  
 
Meditation can help us with both of these. It can help us 
understand how we hold our concerns. And it can help 
us question whether our concerns are really the right 
concerns to have. These concerns can deal with very 
deep, existential things like sickness, old age, and 
death, which in Buddhism are the classic problem s. But 
how much are we living in an imaginary world? How 
much are we projecting into the future? How much are 
we imagining the situation in the way we are challenged 
by things like sickness, old age, and death?   
These are such basic human phenomena. If people are 
lucky enough to live to an old age, they have to deal 
with old age. This is what comes with the territory. The 
problems of old age  – what are they really ? What 
problems are real ? And what problems are imaginary ? If 
we u nderstand these , we can hold them more lightly.  
 
May your mindfulness help you t o be more at ease in 
this world.
