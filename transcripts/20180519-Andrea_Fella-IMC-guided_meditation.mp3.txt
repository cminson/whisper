Being a posture that feels alert and yet as relaxed and comfortable as possible. 
And exploring at the beginning relaxing. 
Maybe for this sitting just beginning with those requests. 
May the body relax. 
See how the body and mind respond. 
May the body relax. 
May the body relax. 
May the mind relax. 
Relax. 
Relax. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? Relax and receive, what is most obvious in this moment? And what is most obvious now? Exploring this, following the attention, staying connected can either be the sense of letting things come to you, or just staying connected and following the attention. 
Relax. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? Body sensation may be obvious. 
Sound may be obvious. 
Feelings, moods, emotions might be obvious. 
Even thoughts might be obvious. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? And from time to time, noticing your relationship to experience. 
Do you want something to happen? Do you want something to stop happening? Is there confusion, disconnection? Or maybe it's okay. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? If thoughts are obvious, if thoughts are happening, and you're aware of thoughts happening, explore the possibility of knowing thinking is happening, and checking in, what effect does this thinking have? How does this thinking affect the body, the mind? Is this related to this thinking, emotions, body sensations? This is in a way broadening the attention around the thought to include more of what's happening in the present moment. 
Relax, may the body relax, may the mind relax. 
Are you aware? What is obvious? A light touch of effort to just connect. 
What's this in this moment? And what's this now? And how about now? And now, hearing, body sensation, thinking, feeling, hearing. 
Light touch doesn't take much to know for a moment. 
And then do it again, and again, and again. 
And now, hearing, body sensation, thinking, feeling, feeling.
