Great.
So, hello everyone and a warm, warm welcome to you.
To this version, this rendition of happy hour as we come towards the end of 2020.
So, for the practice today, what I wanted to invite us to explore is the
meditation for putting down what's no longer serving, what's no longer needed,
with metta. So, that's the theme. So, let me say a few words about it, what I mean by that.
So, the theme is inspired by many things, one of them being, you know, often towards the end of a year.
There are these idea of resolutions, etc., etc., and one thing to consider perhaps is,
again, maybe resolutions, again, that could be another talk or lecture, what's supported, what's not supported,
one thing, one reflection, that could be helpful.
Even though, again, someone can say, oh, years, you know, end of the year, beginning of another, it's all conceptual,
these are all concepts, it's just one moment at a time. Yes, all of that is true, it's all one moment at a time,
and it's all concepts, yes. And yet, we can take this concept of a transition of one year to another,
2020 to 2021, how can we use that in a skillful way? How can we use this concept that everybody buys into,
that we agree upon, this concept that we all agree upon?
One way that we can use it to support our practice is to consider, oh, in this past year, or in the past, in the past general,
are there patterns, are there things that have been coming up that are no longer serving, no longer helpful?
So you can see a pattern, maybe it comes up as a pattern of thought that you see,
and you become mindful of it, aware of it, and then with kindness, with all the kindness in your heart,
bowing to it, saying, thank you, maybe you served me at some point, maybe you supported me, maybe you made me feel safe,
and you're not needed right now, you've served, thank you.
So with all the care, all the friendliness, all the meta in our heart, seeing it, inviting it to be put down.
So in this way, it's not that we're throwing it down, stop it, you pattern of thought, pattern, there is no ill will,
it's a sense of, oh, thank you, a sense of appreciation, and then putting it down.
So I also want to share a tiny little story before we start, because I think this is the image,
there are a couple of images, actually one of them I'll introduce later, but this story I want to evoke is a famous story of two monks,
an older monk and a younger monk, who had taken a vow of never touching a woman, in fact, in Theravada,
a male monk, or monk of one gender, takes a vow of not touching people in another gender, so anyway,
explaining the monk rule. So in this story, an older monk, a senior monk, and a younger monk are walking together,
and they come to a bank of a river, and there they see a young woman who asks them for help, can you help me cross?
And without saying anything, the older monk picks up the young woman, carries her across, puts it on the other side,
and then the two monks continue, and the younger monk is livid, angry, doesn't say anything for an hour,
how could you, thinking in his mind, how could you, oh, you touched a woman, you had taken a vow of never touching a woman,
continues for another two hours, three hours, and finally, the young monk turns to the older monk and says,
how could you do that, you touched a woman, very upset and angry, and the older monk, and here's the punchline,
the image I like you to carry with yourself is, oh, I put her down by the bank of the river, you're still carrying her,
you're still carrying her, so what are we still carrying, whom are we still carrying, when we could have just gently, kindly put them,
put it down by the bank of the river, so, so in the spirit of Mehta, also there is a lot of kindness and gentleness,
the same way that the old monk puts the woman gently on the other side, that's what we'd like to evoke tonight,
so without further ado, I'd like to invite all of us to get into our meditation posture,
if you need to move, to shift, from a chair to a cushion, from a cushion to a chair, if you need to lie down,
it's all good, see what your body needs in this moment, and settling, settling into this body,
maybe you need to set up a little more straight to have a sense of weakfulness,
ah, and inviting, inviting the body to rest, the muscles to relax,
putting down, putting down with kindness, with gentleness, any thoughts, any preoccupations we've been carrying,
putting down, putting down all stories, even the story I just told you, all the words, putting it all down,
ah, let yourself be refreshed, arriving in the body, taking refuge,
as if you were soaking in a healing, soothing, calming river,
gentle, feeling the moisture, just the perfect temperature, caressing your muscles, your body, letting your body relax,
if there is tightness or holding, imagining it's being offered up, imagine it's being offered up,
soaked in the river,
allowing your legs to relax, soften, your sit bones, your abdomen, to let go from the inside,
to let go from the inside, to let go from the inside,
letting your hands feel heavy, your neck and shoulders relaxing, your face, your forehead softened,
smoothed, stretched, your jaw relaxed, your whole face,
giving up its tension, relaxing, softening from the inside,
receiving the breath and the abdomen, soothing, calming, settling,
soothing, relaxing.
noticing that each breath can calm and settle you, the soothing power of each
in-breath and out-breath, like a calming, mellifluous, sweet-sounding lullaby.
appreciating this moment of quiet, finally sitting down, the body, the
refuge of the breath, what a delight, enjoying breathing or being breathed.
you
and if thoughts, memories, preoccupations arise, it's okay, see them, smile at them, hello friend,
a nod of recognition, the never-so-gently, just as the old monk careingly put the
young woman, safely down by the bank of the river, you right now, during this
meditation, putting the thought kindly, warm heartedly down, setting it down by
the bank of the river, thank you. I'm turning your heart wholeheartedly to
the breath and the body in this practice right now.
you may have to do this many many times, it's okay, every time do it with patience
and kindness, it's a training, it's a training, training and kindness and
gentleness and putting down, putting down what's not needed right now, the same
thing over and over maybe, it's okay.
you
you
you
receiving the breath in the body
feeling the body, feeling embodied, never leaving the body through this practice as
much as possible. And those patterns, patterns of thought, patterns, or repetitive
patterns come up, really turning, turning and seeing them clearly, turning
awareness onto these thoughts, these patterns of preoccupation, with kindness,
really seeing them clearly, or what they are, seeing them clearly, recognizing them,
smiling at them, well here you are again, I see you, I recognize you, yes.
And seeing if this pattern is no longer needed, no longer helpful, no longer
serving. When choosing, choosing with kindness, kindness to yourself to be of
benefit to yourself and others in the world, with good will all around, gently,
kindly, setting down, setting down this pattern, knowing that it might come up
again, because it's a habit, of course it's a habit, and yet every time you
clearly see it and recognize it, with kindness, not with anger, kindness and you
put it down, with gentleness,
every time you do this, recognize, put down gently, kindly,
you're strengthening, you're feeding, your heart both in kindness and in
wisdom, kindness and wisdom growing, every time you do this, intertwined
together, growing in wisdom and kindness.
One of the patterns that might come up is pattern of self-judgment, oh you can't
put anything down, or you can't do this right, your failure, oh see that is a
pattern, oh dear, oh dear, thank you, thank you with kindness, with kindness,
intending, intending to lay it down, again, many patterns, many thoughts might
come up over and over again, the idea isn't to put them down and you're done
for once, that's not the expectation, it's the training, it's the training to see
clearly, we train our mind to be still, we train our mind to be still, to be
patient, to see clearly with wisdom, to not be scared or angry, but with kindness
see patterns and with kindness intend to let them go, knowing that once may not
be enough, but it's that training, it's turning our mind, as the Buddha says,
whatever you reflect upon becomes the inclination of your mind, so this is what
we reflect upon, so that it becomes the inclination of our mind, that's the
crucial difference, the inclination of the mind towards calm and clear seeing,
kindness, gentleness, and turning towards wisdom and kindness, again and again the
actions of the mind, and then coming back to the breath and the body, just
breathing, appreciating this breath in this moment, not judging yourself, hang in
there, hang in there, begin again, begin again in this moment, every moment is a
fresh moment, begin again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And for the last couple of minutes of this practice period, turning your attention,
your awareness, to appreciation for yourself, for having showed up, for having
hung in there, even if it feels shoddy at times, the mind was here there and
everywhere distracted, no judgment, you showed up, you tried, even if there was
one moment of connecting with wisdom to see the patterns of thought, to
preoccupation, being lost, and one moment of connecting with kindness, seeing it
without aversion, without anger, with gentleness, open heart, with metta,
inviting it to be put down, even if it was just one moment, yay, appreciating
yourself for having showed up, having practiced, there's so many other things
you could have done in this moment, you chose to show up, to practice, to align
your intentions with your actions, thanking yourself for your own goodness
of intention, with gladness, appreciation, and delight.
Thank you for your practice, I deeply appreciate your practice, showing up
for yourself and for all those people whose lives you touch, directly or
indirectly. And to take that in for a moment, you don't do this practice just
for yourself. So, I'd like to invite reflections, reports, questions, and you
can either type them in chat, if you wish, or all to see if you want, or direct
it to me with them out loud, or you can raise your hand. If you raise your
physical hand, I may not see you, there are limited tiles I see, but it's best to
go down to participants, click on that, it opens a window, and then it says
raise hand, and if you click on that, then your blue hand would be raised.
Especially, I want to invite folks who usually don't share first, to make space
for those who usually pull back, hold back. So, inviting folks who don't usually
share, please would love to hear from you first.
Questions, comments, what came up for you? Especially if you're new to happy hour,
if it's your first time, your opinion is important, your reflection is
important. See reflections on YouTube. Thank you, Dawn, Laura, and A.B. Alan.
Great, thank you. One more round for those who tend to hold back, usually, please.
Yuka says, harmony is mother. Oh, sweet, thank you for that poetic reflection.
Harmony, nice, very sweet. And Jerry, please. Can you hear me? Yes. So, when I'm
here, I just share, so I hope I'm not hogging someone out of the space, but I
guess I was struck by the comments of the yeses or arbitrary, depending on what
calendar you use, times where the year ends and the room calendar and starts
again in January. But it was helpful to sort of think about stuff that one's
holding and then letting go of it. And then sort of just settling yourself
into that space. And so that I found helpful. I recently had to travel
outside the country for a few days to South America. And so I was, you know, it's
cold here. So I got a chill this evening. So I just thought, oh my goodness, here
comes COVID. And despite, you know, wearing N95 masks, which I had purchased
prior to this. And so anyway, I turned the temperature up in the house. It was
warmer. But it was a ways in how the mind went. But it was just an attempt to try
to settle me and sort of going forward in thinking of the past and sort of just
staying here in the moment. So it was very helpful to see the patterns. Yeah, to
see the patterns of worry that come up and all of that. Yeah, great. That was
helpful. Yeah, also the idea of we're here now and staying in that moment and
then letting go of that. By the end of it, I seemed to have no worries.
Life was like that. That's great. Thanks, Jerry. Thanks for your reflections.
Other reflections, please. What happened for you? What worked? What didn't? Questions?
Complaints? Bill says, what if I have a pattern that I need to let go of, but I'm
not ready to yet? Oh, fantastic question. Great. I was going to actually say that
during the guided meditation. Terrific. So appreciate you bringing that up, Bill.
So a pattern that you need to let go of, but you're not ready yet. So the
invitation there, Bill, is to recognize that you're not ready yet. And just
the fact that recognizing that you need to let go of it, inclining your heart
towards that, oh, may I be open to letting go of this with kindness.
It's almost like what you're saying reminds me of, for example, forgiveness.
And this is the invitation we usually have about forgiveness. Sometimes you're
ready to let go of some grievance with someone. Oh, you've been carrying it for
so long. It's like, okay, time to put it down. And some other times like, okay,
I know I want to let go of this at some point, but I'm not quite ready yet. So
that practice becomes, may I be open? Do you incline your mind, your heart towards?
May I be ready at some point? May I recognize with wisdom? And you don't have
to force yourself to let go, to put it down or let go. That never works. But
that's a really, really good question. I'm glad you brought it. And I hope
that's helpful. You're welcome. So I see, Trevor, please. Oh, actually, Alana first.
I asked you to unmute. Yes, please. Um, yeah, something that has been coming up
for me in the practice of letting go and letting be has been how in some ways
there's, there's like nothing to do. And it's such a new concept for me that
it's not like letting go is not something that I need to force myself to do or an
action to take. But more of just creating the conditions for it to happen, which is
just outrageous. It's so different than the way that I'm used to doing things. So
I'm appreciating that, that new perspective. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Alana.
Brilliant. I so appreciate you bringing this in. It's creating the conditions for
letting go to happen. Exactly. It's, it's, it's much more spacious. It's not so
much that we let go, that we, it can be done. And that's something I was trying
to bring in to the spirit of this guided meditation that you might have to do it
over and over again. It's just pattern is training. See, we're training our mind.
And at some point, the mind will just go tired of this and it will let go on its
own. And that's the beauty and the grace of it. And I so appreciate you bringing
that in because that's when it happens. It just, it gets let go of when the mind
is ready, but then keep inclining like, oh yeah,
inclining towards kindness and seeing it with kindness. Just what you were saying
and actually with the previous thing that Bill was saying, perfect combination
because sometimes we're not quite ready, but yet we keep gently inclining the
mind and at some point trusting that the mind will be ready and it will do its
own. And it's more, yeah, it's not our doing, but putting the conditions in
place. Fantastic. Thanks for bringing that in. Yeah. And Trevor, and we'll let
this be the last comment before we go into groups. Please, Trevor.
Yeah, I think I can remember exactly what I was going to say. I think a common theme
in really trying to practice a lot of loving kindness is noticing when I come
to sit down on the cushion, just how easy the mind can slip into a kind of
hindrance, one of the hindrances or something and be quite dull or tired.
And then you notice subtle frustration come up of, you know, just, just, just
simple, you're not doing it right or just those basic frustrations that can be
very subtle, very underneath the surface of just a small undercurrent and kind of
feel like it's like something's not right. But upon recognizing that, you start
to recognize, you start to want to shift yourself towards allowing that to be
there and just giving that some space. Yeah. And I've been doing a lot of
trading in the stock market and, you know, you can have small wins here, small
losses there and you brush them off. But it's no, those things, they add up over
time. Yeah. Meta is that recognition and that that small seed that you're
planning each time. Exactly. Exactly. And there are two things that I want to
highlight quickly. And one is actually the recognition, that's seeing, that's
wisdom, that's seeing with clarity, like, Oh, yeah, this is what's happening.
As you're saying, describing, you sit down, you start to notice, Oh, this is
what's happening here. Oh, and then when that awareness comes in, and then with
kindness, planting the seed of kindness to shift, to gently shift it. Beautiful.
Thanks for describing that, Trevor. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. So time is
flying. So let's, so let's practice in small groups, small groups of three will
just be six minutes will be pretty short tonight. And the invitation is always to
hold each other with kindness, holding yourself with kindness. And maybe if you
wanted to share, you could share nothing, or if you wanted to share, Oh, what did
you notice in this practice? What is it that your mind kind of noticed wanting
to let go of? Or not? So you're welcome to share anything you wish that might be
supportive for you in the way of offering and being held witness. So I'm going to
create the groups now. And here we go, opening the rooms. Okay, welcome back,
everyone. The groups are closed, rooms are closed. And we just have about one
minute. If there are any reflections, especially again, people who tend to hold
back usually like to share about what, what was it like to be in the group would
love to hear from you, please. Those who usually don't speak up. What happened? What
was it like to share or hear others can either type in chat or you can raise your
hand.
Okay, going once, going twice, it's hard to get, it's quite an invitation to ask the
people who usually don't speak, shy ones, you know, whatever category to come forward.
Yes, you can do it.
Maybe that's the pattern to let go of, oh, my opinion doesn't matter, it's not important
enough or, oh, I can't speak up, so maybe that's the pattern to, you know, let go of
and say something.
Anybody want to try it?
Folks usually don't speak.
I just wanted to say thank you for the practice today and it helped me realize that I was
angry about something at work today and I realized that I created this whole narrative
around it, about who did it, about why it happened and based on prior experiences at
work, but I actually didn't know any of those things and I didn't know what happened and
it just made me realize how my mind just creates these narratives that are kind of false and
how silly that is and how I can just put that down and laugh at it and observe it.
Beautiful, that is so powerful, thank you, you said it so well, it's laughable right
after you get to see it, after having been in the storm, how the mind creates the storm,
that's lovely.
And Jane also says, it was nice to get in a small group and hear various things and
how they try working it out, fantastic, lovely, well, thank you for those reflections and
it's 702, so let's bring our session to a close together, so thank you all for showing
up for your practice and let's dedicate the goodness of our practice, the merit of our
practice, to well-being of all beings everywhere, may all beings be free, happy, liberated,
including us, thank you, and now if you wish, I'm going to unmute you, if you want to say
goodbye.
