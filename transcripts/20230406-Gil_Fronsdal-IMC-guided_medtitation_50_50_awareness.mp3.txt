Hello, everyone. Welcome.
And sometimes I think of mindfulness practice as having adventures with awareness, and that life is very different when we're aware,
so much so that sometimes I think of we have many bodies, the body we have when we're not aware, and then the bodies we have when we're aware,
just all these different ways of experiencing the body, and the mind that's when we're not aware and the mind that's aware,
which is so fascinating, the emotions when we're aware and when we're not aware.
Our social life, when we're aware and when we're not mindful, it's so varied and becomes so rich when the mindfulness is there,
the awareness is there, and it becomes so variable that it becomes almost like three-dimensional or four-dimensional or something
when there's a clear sense of mindfulness, and without clear mindfulness and kind of almost intentional mindfulness or awareness,
life can start becoming two-dimensional or one-dimensional.
So one of the great skills that I've found very useful for me is being able to sometimes almost simultaneously be aware of others and myself,
of them in conversation with people, and I like to have this general idea that I'm 50% of my attention is with the others
and 50% attention is here with this person, with myself, and that way there's a wonderful balance and there's a check-in balance system.
And so this ability to shift where we bring our attention to be able to get a richer experience of what's actually happening here
can be involved in any given moment of mindfulness that we can be aware of an object of attention
and we can be aware of what it's like to be aware of the object of attention.
So I can be aware of my breathing and I can be aware of how I am being aware of the breathing,
that I'm straining or pushing or laxity or lazy or resistant.
I can be aware of how I'm aware of an emotion and I can be aware of from where I'm aware of it,
I'm aware of it in my head, I'm aware of it in my body.
Which of these two is a useful way of taking in and registering the emotion?
So sometimes I'm with the emotion, sometimes I'm with how I am taking it in.
Oh, it's in that place in my body, my place in the body feels this way and this is my reaction to it, my response to it.
And so for this meditation I'd like to suggest that there'd be a very simple alternation for you,
maybe almost with the alternation of breathing, between being aware of something
and then being aware of how it is for you to be aware of it.
What's a subjective experience like for you to be engaged in the mindfulness of something?
So to clearly see something in its own right and then how's it like to be aware of it?
And this adventure of kind of going back and forth, not one or the other.
If it's only how you are about it, the subjective experience which is one extreme that some people take,
then it's all living inside of this kind of labyrinth of self and me and the impact and what I should do and judgments about it.
But if it's all about the object, then there can be losing touch with oneself, there can be a strain,
there can be attitudes about the object that go unseen.
But to go back and forth, to see both, sometimes seemingly simultaneously, sometimes by kind of back and forth.
So to begin with meditation posture.
And then gently closing the eyes.
And mindfulness, awareness practice, begins with doing so intentionally,
doing so knowingly, consciously, choosing to be aware.
And to begin by choosing to be aware of your body.
And taking some time to feel your body, familiarize yourself with your body.
And then how are you being aware of your body? Are there judgments, fears, resistance, ideas?
It might be possible to simplify how you are being aware, just aware of the body.
And then to become aware of your body breathing.
Familiarize yourself with how breathing is at this time.
And then how are you in being aware of breathing?
Do you have judgments, ideas of what should be and shouldn't be?
Do you have expectations and things you are trying to do with your breathing?
Is there fear? Is there concerns about breathing? Is there enthusiasm?
How is it? How are you about your breathing?
And can you simplify how you are with mindfulness of breathing?
So it's simply being aware of the body breathing.
And then gently going back and forth between how you are in being aware of breathing and the breathing.
Take a few long slow deep breaths, relaxing as you exhale.
Take a few long slow deep breaths, relaxing as you exhale.
And then letting your breathing return to normal.
And then continuing quietly with the meditation.
But in some relaxed rhythm, move back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware and intentional about it.
And then becoming aware of the subjective experience of what it's like to be aware.
How are you being aware?
And maybe moving back and forth through these two modes can be done in a way that's quieting,
calming, here.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And then moving back and forth between what you are clearly mindful of,
a sense of choice to be aware of.
And as we come to the end of this sitting,
to first check in with how you are.
How are you in your body?
And how my things have shifted for you?
How are you in your mind?
And how my things have shifted for you?
How are you emotionally?
And how might that have shifted from the beginning of the meditation?
And with how you are, what's available inside of you for kindness,
for goodwill, for compassion?
And how now to turn your attention to the people of your lives, the people you might see today and encounter today?
And to consider them, to think of them kindly with friendship, goodwill,
have thoughts of appreciation for them?
Maybe being aware of appreciating that you have this ability to appreciate others,
to enjoy others, to care for others.
And in whatever way that you have benefited from this meditation,
maybe you can want to use that benefit to benefit others.
Use that benefit of meditation to enter into the world,
caringly, kindly, with warmth and friendship for others,
even if they are not that in return.
May we co-forth from meditation for the welfare and happiness of others.
May all beings be happy, may all beings be safe,
may all beings be peaceful, and may all beings be free.
And may we contribute, even in small ways, to that possibility.
Thank you.
