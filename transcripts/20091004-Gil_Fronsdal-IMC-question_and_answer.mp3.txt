Dharmette : Question s and Answer s 
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on January 26, 2011  
 
 
Good morning. This morning I actually have  nothing to 
talk about. So I think that’s  a good day to see if you 
have any questions you’d like to bring up , and I’ll try to 
respond.  
 
Practitioner  1: How do you practice when you’re sick?   
 
Gil: It’s a good question , and it depends on how you’re 
sick. One of the first things is to be mindful o f what it’s 
like to be sick , and your reactions to it. Mindfulness 
works in many ways, but a n important way  that 
mindfulness works  is that you pay attention to what your 
relationship is to what’s happening. Sometimes it is very 
fruitful to look at the rela tionship , because that’s 
something you can do something about. There are 
many situations in life where you can’t do something 
about the event  – you might get sick, you might get 
really sick, yo u might be dying, you might die.  Sooner or 
later that’s going to happen. You might not have much 
choice in the matter , but you might relate to it in a way 
that either causes you a tremendous amount of 
suffering , or hold it in a  way that actually can be freeing 
and l iberating.   
People wi ll suffer a  lot extra because of how they relate. 
When we’re  sick, we can feel depressed, embarrassed , 
guilty, angry , or discouraged . Many kind s of secondary 
reactions might be there . Mindfulness can help you  free 
yourself from the secondary reactions. Just let your  self 
be sick in a simple way. It’s bad enough to be sick . You 
can’t expect not to be sick , and y ou’ll probably heal a lot 
better if you don’t add the secondary reactions on top of 
it. So mindfulnes s can be a great help. Just look at it 
and understand it.  That’s one thing to do. You’ll  be 
surprised at how man y secondary reactions there are 
that maybe you didn’t think were there.  
 
When I’m sick in bed , I do a lot of mindfulness of the 
body , where I f ocus on my body and all the ways there 
might be some tension or holding. My meditation 
practice in bed has a lot to do with just relaxing the 
body , and looking at how deep ly I can  get relaxed in my 
body. Anything else seems hard to do  – like follow ing 
the breath . I find the breath , but then I slip right off. But 
somehow being  connected to the body that’s sick and 
relaxing into and with it  seems to help. It’s also probably 
healing just to relax. And i t’s good to get rest when 
you’re sick , and drink a lo t of fluids .  
 
Another thing that happens when you’re mindful  is that  
you can sometimes be more likely to pick up the signals 
inside that tell what you need in order to take care of yourself when you’re sick. If you’re mindful  and attentive 
to what’s going  on, you might know when you need 
sleep. Depending  upon what kind of sickness you have , 
maybe you need to go to the doctor , or do something 
practical for it. Sometimes it can be quite subtle. When 
I’m sick , sometimes the foods I want to eat change. I 
pay attention to the particular foods I feel I want to eat. I 
can’t give you a medical reason why those foods are the 
right thin gs, but I feel strongly drawn towards  them . I 
trust that somehow my body knows that this is what I 
need to do right now. These are the things that occur to 
me.  
 
Practitioner  2: I wonder if you could share a few 
thoughts about how to be mindful of sadness and grief 
without feeling like you’re wallowing, or you’re sitting 
down and saying I’m going to try and feel bad  [laughs] . 
 
Gil: Good, thank you. I think that some of the same 
things apply. Sometimes rather than being mindful of 
the grief directly , it’s good to be mindful of the 
secondary  reactions, belief s and identities  that are 
connected to it . With grief and sadness , there can be 
identities. It’s okay to grieve for a day or two or a month 
or two, but then we feel  embarrassed because people 
tell us we’re supposed to be over it by now . The whole  
idea that I should be  over it and it’s not okay to grieve is 
a secondary reaction that can cause suffering, 
embarrassment, anger , and confus ion.   
There are  a lot of different secondary things that can go 
on. Sometimes people are attached to their grief or 
sadness , and that’s secondary as well . People can get 
an identity  from the  support they receive from others . 
Because  they’re staying there in their grief, they hold 
onto it to get the support or to be seen in a certain way. 
Some people hold onto grief and sadness  because it’s a 
tangible connectio n to the one they’ve  lost. Sometimes  
people don’t want to give up their grief because they 
feel that they’ll lose what they lost or that it’s  
disrespectful. They  have a big loss when someone dies , 
and think  that they if they don’t grieve , then that would 
be disrespectful. Those are all kind s of secondary 
things.  
 
It’s important to see these, come to terms with them and 
work  through them. Part of the advantage  of looking at 
secondary reactions is that if they really can’t be let go 
of, then maybe they can be  put aside enough that you 
can feel the primary  emotion more fully. One of the 
ways to feel sadness or grief is to feel it in the body , and 
give it permission to be there.  Generally grief or 
sadness is part of a very natural process moving 
through us , and unfolding within us. If we can get almost 
out of the way , and let the natural process unfold , then 
generally the body or the heart knows what to do – 
whether it takes a few months or  a few hours.  
 A friend of mine lost many people in one year – a father, 
brother, best friend. She had a tremendous amount of 
grief, which would come  in waves. When  she went on 
ten-day meditation retreat s, the grief was much more 
intense , although the waves only lasted for a few 
minutes as opposed to a few hours. That’s because 
being on retreat is really a way of getting out of the way 
more fully. Meditation is that way . Get out of the way 
and just let it come , and wash through. It can be more 
intense , but it’s cleaner and more complete.  
 
Then  how do you differentiate between wallowing in 
grief or sadness , and just have  it in a clean way? With 
wallowing , usually there’s self -pity: “poor me. ” There’s 
usually a leaning into it , or collapsing that goes on. I t’s 
always good to keep the symbolic image of the Buddha 
sitting in meditation in mind. The Buddha is sitting so 
upright. The idea of being upright in the mi dst of our 
challenges is a really beautiful thing. It doesn’t mean we 
deny or avoid them . Staying  upright mean s we’re not 
collapsing with our grief , or being pushed around by it . 
Just use your posture. So if a person who is  grieving  is 
going like this  [collapsing inward] , chances are they are 
kind of lost in it too much or wallowing. But if you sit 
upright and allow the grief to wash through , it’s harder to 
wallow. It’s harder to have self -pity or be caught in it if 
you use your posture as a good thing.  Those are things 
that occur to me. Does that seem  okay?  
 Okay. Sickness, s adness, grief, what else is there ? 
 
Practitioner  3: How about a nger? 
 
Gil: How about anger? [Laugher] Well, it involves some 
of the same things , like study ing the seco ndary things. 
There are  a lot of secondary things with anger , which 
come from our families, culture, and many  different 
places about how we’re supposed to be with anger. 
We’re not supposed to express it; w e are supposed to 
express it. It’s okay to be angry; it’s not okay to be 
angry. People  have histories with anger . Some  people 
are traumatized , because maybe once upon a time they 
were angry and got physically hit really badly for it – 
their parents slapped them. Now they’re afraid of their 
own anger , and so there’s  fear connected to it. The re 
are a lot of secondary things that go on.  
 
One of the great advantages of meditation is that it is a 
really safe place to be angry b ecause you’re not acting 
on it. Y ou’re committed to not moving for a certain 
period of time , so you know that you’re not  going to 
punch anyone out , or make any mistakes with your 
words. So you sit  there . It’s a safe place  to really feel it , 
and let go of all the seconda ry judgments about it , like 
it’s not oka y to be an angry person. No one needs to 
know. You have this beaut iful place and permission to 
feel angry , and let it just bubble through so that you can 
see it and get to know better. I find with anger it’s good to find some way to let it come through  in order  to listen 
more deep ly to it. What else is going on?  Anger  itself, 
more often than not , is a secondary emotion. But it’s 
very hard to see what’s primary unless you really let it 
move  through you.  
 
Practitioner  3: Well I feel like there is some  social 
injustice  about  particular opinions that I’m dealing with.  
And so I get angry. In meditation, I resolve the anger 
itself. But then h ow can we address the social issues?  
 
Gil: Well if there are social issues that you feel are 
important to address I really hope you engage in that 
process. The fact that you’re no longer angry  – I hope 
you still have the motivation to engage.  
 
Practitioner  3: But it’s hard to engage without getting 
angry. So if I’m on the cushion,  I can kind of manage it. 
If I try to address it, it reoccurs and …  
 
Gil: Yes, I do n’t know either. It is hard to do. So this 
practice here is not trying to get us to stop being an 
activist , but rather to be an activist without the anger. It 
might be compassion that motivates you. So you might 
see if you can find a different motivation . Don’t  just let 
go of your anger , but see what else motivates you to 
act, for example,  like compassion or something. Then  
see if you have confidence in that other motivation , 
because if you don’t have confidence in compassion as motivating , then you feel powerless. Powerless  people 
tend to succumb to anger much more quickly. But if you 
have a sense of personal power , at least you can 
engage the best you can. You might not get your way, 
but at least you can engage out of compassion , for 
example. Then maybe there is less of a need to get 
angry.  
 
I don’t know how  you are when you’re angry , but some 
people make tremendous devastatio n in the world if 
they’re angry. They should r eally maybe take a year off 
[laughs] , and deal with it before they go  on. Buddhism 
basically says that it’s not useful to be angry , but there 
can be ferocity. You can have ferocio us motivation 
that’s not angry, like ferocious compassion  when you 
say, “No, this is not okay !” but there is no ang er or 
hostility in it. In order to work through this link between 
anger and activism, sometimes it is important to 
differentiate between what’s anger  and wha t’s ferocity. 
Like a ferocious “N o!” – you’re not going to h urt 
anybody. Y ou’re just taking your stand – “No. You have 
to deal with me , and I’m not moving ” – in a ferocious 
way. So ferocity at the right time is a beautiful thing.  
 
Another thing I want to say is that sometimes if anger is 
relatively mild , it’s not a sin [ laughs] . Maybe it’s okay to 
learn how to negotiate that world of anger by giving into 
it a little bit , and ac ting based on it a little bit , as long as 
you think you’re not going  to cause a lot of harm . May  be you’l l learn by doing , rather than h olding it and 
bottling it up . You think angry , and do it in an  angry way . 
Then  you can refine it, work on it , and clarify it.  
 
Okay, well : sickness,  grief, anger…  we better stop 
[laughter] . 
 
Practitioner  4: What about happiness?  
 
Gil: What about happiness? That’s what we do for 
lunch.
