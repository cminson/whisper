The following talk was given at the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies in
Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at sati.org.
I'd like to start by saying a little bit more about my background
for those of you who don't know me, although it's nice to see familiar
faces on the screen today.
My professional training has been as a neuroscientist and a medical doctor
and a psychiatrist.
I had a clinical practice of psychiatry for about 35 years,
primarily seeing patients with anxiety and depression.
I retired now from clinical practice, but I'm still
on the faculty at the University of California, Davis, where I've been for close to 40 years.
I teach psychopharmacology and psychotherapy and neuroscience.
I'm still involved in brain research, which I've been doing for
over 50 years.
The type of research that I've been doing primarily, well, since the 1980s,
when MRI scanners became widely available, I've been
using brain imaging methods to look at and study what's
happening in the brain and what might be wrong when people
who have psychiatric disorders come and seek treatment
and are willing to be research volunteers.
It's been a journey of learning about how to relate
the sort of basic anatomy and physiology
and neuroscience of the brain to human experience.
I also have had a practice in Buddhism.
I was first interested in it and had a meditation practice
in my early years, but when I went to medical school,
that seemed to sort of disappear in the hustle and busyness of training
and early academic career, so it's really the last 15
or 20 years that I've come back to a serious commitment
and practicing in this tradition.
As I've done that, as I did that, having spent those years
studying the brain and the mind from other perspectives,
I realized that I developed this kind of bilingual
feeling for the subject matter. I would sit in a Dharma talk
and I would hear what people were saying and I'd say,
well, that's just like this principle from neuroscience,
or I would be reading a neuroscience article or listening to a talk
and I would think, oh, that's just like something the Buddha talked about
in this Sutta when he was teaching us about how the mind works
and how to be skillful in terms of
having a human mind and all of the little pitfalls built into it.
This has been a very
useful and enriching synergy for me
and so I want to try to
share that perspective with you on a couple of topics
and today that would be how memory works and how
people perceive the world using both
the language from neuroscience and the language from the early Buddhist tradition.
I guess the other thing that's
done for me is it's really increased my level of confidence
in both traditions since they seem to be pointing at
kind of the same basic
facts about the nature of the mind.
I also want to communicate a caveat
even though I'll be using a lot of the metaphors
and language of neuroscience. I don't mean to
imply a materialistic metaphysics in doing that.
I think science has a valid
claim to being useful as do
many other traditions of knowledge but that's not the
same as having a valid claim to the ground truth or the
basic reality in which we find ourselves.
Please don't extrapolate if I show pictures of brains
and nerve cells that I think this is ground truth. I just think it's a very
useful way of framing what's going on in our bodies.
I'm going to be doing sharing my screen
a lot. Some of the things I want to talk about are fairly visual so
I will rely on you to tell me if that's not working.
I'm not seeing the screen right, interrupt me please.
I'd like to start with
a quote that I really like from
the 10th century Chinese Zen master
Yun Men. When he was quite old he was asked
what is the fruit of a lifetime of practice
and he replied
an appropriate response.
An appropriate response.
I've always found this terse and pithy
quote to be very useful because it highlights
the reality that one of the most
important fruits of Dharma practice is a transformation
of how intentions and actions arise
in the mind and in our heart.
The freedom that the Buddha spoke about was in large measure
freedom from the effects of greed and hatred and delusion.
When the heart is free of those things
the way we respond to what's happening around us
has been transformed and has a base note
of benevolence about it but is customized to the situation.
This response I think captures a lot of what the Buddha was pointing at.
The Buddha talked about
intention and how intentions arise in our mind
in a lot of ways and one of the ways was with the concept of karma
or karma in Pali.
In the West this idea sometimes misunderstood
as some form of cosmic justice where people
and things eventually get punished for it.
But the Buddha had something much more simple and direct
in mind although subtle which is that whenever we act
in the world there are intentions behind them
and sometimes we're not really clearly aware of what they are.
We'd rather not know and we tell ourselves our intentions are one thing but really there was something else.
But it's the actual intentions behind our actions
that influence our future life.
That's the way that the Buddha generally
meant his teachings about karma.
It's not some kind of force in the universe
or force outside of us. It's the simple relationship
of what activates in our minds and motivates actions
and then who we are in the future.
It shapes who we are in the next
mind moments and in the next days and weeks and months.
I'm going to share my screen and just show you a couple of suttas
that illustrate this.
This is a sutta called the penetrative sutta and it's much longer
than this but this excerpt is just pithy and I enjoy it.
The Buddha says, intention I tell you is karma.
Intending one does karma by way of body
speech and intellect.
The karmic results are not
from the outcome of our actions.
If a surgical patient
dies in spite of a surgeon's best efforts to save them
this doesn't produce bad karma for the surgeon.
If the surgeon had been careless or
neglectful or even malicious in his actions then that's
bad karma. It's the intention not the outcome.
The intention is what arises in the mind and leaves a trace
that influences us in the future.
There's another way that the Buddha taught about
the importance of the intentions behind
our actions of body speech and mind.
The sutta on the two kinds of thought.
A mendicant by the way is a monk if you're not familiar with this usage.
Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers
becomes their hearts inclination.
They often think about and consider
cruel thoughts, their mind inclines to cruel thoughts.
Whatever a mendicant thinks about
and considers becomes their hearts inclination.
They think about and consider thoughts of good will,
mind inclines to thoughts of good will.
They often think about and consider thoughts of harmlessness, the mind inclines to thoughts of harmlessness.
Yeah.
So this principle
I'm going to stop sharing for a moment.
It's very similar to a fundamental principle in neuroscience
which is summarized as neurons and brain cells
that fire together, wire together.
What this means is that whenever an intention, body, speech, or mind
is activated in the brain, it strengthens the connections
between the neurons that embody those intentions.
And by strengthening those connections, that type of intention
or similar intentions will be prioritized.
They'll be stronger, they'll be more likely to show up in a similar situation.
Let me
actually have another sutra I want to show you.
Buddha also spoke about the importance of
the practice of reflection and how that
can affect our intentions. This is one of several sutras where the Buddha
was instructing his son, Rahula.
Here he's asking him, what do you think Rahula? What is a mirror for?
And he answers, for reflection, sir.
In the same way Rahula, bodily actions, verbal actions, and mental actions
are to be done with repeated reflection.
Whenever you want to do a bodily action, you should reflect on it.
This action I want to do, would it lead to self-affliction, the affliction
of others, or to both? While you're doing
a bodily action, reflect on it. Is it leading to self-affliction,
the affliction of others, or to both? Having done
a bodily action, you should reflect on it. Did it lead to self-affliction?
Did it lead to the affliction of others, or to both?
Thus, Rahula, you should train yourself. I will purify my bodily actions,
verbal actions, mental actions, through repeated reflection.
That's how you should train yourself.
Excuse me.
So the Buddha teaches that
one can purify one's actions through repeated reflection.
And one reason for this, of course, is that
when you think about it, and think about if it's harming yourself or others,
it might bring closer to conscious awareness
that maybe what you're doing isn't a good thing to be doing, and it will
change your motivation. But there's another thing here that
is particularly interesting from the point of view of neuroscience, that he talks about
after an action has been carried out, after you've done something, remembering it
and reflecting on it, can actually change
the memory trace for that action intention
and can change its influence on future experience and future actions and intentions.
And I want to talk about how this is sort of
fundamental to the way people think about memory now, particularly in the context of
psychotherapy and helping people overcome the effects of past
experiences. But before I expand on that,
I want to bring in a related Buddhist idea, which is
that of the alaya. And this is not from
the earliest Indian Buddhist tradition. It's
an Indian Buddhist tradition, but it's from about 700 years later, after the
time of the Buddha, from a school of Buddhism called Yogachara.
And they introduced this somewhat more explicit
way of thinking about karma based on the idea
of the alaya consciousness. In the word alaya
means store or storehouse. And
it's a word that we're familiar with in the West because of the mountain range, the
Himalayas. It's part of the word that names that mountain
range. Him means snow. And the Himalayas
are where the snow is stored.
But in the Yogachara tradition, it's where the traces
of past experience are stored in the mind.
They called it the alaya consciousness
to the best of my understanding because they
called everything consciousness. So just like they called
vision, eye consciousness, they called this memory
storehouse the alaya consciousness.
So in its simplest forms, it's a place in the mind where traces of our past
experiences are stored in a dormant or latent state.
And they can reappear in present moment experience
when conditions trigger them as
to arise. And in the latent state the Yogachara
is called the seeds, the karmic seeds in the alaya.
And when it showed up in the present because it was triggered by something
that was the ripening of the fruit of karma.
Now I
gather that in later Mahayana traditions the
alaya consciousness has other
types of meanings. And I'm honestly not very familiar with
them. And I gather it's sometimes used to explain the mechanics
of multiple lives. But I'm not talking about anything
that goes that far. Just the basic concept of a
storehouse for the traces of our past experiences.
The other thing that's a little different about the Yogachara
view of the alaya is that it doesn't focus exclusively
or primarily on intentions. It focuses on all aspects of experience.
Which is much like the way
neuroscientists would think about memory.
And really biologists in general are very
happy with the concept of a storage
system for latent information that can come back when needed. Because this is
basically what DNA is. It's our evolutionary karma
and we're all
inherit a raft of it. And it's very active while we're
growing as an embryo and a fetus. And
many of our genes become latent as
when we're fully grown and developed. But they don't go away
and they can be reactivated. And this happens all the time.
If the weather gets really cold, certain genes wake up and they do things to
help you generate warmth. If you make a transition
from a sedentary lifestyle to a lifestyle with a lot of exercise, certain genes
turn on and they deal with that and they cope with that extra demand.
I'm sure you know this, but that's good for you.
This happens even with meditation practice. Certain things get
turned on when one adopts a new
regular practice. Certain potentials that were latent
become activated. So this is a very agreeable concept to
biologists. But for neuroscientists
and psychiatrists and psychologists, the thing about memory
and for our experiences of our life, especially our
early life and feelings and beliefs
and things that happen to us, not just from our own
intention, although that's very important, but
sometimes things happen to us that have nothing to do with what we intended and they affect us.
And basically neuroscientists call
this neuroplasticity, of which memory is
the sort of common sense expression of it.
And I want to talk about how that's embodied and I'm going to share my
screen again.
So this is a sketch of an
embryonic brain of a human.
The brain is the part above the spinal cord, so there's the hind brain,
the little bulge, and the midbrain, another bulge, and then the
forebrain, which has two subunits.
And then as the human develops and grows into maturity,
the brain looks like this and the forebrain and the human has become very large.
The midbrain stays very small
and the hind brain grows a bit and
it sort of looks like this. And while this embryonic brain
on the left looks actually not that different from the
embryonic brain of a salamander or a fish or any
vertebrate, it's what happens during development that makes
the difference. And so in fish, the hind brain
stays the largest and in birds, the midbrain becomes
as big or bigger than the forebrain, but in mammals, we're a very
forebrain oriented branch on the tree of life,
of animal life. But
the point I want to make is that each of these sort of subbrains
has the capacity to
sense and perceive what's happening in the world, has some capacities for that
for knowing how to care about it, is this good or bad, what's happening,
and doing something about it, responding, generating
intentions from the most primitive unconscious intentions to fully
conscious aware intentions from the cerebral cortex.
So these are functioning subunits that cooperate
to create a useful organ
for governing our behavior.
And all of these different circuits in the brain and many subcircuits within these
different elements of the brain are capable of remembering
and they're remembering different ways. In the forebrain we have a lot
of conscious memories. In the midbrain
and hindbrain and deeper parts of the forebrain, the diencephalon,
the memories are not conscious. Some
parts of the brain are active all the time.
Other parts of the brain are sort of waiting to be needed.
They have different neurotransmitters and the dynamics of their memories are
really different. So there isn't one set of rules that governs memory for
all these regions.
But we know there are many different kinds of memory and that's related to the different
manifestations of brain tissue in our system.
And the ones on the left here,
declarative, explicit, these are memories that we are fully conscious of
and we can put them into words. That's why they call it declarative. You can say
what just happened, your immediate working memory
or what happened last week or what you know about the world, your semantic memory.
These implicit memories are not declarative
that they're hard to talk about. How to ride a bicycle. This is sort of the motor
or muscle memory of procedural memory.
Perceptual memory alerting to discern differences in what you see and hear.
A musician has developed, has a lot of perceptual memory for shades of
difference in musical tones, conditioning, etc.
They're all different. But what I want to talk about
is episodic memory also called autobiographical memory that
primarily involves the hippocampus and the thalamus and cortex.
And what I'll say about it is not going to be
true in detail for all these other types of memory, but the general principles
I think will be the same.
So what episodic memory is
is memory for the specific episodes of our experience. So
if I asked you what did you have for breakfast this morning, your mind could
go back and recreate that situation, hopefully.
And you know the answer to that. If I asked you where was your favorite vacation
in the last decade, that should pop up in your
mind. And the characteristic, the defining characteristic
of episodic memories is that they are situated. That is, they have
autobiographical context, who was there, where it was,
when it was, how you felt about it.
It's a rich sort of elaborated memory scene.
And this is different from, for example, semantic memories.
If I were to ask you what's the capital of Canada
you might know it's Ottawa without ever having been there.
So there's no autobiographical context. You probably don't remember when
in the fifth grade you learned that.
It's not autobiographical. It's really factual.
It's abstract. It's cognitive.
So some basic
principles about episodic memories. And this actually
applies, as far as I know, to all forms of memory.
As the memories are formed, they're shaped by things we already know.
They're already part of our alaya, if you will, or how the
brain, and this is in a grown person.
It's shaped by internal information. It's also true that
episodic memories and all memories didn't evolve to accurately
record the past. They evolved to meaningfully guide our behavior
going forward. So they're not archives.
They're guidebooks. And if the meaning
of an event, an episode that's been remembered in this kind of memory,
if that meaning changes, the memory itself changes.
And if one reframes or changes the perceived context of a remembered
event, its meaning can change.
So I'd like to illustrate a couple of features
of episodic memory. And I'm not
going to actually ask you to take this memory test, but I'm just going to tell you what it would be like if you did.
A lot of studies like this are done on college
sophomores. So I'd ask people to listen to a list of 15 words
without writing them down. And then when the list is finished, have them
write them down. And I would read the words from the list.
Bed, rest, awake, tired, dream,
nap, snooze, blanket,
doze, slumber, snore,
wake, peace, yawn, and
drowsy.
This might not be the best word list to use in a Zoom talk where you don't want people to fall asleep.
But anyway, if you were to give that
word list and then wait about 15 seconds and have them do something to distract them
from just saying the words over and over again in their mind. And then
that is, in other words, entrust that material to episodic memory,
not just hold it in active working memory. And then write them down
after it's gone through the little bit of filtering that working memory, that episodic memory
does.
About half of people would write down that they remembered hearing the word sleep,
even though it's not on the list. Now you can see
that the word sleep is very strongly suggested by this,
the gist of this word list. And episodic memory
is most interested in the meanings of things, the gist of an
episode that's prioritized. And the longer this
material is processed in these episodic memory circuits that I'll talk about in a little
more detail, the stronger that tendency to prioritize meaning becomes.
And in fact, if you
do this memory test on people and then have them
go home and have sleep through the night and come back in the
morning, the percentage of people who remember the word sleep is even greater. And that's
because one of the things that happens during sleep is our memories are sort of refined
and enhanced and consolidated and compressed a little bit.
And this meaning principle is a bigger part of what we're left
with. And people at first called this
a false memory, but I think that
people don't do that so much anymore because that implies that there are some
kinds of memories that are accurate. But
that's not true. All memory is about
meaning. It's not about archiving. That doesn't
mean that memories are not useful and that you can't rely on them. They are
useful. There's always
something that's wrong in any detailed memory.
It's just not what it's prioritizing. So it's better
to call this a memory illusion. And it just illustrates
how memory works. There's nothing wrong with us for having these
memory illusions. And it's sort of helpful. It's a little bit
freeing to sort of know this.
Another kind of episodic memory is
called a flash bulb memory.
It's not really a different type of memory. It's just episodic memories that are really vivid
and strong and usually rich
with emotional meaning. And people say,
they remember them really well. And a classic example is
the events of September 11th, 2001.
A number of memory researchers studied how
folks remembered those experiences. And
37% of Americans said that a year later said that they remembered
exactly where they were and what they were doing the moment they heard about the
attacks. I remember that exactly as well.
So what makes some episodic memory so vivid and clear
and produces a sense of such great confidence that you've
remembered it exactly as it happened. The emotional
arousal associated with it, the meaningfulness of it. And
if it's a memory that one has frequently recalled, and I know many people
spoke about the events of September 11th, and other important
life events get talked about and recalled. And those three
factors together can lead to a feeling of
very clear memory.
One of the memory research groups that
studied this interviewed some undergraduates
within a week of the attacks and wrote down
everything they said about where they were, who they were with, what they were doing.
And then got them back in the lab again and asked them those same
questions a year later. And their descriptions
agreed a little over 60% of the
things they said were the same as what they said the first time, or similar enough to sound
like the same memory. But it's a little under 40% of the things they
said had changed during that time.
And this is how
memory is, especially memories that are recalled frequently talked about.
You went over to your best friend's house and you talked about it and they said what they were
doing and things start to get a little muddled
and the memory changes.
So how does this happen?
How do memories change over time and often become less
accurate than we subjectively think they are?
And I think a good explanation for this or a good way of
thinking about it comes from current thinking about what happens in the
circuits of the brain as memories are formed and reformed
over time. And I'm going to go through that in a little bit of detail.
But there are three principles that I would like to underscore.
One is that, I don't mean three principles, three phases of
memory. The first phase is when things are happening, the present moment
experience. The second phase, immediately after
and up to a couple of weeks, is a period when the memory
traces labile. It can be easily updated, especially in
the first hour or two, and modified and
crystallized and consolidated and it gradually becomes a stable store.
And in the stable store for episodic memory, it doesn't change
for long periods unless it's retrieved or
there's a gradual decay of forgetting.
A different way of thinking about these three phases,
graphically, present moment experience, all of the mental
content, our actions, our feelings, our perceptions
of the present moment experience are continually
recorded by the labile storage
circuits of the brain, which is basically the hippocampus for
episodic memory. And in this short-term store, this labile
store, it can be updated, but a process occurs that
translates it into a stable store that is not labile and is
resistant to change except for forgetting.
An important point is that
if you take this
stable memory that's resistant to change, but you
retrieve it, you're making it labile again.
And it's only the labile traces that can be updated or modified
or changed in a way that enhances
its useful meaning.
So I'm going to just show you a little bit
how this happens and I'm going to use some sort of cartoon illustrations of
what's going on in the brain. So an ongoing experience, present moment experience
neuroscientists think about this as being represented as patterns of
activation in brain areas, especially cortical modules for conscious
experience. And so the areas that are bright or areas that are processing
this visual area, the person's probably seeing something, they might be hearing
something in this auditory area, they're
thinking about what they might do in this action planning region.
So all these different things are activated in a moment of
experience. And retrieving a memory
involves sort of recreating or simulating that pattern of activation.
If you produce the same activation at a lower level, you'll have a memory
of the original experience. So one of the key
things is knowing which things were activated and how to
connect them so they activate at the same time. And the
hippocampus, that's its job. It's really
a unique part of the forebrain.
It's kind of always recording. The recording button is always on
in the hippocampus. And it stores codes
of what's happening now, what happens next, and what pattern of activation is there.
And it can, it's connected widely to the cortex and
can simulate the pattern of activation that was present
an hour ago when you were doing
whatever you were doing. And so it creates kind of a
code to simulate that pattern. And it uses that to
retrieve a recent memory, a fresh memory.
And that code kind of expires after about
a month, really never lasts longer than about four weeks. The hippocampus
needs the space to keep track of what you're doing now.
So it transfers that memory to the cortex.
And it has to teach the cortex how to
simulate that pattern of activation itself.
So I'll just walk you through that again.
If you don't have a hippocampus, your fresh memories are very
weak. And someone who has damaged the hippocampus,
the things that have happened in the last week to four weeks,
they just can't remember it all, not in an episodic memory sense.
You need the hippocampus early on. And then as time goes by
and a lot of this happens during sleep, when the brain
is not otherwise busy, the hippocampus is teaching the cortex about
what happened when you were awake. And it takes
time. And over the course of up to four weeks, the hippocampus
is no longer needed to represent that pattern of connections.
I'd like to illustrate this a different way. Everybody
has different preferences for how they input information. So
in terms of a block diagram, a present moment
experience, our sensegates are letting in information about the
world. And we have all the scondas are active, our
intentions, our feelings, our perceptions, our consciousness. And it goes into
this labile short-term store in the hippocampus.
And the first couple of hours are the most flexible.
We all have this experience where something unusual happens
and shortly after we're saying, what just happened?
We're going over it again. And it's coming from the labile store back into
the present moment. And we're looking at it and trying to figure it out and put it back in the short-term
memory. There's a lot of changes that occur early on in memory
encoding. And then there's a less
highly labile phase, but still not
stable, where things are consolidated. And especially after the first night
sleep, the memory becomes a little bit less easily modified, less malleable.
And then by four weeks, it enters
the stable store of long-term memory.
But at any point, we can retrieve it.
We can retrieve memories from a month ago. We can retrieve memories from
a week ago. We can retrieve memories from five minutes ago. And whenever
we do their present moment experience, and this whole
cascade begins again, especially if the retrieval
was part of something meaningful. We talked to our best
friend about something that happened two weeks ago, and it
really mattered to us. That episode of retrieving it and discussing
it and thinking about and reflecting on it, this is what
reflection is. It reactivates, makes labile
again, something that was in a fixed state as a karmic seed.
And it becomes alive again.
And it can be modified by virtue of the reflections that occur
or the meaning that's created in this present moment experience.
And this maps very well onto the way
the Alaya metaphor talks about this.
These are the stable stores of the karmic seeds.
Retrieval, reactivation, remembering is the karmic fruit.
It's when
these karmic seeds ripen, those are the times they're susceptible
to being exhausted or destroyed in the metaphorical language
of the Alaya.
And for the point of view of like psychotherapy, when memory traces are
reactivated in present experience, they can be reframed
in a way that actually modifies the long-term
store of that memory. The meaning changes, the memory is changed.
Quite commonly, memory traces are reactivated.
Even troublesome ones, ones that cause distress, they're reactivated.
But in the language of the Alaya, they're replanted, unchanged.
People just react the same way.
And that, if anything, solidifies the seed.
If it changes, a new stable trace
slightly modified, replaces the old one, and over time
can completely change. This doesn't happen like it with one setting.
Often it takes many repetitions.
But this is one way I think about
the sort of the karmic metaphors versus the psychology and neuroscience
metaphors. Karmic seeds are in the long-term store. They ripen
when something triggers them and they're either
replanted, largely unchanged, or there's a mindful
and compassionate reflection that's occurring.
And this modifies them even to the point of exhausting them, destroying
those seeds completely. When they're reconsolidated with a fundamentally
different meaning.
So you can see that
this has some implications for dharma practice,
for well-being, certainly for psychotherapy, if you happen to be in that business.
When karmic seeds of
difficult experiences arise, are triggered
and ripen, that's a challenge for people. And often they just
get replanted without much change. The same
reactivity pattern arises.
But, so it's not necessarily bad because it's only when
reactivation occurs, there's even the possibility
of changing the long-term store, the seed form
of these traces. But it requires reflection and reframing
really penetrating the meaning
that's been taken and seeing if that's really the right meaning for that
experience. So it's a time of
opportunity. And
when I was treating people with anxiety disorders, like agoraphobia
for example, some people would be in a situation that triggered
their fears. And it was very unpleasant for them, but
what they discovered over time with
cognitive behavioral therapy, that if they stayed in the frightening
situation, their fear would eventually subside.
And when that happens, the meaning of that experience
is different than it had been in the karmic seed. And gradually
a new set of memories would replace the
fear memories that were triggered by certain situations.
And some people who
were making really good progress began to feel a sense of
mastery and a sense of wanting another fear
to be triggered so that they could work with it.
It started to seem like, oh, yeah!
Are there any more of these? What else have you got? Let's see it
and let's see if the meaning can change.
Now, I don't want to make it sound too easy, but
the key, of course, is meeting the experience with
mindfulness and compassion and wisdom. And it really, it's not
something that you just do with strangers.
You do it with yourself, with self-compassion, or you do it with a trusted mentor
or therapist.
I think there's
another implication of these metaphors
about episodic memory and memory in general.
And that is, I found this really striking for
me personally. Sometimes we have things
that happen that aren't troublesome, but in fact they're profound and deeply affecting and deeply meaningful.
And sometimes this happens with meditation practice or just in life.
I think it's wise to
treat them with special care, especially when they're fresh. I know I
felt this way instinctively as a young person not to talk
about things too soon. Because the wisdom
in the mind that has nothing to do with our personalities
knows how to settle these things down.
I guess I had the experience of talking too soon about something
with someone who wasn't really interested. And it just
sort of diminished.
It replanted a different seed that wasn't a good one.
So it's wise to allow these things to settle. And I think this is
relevant in psychotherapy practice where sometimes
a person is really touched on something important.
And then the hour is over. And I sometimes would suggest
if they don't have to go right back to work to spend some time just letting things settle.
Because this process is a wise process.
And it's not something that you can do a better job of
by talking about it, except in very special settings.
Well, I think that's all I've got to say
about memory. And
if people have questions, be happy to respond to them.
You can just raise your zoom hand.
Paul.
Where did Paul go?
That's okay. Let's let Wayne go first.
And then I'll go later. Thank you so much.
Hi.
I am 64 years old
and I had a stroke in the HIPAA
campus, I'm told, of my brain
about 30 years ago. And it was a rare
part of the brain to have a stroke. And I know
the hospital put me in touch with some people from UC Davis. And I saw
three people at the Veterans Hospital
halfway between Davis and where I lived. And
I'm just, I wonder, like I now teach autistic
middle schoolers and I have six students in one of my class.
And I've been with them now for three months, but I list their names
on the wall so that I can remember six names.
Because sometimes I just forget them.
But there's a part of me that in terms of my practice, I just kind of will go, well, shit, it's hopeless.
I can't remember anything. And I'm just
wondering if you can comment. You know, one other interesting thing is these
three researchers I saw said I was the first person they'd met
that had a stroke in this part of the brain that wasn't blind in half of each
eye. So very fortunate.
Yeah. Yeah, that does sound like an unusual
presentation. I'm sorry that you've had to go through that.
Well, you know, I talked about this
episodic memory in which the hippocampus is super important
for. But there are many other kinds of memory. And
you know, our practice shapes
who we are and how we respond going forward
even without having conscious episodic memories.
We are shaped in other ways. Emotional memories
procedural memory is often called muscle memory. But
it's more than just learning how to ride a bike or throw a Frisbee.
It's learning sequences.
This follows this follows this follows that. That kind of thing that's not
quote episodic, be hard to verbalize. But one learns
to act in different ways and situations through that
kind of sequencing memory.
Relationships, the way one conducts oneself in relationship is a different kind of
learning and memory than episodic. So there
are many other avenues of transformation
through to memory and
what we do in our present life. I don't know if that's
responsive to your question.
Yeah, it's helpful.
And I said, I think, you know, I just think something
this is helping because at least it do nothing else
it relieves anxiety and calms me down and makes
school much less likely to get
reactive to one of the 700 middle schoolers
doing crazy things.
Yes, thank you. Nancy
Thank you.
Thank you. Gosh, I have so many questions.
I'm not sure where to start.
I used to be a criminal defense attorney
and a lot of what you're talking about in terms of
a memory and how they change over time
certainly makes me think of witnesses
that have testified in a number of cases and how
when witnesses are
what we call it interfered with but when
suggestions are made to them by any party that
can really color what their original memory
was. And the other thing
I thought was fascinating when we were talking about
the karmic background with
intention is that
that also plays out in the legal world
in terms of mens rea and that the intention
especially in some of the more violent crimes
like murder or for instance conspiracy
all of those intentions make
the crime much more severe.
And so it's just an interesting
take on what you're talking about today.
I do have just a general question about how it
is that like my sister and I grew up in the same household
and I have a really great memory of when
we were children and she has like a
non-existent memory of when we were children.
And how is it that our brains are so different
that our memories are that different
of the same life?
Well, yeah, people are really different
and the brain is a really complicated
organ that starts out as a few cells
built out into this really incredibly complex
thing. And the diversity is
probably a feature and not a bug.
Every generation has very diverse minds and brains in it
even if they're siblings. That's how I think about it.
Thank you.
Yeah, Sandy
Hi, good afternoon.
I'm a psychotherapist working with highly
suicidal teens. So needless to say I run into
a lot of trauma and what I'm
trying to work with with my clients is because
they want to try to remember everything that happened and I try to
encourage them that it's not important to remember every
detail, but rather how it affects their behavior
how it affects them internally, where do they feel it internally.
And my question to you is
when trauma happens to a youth versus
an adult, is it the episodic memory
that makes them remember it differently?
Like I'm finding a lot of the teens, a lot of the children, don't remember
all the details almost like it's like the brain is protecting
them because it is so traumatic and if they felt every
essence of what happened to them, they would literally
feel like they would explode, whereas adults kind of shut down
a little bit, but they do tend to remember a lot of what happened.
Yeah,
that's a great question.
I can start by saying that when I was trained actually
in the 80s in psychiatry
it was a more siloed academic world
then and I was an adult psychiatrist and I really don't have a lot of
experience with children, adolescents and adults, so I
can't speak from working with young
children who've been traumatized, I've just never had that experience.
The principle I think that you articulate is a reasonable one, which has
children are more likely to
wall off memories
I think because of the potential
disruptive effect of them. And yet
if someone who's been traumatized wants to, you know, is ready to
go over those memories with a safe
and trained caregiver,
that is a good thing, you know, that usually leads to
some resolution, some replanting of different seeds
that are going to be less troublesome going forward, and it may take time to remember all the
things. I think the best indicator of whether it's essential
that all the details are remembered is how much those reactive
seeds have been exhausted. If they're exhausted without having to remember
exactly what happened first or second, then
that's not a problem. But sometimes there are details that remain
like a little source of inflammation
and then until they are brought into
the present moment, they can't be changed, and so it's a bit
of a detective process sometimes.
Adjust the mindful relaxation and reflection
eventually will bring to light most of those seeds.
Tony. Hey Rick, I remember
the movie Inside Out, which was a cartoon
story about internal life of a young girl.
And one of the things that was going on in the movie was
everybody was trying to keep sadness away from recalling
the memories that were in the
I don't even know how to describe it in the movie,
but it would have been the alaya. And when those memories
were touched, the sadness as I recall was blue
and the memory started to turn blue and there was
an effort to try to distract
that behavior. And I'm wondering if this
same, whether that's correct neuroscience it sounds like,
but whether recalling things when you are
feeling joyful or happy,
whether that's a good time to explore
in mindfulness, to call up some of those experiences and recall them
if one is feeling mindful and to intentionally call them up.
What do you think?
Yeah, I think there's a time and a place for
retrieving and reactivating challenging memories
and feeling good, feeling confident, feeling happy is
a nice qualifier for that. But I would also
say having the freedom to not have to cope, you know, take care
of your infant child, you know, I mean if you have
some space, that's really important.
So like if I don't remember those details of the movie,
but you wouldn't necessarily, you might want to
suppress the recollection of a difficult
memory if you didn't have time for it right now, you know, there'll be a better time
later. And you know, the brain uses sleep
to do some of this reprocessing, which is a time that you've got time, you know,
you're not busy. So it activates
those circuits below kind of in dream consciousness.
We were interested in it a little bit.
So yeah, I think one should use
discernment in deciding when to open up that box,
you know.
Paul.
Quickly, and we don't need to dwell on this, but if you, I personally
had COVID earlier this year, and I think I have seen a little
decrease in memory, nothing really to worry about, but I was wondering if you had any ideas
on how to improve it. I know that's kind of a lame question in this context, but I ask it anyways.
Thank you. How to improve your memory? Given COVID, for example,
and so forth. Yeah, well, if you're fully recovered,
there are things that have
beneficial effect on the hippocampus. And one of them
is aerobic exercise. And so
I can recommend that if you're, if there's no reason not to
for you. And regular, you know, I mean, this is just your
standard prescription, but you know, 20 to 30 minutes
four or five times a week of
exercise that gets your heart rate up above
the 65% of your maximum, which is
220 minus your age.
That has a well documented
beneficial effect on a number of brain circuits, but in particular the hippocampus.
So that might have a restorative effect.
Great.
Yeah, and you know, sleep is also
really important. And it's not just because of the information
processing that occurs in sleep that does, it has
an important role in memory, episodic memory, but because sleep is when
the trash gets taken out of the cellular channels
in between your neurons and your glia, those little channels
dilate like 300% or something, I forget exactly
the proportions. And fluid washes through there, and that only happens
during deep sleep. So you really want to get plenty of deep sleep if you've had
a viral infection that does affect the central nervous system. And many
do. Flu virus also does that. And apparently
COVID does as well. So make sure you get plenty of deep sleep. One nice thing about
exercising is it promotes deep sleep later when you go to bed.
Fantastic. Thank you so much.
You're welcome. Mark.
I'm a bit confused about
unconscious intentions. So until
recently, I thought intention is a conscious thing. If I'm
say somebody is intent on harming or intent of doing good,
especially also in the context of the first
step of the eight full path.
And so I can work with my conscious intention, but so
is there a
interaction between unconscious and conscious intention or
how do you work with unconscious intention and how important is it
and so on. Thank you for that question.
I think that that's a really important
point you're raising. So the word intention
gets used in different ways. And one of the ways it's
maybe the most common way it's used is the way you're describing it. That it is, it would be
conscious. It means conscious intentions, but I think the Buddha used it
in a broader sense. And I was trying to use it in a broader sense.
And I would like to say something about consciousness too, because that's a word that gets used in
different ways. And I personally don't subscribe to the idea that
it's either or, conscious or unconscious. I think
consciousness is a spectrum. And some things are
apprehended with conscious
awareness. And other things are a little trickier, slipperier, harder to
see clearly. And some things will never be able to be conscious of
in ordinary mind states. So that's a spectrum
intention is a spectrum. And what I think is being
pointed out here is that and something I'll be talking about in the second half of this
is it's a valuable practice to become
more aware of more intentions and often
there's more than one intention arising in this complicated brain of ours.
And but only one of them usually is wins the competition
and governs our behavior at that moment.
But it one of the benefits of mindfulness is
and especially a sort of a broad awareness is becoming
aware of different intentions that are bubbling up.
Even though you don't act on all of them,
they incline the mind a little ways, even when they bubble up into thought.
So part of the practice is
having better skill at noticing what the actual intentions are.
And I say this in a no blame format,
these intentions arise. It's not really personal. Nothing we do really
is. I mean, if we're conscious of it, we're more responsible for it.
But even if we're unconscious of it, if we had
the skill to see those intentions arising that we might not choose to act on them.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, so I'm still struggling with it. But yes, and I think this is
helpful. Definitely will put me on the way, especially the
what you're saying, the, you know,
consciousness and intentions being a question of degree
or spectrum. And yeah,
the awareness of what's bubbling up. Yes, very helpful.
Thank you.
Stand.
Hi, thank you. I have a very good friend who is in her mid
seventies and she's been disturbed a lot in her
life. And she has taken up the practice in the last four or
five years of something called reparenting as
part of the adult children of alcoholics to
cover over the terrible upbringing that she had.
And she does seem to get a great deal of comfort out of this.
So I looked at some of the workbooks that they went through and
saw her actually practice this. And it seemed to grieve
for a great deal of comfort. But it's very curious
to me because she still seems to remember and go back to
some of the bad things that happened to her in her youth.
So what is, what do you think of the process of something like that
where you try and reinvent imaginatively
a loving parent as opposed to a hateful
one?
Yeah, interesting. I am not aware of this
method, this technique, this therapeutic
technique. So I can't
I don't have much insight to offer into that particular technique. But I guess
one question I have is, is this entirely a
self-help thing or does she work with a skilled
clinical provider?
No, it's part of the extension of alcoholics in the
adult children of alcoholics. And this is a
branch out of that. So there are people who kind of
run these programs and they have some kind of
training but it's not official
like what you guys have.
Right. Yeah, well there's a lot of diversity in what we have too.
So that's encouraging. So there
might be some people who develop some discernment
and experience with this process that are helping her. I think if you have a good
guide, I mean the
principles sound reasonable and should be helpful.
But it would depend upon what kind of guidance
you're getting from the person you're working with.
Okay, thank you. Yeah.
Let's see.
Deborah.
Great. Good afternoon.
Thank you so much for your talk. I want to say two things specifically
before question. Thank you for kind of your synthesis,
your kind of putting things side by side and just sharing that with us.
It was super helpful. And I really like the implications for practice
and the positive note about
this is when there's an opportunity. So I just love that.
Okay, I'm looking at my screenshot of one of your slides and it's
step by step and the looping.
And my question is, I guess,
best way to say it is kind of the how much at any one point in time,
how many of these at any one point in time
is a lot. Not just one at a time, not just
yesterday's upsetting event, but at any point in time just a lot.
And a lot of it we're not aware of. So that I guess that's the question
and then related or subsequent question is, and so what is
the implication there for practice? And I guess
I'm thinking about the experience of, there might not be
anything going on, you're sitting, there's a lot, nothing
particularly, whatever, upsetting
or but during those times
as you're saying with compassion, you're sitting there, awareness and compassion, it's like you're doing the house
cleaning because there's a lot going on, but you're just
you're not aware and that's okay too, let the cleaning happen.
So anyway, those are my questions. Yeah, those
are great questions.
Yeah, so
when I think about this material or these insights
my mind often goes to the more traumatic situations
because that's really
important in people's lives, but that's not the only thing and I think as you're saying
in our regular practice, minor things come up
that where they could be transformed by
reflection, just in little ways, as they say, we often have a mixture
of intentions arising
in reflection, especially if things do pop
up during practice that there's some pressure for them that they're like they don't fit with
the rest of you, and so they're being
nominated for retrieval and then you reflect
on them and you say, if I had looked at that situation this way
I could have been kinder, and it's not a huge deal, but it's
part of the process of practice and
purification and freedom really,
freedom from those tendencies.
So when you ask the question
how much, I'm not sure I got that completely.
Kind of like how many, you're looking at this like this memory
of this karmic seed coming to fruition, it feels like any point in time
there's probably 15 of those bubbling around.
Yeah, so how does one prioritize them?
Yeah, and again
the setting, the time and place is important.
If you are a working person, for example, you're not just going to be doing this at work.
So what are the time and
I think they set priorities on their own. It might depend
on the conditions around you, what's coming up for you this week.
Certain seeds will be advanced
in anticipation of what you're doing in the coming week
because they involve similar situations.
So yeah, I think it's not a
something that happens all at once. I see it as a gradual
process and the really nice thing about having a regular practice
is that you have the time and you have
many opportunities. As I was saying, every day the opportunity.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Wayne. Hi again.
I'm wondering a couple of years ago, you're passing on a teacher that I sometimes sit with
recommended that people
reach out to someone that they've
hurt, or they feel that they've hurt from the past.
I did that
for someone that I hadn't seen in 40 years
and she was very appreciative.
I'm wondering, first of all, if that's any
kind of practice in Buddhism maybe other people know
and also maybe
it's something just to think of people I've hurt
and just think about it and
practice loving kindness or something because I wouldn't want to
just reach out to somebody I haven't talked to in 45 years and
say something. Have you ever heard of that kind of practice
or? Well, it's part of the 12 step
practice, the programs and
I've never recommended it to my patient. I haven't worked in the
area of addiction but I gather that it's very powerful
and I can see why it would be and sometimes people don't mind
but I guess one thing I would like to clarify and
you made it clear that you understood this as well but it isn't to be forgiven
it isn't that how they respond
to you reaching out to them is crucial. I think the reason that it's powerful to reach
out to a person is that it really focuses your mind
because there's a real person there that you hurt
but if you could focus your mind without having them in front of you
that would work just as well in my view because the karma is internal
and when you fully retrieve
what you did and reflect on it
and you reflect just like Buddha advised Rahula on how it was
really harmful to another person and ultimately to yourself
you remember it as a mistake
that you don't want to do again and that changes
something I think it's a more complete accountability
Yeah, well one thing that's occurred in the last couple of years
since doing that I've gotten in touch with some people
that I was like very good friends with from through
high school but I've just not been in touch with them at all
and recently in talking to them it makes me realize their take on
reality and their historical memory is just completely
different than mine and just the constructs in my
mind are crazy or just different
Yeah, I'll just say one other thing
about that when I first became a psychiatrist
and people would talk to me about
things that happened I would sometimes think that
well that doesn't sound right, something about current events
that happened ten years ago I think that's not what happened but I realize it's not important
what's important is how they're remembering it
that's what's affecting them, there was no point in trying to
get people's memories to be accurate, get them to be
meaningful in a way that's not harmful to them
Anyway
Yeah, Doug
Thanks, it's good to see you, Rick
I have two things I wanted to mention
and it was sort of a comment of an interesting thoughts on it and another is
a more personal thing
Somebody was talking just a short while ago about visiting the past
and stuff and I don't know if you've ever run across this
but Jeanne Houston has a book out called The Possible
Human and one exercise in it is befriending the
child and the idea is that you pick
time in your past when you were a child and in
relatively receptive shape and imagine
yourself as an adult going back and befriending
yourself as a child because you would know
more about what's going on with that child than anybody in the world and then
just do this repeatedly and imagine going on walks and all kinds of things
as the way she described it is it doesn't change
past memories but it sets down another track
that if there were just one person in your life who really got who you were
while you're going through this trauma, what a difference that would make
and it kind of gave us an alternate path through which I found helpful
with a lot of mild stuff
I don't know if you have any comments on that
but I had another situation I just wanted to
say that sounds like a very constructive process
and yeah that sounds great
about 15 or 20 years ago I was in a bicycle accident
and so you talk about a hippocampus
that brought this all back to me and I was not
able to form any memories for longer than about two minutes
for about eight or nine hours
and my wife and my oldest son were there and I kept
asking them what happened and they
I think they were thinking they were worried they were going to have to stake me out in the backyard and throw food out
or something because I just couldn't hold anything
but it gradually came back
and so here I am all these years later in my mid-seventies
and I can feel my memory
sort of fading around the edges here and there
it's hard to hold stuff
and I'm just curious and interested as I deal with all this stuff
that whether
this is some residual stuff from that bike accident
that's showing up or how much of it's just kind of normal aging
and what if anything to do with it
and you kind of answered some of that earlier about aerobics and things like that
but I wanted to throw the specific ash of the sea if you had any thoughts about it
yeah
you know it
certainly it's characteristic of aging
to have that decline in episodic memory
and in terms of the head trauma
a little bit outside of my expertise to know the natural history of that
that I haven't
managed those kinds of problems in my own patients
it's always been neurologist to do that
so I don't have that direct experience from talking to 30 people over the last
40 years about the same problem and knowing what happened to them so I just don't know
it's
logical to me that especially because they have the campus is
it's kind of the canary in the mind
really but it's so active all the time that
if something compromises brain function it's the part that often
goes offline first
because it's operating near the limit of its capacity most
of the time so it's a vulnerable
area so it's not too surprising that it's often harmed
head injuries and that sort of thing but you know it
usually comes back and you just don't you have a period where it didn't
make the code for memories and so that period's gone
but once it's working again
it does its job
I'm not sure what else I can offer
in terms of caring for that part of the brain
thank you but my assumption has always been that
brain doesn't actually repair old
as much as it does compensate and rebuild around it
is that true or does it actually rebuild them
most of neuroplasticity is
remodeling the brain
it's guided by what the organism needs
so yes there's a lot of rerouting and rebuilding
but there are stem cells neurostem cells in the brain
and they're in two locations one of them is the hippocampus
because it's a region that has
the most demand on its information processing capacity of any part of the brain
it needs fresh cells so
the oldest humans that have ever donated their body
to science well into their 90s they have neurostem cells in their hippocampus
that are in the process of turning into new neurons
so it never stops you always get new baby neurons in your hippocampus
so that's good news and that's one of the things that exercise does
is it accelerates that process and more of those baby neurons
survive to maturity
are not sedentary in their life
thank you
I think I can just take two more and then we'll have to
let's take a break and move on
Nancy
I wanted to ask a question you talked a little bit about
neuroplasticity and
sort of re-routing
things that had to do with karmic memory
and I
have a chronic neurological condition that I've been doing
neuroplasticity retraining for a number of years now
and I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more
about
how neuroplasticity retraining or exposure
therapy would come up during meditation
how you would work with it during meditation
okay well
I'm not sure I know what this particular method is that you've been using
I mean neuroplasticity is a very general term so all the things that I spoke about
were forms of neuroplasticity and
reflection and reframing and changing the meaning of
memories that do arise is neuroplasticity but it sounds like you're talking about
something a little more specific and so I don't know
which type of memory you know it sounds like it's maybe not these
episodic memories that we've been focusing on but maybe more
I guess my question
my neurological condition really is vestibular
and so my neuroplasticity retraining
is sort of exposure therapy and retraining my brain
to find balance in a different way
but in terms of meditation
and dealing with dukkha and becoming more
aware of what
you're doing in meditation I'm wondering if you can talk
a little bit more about how neuroplasticity
relates to that experience
yeah well
yeah I mean
every moment of experience is
a moment of neuroplastic change your brain is always adjusting
itself in the face of what it's encountering in
experience and when that's done in the context of
mindfulness it's always a step in
the right direction in terms of those neuroplastic changes
it's like a universally beneficial factor to have mindfulness established
so that's a very general answer but it does apply
in terms of vestibular neuroplasticity
that is a problem I'm familiar with and
the vestibular apparatus is subject to injury or
slight change in how it's functioning and people have to relearn
where balance is and that's a
neuroplastic challenge and
it's important that the cause of the
change in vestibular function is stable if it's a stable change
your brain will accommodate to it eventually but it needs to have exposure
and exposure with a calm mind
is ideal and a confident mind is ideal but one thing that
accelerates neuroplastic change of that type is
arousal caring about what you're doing so I don't know what sort of
things you do for exposure but if you could do things that really matter to you
that also challenge your vestibular system it will have a synergistic effect
on the neuroplastic change there are many circuits actually
thinking about them in the next section that tell your brain
what's important and if your brain gets the message that what you're doing now is really important
it will be more neuroplastic during the time you do that
Meditation practice has been immeasurably
helpful so thank you
Paul, last question Paul
just quickly two things one I just again want to reiterate just thank you so much this is just awesome
how is memory literally stored
is it like a protein that's stored on a cell
help me understand a little bit better if you could please
a good question I forgot to say anything about that
mostly it's stored in terms of an anatomical change
a change in the connections between nerve
cells brain cells more generally but mostly nerve cells
and they can be very small changes
like the number of neuro transmitter
vesicles which are these tiny little bubbles
at the tips of neurons and you might have 500
of them before you learn something in this one location and after you
got a thousand of them so that connection will be a little stronger
it has more potency for making a connection with the next neuron
there are these little microstructural changes and the number of microstructural
changes that embody neuroplasticity
plasticity is very great there are many ways
that the brain changes its structure in order
to store what it's learned from experience
but mostly they have to do with the strength of connections
in circuits of nerve cells
got it perfect what are those bubbles called again vesicles neuro transmitter vesicles
little storage vesicles waiting to see if that
neuron needs to communicate to the next neuron and if it does they
float up to the surface and pop and release the neuro transmitter
that floods across the tiny cleft and tickles receptors
on the next neuron this all takes place in like 3 milliseconds
or less it was very fast that goes all the way back to what you
talked about in the very beginning of this in terms of intentions and sort of repetition
yeah that's right thank you
okay let's take a break
let's make it a 10 minute break and oh my goodness
it's 10 to 3 already could we just make it a 5 minute
break and then I'll get back to some more material for you
so I've got 251 so 256 we'll come back
is that alright good I'll see you then
yeah okay so
I want to talk about perception
and frame it in both terms of neuroscience and in
terms of the early Buddhist teachings and you know one of the primary
goals of Dharma practice
is to recognize and abandon tendencies
toward grasping and clinging that undermine our well-being
this is the source of our discomfort our suffering
some of these tendencies that are unskillful are conditioned
by cultural factors and things that
happen to us of course but some of them are just innate biological
tendencies and in some sense
you know the Dharma practice is like a workaround for the human predicament
or just the way we're designed
the Buddha sometimes talked about going against the stream
going against the stream of sort of conventional responses
in some ways our biology
and one of the things that
our biological tendencies are wonderful they help us survive
and that's how they evolve but they might not provide the best help
for other aspirations like an aspiration
to wisdom or to compassion or freedom
and so that's what the Buddha is teaching us is how to work with the situation
that we've been given
and some of the workarounds involve
our perceptions and the Buddha talked about perceptions
in a number of ways
but one of the most fundamental ones and I'm going to share my screen
again is as one of the aggregates
let me just put something up on the screen here
so
yeah so
there are many teachings in the early sutras about the five aggregates
skandhas or kandhas in Pali
and for those of you who may not be familiar with them I'll run through them form
which is the English translation of rupa refers to the body
and materiality in general and these aggregates together comprise pretty much everything we experience
materiality and our body
they deny is translated usually as feeling tone we experience feeling tones which
in the simplest sense are pleasant or unpleasant or in between
we have an effective response to experience
that's part of our lived life of our mental life
and then recognition or perception is the translation of
sanya and that's what I'm going to be talking about here and this is how we make
sense of our experiences how we construct meaning from experience
sankara is often translated as
intentions in the way I've been speaking about intentions earlier or fabrications
or volitional formations or choices some people translate as choices
this refers to the intentions that give rise to thoughts
speeds and actions they motivate how we
respond to the world and finally
to the mind or consciousness or awareness
this is what allows us to have direct conscious experience
so
all of our moments of experience have some elements from each of these categories
and the Buddha
taught us about noticing them there was an aid to notice these
different categories and then the way he applied it generally I'll talk about later
before I talk about the practical application of working with the skandhas
I just want to say the aggregates I just want to say that when I learned
about these and I already knew a lot about neuroscience I was really struck
by how similar this is to like this is like
a table of contents of a modern textbook of neuroscience
under form and rupa and materiality you've got
our sensory physiology and how our sense organs interact with the material world
and under fate and a feeling tone there's chapters in the
textbook about emotion and feelings and
all the emotional and affective responses it's a whole set of circuits
that do that and then sanya or recognition big parts
of the brain that's this main job is to construct perceptions
intentions that's the motor system and the planning system
and the areas that where different intentions
compete with each other and one wins and then becomes the source of an action
and vinyana there's always some chapters on consciousness
in these textbooks although those chapters are more
speculative because
neuroscience now although there's a lot of work in the area
of how consciousness is embodied there's not a lot of consensus
this hasn't reached a level of understanding that people agree
on unlike the case for the other three mental
aggregates that is feeling tone perception and intention
which I sometimes call when I'm speaking in the neuroscience language
call this a set of feeling tone evaluation it's this automatic
process that tells us what to care about and which way to care about
it and do I want more of this or I want less of this is this good for me or bad for me
pleasant or unpleasant important or not important
these are non-cognitive they're sort of more basic
fundamental evaluations that are engaged
in our nervous system so these three
aggregates are the focus of much study
in neuroscience and a lot of consensus and a lot of knowledge I'm going to talk about
a little bit about the perception
from a neuroscience perspective but I want to just show you a few other
things that illustrate
how contemporary the Buddha's insight was in dividing up experience
into these five categories I mean in neuroscience we would say
that the three middle ones that have highlighted that we understand pretty well
these are what any animal needs any animal with a brain
and in nature if you see
a creature with a brain it's a creature that moves around and you need a brain
to have complex behavior
and in order to have complex behavior you have to have
sense organs and perceptual circuits or perceptual capacities
to make sense of what's happening you have to have
evaluative capacities to know what to care about
what your goals are in your priorities and then you have to have the ability to plan and generate
action responses or to formulate not necessarily plan in a conscious sense
but to generate adaptive behavioral responses
and that's just most of that accounts for
the most elemental things that the brain does and I just love the parallel
with the Buddha's formulation
and someday if we understand consciousness better we'll put it on this graphic
but right now I would just say perceiving evaluating and intending is what
your brain is doing at the most basic level
oops
and this
triad of functions is reflected in the architecture
the design of the brain even at the largest scale
so here this is a picture of the human brain looking at the cerebral cortex
and the front part of it the frontal lobe it's specialized
for planning and generating intentions and carrying them out
behaving and the more posterior part behind
it in white shading are
perceptual cortices in the occipital for vision
the temporal cortex we're hearing and a lot of other additional higher level
visual processing and also memory
episodic memories in the temporal lobe and then in the parietal lobe where you have the body
senses touch and body awareness
kinesthetic awareness and also a lot of visual processing in the parietal lobe as well
but this part of the this half of the brain
is specialized for perceiving the front half for acting
and intending and planning it's not 100%
there are exceptions there are parts of the frontal lobes that have more of a perceptual function
and likewise in the posterior lobes more of a motor function but in
terms of what the local expertise is they're particularly good at
these functions the evaluative function on the other hand
is in the more primitive parts of the brain in a human being
and they're in the midline if you were to slice the brain down the center
and you'd see all the way down to the almost the spinal cord here the brain stem
the hind brain I should say a lot of these evaluative nuclei are in the most primitive
parts of the brain but some are in the cortex but they're in the midline of the cortex
and it's this is actually the most primitive part of the cortex if you look at
a rodent's brain it's mostly these
midline cortical structures are large and
the other that you know the things that are particularly big
in humans are not particularly big in a mouse
anyway at this macroscopic level
the Buddhist conception of the aggregates fits very well onto how we think
about how the brain's functions are segregated and also at a microscopic
level and I'm not going to spend much time on this complicated picture but
this is a slice through a human cerebral cortex it's a
six-layered structure the layers are numbered over here underneath them
is white matter but each layer has a different function and there are
thousands and thousands of neurons in this picture
in layer four that's where perceptual input
comes in from lower parts of the brain
that are involved in delivering perceptual information and layer five is where
a motor response is generated as a separate layer and
the evaluative responses come up from those midline those primitive
regions that know how we care about what to prioritize
they come up and they tweak the activity of all six of these layers
there are other functions as well but these are the functions that are probably best understood
in the cerebral cortex and they come down to these elementary
functions identified in the aggregates so
this always thrilled me when I discovered this teaching in
Buddhism because it was just like a neuroanatomy lesson basically
but the way the Buddha taught about it wasn't
to impress you it's his insight into how the brain is designed but to teach us
what it is that we cling to and these are the
things that we tend to cling to and he usually
refers to as the aggregates of clinging and one of the things
that conditions us or makes us more
likely to get attached to how we feel and what
we see and what we do what we think
is that we add qualities to them that aren't
naturally present there and the things we add to
them like that they're part of the self or that they will satisfy us
without fail or that they'll be enduring these are
distortions of perception and one of the teachings
about perception in the early sutras it comes from the Vipalasa
sutra the distortions of perception
the Buddha describes these four distortions of perception
of thought and of view sensing no change
in what is changing sensing pleasure in what ultimately
is suffering assuming self where there's no self
sensing the unlovely sensing the unlovely
as if it's lovely got astray with wrong views
beings misperceive with distorted minds
and then later in the sutra he describes when those with wisdom who have
heard this referring to the Dharma they recuperate their right mind
they see change in what is changing they see suffering
where there is suffering they see non-self in what
is without self and they see the unlovely as such by accepting
right view they overcome all suffering
so the Buddha teaches about these distortions of
perception that can make it more
likely that we'll get attached to things and cling to things and this undermines our
being but perceptions are also important
and in the Nibbana Sutta there's a dialogue between
two of the Buddha's senior disciples Ananda and Sariputta
and Ananda asks Sariputta
why some people become fully free in the present
life and Sariputta answers it's because
sun sentient beings truly understand which perceptions make things worse
which keep things steady
which lead to distinction and which lead to penetration
so I think what he's saying here
is that perceptions can be distorted
but they're malleable in the condition by wisdom
and in this case studying the Dharma we
can modify the way we see things and certain perceptions
kind of conventional or default perceptions
in the human condition you know they tend to make things worse
they encourage attachment
but other perceptions can help us
achieve a steadiness of mind other kinds of perceptions
that we can cultivate help us make discerning distinctions
about phenomena of experience and other types
of perceptions that we can cultivate can lead to penetrating insight
and ultimately liberation
so the I would say the neuroscience perspective
on perception is like this
that the neuroscience perspective
is that it's not like the conventional view I mean there's not everyone believes
this anymore but it's not uncommon for people to think that we see
things just the way they are in the world like a video camera records events
but that's not the Buddhist view and it's certainly not the
neuroscientific view as well
from a neurobiological perspective
perception evolved in each species including ours to construct representations
of the world that can guide adaptive behavior
adaptive behavior is what allows us to survive and reproduce
and constructs meaning from our interactions with the world much like memory
in fact neuropsychologists consider memory a form of
perception at the mind sense gate that's not the words they use but
that's how it translates into Dharma talk
and the construction of meaning is in order to guide our behavior
cognitive scientists are well aware that perceptions are useful but not accurate
but the distortions in our perceptions have evolved to support our survival
we distort in a way that can meaningfully guide our behavior
so I'd like to show you some examples of this
so against the dark background you can see two
tiles and you can see that they're identical in color and brightness
but if I change the context if I change what you see
around them it changes their meaning and it changes how we perceive them
now those tiles
the tile on top looks a lot darker with this context than it did
before the tile on the bottom looks a lot brighter
you know if I go back and just do it again
like the colors just change in front of your eyes they haven't changed the exact same colors
I found it hard to believe this when I first came across this
illusion so I in my PowerPoint program I put a little
block, a little mask around this lower tile
to see if it really was the same
it's the same tile I'm making this myself it just changes color when the background
meaning disappears so the fact that
the tile on top
is under a bright light if it's the color it actually is
it has to be actually darker than that the mind
is darker because that's how it should look in a bright light
and the tile on the side
the way it looks to us now is how it should look in a shadow
given the color it really is and so it changes it given the presence of the
shadow in the light
here we see the color without any meaning imposed on it from within the brain
by other circuits, circuits processing the background information
and our prior experience with shadows and direct light
and I'm sorry and then
when we have the direct light in the shadows we change the color
and we do this automatically and it's useful
here's another illusion that I also
have a hard time believing do these two tables
are they different shapes or are they exactly the same shape rotated
90 degrees well I wouldn't ask you this
if they weren't identical just rotated 90 degrees it just doesn't
look like it so I had to measure these because I didn't believe it
the red line is the length of the green table 2.3 inches on my
computer screen it's also the width of the red table
the green line is the width of the green table 1.7
inches and the length of the red table
these tables have the same dimensions
they're just rotated 90 degrees
so our brain is imposing a different appearance
and the reason that it does that is that the fellow who made this
a psychologist named Bo Lotto who has a lovely website if you're interested
in this sort of thing that's where I got these pictures
when Dr. Lotto made these images he changed
the angles at the corners of the table to suggest depth and perspective
we know that a greater
distance makes things look smaller so he changed the angle of the table top
these table top angles are not pure rectangles there
they have angles in them they don't have right angles seeing that
makes us think it must be longer and we expand it in our mind the green one looks
longer than it is and the red one looks more squat than it is
so our mind does that for us automatically it's useful it's just not accurate
that's not what's actually there
yeah it takes so what we see
is what
a scene like this has usually meant in the past
and in this case it means that one of these is different shape than the other
so how does the brain actually
implement that manipulation
and I'm going to use some diagrams of nerve cells
and on the left is a more
elaborate sketch showing the cell body of the neuron with its nucleus
and these things called dendrites that receive input from a different neuron
there's a synaptic connection here that gets input it's carried along
a long axon well variable length some of them are quite long
sometimes it's insulated with myelin and then it has an output end
and that's where it delivers the message to the next neuron
but I'm just going to represent that as this little oval
with an arrow coming out of it that's a neuron in these pictures
and I just want to show you how the visual system takes input
from the external world and
blends it together with internal information in order to construct meaning
so a neuron brings some information up from the retina
and the first stop in the brain is called the thalamus the visual part of the thalamus
and a neuron in the visual thalamus
conveys that information up to the visual cortex
which is where the first
level of cortical processing occurs primary visual cortex
and we also know that some
neurons in the visual cortex send information back
to the thalamus kind of telling it what to expect conveying
the benefits of prior knowledge previous experiences
contextual information from other parts of the brain what we're hearing
you know what we know about the situation we're looking at
what's happening in the other side of visual space or adjacent to what this neuron
is seeing contextual information and prior knowledge
and so this has been known for a long time that we blend the two to construct meaning
but what was a surprise certainly to me and to many people when this
became clear from micro anatomy studies is that they are
there are at least 10 times as many neurons coming down from the
cortex to the thalamus telling it what to expect
imposing meaning filtering out what actually comes
into these cortical regions and even the primary visual cortex is
not a region that is normally conscious it's only the higher regions
where the stuff is constructed and refined and put together
into a meaningful visual scene that we have conscious access to it
but at this level and at many levels higher in visual processing
there are 10 times as many circuits carrying
prior knowledge contextual information as there are circuits
carrying the bare facts of what the sense organ has
detected so internal
information predominates in the construction of meaning
and this is not just in vision this is in all of our senses
at least the three major senses hearing body senses and vision
I don't know about taste and smell and they're quite different in how they're organized
so we perceive
just what's in there but more like what should be there based on what we already
know and so we're getting this this processed
image something that's been made meaningful and useful to us
useful to us for survival but maybe not
necessarily in our Dharma practice because we tend to reify things
because they are brain sort of does that it adds meaning it
makes it very useful for us and we think it's just the way it is
there's a psychologist
I should say a cognitive neuroscientist his neuroscientist named
Donald Hoffman at the University of California at Irvine
who has written extensively about perception and also about
consciousness he has
promoting and testing
something called the interface theory of perception and it's based on these
same basic facts but he takes it to its logical
extreme and it's actually very compelling he says that our perceptions
function like a graphical user interface
much like what's on our computer screens
we have
let's see
the objects that we perceive in the world are like icons on the desktop
and the environment in which we perceive things
you know our home the streets we live on the parks we're walking through
these are like the desktop itself the objects of the icons
and the environment is the desktop
and their relationship with what's really there
may be equally distant
now what's really there
in the case of this
folder that contains my projects I've got a lot of information in the projects folder
what's really there isn't a small blue
rectangle in the lower right quadrant of my computer
what's really there is a very complicated
electrical engineering circuit board and somewhere in there
is the contents of my projects directory but that is not useful to me
I would really need to know machine language and probably need a
PhD in electrical engineering to usefully
access that information so software engineers that created
these interfaces that allow us to interact with
what's really there Hoffman says that
evolution has done a similar thing for our perceptual
capacities that it has
it constructs a meaningful interface that actually helps us to survive
he makes the point that
different species are going to have different interfaces
we have every species has a species specific one that has survived
the test of time and allowed those creatures to survive
so a crow
will have a very different visual interface
than an auditory interface than a human being
an octopus even more different
than a person or a crow a praying mantis
very different perceptual world
different icons, different shape desktops completely different
and those examples of animals I gave are among the more intelligent animals
on those branches of the tree of animal life
so Hoffman makes the point that it's quite possible
that what we know about what's really there
isn't much
what we know is what's useful to us as humans to experience
we don't want to in fact that evolution has protected
us from having to deal with this level of complexity
now he does make the point and a point
that the Buddha also makes which is that our perceptions may
not have substantial reality to them they have this
quality of emptiness but we have to take them seriously
if I take a file that I really care about and I drag it to the trash
I'm not going to be able to use that file so this is serious
now it's not literally what's happening but it's what I need
it's a useful proxy for what's happening and so I don't drag to the trash
the things that I don't want to lose
I won't say too much more about this but
this guy's works are very interesting he has a book some of you might have
read or might find interesting called the case against reality how evolution
hid the truth from our eyes
and one of the things that he does is he's an engineering background
and mathematical background and he develops some expertise
in these mathematical models of natural selection
and he creates virtual worlds with virtual organisms
that have different perceptual attributes and some
of the virtual organisms see everything in their
environment exactly as it is and he creates a virtual environment
that all the organisms have the same virtual environment some see everything just
at a ground truth level including the things they need to see
50-50 half of what they see is ground
truth and half what they see is what they need to see and other organisms
the only things they see or perceive
are things that are relevant to their particular needs for survival
and then he runs he allows these organism
environment virtual settings to run for hours
and days and weeks and simulating evolution and
he's done this many times with different kinds of organisms but what always happens
is the only organism left the organism that out competes and
drives to extinction all the other organisms are the ones that only see what they need
to see seeing what's really there if it's not relevant to your survival
slows you down makes you less effective in competing in the
environment so this isn't a proof that his theory
is right but it's actually fairly compelling and
his ideas conform with those of a number of physicists working really
at the limits of what physics knows about
the smallest particles in the world and in the nature of
space-time itself and the conclusion
of those physicists is much like Hoffman's conclusions which is even at that level
space-time and matter those things
are ways we think about the world
not the way the world really is space-time is a model
that we've made it's a fact about how we
perceive not a fact about how the universe is constructed
so that gets a little to the limits
but I think it's a little kind of exhilarating I'd like to
share with you a few clinical examples of how we perceive
and what happens if our anatomy is altered
in some ways our brains are altered there's a famous patient
who lost his sight at the age of three and a half
and he was able to get a surgery that could remove the
opacities from both eyes when he was in his mid-forties
and right after the surgery he was just like confused
he couldn't make sense of what he was seeing but gradually began to learn to see again
as a blind person he had
an expert skier he was in British Columbia
and there was a lot of good skiing there and he would ski with a companion
as blind skiers do who would call out to him if there were obstacles that he couldn't
know about because he was blind but mostly you know when you ski you feel
the snow you feel the angles you feel your speed
you feel the slope and he was an excellent skier and after his
surgery when he finally started skiing again
he would get to the ski slope and he would just close his eyes because it was too confusing
he could do a lot of things with his eyes open but not ski he had to close his eyes
to ski because he couldn't make sense of what he was seeing and that was in the beginning
and then two years later when they interviewed him again
he was now opening his eyes most of the time on ski slopes
except on the black diamond slopes the most difficult slopes
he would still close his eyes because he just
felt more confident feeling than trying to
construct meaning what he was what was flying by him so quickly
he said the difference between today and over two years ago
is I can better guess at what I'm seeing now what's the same
is that I'm still guessing
so what happened with him and is different from what would have happened
if he'd had this surgery while he was still under the age of about eight
let's say a child loses the
ability to get light into their eyes and then that's restored surgically a few
years later but they're still young when their vision is first
restored the retina is fine it brings information up to the thalamus
but what's coming down from the cortex it's not that there are actually fewer
neurons it's that the information value of what's come from the cortex
is much reduced it's not able to impose meaning on
the raw visual experience but the child's
brain is very is more neuroplastic more capable of neuroplasticity
and before long they've got the full load
of information coming down from prior knowledge from prior experience
expectations predictions and they see normally
in the case of patient mm he was older
even after years he only had a partial
supply of internal information
putting meaning on what he was seeing so he was still guessing
a lot of times and what was there
there's another kind of syndrome
and I encountered this a single time in my practice
it was an elderly gentleman 82 year old
man who had been a music teacher was still teaching actually up until he finally
lost his vision he had macular degeneration and he had
recently reached the point of functional blindness and then his doctor
referred him to me a psychiatrist because he started having nearly constant
vivid and very upsetting hallucinations
and the one that I remembered was he lived
in downtown Sacramento in an apartment and he would see a train
crashing through the wall of his apartment and coming through his apartment and
he knew that couldn't be real but it looked so real it really upset him
and this was happening daily to him and
he needed help
when this person came into my clinic I had never encountered this before
and I had to educate myself what was going on and I learned from him
and from the medical literature that he had Charles Bonet syndrome
which is visual hallucinations following visual impairment
a lot of people get this after they become functionally blind
or lose most of their vision especially older people
and neuroplasticity does decline somewhat as we get older
and people can't adjust
and I think what's happening and what I understood to be happening and what was helpful
for him was to think of it this way
he wasn't getting much visual information
about the external world he was just getting a trickle he could see patches of bright
and dark but he still had a fully formed
prior knowledge system in his visual cortices
bringing all that information down to the thalamus he lived in downtown Sacramento
they have a light rail system there and you can hear the squeals
of these little rail vehicles they're not biggest trains but they sound like trains
and he had this auditory
information that there was a train nearby and there were some patches of
light and dark changing in front of his eyes and he constructed a train out of that
and it was frightened by it
and so he
did not have the kind of hallucinations that characterize psychotic disorders
there was no rationale for giving him an antipsychotic
medication or any of those kinds of treatments
what would help and what did help somewhat for him was talk to his family
he lived alone but he had family in the area and people spend more time with him
talk to him about what was in the environment give him more internal information
that he could use and to do something with the things that were being
misperceived as trains and trucks
in his apartment and even just teaching him about what was going on reassured
him a great deal he thought he was losing his mind but in fact his mind was
functioning the way it's supposed to function it just couldn't adjust quickly
enough to the loss of vision
and the hallucinations didn't stop but by the time he stopped seeing me there were just less
troublesome and less often
so the Buddha talks about this
insubstantial nature of perception the fact that
it's constructed and the foam suit is just an excellent
source of his teachings on this let's suppose that in the last month of
the hot season a mirage was shimmering and a man with good eyesight
were to see it observe it and examine it appropriately
to him it would appear empty and void and without substance
for what substance would there be in a mirage
in the same way among seas observes and appropriately
examines any perception to him it would appear
void empty without substance
this is a monk who's been trained in the Dharma what substance could there be in a perception
the same teaching is applied to all of the
aggregates form it's like a lump of foam in the same suit feeling
there's like a bubble perception of mirage choices like a banana tree
in consciousness like a magic trick however you contemplate them
examining them carefully they are void and hollow
when you look at them closely
so this is not too dissimilar with what some of the far out things are being said
by people like Donald Hoffman it's an interface
it's not substantial and yet it's useful
and we're wise to take them seriously and to work with them
as Sariputta told Ananda
some sentient beings truly understand which perceptions make things worse
which keep things steady which lead to distinction or discernment
and which lead to penetration or penetrating insight
let's see
I was going to stop there for questions but I'm going to go on to the next section
and I'll stop after that and we'll have questions there's another
aspect of perception besides its insubstantiality and its
constructed nature which neuroscience and Dharma practice
kind of have a parallel perspective
many meditation teachers tell us that we can pay attention both
in a narrowly focused way and with a broad open field of attention
here's a quote from John Peacock and he talks about mindfulness
and how we can do it in a fashion which is much more focused or we can do it in a
wider sense and Andy Olinsky uses
the term Sati Sampajanya
which means mindfulness in Sampajanya which
is often translated as clear comprehension or full awareness
he says the former term Sati refers to detailed
micro awareness when it's used together with Sampajanya while the latter indicates
a broader more global awareness of an object as it's viewed in its
wider context so we have the capacity for both kinds of attention
and even they can be integrated together
I know Andrea Fella has given some talks on
cultivating this broader awareness and integrating it with focal awareness
and having both present in doing mindfulness
practice and I think neuroscience agrees
with this formulation and I just want to show you how it's thought about in those metaphors
this is a sketch of the visual system with the eyeballs
and the retina and the optic nerve coming into the thalamus the visual part of the
thalamus the left and right and then neurons going up to the primary
visual cortex in the back part the occipital cortex of the brain
this is the earliest part of visual processing there are many more
higher more sophisticated visual processing modules that are not
included here but if you take the optic nerve
and cut it in half and look at its cross section
it's got this appearance there are two zones in it
there are many different kinds of neurons inside the optic nerve and they're kept separate
in the center are these parvos what they're called parvocellular neurons
and on the rim the annulus around it are these
magnosecellular neurons and that's because
the parvocellular which means small cells in
I believe Latin come from very small cells in the retina
and the magnosecellular neurons come from very large cells in the retina
and they are
kept separately they don't talk to each other in the retina they don't talk to each other
in the optic nerve and when they get to the thalamus they don't talk to each other either
they're processed in separate layers of the thalamus
and then
they are projected separately up to the primary visual cortex
and only when they arrive there do they start pooling their
information content
and the way these cells are laid out in the retina and
wired in the retina makes these small cells very well suited to a narrow
focus kind of attention and to discerning
the nature of objects the categorical membership of an object
of visual perception whereas the magnosecellular neurons and their
wiring in the retina is particularly good at
making sense of situations integrating broad
awareness into a kind of
a global view of what's going on
and if you look in the retina
to see what information is coming into the parvo and
magnosecellular systems for the parvo system
each parvocellular neuron in the optic nerve
has information from only one cone cell
and there are a lot of cone cells in the human retina
so there are a lot of these parvocellular neurons many more than there are of the magnosecellular neurons
one cone cell and there are typically two
intermediate neurons that do a little bit of fine tuning of the information from that cone cell
and it delivers it to the parvocellular
optic nerve cell and that takes it up into the brain
very granular kind of information
magnosecellular system
those optic nerve cells they're getting input from about 50
rods and cones spread and the rods are the black and white sensitive ones
the cones are the color sensitive ones and these rods and cones
are spread out various places in the retina to kind of get a big
picture of what's going on and they interact with many
intermediate neurons about 200 for every single
magnosecellular optic nerve cell
excuse me
so there's a lot of processing going on before it even gets to the optic nerve
of this broad information
and that processing is intended to make a meaningful data reduction
of kind of broad global situational information and then
there's a single channel of information and one neuron
can only send one message at a time so this is being reduced
from 250 earlier cells down to one cell about big picture
information
so that's the contrast between what underlies these two kinds of cells
so
when they get to the cortex
as I mentioned they for the first time start sharing their information
and
the granular information that the parvo cells are really good at
is preferentially shared with what's called the ventral
visual pathway and ventral means lower down dorsal means higher up in terms of
the human brain
and these higher visual processing areas as you move forward in the brain
from the back have more and more sophisticated jobs
and the ones in the ventral area their jobs involve
fine-grained analysis, object-oriented perceptions, narrow
things, identifying members of categories
knowing identical twins from each other
if you're familiar with them you learn to tell them apart or
one cat from another cat or any things like that
the dorsal visual stream tells you how to engage with it in a situation
it's a big picture and it enables you to act in situations
it's laid out it's a little bit like
the icons on the desktop in Donald Hoffman's analogy the icons are processed
down here in the desktop the environment the situation is processed up there
now the nice thing of course is that they're talking to each other the whole way
and it's really after it gets to the cortex it's no longer
a dichotomy of two different streams it's now a spectrum
and the in-between areas of the brain have sort of in-between
perceptual talents but the most
dorsal part is the most global and the most ventral
part is the most focal and in-between is a spectrum
I just want to illustrate some of the
things that our mind does with these two talents it has
we can tell with our ventral stream we can tell if that's
edible or poisonous mushroom if we have prior knowledge of the right sort
we can tell that there's a creature hiding in the grass
and we know what kind of creature it is and we know that it means we should back away quickly
with our dorsal stream
we find ourselves in this situation we know what angle to take
to go down that slope or maybe perhaps we should turn around and go back
that's a little beyond our skill set
if you're a little boy getting a frisbee from your dad you see it
you map it with your dorsal stream you know where to put your hands where to put your feet
where to aim your eyes it's situational information dynamic information
some other illustrations
the dorsal stream is good at knowing how close things are how fast they're moving
what the arrangement is around you really built for action planning
in an intuitive kind of thinking and memory
for processes and it's what I would
call subconscious it's often not right in the center of conscious awareness not that we're not
aware of it it's just more implicit or
on the edge of awareness and this is many mammals have this
kind of processing system much like ours in fact a lot of animals are better
at it than we are but then the ventral system
which is sometimes called perception for cognition
is really good at shades of difference in shape and color
and recognizing categories if you were fluent in Sumerian
cuneiform writing you would see the differences between the letters on this
tablet this system is well
structured for language and abstract thinking and representational
memory categorical semantic memories
and it has easy access to conscious awareness often the focus of conscious awareness
is what's being processed in our ventral stream
and the sophistication of this circuitry is unique to humans
and I think it's part of why we have language that is developed
as much as it has
comparison is really with other primates and other non-primates it's harder to
make that comparison because their visual systems are different but humans
really stand out in the ventral stream and it's
informative to see where these streams culminate
the ventral stream culminates in the language areas of the temporal cortex
where we have receptive the ability to understand language
in our semantic knowledge stores
highly sophisticated modules like recognizing faces
and recognizing the emotional expressions on faces
recognizing different species of animals different types of food that's all in this
temporal region
where the ventral stream culminates the dorsal stream culminates in the frontal lobe
which is where actions are planned where intentions are generated
where our values are
compared to the opportunities in this situation
what are our options
so I think it's useful to say that
awareness in the dorsal stream is good for
supporting our actions it gives us a big picture view of what's going on
it gives us kind of a situational awareness and it is framed by
our actual intentions and our habits the intentions
that are inclined to arise in this situation are implicit
in the dorsal stream processing and when meditation teachers encourage us
to be aware broadly that's one way that we can have
a clearer understanding of the actual intentions that are
kind of latent or competing under the surface to be expressed
because they will frame how we see the situation
how we're sizing up a situation we can learn somehow a little more
from those some of the intentions that are a little harder to see directly
the ventral stream on the other hand supports abstractions
and cognition a narrow specific focus identifying objects
and it's framed by what we already know and believe and it can tell
us about biases we have in our prior knowledge and beliefs
because we're imposing that on how we're organizing information in the
ventral stream
well I'm going to skip through this well okay I'll go through it quickly but we're running out of time
like if I ask you what are these objects you immediately in your
ventral stream know this is a blue plastic and metal egg beater
and that is a green plastic watering can and that's
automatically presented to your consciousness by your ventral stream
but if the question is what can you do with these objects you automatically know
that you can pick it up here by this handle you can spin it with this crank
you can maybe whip cream with it or if it's a watering can
you put the water in there you pick it up here and you can carry it somewhere in water plants
with it these are conceptualized as affordances rather than
objects there are affordances there are opportunities for interaction
with something that's the kind of thing the dorsal stream does
and as you can see it's framed by the intentions
you might have
finally I'll say that it's you know I kind of said this before but
this is process the dorsal stream is process oriented it's harder to put
into words it's often in the background of conscious awareness
and it takes a little bit of practice to to cultivate awareness of it the ventral
stream it's content oriented often in the foreground easy to talk
about and easy to be conscious of
they are susceptible to different kinds of illusions
these two streams if I were to ask you which circle is larger
you'd say they're the same but now if I ask you the same question
your ventral stream will tell me that the one on the right is larger
because it just looks like a larger object surrounded by smaller objects
when you put the background on it it
it fools the ventral stream it changes the
the characteristics that we attribute to the object includes large for the one on the
right but the dorsal stream is is not fooled nearly
as much and and the affordance of that orange circle if you were to make it
three-dimensional which some scientists have done and asked people to reach out and grab
it and measure the distance between their thumb and their index finger they
use the same grabbing distance to reach to the
orange circle on the left and the orange circle on the right because their action is being
guided by the dorsal stream it's perceiving an affordance
not an object and its relative its size relative to your
hand is computed the same way
so this is true
for hearing and and some body
senses and it's hardwired
unlike some other differences in the brain the left and right hemispheres are
kind of different you know we have language most people have language in the left hemisphere
not in the right unless hemisphere especially in the language area is a little
slightly different shape and volume but if a child
has to lose their language hemisphere for surgical procedure that's necessary
to save their life they grow up with only right hemisphere
language regions they will develop perfectly normal language in the right hemisphere
that the architecture the underlying
wiring is similar enough in the left and right hemispheres that any function on one side
will be replaced by the other side but not so for the dorsal and ventral streams
if someone is born blind and they never have
vision those parts of their cortex that were
normally devoted to visual will be taken over and colonized by
hearing and touch and blind people become very sensitive and intelligent
in those kinds of perceptions they're using what used to be
visual cortex areas but the auditory
colonization of visual structures will always respect the dorsal
ventral difference the wiring is just not adequate for
object perception with hearing or touch in a situation
perceiving region of the brain this is a fundamental difference
it's a basic spectrum of our awareness
comes up in psychotherapy
sometimes because it's not just simple perceptions
it's all the way up to the level of views and high level models of the world
vary along this spectrum and the more abstract models
which are more like the ventral stream are often reified
it's so easy to abuse substantive reality to them
and this is the source of a lot of suffering
in people who have anxiety and depression
it's so easy to be aware of these kinds of perceptions and views and thoughts
and they often are distorted
in an unhealthy way and unskillful way and it causes them to suffer
so one of the sort of side lights of psychotherapy and intervention
in addition to working more directly on the problems is to encourage people
to cultivate their affordance perceptions
because people who might be very unhappy, very anxious, they can still do lots of things with mastery
they just don't notice it
it's the center of their attention so you encourage people to use
the parts of their awareness that are not being quite as distorted
by some false beliefs about themselves
so just to wrap this up I'll mention
how this relates to the concept of
Sampajanya which is described in several of our instructions
on mindfulness practice in the Satipatana Sutta
it's described as abiding, contemplating the body
as a body ardent, fully aware, is this translation
by Bhikkhu Bodhi of Sampajanya, mindful
having put away coveness and grief for the world
and if you unpack this word Sampajanya
the noun form of it is
it means very full knowing and it's this non-object focus aspect of awareness
it's pointing in part to this capacity we have for situational
awareness that's embodied in the dorsal streams of our sensory apparatus
and our perceptual apparatus. Other translations of this
I mentioned Bhikkhu Bodhi also in Annamali calls it full awareness
but some of these really point directly I think to the dorsal stream
Tanasara Bhikkhu calls it clear comprehension
comprehension implies engagement
prehension is a word that means to grasp in its etymological roots
like a prehensile tail can grab onto a branch
clear engagement, an understanding via engagement
Sujato calls it frankly situational awareness
which is a synonym for the dorsal stream
Buddhadasa in his writings called it wisdom
in action which I think is a great way of defining Sampajanya
and again this is what the dorsal stream
circuits are particularly good at.
Analiyo in his first book on the Satipatanasuta
talks about four aspects of Sampajanya from the perspective of the commentaries
and some of these point also to the dorsal stream
the four aspects are seeing the intention of any
action and that's an awareness of intentions and that is
more accessible to us through that kind of
situational awareness. How we're sizing up a situation tells us something about the intentions
that are arising in our mind. The suitability of an
action that is what action symbol in this situation
again dorsal stream, maintaining sensory restraint
in support of mindfulness. I'm not sure that points to the dorsal stream
but maybe I just haven't seen it. And finally seeing the three characteristics
in any phenomenon and those are in constancy, unreliability
and not self. For me that's like a big picture
awareness. That's kind of the biggest picture awareness and that's the kind of thing that
we have the capacity for that really global
view of the situations we find ourselves in.
Yeah
I'm just going to wrap this up. I've already talked about
this quote but I'm going to talk about Joseph Goldstein who says
how important it is to cultivate the Sampajana
clear comprehension in terms of knowing what we're doing and why
a profound and transforming practice. It's understanding
that mindfulness is more than simply being present with clear
comprehension Sampajana. We understand the motivations behind our actions.
I'm going to stop there and I'm sorry this has taken so long
but I'm happy to stick around for questions
if you have them.
Yeah
Paul
Yeah I second staying around for questions
just wanted to throw that out there. I think it's great if we can talk a little bit longer but
on that note you talk about, so basically at the end there you basically
suggesting that enhancing
dorsal activity is maybe a way to help reduce suffering
and how you do that and why and is that what an
affordance circuit is. Thank you. Yeah that's an affordance circuit and for me
just knowing that that's like a big part of our anatomy
that we don't, it's not the center of
awareness often, it's the periphery. Just knowing about it and learning to direct your attention
to it, it's there. You don't have to construct it, it's just learning to pay
attention to it and that's I think a trial and error process.
I don't know if any of you read the Don Juan
Carlos Castanada books back in the day
but there was a part in that book in one of his first books where he talked about how to
run in the desert on a moonless night
and to me that was like a teaching about the dorsal stream because
what you do is you don't look right at things because the
ventral stream is concentrated in the center of vision
and the dorsal stream is spread out over the whole retina and Carlos
Castanada was told by Don Juan, if you need to run fast in the
desert at night and there's no light, look to the side and then you'll see what's in front of you
and that's accessing the
magnicellular system which sees situations and enables
action so look a little bit to the side of what's in the focus of your
awareness
and you know in trial and error just
knowing that that's one of the things that is happening in your
awareness learn to make it a little more prominent
Mark
Well that was a fascinating
set of observations that I definitely have to
integrate and reflect on but I've been interested
in predictive coding what was the first
part of your
presentation and so our recently was looking at
a presentation by Anil Seth
who is a big proponent of that as well
and this was a very recent talk so it's up to date
and the evidence that he
lots of the suggestion this is a theory and so
it's computational right and so there
is a little bit of experimentation and actually I was in this respect
stunned by the example of the skier
who was blind and then
very convincing but so to the experimental evidence the best
experimental evidence that Anil Seth was bringing forward
was actually I'm not going to go into the whole experiment but
the effect size of this was less than 10%
so when there was a
visual exercise and when there is a suggestion
when people say well you're looking for a face rather than some geometric object
the difference was really
minuscule and so
I said well that's not a way to convince
people but so I'm wondering in your reading
and studies so
how good is the experimental evidence for this
whether it makes a difference this predictive coding
and so
yeah
effect sizes are so dependent upon the details of the experiment
so
whether it makes a difference so do you mean
does it make a difference that what
we're seeing is not exactly what's there is that the difference
that you're asking about yes yeah
so for conventional activities
no I would say not where it makes a difference
is where and I'm basically
my at the moment have confidence that that's true I mean the Buddha
has taught it from one way of acquiring knowledge
through mastering his own mind and observing it and
showing the same thing so they come together so I'm sort of convinced that this is
true and if it's true then
you wouldn't discard it it's still useful
it doesn't make any difference unless you're pushing your system beyond what it's evolved to do
and what the Buddha did was push the human system
beyond what evolution shaped which is an animal that could
survive in the wild
and it wants to free itself from its predicament
and that's different so when you're trying to do something we weren't
involved to do you have to learn to see through the errors
in what you project onto reality or if you're a physicist trying to explain what happened
in the beginning of the Big Bang or what happens in the Large Hadron Collider
because that was one of the sources of some insights into that
the world's actually not made of space time because
you have to explain the patterns they saw in the Large Hadron Collider
if you abandon space time and
other assumptions about the true nature of the physical universe
so when you push things then it makes a difference
thank you
Ann
oh can't hear you
yes I'm muted sorry this has been so wonderful
I have been trying to do this reading on my own of all these
neuro blah blah blah and just this talk like
was so useful to me I have personally somebody was talking earlier
about all the memories that come up and I have personally found that
somatic awareness somatic therapy and somatic awareness
really aligns with what you've been describing or my understanding
of what you've been describing and I find by bringing my nervous system
online and kind of seeing that whoops these
memories are habituated sometimes or my perception of them
has been habituated almost really clearly
has over a couple of years now obliterated my
tendency towards anxiety I'm quite high functioning but anxiety I thought
I could fix everything by thinking but and creating
stories from the memories is what would happen but that
thing about with somatic awareness I find that that
really opens up like what you were saying about the blind person
like I could be overwhelmed by the thoughts but now what else
is here is my regular question so when my brain's overworking I say what else is here
and then suddenly I'm sensitive where and that brings me
into some kind of Vedana that just releases the triggers
somatically I can't explain it it just happens but
you have explained what's happening in my brain so thank you so much
because it's just encouraging that the practice I'm doing I always say
to people the Buddha was a neuroscientist before there were neuroscientists
and that what you explained today has been
so helpful to me so thank you so much I know I'm babbling but
it's just from excitement and passion thank you
I'm glad that's useful to you so glad
Michael
hi hello thank you so much for your time and your talk I really
enjoyed it I have three questions I'll make them really quick if that's okay
with you I was wondering if you could touch on the
differences between male and female brains like the neuroplasticity and development
and then
maybe I'll just ask that one first
yeah well there will be people who know more about this than I do
I haven't made a point of
mastering that growing literature but there's one thing
that I have learned that I think is true
of course I'm generalizing maybe from my wife but
that language is is bilaterally
it's lateralized you know and most virtually all right handed people have
language in the left and a little bit of language in the right
and it's switched in half of left handed people
but the amount of language in the right hemisphere varies
and in part by gender that women have more bilateral
language ability than men do in general
you can't really talk about any individuals
this way and that
correspondingly spatial awareness
is somewhat lateralized to the non-dominant the non-language
hemisphere knowing how to and it's kind of like a dorsal stream function
this spatial awareness and language is kind of like a ventral stream function
so the right hemisphere in most right handed people is spatially oriented
and it makes find better distinctions about
spatial relationships it's more spatially fluent
and that is a little more bilateral in men and a little more
unilateral in women so that's one difference
between men and women and I personally I think I'm very
left lateralized for language if there are people talking
I can't write you know I just have one language channel
I know people who can write and hear
speech and I can't do that
neuroplasticity wise I'm not aware of any differences
I think one thing that kind of interests me is like maybe why you see
more males like boys development wise maybe being more susceptible
to environmental influences or such as like
not grad higher rates of incarceration but not
levels you know well actually there is an important difference
there I forgot about that I do know about which is that
so the brain develops quickly in utero
and in the first few months of life and then it sort of
starts developing more slowly after that but it doesn't stop
its developmental build out until
late 20s even though the body is
fairly you know it's completely grown the brain especially the
frontal lobes action planning intentionality
values and the myelination of the
white matter tracks that is the cables that allow neurons to communicate each other
with each other they become faster when they get myelinated
and the myelination of the frontal lobes doesn't end until the late 20s
and that's what I'm saying is true for men
for women it's like five years sooner
and I think this is one reason that more young
men get into trouble than young women because they
don't have this kind of executive control over more primitive
default response tendencies that frontal lobes
is where the executive control is it benefits more from conscious
deliberation influencing action choices
when primitive parts of the brain don't have that extra tool of
conscious deliberation or it lasting as long you know they can't pause as long before
they act okay yeah I worked with
a lot of at-risk youth and I just sort of my own general
experiences seemed like the females were able to deal with trauma a lot more successfully
and navigate sort of the hurdles of life and ups and downs that
we all sort of experience my other question sorry to
screen is how you talk about perception and distortions
how does one foster more flexible and altruistic
sort of outcomes
right that's a great question
well I do think that
meditation practice provides
some perspective on perception in general and gives us
some insight into
its lack of substantialness you know that it's
malleable that it changes with what we're doing and that allows
us to perhaps to have a little more
flexibility in how we respond a little more freedom and how we respond if we don't
reify things you know this reification is like one of the
worst habits human beings have and I think we might be particularly designed
to do it because of our ventral streams being so highly developed
so to move beyond that
is one thing also perspective taking which is a
dorsal stream talent is to
try to cultivate the ability to see how things would look to
someone else that's sort of a situational awareness like looking at a situation
from a different point of view and recognizing that the way
you're sizing it up is your point of view
so to be able to do that that encourages a little more of an altruistic
perspective
and then my last question thank you so much you had talked about time and I'm not
sure if I'm getting the verbiage right about time sort of being like a man made
concept or sort of some theoretical principle and I was interested
in how that sort of relates to trauma and I think of like the PTSD
soldier who is sort of physiologically stuck in that
sort of heightened awareness many years later
or gets triggered how does trauma sort of relate to time
or the physiological sort of experience
yeah well the way I was
talking about time doesn't really pertain to the question about
a traumatized person is more like a physics issue
but your question is a good one because people who
have been traumatized and have post-traumatic stress disorder
in a way can't come into the present
the past is being imposed upon the present
so it's a good question
well I mean what really
helps I guess one way to think about it is kind of a metaphor
the process I described of present moment experience moving through
labile memory forms various iterations of
labile memories and then into a stable memory
it hasn't been completed in someone who's suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
things are stable and they're a little
they're resistant to change but they keep cropping up they're being retrieved
when they're not called on you know it's an intrusive
re-experiencing is happening taking the person back into
the past a different place in time
and the brain is doing what needs to be done
to solve the problem to retrieve, reframe, re-consolidate
in a less toxic way it's just not happening
and that's when professional help is really valuable and data is clear
we have some medicines that help a little bit with PTSD but the psychotherapy is
really more effective and it involves
assimilating that past episode and really getting it into a normal
stable store so it's not intruding into the present moment
slipping the person back on their timeline
Thank you, thanks so much, I enjoyed the talk
You're welcome
Paul, another question from Paul
Hi, thanks for the patience, I just want to make sure if anybody else has questions please
Okay, so I think this is a pretty
interesting question, so I listened and it seems to me there's a tension or inconsistency
between the Hoffman approach versus the Dorsal approach you described
Hoffman suggests reducing information input for easy interfaces more effective
consistent with the predictive model and speed, the advantage is the speed of doing that
but the Dorsal approach seems to be suggesting more information looking to the side while running
the dark desert may be more effective, so those seem to
be a conflict, which is better, the Hoffman approach or the Dorsal approach
was Buddha advocating for the Dorsal approach to advance humanity, do you understand the question?
Yeah, but there's one assumption you're making that I would disagree with
and that is there isn't more or less information in the Dorsal
or Ventral approach, it's just formatted differently
It's like the difference between the software
that realizes the desktop of a computer
that's just X amount of information, but it's laid out so that you can
interact with it and the software that realizes an icon
that might not have less or more information, it's smaller, but that doesn't
mean it has less information, it's just being realized in a way
that you can recognize it, so it's the difference
between sort of object recognition versus situational engagement
and it's not a matter of more or less, it's that
apparently these two ways of sizing up the world have
evolved because organisms need to have both those abilities
to evolve, so it still boils down to just
what's needed for the organism from a Hoffman
perspective, if that makes sense, it's just there's no
excess information there, it's just that one is formatted
concisely and one is formatted concisely
And the broad is dorsal? Yeah.
And I don't think the Buddha was advocating
for the dorsal stream, I just think he noticed that his mind did that
and that there was some value in paying attention to that
especially because it's easy to ignore, but if you cultivate
his level of self-discipline and awareness was pretty amazing
so you could see that that was a way to know
what your intentions were in one way, it was a way of seeing what intentions were
shaping how you sized up a situation.
I think that helped, thank you.
Well, I really appreciate
everyone's attention.
