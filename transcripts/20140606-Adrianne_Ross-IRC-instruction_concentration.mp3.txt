concentration practice in some of the ways I was mentioning yesterday and for the first part of the sitting we'll use one object and for many of you that will be the breath but some of you it might be the body or sound but just choosing one object to collect and gather all the energies in to this place of stability and calm and then we'll explore the momentary concentration where each object that arises is an object for our connecting and forming stability so we're paying attention to a flow of objects whether it's the breath or sound or sensation or thoughts of flow of continual attention building stability that way and so as I was mentioning before you're going to explore how continuous you can have the attention be and how complete so sometimes they'll be chatter in the background or the foreground and then gradually the attention will gather in until you're completely with the breath or completely with each object gradually guiding the mind to stability ease and clarity so to follow whatever ever of the instruction fits for you at this time so bringing the awareness to the body perhaps taking a few deeper breaths and releasing with the out breath for a moment a few moments letting the awareness spread throughout the whole body you're receiving the body the body relaxed calm at ease grounded and then gradually bringing the attention in to the breath wherever it's most comfortable and natural for you to experience the rhythm of breathing the belly the chest the nose gently connecting with the sensations of the breath coming into a friendly relationship intimate with the sensations of breathing and as you connect with the breath aware of the in breath the out breath perhaps spaces between breaths becoming more intimate sensing the direct experience of breathing the texture of the breath coolness vibration tingling pressure expansion see if you can keep this gentle awareness of the breath continuous with the whole duration of the in breath the whole duration of the out breath spaces between breath and as you're sensing and feeling the breath you can be aware of small adjustments if there's any tightness and you're holding on to the breath or if it's too loose you're not quite connected as though you were using mental muscles to connect and rest with the breath rather than physical muscles not straining but relaxed see if you can be completely with the breath any background chatter just fading away so that your awareness is completely filled with the experience of breathing Releasing everything but the breath. 
It's ready. 
Receiving the whole experience of each breath, each in-breath, out-breath, and perhaps the space between breaths. 
When thoughts arise, simply allowing them to release as you connect more fully with the experience of the breath. 
Enjoying the experience of breathing, the breath filling awareness, whether it's the breath at the nostrils or the whole body. 
The breath filling awareness, whether it's the breath at the nostrils or the whole body. 
The breath filling awareness, whether it's the breath at the nostrils or the whole body. 
The breath filling awareness, whether it's the breath at the nostrils or the whole body. 
Whenever you notice your attention is wandered from the breath, very simply and smoothly we connect. 
A direct experience of the in-breath, all the details of the in-breath. 
Open, receptive, enjoying the experience of breathing, breath filling the body, the breath flowing out. 
The breath filling awareness, whether it's the breath at the nostrils or the whole body.

If you like, you can continue just resting with the breath. 
Calm, stable at peace with the sensations of breathing. 
Or if you like, you can open the attention up to include all of experience so that whatever arises is simply an object to be known. 
And there's a continual knowing moment by moment. 
It might be a sound and then a reaction to the sound is known. 
The sensation in the body comes to awareness and it might be pleasant or unpleasant or neutral. 
And a response to that is known. 
Or thoughts, see if you can maintain this continual knowing, releasing the past, releasing the future. 
Simply knowing what's arising moment by moment. 
Calm, stable attention. 
Sensing the body relaxed at ease and the mind open, spacious. 
This very simple flow of knowing moment by moment, whatever arises. 
So continuing in this way, if at times you get very distracted and you want to return to a single object such as the breath, trust what feels right to you, allowing mindfulness and investigation to balance your practice.

For the remainder of the sitting, see if you can evoke and invite all of the enlightenment factors to support and guide your practice. 
For the day, is there mindfulness or not? Allowing mindfulness to be established, is there interest, curiosity, discrimination? Inclining to that quality, allowing it to be here, is the energy balanced, relaxed and alert, connected? Is there a soft joy present or not? Inviting that quality, opening to the possibility of joy, is the mind calm? Allowing a sense of calm to sink deeply, tranquil, still? Is the mind stable, is concentration present or not? Releasing and allowing the mind to release in sustainability, calm, steady, clear, resting in this way, mindful, interested, relaxed, content, calm and clear. 
From this stable place, can it be possible to be open to whatever arises with a kind, curious attention? The mind knowing, steady and peaceful. 
For the rest of the day, can you be open to whatever arises with a kind, curious attention? For the rest of the day, can you be open to whatever arises with a kind, curious attention? For the rest of the day, can you be open to whatever arises with a kind, curious attention? For the rest of the day, can you be open to whatever arises with a kind? So as we move into the last full day of our retreat, it's a beautiful time to really rest and enjoy all the fruits of our practice here, to allow all the teachings that we've received to begin to integrate as we go about our day and to notice that toppling forward into tomorrow or next week or whatever that tends to happen, and just gently, not now, here, not to push the thoughts away, but very simply continuing to build on the stability. 
The power of the concentration practice is that it gives us a stability as we go out into our lives, that we can continue. 
There's just a simplicity and a stillness and embodiedness that we can bring into our lives. 
And as you go about your day, really check in, am I embodied? Are the factors of awakening present? So we can evoke them. 
We may not be like Sariputra and able to just call up fully developed factors of awakening, but is there calm and allowing it? Is there joy and just evoking them, really bringing them all into being today and exploring that? And also being gentle with ourselves, releasing any agendas or expectations and just being fully here for this precious time that we have now together. 
So Gil has a few announcements.
