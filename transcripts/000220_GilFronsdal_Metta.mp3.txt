 Well I was inspired to spend a few minutes talking about loving kindness today, Metta. Partly the inspiration came from Valentine's Day. My son went through his first Valentine's Day event at daycare and it's changed apparently since I was a kid. My earliest memories of Valentine's Day was not an institutionalized event. It was an event which as a second or third grader I tried to avoid like the plague. And it was all kinds of kids kind of organized and did things and some people, you wouldn't want to get that card from that girl or something. So it was kind of a complicated event and as a boy I remember not being particularly pleased by it. But the way he worked in daycare was that my son had to go come prepared with a Valentine's Day card for everyone in the class. Not just simply all the girls in the class but everyone in the class had to get one from him and he got one from everybody else. So I thought that you know it was a very lovely kind of Buddhist way of doing things because in Buddhism the idea of loving kindness is you start with someone who is really dear to you. You start with your natural feelings or whatever. Your common tendency is for feeling love and delight in someone and then you appreciate that and then you universalize it. You don't stick to it, to your own self-interest but rather you start from there and you kind of begin dissolving the boundaries that keep you from having those feelings towards other people. And so they become, it becomes universalized. The universalization of loving kindness is a very important part of Buddhist practice. And there are specific practices that people do to what's called breaking down the barriers of breaking down the boundaries. So the experience of our goodwill becomes universal. So it goes, you know, spreads beyond our toes and our ears to other places also, other people. The practice of loving kindness or the sentiment of loving kindness, the intention of loving kindness is simply the wish and desire for someone's well-being. And it's that simple. Someone's well-being for their happiness. And someone can also be oneself. And usually in Buddhism we start with ourselves. Can you hear okay? The difficult? Or should we hear you? You okay with hearing? And so as I said, usually we start with ourselves. We kind of want our own well-being. But here in the West it seems that certain individuals, certain people, a large portion of people have a hard time starting with themselves because we're obviously demons and monsters and whatever. So we start with someone else that we can, a friend or a partner or a family member or a benefactor or someone, a child or maybe. And then from doing it to someone else, then maybe it's easier to kind of ease into doing oneself. Someone deserves one's own well-being, desire for one's own well-being, loving kindness. So it's sometimes a little tricky to find that. But it's a very simple, simply the desire for someone's well-being. And what it's supposed to be absent of is self-interest. Now, that's maybe easy to understand in relationship to other people. Can you have some kind of feeling of kindness, some kind of feeling of desire in your welfare or someone else without wanting something in exchange and in return? You see someone who is in trouble on the street and you stop and help them and you finish with helping them and you go on your way and you don't think about it anymore. You don't want anything in return. You simply want it to help them. I stopped someone the other day and their car was stuck in the intersection and she was trying to push it. So I got out of my car, parked it and pushed her car out of the intersection and then drove her to some gas station where she wanted to go. I drove her someplace and then I left. I didn't want anything in return. I just wanted to help her out a little bit at the moment. So to have some kind of feeling of loving kindness, I guess the stress on the word loving kindness is on the kindness that is absent of self-interest. And this for some people is a very foreign idea and maybe a challenging idea. And the more challenging idea it is, I think the more valuable it is for us to explore it. Not that you have to believe it or adopt it as a policy, but rather to clarify what is the way in which you relate to other people, what is the way you choose to relate to them? Is it usually with some element of self-interest as part of it? And is it interesting to maybe as an act of imagination to explore being involved with someone else's happiness and well-being without any self-interest as part of it? And what does it mean to have no self-interest in wanting your own well-being? I think that's much more challenging because you know it's for me after all. But I think there's a way in which you can want your own well-being, your own happiness without being related to the kind of self-interest that involves building up our ego or building up our identity or doing it because we want to appear a certain way for other people, doing it because we're attached to experiences of pleasure. Happiness and pleasure are very different animals. And some people are confused about the two. So can we want our own happiness without self-interest being embedded in some part of it? It's a beautiful thing, the desire for one's own well-being. It can be very simple, the benefits of it. Today I was a little bit late coming down here, getting in my car to come down here. There were various things happened. The phone repairman came on a Sunday morning and he needed me to do something in the house. My son needed something. So I was running a little bit late. So I started getting a little bit hurried. And I kind of hurried into the car and then there was problems with the car. So, you know, I was a little bit delayed. And so by the time I got on the road, I was a little bit in a hurry or harried. And then as soon as I drove off the driveway, I remembered, oh, I want to talk about loving kindness today. But, oh, well, this is a good time. And then so I thought, oh, you know, it'd be nice to be, you know, be well right now and not be in a hurry. And simply wanting that, simply having that desire, being reminded of that as a possibility dissipated my heriteness very quickly. It would have been very easy to continue to my preoccupation of being down here and talking about loving kindness, not important it is to talk about it. But luckily the topic itself was kind of self-correcting. And in that particular instant, it was very easy to kind of change my mood. So I want to tell you the story, one version of the story of when the Buddha first taught the practice of loving kindness. This version comes from about a thousand years after the time of the Buddha. I don't know the genealogy of the story, but the story itself claims that it was passed down orally from the time of the Buddha. There was a large group of monastics, monks and nuns, who were going to go and spend four months doing the rains retreat. The tradition in India was in the monastic order to spend three or four months on retreat every year. We would stay in one place and just basically just practice in one place for that period of time, not wander around India. And as was accustomed at that time, before the monks would go off on their own, some place in the jungles, in the mountains or wherever off in India, they would go find the Buddha and get some kind of instructions for the retreat, what kind of meditation practice to do while they are on the retreat. So they went to the Buddha's 500 monastics, went to the Buddha and said, what should we do? And the Buddha gave him some really wonderful practice. Now some recorded what, but he gave him wonderful practice. And so they were very delighted and they went off to northern India, up into the foothills of the Himalayas, where there was some beautiful forest and they found this beautiful lake that was beautiful kind of quartz-colored lake, really beautiful and clear and pristine water and there were these huge, huge trees, banyan trees perhaps. They were just made wonderful shade and wonderful kind of enclosures around these big roots of the banyan trees where people can sit and meditate and the temperature was really beautiful. Maybe it was up in their Kashmir, you know, where people would go off to get away from the heat. And it just seemed everything, and there was little villages nearby and there was a nice little market town nearby where they can go on alms arounds because they depended on every day to get their food. They can eat it to go on alms arounds to get their food from the villagers. So it seemed like just beautiful conditions. So they sat down and started meditating and the villagers noticed they were there within hours and the villagers were delighted. They didn't get to see Buddhist monastics very often. So they went, oh, you know, we're so happy you're here for the rains we treat. We're going to build you little huts. So they built little huts under each tree. So there are 500 huts and there are 500 of these big beautiful trees spread out in this huge forested area. And it was very idyllic and every monk or monastics were very happy to be there. Now under these big majestic banyan trees, the big majestic banyan trees, they happened to be very ideal foundation poles for the mansions of certain deities. And these deities had built mansions, huge mansions, you know, up in the canopy building up into the sky. No one could see them, of course, but they were there. And at first these deities were quite delighted to have all these Buddhist monastics appear under their houses. And they had a lot of respect for the work of liberation that the monastics were doing. And out of respect, they retreated from the houses because it's very disrespectful in Indian culture to be at a higher level than someone doing something very worthy, like seeking liberation. So and certainly they weren't going to be directly on top of their head. It's a real no-no in Indian culture. So they would retreat. They kind of went to the side. Now for our first couple of days, they were happy to do this, but this was at least for their homes they were leaving. So after three or four days, they started getting kind of, you know, restless and homesick. And after a few more days, they started feeling, well, this doesn't, this is not working. You know, we need to get back there. Our family, our kids, you know, everything's there back in our homes, televisions, you know, and we need our entertainment and we need to kind of get our food and whatever we need. So, so they started getting a little bit distressed. They decided to try to gently first to frighten away the monastics. And then I kind of started getting more and more adamant about it. And they started making horror, harrowing sounds and thunder and, and had great, you know, they did all kinds of things, had great images of great demons and dragons that came and billowed fire. And it got really noisy and terrifying noises. And the monastics got so terrified and so preoccupied with all this stuff that the eighties were doing, they lost their mindfulness. Imagine. So that was enough for them. They said, well, you know, it was okay while we still had our mindfulness, but now we don't have our mindfulness anymore. So they said, let's go back to the Buddha and tell him. So they went back to the Buddha and told them what happened. And the Buddha said, the Buddha then went, use the psychic powers and scanned across India. And he decided that he saw that there was no better place for those 500 monastics to get liberated than that particular forest by that particular lake. So he said, you got to go back. And he said, no way. We can't go back. It's frightening there. So the Buddha said, okay, I'll teach you a practice and I'll teach you about loving kindness. So he taught them about the practice of loving kindness and he gave them a discourse or a poem or a verses called the loving kindness Sutra discourse that they memorized. And he taught them the practice of loving kindness of goodwill. And he sent them back. And as they were coming up the road, returning to that forest, they were chanting the chant of loving kindness. May all beings be well, may all beings be happy. Just like a mother protects her only child. So may you treat all beings wishing them well-being and happiness. And so they were reciting these verses and they were practicing goodwill, wishing goodwill to spreading universal goodwill to all beings everywhere as they were walking. Now as they started approaching this jungle, the deities grew up in their mansions in the treetops, started feeling really warm and kind of warm hearted and feeling kind of delighted and something really great happening here. So they looked around. They saw the monastics are returning and they felt this, these radiance waves of goodwill and loving kindness coming from these monastics. So, oh, you know, let's change our tune here. I think we want them here. It's so nice to have this feeling of goodwill. Let's not frighten them this time. Let's get down from our mansions and let's transform ourselves into human beings for the next three, three months. And let's be the attendants to these monastics and let's clean their cabins, their huts and let's bring them water and bring them food and just optimize the conditions for them so they can have the facilities and the place and locations and everything to get liberated during these three months. And so these monks and nuns then practiced diligently and peacefully for those three months. And by the end of the three months, each of those 500 monastics had attained full liberation. Isn't that a nice story? It's a great story. You can interpret the story in many ways, understand it in many ways. But it's one way is that it's kind of a dramatic way of saying that the expression of goodwill, the feeling of goodwill, wanting other people's well-being generates a certain response in the world around you. It's not clear always what kind of response and it's not always clear, but the response tends to be response of goodwill in return, of kindness in return, of generosity in return. And you might try it sometimes in a situation where you find yourself in hostility or animosity in a tense situation with someone where your normal reaction might be to get kind of huffy or get kind of tight and kind of get angry. See if you can find some genuine desire inside of you for some alternative way of being. And then see if you can be very kind of smudged in a little bit of alternative, if you feel on there because the animosity is so strong. But see if you can find some genuine root inside of you wanting someone's well-being, at least your own well-being. And then see if you can have some feeling of kindness or friendliness to the situation, to the person that you're relating to. And then see what happens. See if that elicits a different response than you would otherwise have had. Like my friend who... I forget exactly the story, but he was in a parking lot and he wasn't getting out of the way fast enough or his car stalled or something. So someone who was really in a hurry and really angry started yelling at him and cussing at him and saying, you know, how could you do this to me on a Sunday morning? And my friend didn't take it on still and didn't return it, but rather was mostly concerned about this guy's welfare. You know, felt a little bad about blocking his car or whatever, but he had no choice. And at some point he said to him in a very kind way, in a way that apparently worked, he said, oh, you're having a really hard morning, aren't you? And that just melted the hostility. Oh yeah, it's really been rough today. And then the situation unfolded just fine. Another story. Let me tell you stories today. A shorter story. The Buddha had a cousin named Devadatta and Devadatta was very jealous of the Buddha. He wanted to have the Buddha's place. He wanted to kind of be the Buddha, you know, have the run the run the show and run the order of monks and nuns, be the top dog or top guy in the river. It's called. And so he was trying to find various ways to get the Buddha out of the scene, get rid of him. And various times tried to kill the Buddha. And one of his attempts to kill the Buddha was he got the huge royal tusker, this big elephant that had big tusks. And it was a big warrior that was used in battle. So it had a certain ability to be aggressive. And he got this great royal tusker of an elephant, really angry. And it was kind of inside its pen. And the Buddha started walking down the road towards where the elephant was penned up. Devadatta had the gate opened up and the tusker saw the Buddha first. Okay, came storming out down the road. And full charge ready to gore the Buddha. And Ananda, who was the Buddha's attendant, was rushed up in front of the Buddha standing in the way to kind of somehow stop or somehow protect the Buddha. And the Buddha calmly said, no Ananda, you're not needed right now. Please stand aside. Well, so he was an obedient attendant, so he stepped aside. And the Buddha then started to generate loving kindness, generate feelings of goodwill towards the elephant. And as the elephant came charging forward, it started slowing down, slowing down, slowing down. And the Buddha, the elephant, was on its knees, kind of smiling nicely in the Buddha. And again, you shouldn't try this with elephants. And I think it's Sharon. Sharon Salsberg could try it with a dog. Is that the story? Someone know the story? Try it with a dog at Barry and the dog bitter. So you know, maybe you should take this as being a little bit of a mythic story, but there's a principle behind it that's useful. That the desire to generate kindness, to be kind and to generate in a sincere way, to see it as a valid and valuable and sincere alternative to acting on our hostility or acting on our animosity or on our greed, changes things. It changes us ourselves, but it also changes the environment and changes other people. And they respond to us in different ways because of it. And life unfolds a lot more beautifully when we have, when we can tap into that capacity of kindness and loving kindness within ourselves. So we have in Buddhism an emphasis on reflecting and contemplating, thinking about studying the psychology and the practices of loving kindness. Even if you don't believe in any of this, to spend some time thinking about reflecting on it. And then to engage yourself in contemplative practices of loving kindness. A little bit of it like what we did at the beginning, at the end of the sitting just now. But to find ways of finding one's intention, however miniscule it might be of goodwill towards oneself or goodwill towards others. And then feeding that goodwill in a sense by expressing it, giving expression to it, giving expression to our wholesome states of mind, feeds them and they grow. And they become more familiar parts of who we are. They become more readily available to us so that they're at hand when we most need them. So may you all leave today at least a challenge to contemplate the practice of loving the sentiment of loving kindness, the wish of loving kindness of goodwill. And it all seems interesting for you. Spend some time practicing with it. And that's what we have to say today. May you all be well, may you all be happy and may you all stay dry enough. Thank you.
