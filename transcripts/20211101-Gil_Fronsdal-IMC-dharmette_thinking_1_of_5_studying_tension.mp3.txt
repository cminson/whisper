 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. So this is the beginning of a five-day series on mindfulness of thinking. And we'll follow the pattern we followed over these last weeks of relaxation, recognition, respect, restoration, and release. So there's a tendency in meditation circles to sometimes be frustrated around our thinking, or even worse, to sometimes thinking that thinking is our enemy, that it's a problem to think, and if only if I didn't think, then I could meditate. In mindfulness meditation, we are learning the art of bringing a clear awareness, clear attention to all aspects of our life, the inner life, the outer life, personal life, social life. But in meditation, particularly, all the different parts that become clear in the present moment, in the present moment, in our whole psychophysical system that we are. And so one of the things that will stand out sooner or later, for some of us sooner rather than later, is how much thinking there is. Some days there's a lot going on in life, and we have a lot of concerns, and the mind can be going really fast, spinning out. Sometimes it seems like the mind has a mind of its own, we're just churning thoughts and thoughts and thoughts, and there's no chance to stop it. And so rather than making it an enemy, what we can do in mindfulness meditation, we turn our attention to be mindful of thinking. But the art of that is to make sure that the mindfulness is not thoughtfulness, it's not thinking about thinking. Some people will confuse mindfulness with thinking, that we're kind of thinking about what's happening in the present moment. And I'll talk a little bit more about that tomorrow, but we're not having discursive thoughts, we're not having commentary, interpretations. It's not like you're having a conversation with yourself about how you're thinking, what you're thinking about. There's almost a silent awareness that we're using in mindfulness. The silence that happens if you have a dirty windshield in a car, and you clean the windshield, the windshield now is clean, and it's still silent, it doesn't speak or say anything. But you see through it, you see through that silence, you see through that clarity to see clearly what's on the other side. So the mind's ability to see or to sense quietly is a movement we're going. And so to listen like you're listening to your thoughts, you're listening with a quiet mind, even though your thinking mind is busy, or you're feeling. And some people find it very helpful with thinking to feel thinking. And in terms of relaxation, the physical sensations that we can feel connected to thinking can be really key. Sometimes it's difficult to see the physical connection between thinking and the muscles. And other times you can really feel it. There are times when I'm particularly sensitive and quiet, that it feels like the mind is a puppeteer and it's all these strings. I'm the puppet kind of. All these strings coming down from the thinking mind, connected to all kinds of little muscles in my body. And they're all kind of like micro muscles are being pulled or tightened or released as I think about different things. Some thoughts are really powerful, resentments that maybe I have at some point. And I could feel my stomach pull up or my shoulders go up. Or I think about a wonderful conversation I had with a friend recently and something releases and the puppeteer is the relaxed muscles. And even though I was tense or holding, but in thinking about this nice conversation, something, ah, that's good. And I relax. And the more relaxed we become, the more we can feel this micro muscle strings tugging and all the muscles that go on. If we're really tense or really preoccupied in our thoughts so we can't notice our body, we won't have a clue what I'm talking about. Chronic tension, where there's no relaxation at all, can become normal for people and they just, this is how it is. This is the natural way to be. And there's no movement in the chronic tension for anything to relax. As people meditate, most people find slowly that the body relaxes. Some of the surface tension that we carry with us begins to soften and relax. And the same thing with the mind. That there's maybe the thinking doesn't stop, but thinking calms down, it gets slower. So, I want to emphasize again that we're not making thinking the problem, but rather we're turning our attention. When thinking is strong and when it's kind of captivating, we calmly turn our attention to be mindful of thinking itself. And the whole week will be spent talking about how we can be mindful of it in different ways. But what I want to emphasize today is we can be mindful of the tensions there, the energetics of it, the stress, the forcefulness, the pressure, the contraction, the tightness, the insistence, the hesitation, the closed downness, the shutting down, the dullness, the numbness. All these things can be associated with thinking. And those things need our care. If we're distracted by the content of our thoughts and thinking the content is what's most important, we might miss the underlying kind of tension that is much closer in actually to who we really are. It's kind of like a deeper layer that a doorway into the depth of who we are is not by thinking ourselves and remembering and figuring things out in their mind and reinterpreting the past. The way to really have a doorway into the heart, into the deep inner life is this ability to relax. So, when there's thinking, and we're really pulled in the world of thoughts, one of the things that be really helpful to learn to do when it takes time is to relax the interest in thoughts, to break the enchantment with the content of the thoughts. Some of us have had similar thoughts over and over and over again for years. The amount of repetition that goes on in many people's minds is kind of astounding. If people could hear any of us how often we think the same thing, they would wonder about our sanity or something. It's normal enough to be repetitive, but it's also not necessary. But what's interesting for a meditator is to recognize that part of the reason is a lot of repetition. Part of the reason why there's often oneself as a central character, and what's potentially involved in our thoughts, is that there's an intense interest in the content, interest in self, in me, myself, and mine. So that interest, that investment can be felt distinct from the content of what we're thinking about. Sometimes I've had the feeling in my mind that I'm glued to my thinking, and I could feel the glue or I could feel the bungee cord pulling me in to it close by. It doesn't matter what I'm thinking about, I can feel the glue or the bungee cord or something that's there. And then to feel that tension, and sometimes you can relax it, but sometimes we can't relax the tension, the physical tension, the mental tension. You can't relax it as a will, as in something we do. But here's a real key to really long-term mindfulness meditation, to really find your way with it. And that is, it really helps if you have a willingness to allow yourself to be tense, allow yourself to feel the stress, the contraction, the pressure, as if it has permission to be there. It's okay, but hold it in awareness. And I love the image of two cupped hands that come underneath, where awareness and mindfulness is like two cupped hands that gently come along and hold the tension, hold the stress, kindly, supportively, and learn the patience that you can do that forever. Because some of the tensions that we carry within us are not really amenable to being directed or told to relax, or that we are in charge. That's just one more time, sometimes one more insult that we're in charge, we're going to do something to this whole wonderful system we have. But if we can come with respect and care and kindness and say, okay, here I am, I'll be with you for however long it takes. And then amazingly, things begin to shift under that kind of attention. Something unexpected begins to relax, something unexpected softens. And our job is to bring that attention that is soft, that attention that is kind and caring. And the attention that's slow, the attention that's not in a hurry or insistent, the attention that's not forcing the issue, or the attention which is not tense. So relax, learn about your attention, become a student of your attention. Maybe before you can relax you have to really recognize and get to know it. And chances are that for most of us there's more tension through the day than is necessary. And so to study the unnecessary tension and stress that's there in the body and the mind. And so in the next 24 hours in preparation for the teachings tomorrow, you might think of yourself more of a student of tension than a student of relaxation. Get to know it well. But if you feel like you know it and have recognized taking time to know it, then if it's easy to relax, please do. And maybe this can be a fun day of studying and hanging out with tension and relaxation and see what happens if that's the subject of the day, the theme of the day for you. And then we'll continue tomorrow. And in some ways, this series I'm doing, starting with breath and body and emotions last week and now with thinking, what proceeded is building up towards our capacity to really work with thoughts. So mindful thinking is not meant for people who are beginners, but it really has the foundation of these earlier types. And then what I'm going to talk about through the week is also builds on what proceeds, proceeds. The relaxation supports what I'm going to talk about tomorrow and so forth. So I say all this with the idea that I'm not expecting you to be able to do all this suddenly, like if you're a brand new beginner, but really it builds on the skills and the understandings that have been growing by ongoing meditation practice. So hopefully that's the case and that this is supportive and I look forward to tomorrow. Thank you.
