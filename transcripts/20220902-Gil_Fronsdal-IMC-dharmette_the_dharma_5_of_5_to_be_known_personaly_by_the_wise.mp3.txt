We come to the fifth and last talk on the characteristics, qualities of the Dharma, the Dhamma, that has been well spoken of by the Buddha. 
To some degree, it's talking about his teaching, but it's also talking about what his teaching is, what his Dhamma is pointing to. 
What the Dhamma is, is the truth that we are discovering through this practice, and it's also the way we discover it, the means by which we discover it, and this combination of the means of what we're discovering and what we're discovering speaks to this intimacy, certainly of mindfulness practice, but also the intimacy of the means and the goal, that the goal to be free, to be aware in an open, free, unrestricted way, not doing it completely, but in partial ways, beginning to live that goal in the means, to practice being present in a clear, direct, full way here. 
And these five qualities of the Dhamma that I'm going through this week is the Dhamma which is visible here, that it's now, it's immediate, that it is inviting inspection, inviting us to see, come and see. 
So this coming to see, opening to see, here, now, seeing here, now, that's kind of the heart of what we're doing here. 
And if we enter this world of seeing, knowing, being present here and now, then we find that something opens for us, an open door or an open current of what's onward leading. 
We can see a path, we see a movement towards what is wholesome and healthy, where the ah is. 
We see the ouch, and we can see how clinging and grasping and hate and delusion and ambition is a freezing of time, is being stuck out, you know, without being in the free flow of time, being free in time, in the flow of here and now. 
And we feel the ouch of that, and as we see it and be with it, at some point we see or intuit or feel, there's something, an alternative to that, and that alternative, we get a sense of it, is the ah, is the possibility of non-green, non-hatred, non-delusion, non-conceit, non-reactivity, just here in a relaxed, open way, and something begins to flow and to move. 
We start flowing in the flow at the present moment. 
We start being carried by this wholesome, healthy direction of practice of ah. 
And this is to be experienced. 
This dhamma is to be experienced. 
The last quality is the dhamma is to be experienced directly, actually the language is, this dhamma is to be personally experienced by the wise. 
So, personally experienced by the wise. 
So, we're talking about something that, in a sense, only you yourself can really experience, know for yourself. 
So, I don't know if it's the best examples, but maybe only you know that you're hungry. 
You know, you can tell people, and maybe you can give symptoms of it to people, but the experience of hunger is internal to oneself. 
The experience of having an itch. 
People might not know you have an itch, but you certainly can know it. 
You have to pee. 
That's something we experience for ourselves. 
So, there might be better examples for each of you, rather than what I came up with, but maybe it's something only we can experience for ourselves. 
And so, there is a way in which this dhamma is to enter into that world which we can only experience, we ourselves can experience personally. 
And the way there's ouches and ahs is really something we experience experientially. 
We can know that for ourselves. 
And we can know for ourselves whether things are stuck or whether things are flowing and moving. 
Maybe other people can intuit that, looking at how we behave. 
But this is something to be experienced for oneself, really. 
So, it's almost internal or this deep, very personal, very intimate involvement with the present moment with here and our direct experience. 
And what we can experience most valuably is not complicated. 
So, this is not an engineering job. 
It's not some sophisticated analysis. 
It's not remembering causes and understanding why things happen or planning out the future and what should happen. 
It's rather that there's something extremely powerful and freeing about keeping it radically simple in the present moment. 
The only place where we can really directly personally know for ourselves how things are shifting and changing, moving, how they appear and disappear. 
They're in constancy. 
They're impermanence. 
And not to be straining to see that, but more like resting back into it and seeing the changing nature of it. 
So, this personally experienced by the wise, the experienced wise, the wise person is mentioned here. 
And now, my favorite definition that the Buddha gives for a wise person. 
A wise person is concerned with the welfare of self, the welfare of others, the welfare of self and others, and the welfare of all beings. 
I think it's such a beautiful definition of wisdom because it doesn't require opening up all the Dharma books and learning all the lists and all the teachings. 
It's more of an attitude, something that arises within. 
But as the practice deepens, a wise person, part of the reason a wise person is interested in the welfare of everyone, including oneself, is because in the direct experience of the moment, we see very clearly this ah and ouch. 
We can feel the movement to the ah, to where welfare is, where well-being is, where peace is. 
And that comes together with seeing impermanence and change. 
Because when we don't see the changing impermanent moving nature of reality, we're probably locked on in some way. 
We've frozen, we've gotten contracted or caught on something, some preoccupation. 
And maybe trying to think about how things, can things really be in constant and changing so much? When we start thinking about that, we've kind of removed ourselves from the experience, the directness, immediacy of what's changing. 
And we can feel that movement. 
We can feel the ouch of that, maybe very, very subtle, but a little bit of strain or tension. 
And we can feel that there is a way in which the ah comes from coming back into the river of change, of flow and movement and all that. 
And to see this, it's not an easy thing I'm talking about, so you can't just decide to sit down and do it. 
But as the practice deepens and as we settle in more and more and feel more confident and more at ease and more able to kind of stay mindful of the present more continuously, at some point this opens up for us. 
We start seeing the changing nature of our experience, the changing nature of our knowing of experience. 
Sometimes we're more aware of how experience is changing, like the breathing sensations are changing. 
Sometimes we're more aware of how the knowing of it is a changing, moving phenomenon. 
That the knowing operates a little bit sometimes independent of what we have chosen to know. 
Because we start thinking, the mind is kind of, the knowing mind knows different things. 
There's a sound outside and now we know the sound for a moment rather than for the breathing. 
There's a thought about how much time is left in this meditation and we know that. 
And then we're back into the breathing. 
We might be knowing something about the breath. 
And then we notice that, next what we know is we notice that there is some sensation in that area of the chest where we're doing breathing. 
But maybe not directly connected to breathing. 
How did your shift? How did the knowing move? The knowing moved, the knowing changed. 
And all this knowing of change is at the heart of what some people are translating into what's called vijja in Pali. 
And vijja, some people translate as true knowledge. 
Vijja is liberating knowledge, the liberating understanding or knowing. 
Vijja is the opposite of avijja, which is ignorance. 
So if we use ignorance in the opposite in English, I guess it would be agnosis. 
But knowing, understanding, seeing. 
And so a wise person is a vinyu, the word is connected to this word vijja. 
And so someone who knows what's beneficial, knows what welfare is, is concerned with it, and can see that in the direct moment of being attuned to the changing, quiet, flowing nature of phenomena. 
And in that awareness of that, not looking for freedom, but in the awareness of all that, freedom is revealed. 
A letting go and non-clinging is revealed. 
To be personally experienced by the wise, to know for yourself from the inside that the mind is not clinging to anything, attached to anything, holding onto anything, at least for a short period of time. 
Trusting that, finding that, being that, is this art of this dhamma that the Buddha is talking about. 
So we have this dhamma spoken by the Buddha. 
Well spoken is the dhamma of the Buddha. 
It is visible here. 
It's immediate now. 
It is inviting us to see deeply. 
It is onward leading and to be personally experienced by the wise. 
And in Pali, this is often chanted in Pali, and my Pali chanting is not so great, but I'll offer you my best effort for it. 
Sva, sva, kato, bhagavato, dhammo, santitiko, akali ko, ehipasiko, upaneiko, pachatam, veditavo, vinuhi. 
You have to kind of be generous to the chanting, but that's the Pali. 
So thank you. 
And I hope that this kind of teachings about the dhamma can give you some deeper trust and confidence in the mindfulness. 
And don't be so concerned about how far your practice or what I'm talking about today this week is exactly where you are in your practice. 
But have confidence that doing this practice, it's onward leading. 
And you're not necessarily responsible for the onward leading nature of it. 
We are setting the conditions for it by being present and mindful, and then when the time is right, the dhamma is onward leading within us. 
And may you become a wise person, free, liberated, and concerned for the welfare of all. 
May all beings be well. 
Thank you.
