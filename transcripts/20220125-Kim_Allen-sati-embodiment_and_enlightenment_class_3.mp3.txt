Okay, so welcome to our third session on mindfulness of the body through this
Sutta, MN119. And we'd like to begin with just an opportunity for you to share
any questions that you might have at this point, or if you have any comments, if I
don't know if any of you took up the invitation to do some of these practices
a little bit more in a dedicated way over the last five days or so, and see
what happens. See if you could discover something different about your experience
of the body. So I just open the floor for any of that, and please use your zoom
hand, because I might not see you with more than one screen.
Amar Staten, is your hand up, or is that a thumbs up?
I don't know. May have been from a prior meeting, but I'll say something.
Okay, great. Thumb and hand aside. I spent quite a bit of time on in the Sutta
number seven, meditating on the foulness of the body parts, because it was not
one that I would normally gravitate to, but I felt like it was because of that
feeling that it was a good one for me to spend some time with. And the more I
meditated on it, kind of going from head to toe in as many areas as I could
remember from the Sutta, I noticed a certain, shall I say, ease around the
body parts that are we normally don't think about or aren't prevalent in in
our, you know, in everyday society, so to speak. And so anyway, keeping it short,
that it's been good to do that. And I'll continue to work with the Sutta for a
while. So thank you. Wow, thank you. I love that comment, because first of all,
you tried something that seemed a little odd and unusual just to see what would
happen, which is something that is really a wonderful thing we can do in
practice, not always just to do what feels comfortable or interesting even to
us. And then I also appreciate that what you discovered, I mean, who knows, we
could discover all kinds of things doing that. But what you found, you said,
ease with things that are not as commonly seen. This is interesting, because this is
one possible result of that practice where we just allow the body to be as
it is. And there are some parts that aren't that beautiful. And it might be
that we're sort of, I'm now going beyond what you said. So I'm just speaking in
general. But it might be the parts that aren't so beautiful or a little bit
icky or, you know, we just kind of sweep under the rug a little bit, you know,
it's like, well, we just won't look at that part. But if you allow, oh, this
could actually be something that is, you know, inherently in my material parts,
but isn't that pleasant? And you just say, well, that's great. That's how it is.
Fine. It can bring a certain ease, just allowing that to be as it is. Not
everything about the body is pleasant. So great. Good comment. Debbie.
I have an very old gymnastics injury when I was a kid, I was a gymnast. And then
a year ago, I was running after a sled carrying my granddaughters and tore my
hamstring, which really is painful. It's a long, slow recovery. And then a couple
months ago, I fell off my bike while stopping too fast clipped in. So all these
things really, I've had a lot of discomfort. I mean, really, because I'm
very active. So I decided my week, I was going to explore pain and where it
started. And I was became very curious with the texture of the pain and
analyzed it from my back all the way down to my foot. And oddly enough, I
became friends with it. I mean, it was just an unusual thing to watch pain in
my body. And then I'd stopped throughout the day, not just during
meditation, but while I was walking or back on my bicycle or sleeping and I
was awakened by the pain, I just started to meditate on the pain. And that was a
stunning experience. So
thank you for sharing that one too. It's, it's so true with the body that it
has these things that we would rather kind of not approach closely. But when
we do, we can discover all kinds of things, ease or friends or all kinds of
things. And it's true the body, the body is very prone to pain. And but the
analysis of it is that it changes when we look at it carefully, right? It sort
of breaks up shifts, we can see it beginning, ending, rising, falling. It
becomes a whole phenomenon in and of itself. And even though it is not a
pleasant input, it actually can be the basis for John even that sensation. So
it's quite powerful. So I love that you've done that exploration. I don't
know if any of my co teachers might want to add anything. I think we've all
worked with pain. Okay, then Charles Lee, your hand is up.
There we go. Yeah, I resonated with the, with the, the, you know, working with
kind of that body scan type, type work and also elemental practice with
washing dishes or folding clothes, filming laundry, really taking advantage
of the tactile sensations in the, in the hands, the feeling of warmth, the
pulsations running through the hands and had kind of an insight. I remember
learning in biology class that, you know, the mind or the brain or whatever, you
know, I interact not with reality, but with a map of reality. And these
practices have helped me to kind of be able to change that map. So, you know, I
remember getting an instruction to, I remember, you know, feel the back body. I
remember the first time I, I heard that and I was like, what is that? What is my
back body? Now I can, now I can feel it or, you know, try and, you know, feel
your, you know, third toe. And, but there's also some, there's a lot of
neutrality in that, in that vein or toe, which is a place that I can kind of go
with, yeah, if I'm, if I'm, you know, having, having too much pain. So thanks.
Well, thank you. That's also good to hear. And that we see that the, another
area that the mind, that the mindfulness of the body can lead to is
understanding the connection between the mind and the body and the degree to
which what we think we experienced just as, you know, the body, it's, you know,
that's what it is. It's a, it is that it's actually very much dependent on how
we see it. You call it a map, an image or something inside, inside of us. And
that that is something that can change through practice, sometimes deliberately
because we decide to see things differently, but also just doing these
practices, it will change in certain ways that we couldn't have imagined ahead
of time. Okay, maybe go ahead. Neuroscience has the word, it's called a
homunculus. Yeah. The nerds want to look that up. I don't know how to spell it.
Yeah, that's the idea that we have something inside that's kind of
watching and seeing all that's going on. We can look for that homunculus.
That's another interesting thing to turn attention toward. Okay, I think
Kathleen, if you're willing to wait, we do have another Q and A session. Okay,
great. So we'll move on to David telling us about the John S.
Thank you. Thanks, Kim. Thanks, Diana Ying. And also for the questions. Thank
you. I have thoughts on the questions. I'll see if I can leave them in there,
or maybe we'll return to some of these things, the body map, the homunculus,
etc. Fascinating pain. But now the John S. And I expect everybody here has sort
of had some, you know, has heard of the John S. And I think the principal thing
I'd like to do, if possible, in about 15 minutes is demystify the John S.
Demystify this aspect of our practice that is termed in the Eightfold Path.
Wise Samadhi. And we can do this by looking closely at the sutra in front
of us, Majama Nakaya 119, has descriptions of the Jhana that may be
surprising in that they present, I think, aspects of our meditation
practice that are pretty familiar, much more familiar than you might think.
If you've read a lot about the Jhanas, particularly about how the Jhanas come
to be presented in later commentarial tradition, particularly that associated
with the Visuddhimaga, what we find in the sutras is something not like
a foreign country where you don't understand the language or recognize
the landscape, but something more like something much more familiar, maybe
like an orange, a fruit that when it's described, you recognize, oh, this is,
this is, I know this, I know this fruit. I like the orange analogy because
the Jhanas, the Samadhi, that deepening collectedness and stillness of the mind
that develop in the meditation are a fruit of practice, at the same time
that they're conditioned for insight. The still mind sees clearly, or you could
say, the collected mind, the collectedness of mind and meditation provides
the field for insight.
So let me, let's turn to the text without further ado and just work through
this a little bit. I'm going to kind of read some of it, but I'm going to, as I
read, provide sort of running color commentary that, again, I hope will have
sort of the effect of making, making available, opening a door to something,
an aspect of practice that actually like the practices with the 32 body parts
or the charnel ground meditations can seem, you know, very different or very
difficult to settle in with and practice with comfortably.
And I'm going to use a physical book, so I hope I can put this up here in a way
that, look at that, you can't even tell that I have a book in my hands.
But we, I'm going to change glasses.
Yeah, so what we get here is this.
Practitioners, when secluded from sensual pleasures, and I'm reading again
from the Bhikkhu Bodhi translation and with a certain amount of correcting, as I
like to think of it, for gender and to make it relevant to our practice.
Practitioners, when secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states,
a practitioner enters upon and abides in the first genre, which is accompanied by
applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of this seclusion.
I just want to stop there and say, so this is probably familiar to us, the activity of the
mind by which we direct and redirect our attention to the breathing, for example,
or to other aspects of our bodily experience, like those we've just covered up to this point
in Majma 119, this returning of thought is what is what is referred to here as applied and sustained
with that. This is one of the earliest instructions we receive. When the mind jumps away, when the
mind gets contracted around a distraction, a pain, a sensation in the body, an emotional current,
we gently, without hurry, bring it back to center, bring it back to here and now,
bring it back to the breath, or the four elements, or the body parts.
With that can come some physical pleasure, and this can be a little tricky for us,
because in the meditation practice, along with pain that comes up,
there can be significant pleasure that arises, and we're encouraged in this text and in other texts
in the Majma Nikaya to cultivate this pleasure, this pleasure born of the seclusion of meditation
practice that arises without dependence on conditions, external conditions.
So it says, a practitioner makes this rapture and pleasure born of the seclusion of meditation
practice, drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body. So this is a bodily practice in which
we're encouraged to let this, the good feelings that come with the meditation,
fill the body, drench the body, steep within the body, pervade the body.
And a wonderful simile is given for this practice here, that this is like a bath,
what do we say, a bath attendant, or a bath man, who takes powder, mixes it with water,
and creates what was used for soap in this particular place in the Bronze Age.
You might think now, if you bake bread, if you need bread, if you work with ceramics,
or ever have, that we do the same thing, the mind redirecting attention to the here and now,
where the breathing is happening, where the body resides, is this activity of pushing the pleasure
throughout the body, really sustaining it. This is like the kneading of bread, or the working
with ceramics, of getting the mixture of clay and water, or wheat and water to the right place,
drenched with it, but not sopping wet, right, unless you're making a special kind of sourdough
loaf, where you want those big holes, in which case you want it very hydrated, as I said,
I bake a little bread occasionally. So in doing this, we read here, this is also how
a practitioner develops mindfulness of the body. This way of bringing our attention back to the
here and now, and along with it, this spreading the good feelings that come with the meditation
throughout the body. And then again, we might say that in this text, these are presented as four
distinct states, your experience may be a lot more fluid. And what you can pay attention to here is
which aspects of these descriptions are kind of strong at a particular time, and then maybe
weak in another, the big distinction between the first and second genre is a simple one, really,
that there's less mental activity to keep bringing the mind back to the here and now.
And maybe that pleasure, steeping throughout the body, becomes sort of self sustaining,
doesn't need a lot of, doesn't need a lot of effort or efforting, and instead flows pretty
naturally. And this is what's described in the second genre simile, that this is as if we were
sitting in a mountain lake that doesn't receive its fresh water from rain or inlets of streams,
but rather wells up from an internal, an internal source and internal spring. And again, I would
ask you whether you have this experience occasionally in meditation of a sense of ease, maybe something
happening sort of naturally, organically without a lot of effort. Maybe the mind comes back up,
we apply a little bit more effort, maybe the mind then settles a little bit more.
The next place we find ourselves, there's an ebbing of some of the maybe more intense,
like pleasurable feelings, and maybe more of a upwelling of what we could call a glow of
contentment, something that maybe is a little bit more of mind than of body, but still pleasurable
or pleasant. The simile given for the third genre is that of a still pond in which lotuses are growing.
And I like the, in my mind, I have this sense of the lotuses very gently moved by a very,
very slow current sense of real collectedness ease stillness that's there in the mind,
that's accompanied by an awareness of the pleasantness of that particular mental state
and the stillness and collectedness and unification of the experience.
In the fourth genre, even this sort of glow of contentment can fade. And again,
you may have found yourself in meditation sometimes where there isn't much effort happening.
The mind is pretty, pretty easy coming back to the center again and again doesn't need a lot of
force or effort, where the, some maybe the sense of enjoyment of the seclusion has given away to
greater, greater contentment of mind. And even that sometimes fades where what's left is just
clarity or as is described in the description in the text of the fourth genre as a, as a,
as a, as a purity of equanimity and a strong holding to the center of experience with our
mindful attention. And the lovely simile that's provided here is this one of a cloth draping
the body. I like to think of the cloth as cloth, but mostly characterized by light,
that there's this sense of a lightness of experience, a lightness of being a lightness
of centered, collected attention and awareness. So putting aside the text, and I encourage you
to read it, maybe a little bit more with some of what I've tried to imbue this reading with,
which is a sense of just the simplicity of these descriptions, the way in which they really are
very connected to bodily experiences of meditation that we're very familiar with.
And again, maybe to move away from a sense of attainment around the jhana, so called,
maybe a sense of understanding that we, we, we find this as a fruit of practice as we
keep bringing our attention to the body as described in module 119. We find there's this
natural still of the mind, the natural collectiveness, the natural gathering around the
center of our experience. And as that happens, we, we find a growing clarity. This is the link
between insight or being able to see clearly how things arise and pass away or various other
aspects of our experience that are frequently hidden from view until the mind is still, until
the mind is quiet. Elsewhere in the texts, you'll see this referred to quite briefly
and elliptically. You'll, you'll, you'll, in the eightfold path in particular, the jhanas are
subsumed to wise samadhi, samasamadhi, sometimes translated, never by myself as wise concentration.
And I wanted to leave you with this note. If you've heard the word concentration and
maybe wondered how that has a place in the kind of opening of mind, right, and freeing of mind
and stillness of mind with which our current conception of concentration seems a little foreign.
I would just point to the literal meaning of the word concentration and the meaning it had
up until very recently. In fact, the meaning it had up until the time of the people who translated
these texts into English, people who were male Christian colonial administrators, among other
wonderful attributes. But the, the, the meaning of concentrate, you can figure out if you took
Latin in junior high school, like I was forced to, it just means to with or together with the center.
And from early on in the use in English, it meant the action of bringing to a center the
act of collecting or combining into or about a central point. This is from the online etymology
dictionary, one of my favorite online sources. And I think you can see how this reading of
module 119 supports this idea of this word concentrate, bringing things to center.
Again, we're not making anything up here. This actually happens when we bring mindful attention
to the body. We come to the center of our beings, the center of our experience. That's where the
breath happens. It's in the middle of the here and now where the body lives always. When we bring
the mind there, encourage it to rest, can become still open, translucent, clear, in a way that
allows us to see clearly and know the world maybe more, more, more honestly, more as it is. Diana.
Thank you, David, for this description of the John as in the similes in there.
And sometimes I appreciate very much, David, how you were emphasizing, we have some familiarity with
us. Because sometimes, and I certainly had this experience at the beginning, being like, this
is like formulaic, technical, I just can't relate to it. But just this, maybe like how we
heard earlier, how some people doing some practices discover, oh, yeah, when I really
work with it, there's a way in which it makes sense. So just leaving open that possibility that
as we practice and become familiar with the teachings, that these may become more and more
familiar unless this technical formulaic experience and more part of our individual experience.
I'm going to lead us in a guided meditation. And I'm just going to start just by saying,
also highlighting with David's hand, that this, any like deepening or softening or
broadening of our practice is, it's enormously helpful to have this attitude of openness,
softness, this inclusivity warmth. As opposed to this idea, like, I have to get something,
it's more this movement of letting go, this movement of openness is which allows the mind
to settle down. And you'll notice that in much of my 119 kaya-gattasade sutta, that the
jhana descriptions follow the practices of charnal ground contemplations. We haven't spoken a lot
about that. But charnal ground, contemplating how one's corpse or skeleton is, there's a lot
of letting go that happens when you, as the sutta points to, when you bring to mind that, oh, this
body too is of the same nature. It'll be like that. It'll be a skeleton. It'll be a corpse.
So there's some letting go that happens. So that's the movement. That's the direction we're going
here. As opposed to this feeling like I have to attain and get and get focused. It's an opening
of letting go, a softening. Okay. So we'll take a moment to settle in, settle into our posture.
Allowing yourself to adjust the posture in a way that feels like it could be balanced and
you could sustain here for a little bit of time.
Just sit and know that you're sitting,
feeling the sensations of sitting, maybe the sensations of touch with the floor,
the cushion, the chair, whatever it is you're sitting on, perhaps noticing the hardness or softness
of it, feeling the pressure against the body, feeling the support,
feeling the pressure against the buttocks,
the legs,
the feet, connected, grounded,
connected. Bringing an aliveness of attention, of mindfulness into the body, into the bodily
experience, inhabiting the body with aliveness, with presence,
maybe checking in with the face, how the face feels right now.
And if you notice there's some hold, some tension, relaxing as much as you can
without making it a big project, just softening
and feel how it feels to let go, to soften, to relax.
Around the eyes, around the jaw, the neck and throat.
It's okay if all the tension doesn't go, just whatever is possible right now.
Feeling into the shoulders,
allowing them to drop down, the arms and hands,
the upper back,
the lower back,
tuning into how it feels,
the chest,
the belly,
tuning into feeling, sensing, softening.
Can we be with this experience of bodily life right now,
opening to it, allowing as best we can, welcoming.
And is it possible, the remainder of our meditation period here, to separate
direction is one of kindness, set the direction as one of warmth, openness,
holding yourself in care, holding yourself in a kind attitude,
not a self-improvement project,
and at any time returning to this orientation of warmth and warm-heartedness and kindness.
Tuning into the sensations of breathing with this warm-heartedness.
Feeling the expansion and contraction, the chest or belly as the breath arises and falls away.
When the mind wanders,
doesn't have to be a problem, just very simply, gently begin again with the sensations of breathing.
Letting the breath bring awareness and ease to all parts of the body in a relaxed manner.
Maybe there's a way in which we can sprinkle awareness on those areas that might feel a little dry.
In the same way that we sprinkle water on flour, when we're making dough,
the movement of the breath could be like the kneading, the gentle movement to stay with the breath.
Allowing this warm-hearted awareness to pervade the body.
Maybe a little bit more water gets sprinkled
on the flour, on the bath powder,
so that the body is completely pervaded with this warm-hearted awareness.
It allows a sense of ease.
We're not denying or suppressing other experiences, but we're letting the awareness be filmed
with any sense of ease. Allowing the ease to grow and become as big as it would like.
Not forcing anything,
just creating the conditions
in which the body can be filmed, steeped in
some warm-hearted awareness, this growing sense of stability,
steadiness.
There might be some thoughts or sounds or bodily sensations that arise. That's okay.
Just let them be as if they were this gentle ball of string that just rolled towards this solid,
steady door. Just a soft little bump, doesn't knock over the door, doesn't knock over our
stability, our steadiness.
We're in the body, steep, filled, pervaded
with this warm-hearted awareness. There can be a sense of being filled up,
saturated, and the breath be allowing any parts that still feel dry
to become moistened.
Anything that feels maybe a little bit crumbly can feel brought into
this perhaps water jug of water, this jug that's filled with water,
the sense of fullness, completeness.
This filled-ness sense of being filmed
is contributing to this stability so much that the distractions just simply don't enter. We're
filled up.
Being filled up means we could, if we wanted to have the awareness go a particular direction,
just very simply tip this water jug that's filled with water, filled with this warm-hearted awareness.
It's just perfectly natural that water flows out in the same way, perfectly natural that our
awareness could flow in the direction we'd like it to go, just by little tipping and clinging the mind.
Staying with the breath, allowing the breath to be the vehicle in which
we can fill up and pervade this bodily experience.
Thank you.
So thank you. Introducing some of the similes that we find in this sutra,
which is that we might work with them or consider them. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ying.
Yeah, thank you, Ta Hiana and David for this beautiful meditation and the teachings.
I want to just check if you can hear me okay? Yeah, okay.
So we'll transition and follow on what David and Diana shared, but I also invite you to maybe
be engaged with this part of the teaching through the body. So let's bring this in as part of
your practice as you listen and kind of take in what I'm about to share.
And so now that you've heard about the Jhana similes and some of the similes that Diana brought in
in this next part of the sutra, but before I go there, I wanted to just say a few words about
how the Buddha used orphan and the similes and images in his teachings. I want to share this
that one of the inside teachers spoke about this and Shaila Catherine spoke about this.
The Buddha's teaching skill shines through the wide range of examples and similes that he used
to convey, subtle point of instruction. And these images help ordinary people comprehend
the deep topics and the striking similes continue to help meditation students gain a down-to-earth
sense of the profound path taught by the Buddha. I think you probably have a little bit of a sense
as you engage with the guided meditation that just happened. And so for me, it definitely feels the
sense of using similes and images. It's like the Buddha's creative way of finding ways to convey
things that are hard for people to relate to. I imagine, you know, so much of this is the inner
unfolding that the Buddha went through himself and finding ways to share this deep sense of
annoying with others. And so he's very creative in bringing the similes and images so that the
students and Yogi's have a way to relate to them through maybe felt sense and through the images
that he uses. So it's a functioning kind of like a poetry and art that opens the ways for us to
relate to them. So I'm going to move on to share you the next part of the sutra which is
titled, Progress Through the Mindfulness of the Body. From all these practices that you've been
engaging in and the Jhana practices, now this next chunk is speaking about where this mindfulness
body is leading towards, a progress through the mindfulness body. And this part of
the sutra starts from section 22. It starts with an overarching image of the streams flowing into
the ocean. And so here the image of streams flowing into the ocean is used to describe
the goodness of a cultivating mindfulness body is like the ocean that includes all the
wholesome qualities like the streams that are partaking in awakening process. Such goodness
kind of all coming in through this powerful practice of mindfulness of the body.
And so this is a quite a powerful and vivid image and for me that there is a sense of
uplifting of my heart and this is really kind of uplifted me. And from there
then the Buddha expanded this a bit by bringing two sets of a very vivid and evocative
set of opposing simileses that describes the danger of not cultivating and developing mindfulness
of the body and the reverse, the benefit and the potential of cultivating mindfulness of the body.
And so I'm going to share my screen here. Let's see if we can do that.
Okay, let's see.
Yeah, so hopefully you're seeing my screen here. I made a little handout to show you
the few simileses that are used in the satsuta and I started with this overarching image of
the great ocean that includes within that whatever streams that are flowing into the ocean.
And then this next set are the two opposing set of the simileses.
One starts by saying that the mindfulness of the body when it's undeveloped,
Mara finds an opportunity and a support in them very easily. And I just loosely translated as
Mara can easily find footing in one if the mindfulness of the body is undeveloped.
And otherwise when mindfulness of the body is developed, Mara has a hard time to find a footing
in oneself. And Mara is a signified and the forces of great hatred delusion and unwholesome forces
that tend to lead us into dukkha and stress suffering. And so here, let me just unpack
this three simileses a little bit. I invite you to work with the simileses,
kind of like what Diana guided us into, maybe through some form of felt sense.
And I can't say that I know all the details of what the simileses might be pointing to.
But I invite you to find ways to work with the simileses that may help you relate to
where those teachings are pointing towards. The first set is throwing a heavy stone bowl
against a mount of wet clay or wet mud. And that is used to describe the mindfulness of the body
when it's not developed, Mara can find footing in oneself. Here for me, there's a sense of
mount of wet mud or wet clay. There's a sense of very brittle and easy to break.
And it's almost as if there's no spinal strength in one's being. And so
Mara becomes a really, really strong force in this contrast. It's like throwing a heavy stone
ball at this kind of a wet clay and easily breaking oneself. So it's like maybe just
some irritating, painful sensation in the body. All of a sudden, just get us into a big story
about it. And so this, when the mindfulness of the body is not present, Mara can easily pull us out.
A contrasting image is that of throwing a light ball of string at a hardwood made door panel.
And so here, sometimes it's translated as hard wood or hardwood. Both are indicative of
kind of the kind of a wood that are hard to penetrate. And so that's the kind of door that's
being made. And so when the mindfulness developed or well cultivated, there is that centeredness
that David pointed to and that sense of impenetrable. And Diana used this image in our meditation also.
And so in this case, and the force of Mara is more like a light ball of string throwing
at the door. It doesn't really shake us. It's kind of unshakable. Even if a juicy thought comes in,
it's just like a breeze just goes through. It doesn't really penetrate us when the
mindfulness of the body is well developed. And that's one sense we can use to relate to the
testimonies. And the next image brings up a different sense for me. That's a lighting fire
with a dry sapless piece of wood. And here, a dry sapless piece of wood has that sense of
for me, it was this kind of dried out. Diana also used to this easy to crumble.
And also a sense of a lifeless, maybe very dreamy. And so very easy to light fire. Somebody said
something about us. All of a sudden, you know, we can get angry and just reactive and get caught up
by that. But the opposite image here is the lighting fire against a using a wet, sappy piece of wood.
For me, this wet, sappy piece of wood signifies this sense of juiciness as we engage with mindfulness
of the body, that this sense of a pervasiveness of the goodness, saturated with goodness.
And so when that happens, Mara is a hard to get getting kind of take hold of us.
And the last one is one of my favorite. And that is a filling water into the hollow,
empty water jug. And used to describe maybe when the mindfulness is undeveloped.
There can be a sense of hollowness and emptiness inside, even if our mind is busy and our life is
busy, there can be a sense of a hollow and emptiness inside. And so we can easily get caught by the
forces of a great huket delusion. But opposing image is that of a water jug filled of the full
of a water right up to the brim, so that the crows could drink from it. I love this a fun part
where the crow could drink from it. And I don't know exactly why, but I can't imagine, you know,
the crows and the birds that have a short beak. And it's hard for them to drink from a water jar
that's a half full. They need to stand somewhere to get their beaks in there to drink. So there is
that fullness of water pervading on one's being. And so Mara has no chance to get in.
So there are this kind of different ways of relating with the systemologies can help
bring maybe different aspects of the undeveloped and versus developed mind from the body.
And then the next part of the Sutta, I'm not going to go through the similes here.
Diana used to this in guided meditation, which is pointing to that when mindfulness body is
developed. And there is a way that allow ourselves to incline the mind towards
the awakening process. And this becomes ripened to us, like tipping the water jar
where the water would flow out. So I invite you to maybe look at the systemologies and
see how you might relate with them. So I'm going to pass it to Kim next.
Okay. Wonderful. Well, we've had quite a grand tour of these beautiful images in this Sutta.
It's one of the richest parts of the Sutta is some really, and then that's, I guess, the richness
of the body, you know, it's this direct visceral object that we can use in our meditation and
become so much more as we develop the mind through that. So this is now a chance for all of you to
speak together about the things you've heard from David and Yang and maybe the meditation
that you did with Diana also. So the breakout group question kind of takes off from where we've been.
And the question is, in your experience, how does mindfulness of the body help quiet the mind
and lead toward freedom? So we have the quieting of the mind, the stilling of it into Jhana,
and then the leading toward freedom as the mind develops in strength and can turn itself toward
anything knowable by direct knowledge, as Yang explained. So in your experience, how does mindfulness
of the body help quiet the mind and lead toward freedom? So it'll be available there in the chat
for you. And the way we'd like you to do this is you can go around in a spiral. We don't want it
to just be one person share, one person share monologues, but also not a super quick spiral.
Like this is a question where you don't need to have just a one word answer. So let's say that
each person makes one point, one brief point, and then the next person does and the next,
and hopefully you'll go around a couple times. And you can wait a little bit and see if what
somebody else says might bring something up for you for your next point. So let's see what you
can build together. I knew that you're building something together into a whole of how various
ways that mindfulness of the body helps quiet the mind and lead toward freedom. So maybe the person
who has the most colorful shirt can start. Okay, see you soon.
Yeah, here comes everybody back. And the recording has begun, Diana. Okay, Kathleen,
back to you. Yes. Over the last week, I had worked with the 32 parts of the body, well,
actually not all 32. I mainly stuck with the group one, the head hair, body hair.
But actually getting into it. And it's such a different approach.
Versus just being aware of your breath. There was so much more concentration involved.
It surprised me quite a bit. The difficulty I was having just switching the approach
all together. And then some other just general questions I had, why these particular parts?
Why in this order? And then I noticed things that were missing like the eyes and the ears.
So those were just some thoughts I had around the last week.
Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Kathleen, for sharing that. It is quite a
different thing when we work with the body in this way, you're highlighting this in your reflection.
And I remember when I was preparing this classes, and I had this text in front of me
on my screen, and my son was sitting next to me, and he was looking at the screen, and he began to
read this body hair, the sea news. All of a sudden he turned and looked at me. What are you doing?
So that was the moment I realized, wow, this is very different from how we are relating to
our bodies and what's in the body. And so for someone like a young boy, kind of reading this,
it's kind of just like, what are you guys doing? And yet it's so powerful in beginning to shift
and orienting our habitual ways of relating to our bodies. And as you're also pointing out,
there are some interesting observations and knowings coming from this in terms of what order
this is going and is there an order and what might be missing? And so there's a different kind of
knowing and opening of our knowing capacities that began to come in. I want to keep the questions
alive for yourself and then continue to engage in with this. Thank you for agreeing to have.
Yeah, thanks. Charles Lee. All right, thanks. Just a thank you to the other three players
in our quartet. It's a wonderful, wonderful conversation. And one thing I found interesting
that came up was mindfulness practices or mindful movement practices. So we were talking about
yoga, qigong, tai chi, how I guess this, you know, kind of this insight of the Pasana tradition,
you know, the most movement of formal practice seems to be walking meditation.
But I guess is there any role or room for more vigorous movement and maintaining mindfulness
and quieting the mind? Because I find my mind is most quiet after like a run or after a tennis
match. And I've had, you know, really serene, you know, quote unquote easy sits after, you know,
that type of vigorous activity. Yeah, it's a great thing that you pointed out. I think
the the sutra uses the postures and the daily activities, you know, kind of going out,
coming back and eating and drinking. Partly it's kind of, for me, it was a sense of descriptive
of how the monastics kind of are living their lives. But for us, the modern western
lives, I think it's perfectly okay to open our practice up to engage in various activities
that we're engaged in. And so running, swimming, and a great place to bring mindfulness in. And
you pointed out so well that this continuity, continuity helps us when we sit down to have
a deeper sense of a quiet and serenity. Yeah, so yeah, bring it in when you really feel this is
bring it in in your life. Maybe that's what I would say.
Hi, I was wondering about when David was talking about the janas. And can we experience those
during walking meditation? Does it have to be sitting? I do a whole lot more walking meditation.
It's easier for me to be in my body when I feel my feet on the floor. And so I just wondered
about jhana and walking meditation. Or is it just sitting? Absolutely. I think that stillness of
mind, the collectedness of mind are available throughout the activities and exercises or
instructions or descriptions that we find in the sutta. But there are canonical stories,
stories we find in the discourses of people who find themselves very awake as a result of or
during or in the walking practice. And the same exact things we talked about, for example, bringing
attention back to the feet hitting the floor or the ground, the connectedness with center
groundedness, that's available. The pleasure of the movement of the body is available and we can
encourage it to pervade the body, drench the body, steep the body. And similarly, with each of the
kind of different aspects of those experiences, they're all available in probably any activity of
the body. And the floor is open.
May I say one thing since nobody's raised a hand sort of in response to, I think it was
Kathleen's very, very interesting observations and question, which is kind of why? Why do we
find them in this order? Why? And one thing is just useful to keep in mind is that we're looking
at text that's a creation of not just humans, but practitioners, and that each of these
practice seems to have found its way here because it was useful to someone in stilling the mind and
seeing clearly. And so the order therein, there seems to be some rationale or logic behind it.
And similarly, with the 31 slash 32 body parts, as you practice into it, I think you'll connect in
a way with other practitioners and their experience of these practices that have come
down a very long, have a very long pedigree of working. So that's a nice thing to keep in mind
and a good answer to the question. Why is it like this? Well, because it worked, because it works.
Okay, maybe we'll move on. So Kim will open and see if you will.
Okay, so we're really getting into this exploration of the body. And I hope one thing you're finding
is that there are many more dimensions maybe to the body than we have thought about originally,
and that the body as a topic in Buddhist meditation practice can really develop the mind.
You know, we had this, we see a difference, let's say, between what we can know about the body
kind of intellectually. We had a reference to a biology book earlier, or a biology class,
and what we might learn that way, compared to how it feels as we use it, as we do yoga, and as we
meditate, and then use the relationship to the mind. So we have a lot of kind of momentum at
this point. And so I'm pointing us toward reading all the way through the sutra, maybe go back to
the beginning. It's not too long. Read the whole thing. And then next time we'll be talking about
these 10 benefits of the cultivation of mindfulness of the body. So when we have cultivated a stronger
mind and are beginning to resemble more this door panel and so forth, then we can start to see
some particular changes coming about that the Buddha found interesting. I mean, there's many,
many things that happen as we practice with mindfulness of the body. But the Buddha points
out that there are some particular ones that are relevant for our path toward liberation.
So we'll look at those. And then maybe in terms of practice, I guess there's maybe two choices.
One is try a different one that you haven't tried yet. If you're inspired, you know,
somebody mentioned doing the charnel ground meditations where we hadn't even talked about
those really. So you might, you know, try yet a different one. Or if you feel like you have
good momentum with one that you've a new one that you've chosen, maybe continue with that and deepen
it. So those are kind of two different paths, depending what feels like it's going to be most
suitable for you. But I encourage you not to just stick with the breath, which is the very first
one, if that's all you've been doing up until now in your practice. Here's an opportunity to
explore a bit more in this realm of the body. So just as a quick reminder, we do have a class just
like this on Thursday in the morning. And then our Saturday class is going to be longer. It's a four
hour half day from 830 to 1230 Pacific time. You can translate that if you're in a different zone.
And, you know, we're going to make it like a half day of practice with sitting and walking and a
review of some of these practices and also, of course, a chance to wrap up together and summarize.
So I hope you'll make the time to come. This is a sort of a special longer deeper class than we
sometimes do. And the topic really warrants it. So hope to see you Thursday and Saturday.
Saturday. Thanks, everyone. Take care. See you on Thursday and Saturday. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, mom. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Take care.
