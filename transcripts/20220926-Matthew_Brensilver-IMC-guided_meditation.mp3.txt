 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome folks. Yeah, welcome to you all. Yeah, happy to be with you this week and I hope you're well, wherever you are. And we'll do that thing we do and sit. Okay, so yes, settle into a posture that feels sustainable. Thank you. Let the Dharma tell you what to do. Okay. Let the muscle memory of any and all your prior practice tell you what to do. Thank you. Let your mind take its cues from the stillness, the silence. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm looking for the phenomena where giving some attention there brings in a sense of tranquility. He is. Maybe that's the breath. Maybe that's sensations in your hands or feet or something. The body that feels vaguely pleasant, soothing. Maybe that's the darkness behind your closed eyes. Or maybe even amidst the ambient noise in your environment, you can kind of tilt the attention towards silence. It's letting your mind take its cues from these soothing objects of attention. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The body is healing in itself. And the tranquility makes more room for the imperfection of the human condition to be digested. So maybe we just, what's arising is some sense of ease, quiet, and we just abide. There's no project to be done. Maybe the tranquility illuminates what is unfinished in the heart or the transient aches, heartache, that which is calling out to be digested by awareness. So whatever is arising in experience, there's goodness unfolding. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And no matter how you think you're doing, you can rest well in the wholesomeness of your intention. The goodness of the aspiration to wake up. Just connecting with that is also soothing, tranquilizing. You You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you we take a certain kind of Dharma posture Make a certain gesture of awareness. And then just let time pass. Let time be your ally. Nothing more needs to be done other than just making that gesture of awareness. Letting the logic of the Dharma unfold through you. You You You
