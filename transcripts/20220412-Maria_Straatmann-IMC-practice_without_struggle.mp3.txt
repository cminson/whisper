The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
As we come out of the sit in the last minute, notice yourself coming out of the
sit, just the becoming more aware. When I ring the bell, open your eyes.
Welcome to the continuing of your day. Welcome to just being here. Just here, just
you. So, so much, so much of our practice is about being something, being
somewhere, being some way, achieving something, so much of our lives. Forget
practice, life is like that, right? We always want, want something more, want
something better, want something to be a different way, just this constant
dissatisfaction with just this. And the settling into the ease of just this is
such a blessing, just a, just this, a wonderful. So today, what I want to talk
about is struggle. It occurred to me that very often I'm talking about just
settling in, just being here. And sometimes that just seems like a whole
lot of work, because there's a lot happening in life. We live very complex
lives. How do we exercise? How do we practice? How do we have what is the
practice of Dharma, without it becoming one more thing we have to do on the long
list of things we have to do to be who we want to be, how we want things to be. How
do we deal with dissatisfaction without it being a struggle against
dissatisfaction? How do we, what is the nature of diligence without struggle? What
does that look like? What does that feel like? How is that? Is that possible? How
do we do that? How do we exercise wise effort? How do I develop my capacity for
mindfulness so that I end suffering in my life?
What does that mean? It's a whole lot of words that we typically string together
and we all have shortcuts for it, you know, let go of that. Don't just let
that be. But always in this, there's this underlying tension about there's
something I want here. That's why I'm doing this, right? That's my motivation
for doing this and the sense of just being is hard to, hard to realize when
you're trying to attain it. Because there's just more, more, if only, so much if
only that we have in our ways of thinking. How do I come to peace with my
desire for the freedom that I seek without creating the sidecar of
disappointments and regrets? How do I do that? What does that look like? How do I
turn down the sound of what's wrong and enhance the light? So I'm going to give
you a very extended metaphor that I hope has some value for you. So I am late to
the practice of swimming. I'm almost 74, as close enough as a breath to 74. And
I've decided it's time for me to swim. And there's a pool in my apartment
complex. So the last couple of years I've been working on swimming. And in the
beginning, of course, what I did was just go in and splash around and go with my
grandkids, right? Let's go in and splash in the pool. But none of this trying to
swim thing because I'm basically afraid of water. Now, having said that, there's a
whole lot of different kinds of water, right? There's the water I watch. I love
going out to the ocean. The immensity of the ocean and the strength of the
emotion and the infinity of the emotion of the ocean and how it becomes a
place where I can dump all of the things, all the worries and disappointments and
ill emotions. Everything can be just dumped into that ocean and it will
absorb us. It's so immense. It absorbs all of it. And I can feel all of the
tension of all of those thoughts going into the ocean and it doesn't bother the
ocean at all. And the ocean is magnificent. Of course, I'm standing up on the
shore well away. Being in California, I know about sneaker waves. I never turn
my back on the ocean because actually I'm afraid of water. And so there's both
the immensity and the joy of seeing all of that wonderful ocean with the waves
crashing in. And the little, I got to be careful. I got to stay away from the
edge. You know, the water is cold. It can be quite unpleasant. The current along the
coast is cold. Still, the abstraction of it serves as a refuge for me. I can dump
a lot of my cares into that just temporarily and it just absorbs them
and carries them away. And then there's the water I place myself into, right? I
can go into the shower. I can go in the bathtub. These are places of delight or
usefulness and I can feel the water crushing over, flushing over my body or
sinking into the water. And all of these feelings are very pleasant and, you know,
it's quite safe. I control the temperature. I control the force of the water. I
control the volume of the water. You know, what's there to be afraid of? This
water is harmless water. Safety and fear are not part of that equation. And then
there are the bodies of water that I bravely enter or float along the top of
in some kind of vessel. You know, I can go into the swimming pool and, frankly,
it's not that big a pool. You know, I can always just walk to the end. It's not
even that deep. It's maybe six feet deep. You know, if I bounce on my toes, I can
breathe. It turns out, breath is an issue. What if I can't breathe in the water? How
do I breathe in the water? And that did turn out to be the biggest deterrent to
my being able to swim, by the way, is how do I manage breath in the water, right?
Now, there are issues here that have to do with fear, safety, doubt, aversion,
desire, sloth and torpor. Did these sound familiar? The hindrances are very
present in the practice of swimming, just as they are in the practice of Dharma,
any kind of practice of Dharma. All of the hindrances show up. So there's fear,
there's a sense of safety and security that are here. They're all the, oh, I don't
like water. I don't like cold water. I don't, I want the water to be a certain
way. I don't like a lot of people in the water splashing because then I might not
be able to breathe. I might swallow water. I can give you an infinite number of
reasons why I shouldn't do this. Why I shouldn't get into water. The fear I
experience around water. I love going sailing, but I have to tell you, it's also
terrifying. I get on the boat. Do I trust the captain? Who is this? Is this an
experienced person? How are they going to handle this? You know, I once was on a
catamaran, a hobby cat that overturned in the Coral Sea. I was absolutely
terrified. It was a two-person boat with pontoons, flat net with pontoons,
essentially. And it had a float on the top of the mast, so it would ride itself.
But I was clinging for dear life to one of these pontoons. And my husband, who
was with me, said, get on the boat! I'm just hanging there, so glad I'm still
alive, right? Because he, is very used to water, has always grown up about water,
doesn't have this fear of water. We're different. And all of us in any of the
conditions we are in are different. And our our experiences are different. We're
in the same place, but our experiences are different. Just as the experience of
water can be pleasant or unpleasant, it can be delightful, life-enriching, it can
be cold and frightening.
All of these experiences of water are possible in any moment. And the ease I
have has a lot to do with whatever conditions show up in that moment. It has
something to do with whether I feel in control and no amount of telling myself
let go of the need to be in control is going to change that. But the honesty of
saying what's actually true here to limit my experience to the sense of this
allowed me to crawl up out of the coral sea onto the pontoon and then cling for
the rest of the trip to that netting. Because that's what you do, you take the
next step. You just take the next step. As we were sitting here quietly in
meditation, I thought, well, let's see, I should check the time. I'm aware of my
responsibility to keep going. And then suddenly I felt my heart rate increase
slightly because, well, I'm going to have to speak and then I said, and you will
just speak one word at a time. Not so much holding on to the rest of the of
the meditation, but rather saying, and now it's time for the next step. Just the
next step. Just the next step. Always practices like that.
Sometimes water is a blessing. Sometimes it is threatening. Sometimes it's
thrilling. Sometimes it's frightening. But it's all water. It's all just
experience. All of the experiences we have are just experiences. It's really
hard to grasp what that means. You know, we want to make everything in our life
mean something. But it is just the sensory input. And then we quickly put it
into a category and we note something about it and say something about it. And
then once we say something about it, it shifts our awareness. But suppose, and
this is what's been consuming me for the last few months, suppose instead of
taking the experience and noting it, perceiving what it is and then becoming
more aware of that, suppose we become aware of what we're aware of first. And
not so much what we think about it. And that we can use awareness that allows
us to see something slightly different. So I'm going to go back to my
metaphor again. So one of the things I noticed is the bathtub has lots of
controls. The shower has lots of controls. And it's almost cheating enjoying
that water. And sometimes I'm aware of just the pleasure of being able to turn
on the water and turn it off. Just but when I get into the ocean, well, you
know, that's different. It's saltwater. So I tend to be a little more buoyant in
the saltwater. And if I get long enough fins and a snorkel, I can do all kinds of
reef watching. I love reef watching. It's one of the great joys of my life. And
yet every time as I get wet, ready to enter the water, I'm aware of the
frisson of fear. Something could happen in that water. You know, it's like the
monsters under the bed. And to see that reluctance, that pushing away of the
experience. And I remind myself, Maria, not only are there lots of people around
to help you, but these fins, this your body will just float around, you can
just float, just float. And I force myself in and I just float. And then I'm
overcome by the beauty that I'm seeing in the water. And of course, I have that
great snorkel that allows me to not worry about breathing, right? So just
breathe, just breathe. And the experience of just breathe, just float. When I
become aware of it, becomes a data point that my brain takes in that I can do
this. I can, this is safe to do this. I can do this. And what's reinforced is
that the faith that water is not my enemy, that I can do this. And every time
that is reinforced in me, it becomes another source of confidence. Okay, so
now I'm going to get into my swimming pool and my apartment complex. I'm not
going to jump in with the snorkel and my fins. There's not even room for that,
you know, if everybody had fins and snorkels, we'd have to just stand there. So
now what do I do? And so I recently sat in the last couple of years, lost a lot
of weight and I discovered that I was less buoyant than I was before. Wait a
minute, I'm used to having some buoyancy here. And so, so in the beginning, I had
to wear, you know, one of these inflatable belt or these belts so that
it would keep you floating. And I would float across the water when I first
began. It was embarrassing the way I was. And then, then I discovered I could
let go of that. And I got some short fins, short swim fins, their exercise
fins. And that gave me enough propulsion, I could hold my breath all the way to
the end of the pool. And I said, Oh, Oh, I can just hold my breath. What? And so
now I can readily swim back and forth. And I don't care if I stop at the end
and breathe and then swim to the other end of the lap and back and forth. Because
I'm becoming more comfortable in the water. I'm becoming more at ease in the
water. And the faith that I'm developing is just one more example of, Oh, this is
possible. Like, what is the spirit of swimming? I could swim. And, and I work
on that for me, it's very meditative. I feel the flow of water along my body.
And I feel my feet going up and down on it. In the beginning, I noticed I was
clenching my teeth. They're like, if I hold on, then I can make it to the end.
And I came to realize that I wasn't going to get there more safely by
clenching my teeth. That I could relax my jaw and swim to the end of the pool.
But that the effort I was putting in was misplaced. The energy of clenching my
teeth was not useful. If I could relax that, then I could notice how my arms
were moving and how my legs were moving and how the water was filling up for
my body. And the awareness of what I was paying attention to changed. And the
tension of how hard I was trying began to ease. And as I noticed all of these
things, the tension of trying was getting in the way of just swimming back
and forth, just going back and forth. The ease of practice is not related to
how good you are at something, but the things that the extra energy of wanting
to be this way, look this way, try this way is getting in the way of the ease
of just doing it. Does that make sense? That we become so tangled in the
struggle, in the struggle that we don't realize that the practice is just
doing. It's just going back and forth. It's just being here. It's just with
whatever this is, whatever this is. And then when I notice, oh, this is just
not working. Oh, this is not working. It doesn't mean I will never swim. It just
means this is not working. I have to work on this. But I have increasing
confidence that water is not that dangerous. And yet every time I'm ready
to go in the pool, I have to take a breath and let it out. Okay, I can do
this every time. It's a swimming pool. It's a short pool. It's 10 yards long.
It's nothing. But I'm aware of that piece of fear and say, yeah, fear. It's not
dismissive. You can be aware of the fear of this movement, this step, this
person, this conversation. You can be aware of it without saying, oh, I got
to do something about the fear. I got to let go of the fear. I got to treat the
fear. It's just notice the fear. And then take the next step. And then dive in to
the next step. It doesn't have to be what it's about. So I've been using the
pool to explore water and my relationship to it. And it's become not only an
extension of my practice, but a sort of a place where I notice, notice, oh, look,
this comes up, this goes away, this happens. My relationship to it is open
to discovery. I'm confronting the fear of water gradually. I'm not trying to
overcome something. What I'm doing is cultivating the capacity to swim. Now,
part of that is I'm just not as strong as I once was. I'm not as agile as I
once was. Okay, so this body is the body that's trying to swim. This body with
all of its aches and pains and limitations and an interest in playing in the
water. So that I notice in this practice, I notice the hindrances, I meet them. But
I also meet the faculties, the five faculties that we have in Buddhism, the
five faculties being, see, they just, they, they totally disappeared those five
faculties. Okay, faith, faith or competence, effort, or perseverance, what we
put into it, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom, faith. I have a hard time
going from step one to step two, because I'm so involved right now with faith
and confidence. Okay, so faith and confidence, effort, which is really what
struggle is about, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. What do I
learn? And each of these faculties becomes a place of exploration and
development of cultivation, which seem to have, which seem to me to be more
skillful at this stage than worrying about all the hindrances and battling the
hindrances, that to build up the capacities gives me the resilience and
strength like becoming flexible or building up your muscle strength helps
you to meet the unexpected. When I shift my awareness away from all the things
that are standing in the way of practice or of swimming, and instead look at
what are the capacities that I'm developing that encourage me, that
becomes a useful place of investigation. What do I do with these? How do I
look at that? When I'm struggling, I'm more subject to fear. When I'm fighting
against something, I'm introducing an attitude of mind that is fighting against
the whole idea of battle and struggle creates tension, even when I'm talking
about it. No, my finger movements are getting tighter, and I can feel my
throat getting tighter, just talking about the struggle. And when I talk about
faith and effort, I kind of soften a little bit. It's a little okay. So
there is less of the aversion to aversion, the aversion to all of the
hindrances. And instead, I'm looking at what is it that I'm really trying to do
here? I'm not engaged in swimming to overcome the hindrances. It turns out
that I'm engaged in swimming because I want to enjoy being in the water.
I'm not entering it because I want to overcome my fear of water, although
that lurks back here in the back of my brain. But rather, how can I just allow
myself to enjoy? And you know what? I've been getting to enjoy swimming. I look
forward to it. I'm eager to do it. I make sure my name is on the reservation
list, not because I'm forcing myself to exercise, but because it's delightful to
find myself moving through the water. Who knew? I never would have predicted
that. Who knew? It isn't what I know or what my goal is, but what can I
discover in this moment when I just let this moment happen? I'm not trying to
enter a triathlon. I just want to be okay in the water. So I don't, so my
swimming doesn't have to look like something. My practice doesn't have to
look like something. It doesn't have to represent something. It can just be, I
can find delight instead of struggle. Not because I'm looking for delight, but
because it arises when I say, oh look, I've seen something new. All of the
comparisons and measuring just get in the way. Just get in the way. If I can just
be aware and see how my awareness is coloring my experience, that's really
useful. So then I can see the hindrances as temporary veils, barriers that are
obscuring what I want. And they are not things to be fought against, but they are
just states that arise as we practice. Oh, I don't feel like it today. I have to get
dressed. I have to go over the pool. Then I have to deal with the swimming stuff
afterward. This is sloth and torpor. Okay, you're making excuses. Or I'm actually
really weary. And learning to distinguish between laziness and
weariness is a distinction that comes with just, what am I aware of here? So the
first thing is, I just don't want to go today. Okay, don't want to go. Give up. But
it turns out with just a little bit of effort, I can get myself there and feel
that lovely swinging, moving through the water. How delightful. But I almost didn't
allow myself to experience because I was tied up with, oh, I just don't feel like
it today. And hidden behind that are all kinds of things, which I could analyze,
they might be very interesting. But if I don't worry about what they are, but
rather say, how strong is that? Am I really, is it weariness because of
something? Or is it just not quite enough effort? Navigating the effort and
struggle is part of what makes the difference between the discovery of
practice and the struggle of having to do something. And that is not a black and
white affair. That's a place of experience where we just say, what's
happening here? The hindrances are not what happens to us. Instead, they're the
names of states that describe the distance between what is true and what
we want. They're the names of straight states that describe the distance
between what is true and what we want. I think of suffering as wanting things to
be other than they are. And the hindrances are wanting things to be
other than they are. I don't want to be restless. If I think things are
restless, what's the difference between restlessness and high energy? From a
sense point of view, what you're feeling is high frequency. Now, when we name it
restlessness, we're saying, I am valuing calmness in this moment. And what I'm
experiencing is this, I want a slowly rising rhythm to my life, not a jagged
rhythm to my life. And therefore, I name it restlessness. But it could be
the energy of excitement. And the difference is the meaning we attach to
the sensory input. We identify this and we say, oh yeah, that's restlessness or
that's aversion or that's desire. And I'm leaning into the moment, sort of like
gripping my teeth together to get to the end of the pool, which was not
helping at all, and was distracting me from the ease of just moving through the
water. But because my attention was on this tension, or not aware of the
attention, but just feeling that urge to get to the other side, that I couldn't
just relax and get to the other side.
Just get to the other side. I often use the example of being in a hurry to get
somewhere and people are driving and people are in front of me. And I find
myself leaning into the steering wheel and gripping the steering wheel and
saying, Maria, you can't get there any faster than the car. Relax. It's that
same energy when you notice this tension is not contributing. This tension is
just, this is just a struggle. I could say let go of the struggle, or I could
say, what's this about? Why is this here? What is the usefulness of this? What
about the absence of this? Does it get in the way of where I'm going? No. Well
then, what's the point of that? We sometimes get into the tyranny of a
goal, and we don't want to stray from that goal. And anything that gets away from
that goal is to be fought against. But if we notice we're just moving away from
something, is that the goal? Or is that the thing?
When we meet these aversions to what is up with aversion, we're creating
another level of suffering. So the other morning, I noticed that that ill will
was with me. Let's just say there was just this miasma of feeling around me
that was just, I don't want. And it wasn't so much, I wasn't aware of what I
didn't want, as I was just, don't touch me, don't talk to me, just, and my husband
was trying to have a conversation with me. And I was aware of this ill will. And so
I brought up all my Buddhist techniques. Remember your intention to
be kind to your husband. You know, the mind came up with this, oh yeah. Okay, that's
not working right now. I'm really, so I was overwhelmed with this ill will. I
did not like this ill will. I wanted this ill will to go away. I wanted to do
metta and soften my heart all the tricks I have. And then I thought, well, I
guess it just needs to be seen this ill will. And the only thing I can do is
nothing. And the energy of just stopping so that I don't retort, say
something inappropriate, unkind, just do nothing. Stop trying to be better. Just do
nothing. And I just sat there feeling this horrible energy and noticing how
unpleasant it was. And unpleasant, but I was literally biting my tongue. Just do
nothing. At least do nothing, right? And at that moment, there were these a flock
of cedar wax wings flew into the trees outside the window. I was sitting at a
dining room table and there's some redwood trees. And a flock of cedar
wax wings came in, which one of my favorite beautiful bird, actually. And for
two or three days, each year, the flock comes in and they demolish the
pyrocantha berries and the bushes down below. I'm on the third floor. It's
down down below. And they these come in two or three days a year. And I always
wait for them 100 birds. And in three days, the berries are all gone. They're
all gone. And just at that moment, they came in. And I and I was filled with a
feeling of delight. So here's my asthma of ill will suddenly delight, delight
dispels, dispels it will. It just they can't coexist. Nothing was resolved. I
did nothing. But everything shifted. Now, you could call this a miracle, an
accident, serendipity. But the truth is, it was also true that I was doing
nothing. I was leaving it totally open to okay, whatever. Had I not been in
that space, had I been locked into trying to deal with the ill will, I
would have missed the birds. I wouldn't have looked out the window. I wouldn't
have seen them if I was looking out the window, because I would have been
concerned assumed with the aversion to aversion. So what I'm suggesting here is
not that we ignore the negative things that occur in our lives, or the great
sadnesses, or the disappointments and and the unexplained, the unexpected, but
rather that we say, ah, this hurts. And just see that and not have to deal with
it, not have to do something about it. We just take the next step. It doesn't
have to be a life plan for every unexpected activity. We don't have to
meet the moment with self criticism or aversion. We just say, okay, my
intention. My intention is to be open. I'm not feeling safe. Okay, but it is my
intention. So how do I honor that intention when I don't feel safe? Well, I
notice the existence of both things. And I don't give preference to one or the
other so much as I just allow. I see it as clearly as I can possibly see it. When
I do metapractice, I remember that it isn't about becoming a better person, or
dispelling ill will against another person. It is really about softening my
heart and opening my heart that that that has more virtue than solving a
problem with that person, because it makes me more willing, more confident, more
mindful. It develops those capacities that are the five faculties necessary for
practice. So they don't spend so much time on repairing, but more time on
building. Take what this is. These are the conditions I have. Yesterday's
conditions are really not the ones I have to deal with. They're these conditions.
Whether I was fearful or buoyant in the water have nothing to do with this body
of water. What do I do with this body of water? This person now, this place, this
is what I this is. This is where I take my next step. This is where I try to be
skillful with what I see, and I try to see as clearly as possible. I try not to
become entangled in the ill will, or the fear, or the uncertainty, or the doubt. I
just notice, oh, uncertainty is here, but it isn't me. It's just what's here now.
Ill will is here. Fear is here. But if I battle fear, I'm lost in the struggle. And
sometimes fear just has to be seen. And then you say, so what am I afraid of?
Well, I'm afraid of falling off the mountain. Well, the only thing that's
true is you're not going to stay here. So you might as well take the first step.
Yes, fear is here. And I have to admit it's here. This is here. But I don't have
to become the fear. I don't have to operate from the fear. I just have to see
it. I have to know it. Or sorrow is here. I don't have to let sorrow consume me.
Somebody sent me a quote yesterday, and she said in in Irish, one doesn't say I'm
sad. They say sadness is upon me. And I kind of like that, you know, and you
don't have to personalize sadness. It's sadness is upon me. You can feel the
weight of the sadness. And you can feel the uncertainty of the sadness. But you
don't have to become the sadness. In the becoming, we are strengthening it. And
we're we're shaping our awareness of what then we can see. But when we're
outside and feel the weight of the sadness, then we can take the knowing of
the sadness.
And we can say, And what else is here? What needs to be seen along with the
sadness?
We use mindfulness to increase what we're aware of. I listened to something
from Joseph Goldstein yesterday, he was talking about aggregates, and he was
talking about how to how to look at an experience and and not let the
experience become all about what we think about it, right? If we stop
assigning meaning to the state, it's free to morph, it's free to change. But
when we name it, and we hold on to that, the way he described it is, I
expand my noting. So if he says, I note, I can't remember what example he is
now, but I know that he he was he was engaged in sexual fantasies, and he
was noticing the pleasure of it. And he would say, Okay, I noticed this, I
noticed this, I noticed this, and then he said, I noticed he changed it, he
expanded it to be, I noticed contact and the liking. So he divided it into
sensing what he was sensing. And when he thought about it, and that helped him
to break the being locked in the compulsive thoughts. Right. So, so what
he called expanding the noting, I talk about as shifting the awareness, what
am I aware of? In addition to what I've named it, what else am I aware of? So
that we don't dismiss our feelings and get locked into the feelings based on
what we've named them, resentment, aversion, embarrassment, fear. But
rather we say, ah, embarrassment, and, and what else? Well, fear of not being
liked. Oh, fear of not being liked, but I may never see fear of not being
liked, because I'm locked on embarrassment. This is how we grow in
wisdom and increase the capacity for wisdom, the faculty of wisdom, by just
allowing ourselves to see what else is here in this experience and not being
locked in the struggle against the thing. Taysha Nia says, don't use
excessive energy trying to be mindful. Simply keep reminding yourself to be
mindful. It's in the same spirit. It's, it's not becoming a mindful person,
developing mindfulness, but just reminding oneself to be mindful. Just
reminding. He said further, strong mindfulness is used to describe a
state of mind in which the five faculties of faith, effort, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom or understanding are in balance. We don't
do one in favor of the other, but we have these five faculties in balance. If
we're still focused on, I got to be mindful of my breath, mindful of my
breath, mindful of it. The opportunity for wisdom evaporates. The opportunity
for faith evaporates because now I'm consumed with doubt because I can't
stay there. It's about ease in just thisness. I didn't take up swimming
just in the fear of water, but to find joy in swimming into your practice, not
to make it something else to do, but to find joy in the practice. Not
because you're looking for it, but because it naturally emerges when
you're not in struggle, when you're not engaged in wanting things to be other
than they are. I run way over time for what I was going to say. I'm going to
close what I was going to say with a poem because I got to the end of
writing my talk yesterday and I recalled this poem and I said, yes. So
this is a Jane Hirschfield poem. It's called The Promise.
Mysteriously, they entered those few minutes. Mysteriously, they left. As
if the great dog of confusion guarding my heart, who was always
sleepless, suddenly slept. It was not any awakening of the large, not so
much of that, only a stepping back from the petty. I gazed at the range of
blue mountains. I drank from the stream, tossed in a small stone from
the bank. Whatever direction the fates of my life might travel, I
trusted. Even the greedy direction, even the grieving trusted. There was
nothing left to be saved from bliss nor danger. The dog's tail wagged a
little in his stream.
The promise. Mysteriously, they entered those few minutes. Mysteriously, they
left. As if the great dog of confusion guarding my heart, who was always
sleepless, suddenly slept. It was not any awakening of the large, not so
much as that, only a stepping back from the petty. I gazed at the range of
blue mountains. I drank from the stream, tossed in a small stone from the
bank. Whatever direction of the fates my life might travel, I trusted. Even
the greedy direction, even the grieving trusted. There was nothing left to be
saved from bliss nor danger. The dog's tail wagged a little in his stream.
So those are my thoughts today. I wish you ease in that the struggle is not
there. That you just see it, just see it. Thank you.
