 So in our final evening sitting together for this retreat, in this new moment, this fresh moment, inviting you to rest, to relax into the body, your body. Whether you're sitting or lying down, standing up. You see, how is it now? How is it to be embodied here, in this moment? Allowing this experience of embodiment to bring a sense of stability and support, of groundedness and presence. And bringing an attitude, a quality of receptivity, kindness, this tenderness of the heart to meet whatever experience may be arising for you now. And including in this stable, presence, this quality of warmth, of kindness, a kind of wide, spacious awareness. A quality of allowing, allowing the small mind to be here and to be known. Whatever it may be, saying, thinking, comment. Also allowing the big mind, the big mind of awareness. It's always here, always available. The mind that knows, without your needing to do anything. And as we bring the capacities of these three centers together, knowing that this offers us a possibility of seeing in new ways, of allowing the mystery of reality to display itself fresh, new. In that spirit, I'll offer one of my favorite Dharma teachings from the Zen Master Ehay Dogen. From his teaching called the Genjou Koan. Genjou Koan means the Koan of what's happening now. The Koan of this moment, here. And he points us toward this possibility of seeing the world with fresh eyes. He writes, when you sail out in a boat for the middle of the ocean, where there's a barking dog. Oh, thank God. When you sail out in a boat to the middle of the ocean, where no land is in sight, and you view the four directions. When you sail out in a boat to the middle of the ocean, where no land is in sight, and you view the four directions, the ocean looks circular and does not look any other way. But, he says, the ocean is neither round nor square. Its features are infinite in variety. It is like a palace. It is like a jewel. It only looks circular as far as your eye of practice can see at this time. The ocean is neither round nor square. Its features are infinite in variety. It is like a palace. It is like a jewel. It only looks circular as far as your eye of practice can see at this time. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this. All things are like this.

So here we are together in the middle of the ocean on our last night of retreat. What do you see? What is here? What is here? What is here? As we bring our evening of formal practice to a close, taking a moment to reflect on any goodness, any embodied wisdom, any tender heartedness, any insight or clear seeing that may have arisen for you over the course of the day. And offering it all up, opening our hands, opening our hearts, freely and generously sharing. Any goodness, any benefit, any of the merit that may have come for each of us, for all of us. And offering our sincere wish that our practice, the ups and downs and twists and turns of our efforts and our insights may be of help, may be a balm for the many, many beings seen and unseen, known and unknown, sentient beings and non-sentient beings. And offering a goodness to the earth itself. And by the power and truth of our practice together, may all beings everywhere find true happiness and peace. May all beings be safe, free from harm. May all beings discover a sense of ease and well-being. And may we, together with all beings, be free from suffering. May we awaken and be free. So again, if you feel some energy or some momentum from your practice today or over the last few days, knowing that you can see the beautiful image of the meditation hall. It's dark in the room with some beautiful light. You're welcome to continue to practice. And of course, if you are tired and in need of rest, you can also continue to practice. And if you wake early and wish, you are always welcome to come into the hall to sit. But however and whatever shape or form your practice continues to unfold, just continuing to meet each moment as it is with embodied presence, tender heart, and a wide, spacious mind. Thank you all very much for your attention. And take good care of yourselves this evening. We'll see you in the morning.
