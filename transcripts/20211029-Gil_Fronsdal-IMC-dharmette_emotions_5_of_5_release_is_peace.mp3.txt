 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So here on the fifth talk on mindfulness of emotions, where we've talked about release, release in relationship to emotions. I think I said this at the beginning as well, that some emotions are a product or arise together with stress, with tension. And some emotions flow with the lack of tension, the lack of stress. And generally, the unwholesome emotions, the ones that are afflictive, that are painful to have, or which motivate, kind of harmful activity in the world, that those come with stress. And so as we release the stress, release the tension, the tightness, those afflictive, unwholesome emotions tend to have less energy, less juice, less nourishment to keep going. The emotions, the sense of well-being that we can have when there's no stress, no tension, that tends to support to make room for the wholesome movements. And so the absence of stress tends not to result in more afflictive emotions, but rather the beneficial emotions, the supportive emotions, the nourishing emotions. Love, joy, delight, happiness, care, compassion, contentment, gladness, tranquility, calm, a whole slew of things like this. So this release, to really learn how to release and let go, doesn't leave us emotionally neutral, kind of like a blank. What it does, it might be initially that way for a little while, is a transition, because if we're really used to swirling in fear, anxiety, swirling in anger, resentments, swirling in desires and ambition, that we're comfortable, some people are comfortable with that. And so when they let go of that, the energy, the motivation, the charge that they've been living their life on is lacking, and nothing has replaced it yet. It can feel blank for a while. But it's kind of like giving up coffee and having spent three days adjusting to that until a natural vitality comes back. Same thing with as we switch from spending a lot of time with afflictive, difficult emotions, and it may be a lifetime, there's a transition. But as that transition unfolds and the lack of tension and stress is there, that makes room for these beneficial emotions. And then they, I think it's kind of, I find it kind of humorous or delightful, that as these beneficial emotions arise, any movement to cling to them, to resist them or want to hold on to them, is stress. And it's the very opposite, it moves us in the opposite direction from what they're all about. So it's kind of like rubbing a cat, pitting a cat against the hair, the way the hair lays down. The hair gets kind of bunched up and raised up rather than flat down, or going against the grain of the wood to cling to these emotionally good emotions. So it's kind of like the tendency to want to hold on to them or do with them is there, but at the same time you know you can't do it. It doesn't make sense to do it, it's not appropriate to do it. And so I find it kind of humorous to be in that middle spot there and just delight and that, oh I can't do anything with it, I can't hold on to it, I have to let go. I can't make it mine, I can't be in charge of it in a certain way or claim it. There's freedom in relationship to them. But some people don't understand or haven't been told or learned that as we practice, that our life matures and as letting go deepens, the connection to our inner life deepens, to life deepens, that there's also joy and well-being and happiness. It doesn't have to be dramatic, sometimes has a quiet feeling to it, but to avail ourselves that, to make room for that. Release is not only about what we let go of, it's also what we make room for. And in that making room for, there's a lot of peace. And I think the two words, two concepts of the Buddha most commonly use to describe how someone is when there's been a deep letting go, deep release, is peace and happiness, and peaceful happiness, happy peace, peace and happiness. And I don't think we can go too wrong with those in the forefront, especially when those are the very conditions that allow for our deepest or fullest forms of care for the world to operate as well, because there's nothing that interferes with it, there's no blocks to it. So to let go deeply and in relationship to emotions, to let go of the stories we have about it, to let go of the preferences we have about our emotional life, to be able to tease apart all the different component parts of what's happening when we have emotions, and find the place of holding. And sometimes the clinging and the holding is not in the emotion itself, but in the way in which we relate to the emotion, the knowing, the directedness of attention, the attitude we have about it, the ways we're thinking about it. And so sometimes we have to kind of turn away from the emotion, per se, and look more at the attitude, more at the directedness of mind, or the engagement of the mind in the emotion, to find the place where something can let go and relax. And to let go, to relax, to release, and to appreciate every moment of release so that it becomes kind of a positive reinforcement for release. We start recognizing that release, letting go, is a healthy thing, a good thing. To learn to let go enough so we learn the skill of letting go, we learn when it's appropriate to let go, we learn how to let go appropriately. One of the things I had to learn was if I let go, and I was kind of emotionally neutral, it would come back and bite me. I hadn't really let go. To really have let go in a healthy way, that there had to be some modicum, some degree of joy or lightness that came in the wake of it. So to release, let go. And you might try it. You might try when you have emotions of all kinds, especially when you're in the grip of them or strong. Maybe you have to pull yourself away from the situation you're in, go for a walk or sit down or something, and just kind of maybe go through these, just letting go in a deep way, maybe go through these five hours. And some people really like going through a systematic process that keeps them engaged and focused. To relax, recognize, respect, restore, and then release. But all those are a form of letting go and or involve some degree of letting go, release. So thank you for this. In my experience, my practice life, one of the byproducts of release, letting go, of releasing the stress, is profound gratitude. It's a tremendous feeling of gratitude. And it's one of the, I think I've been one of the great gifts of this practice. And it's a gratitude which often I haven't, sometimes I feel grateful for particular things, the practice, the Buddha, the community I'm practicing with, many things. But the one that kind of gratitude that I find the most, I don't know, somehow meaningful or satisfying or profound or something joyful, is the gratitude that it's just grateful for no reason. Just grateful. Just a feeling of gratitude, gratefulness. And so emotions. We're going to week on emotions. And I hope that this has given you a new perspective on how to live with emotions, practice with emotions, appreciate emotions. And that it supports you and brings you greater sense of well-being and maybe even some gratitude for this life of ours. So thank you all very much.
