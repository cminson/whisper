To continue with the theme of wisdom, Buddhism is 
often considered to be a wisdom tradition. To some 
degree, wisdom is seen as the gateway to liberation 
and living a liberated life. So what is wisdom? One thing 
that is good to know is that it's a faculty w e have – the 
discerning faculty, the distinguishing faculty, the faculty 
of seeing and understanding clearly. It's also a capacity 
we have. It doesn't involve a lot of book learning, study, 
or learning all the lists of Buddhism. Rather, it's 
developing our  native and natural capacity to see 
clearly.  
 
A lot of it has to do with becoming clearer in our 
capacity to be aware. That eventually leads to what I'm 
going to talk about today as revelatory wisdom. This is 
an idiosyncratic term that I've come up with. I  like it  
  audiodharma.org  because it implies that things are revealed to us as we 
practice – rather than us figuring it out, or trying so hard 
to understand what's there. We bring ourselves to a 
place where we allow our experience to show its nature 
and characteristics to us. We are preparing ourselves 
for the revelation of the deeper building blocks of 
experience for the purpose of liberation and no longer 
clinging to things.  
 
The earlier form of wisdom – the wisdom that 
distinguishes things – helps us to make choices tha t 
move us towards greater clarity. A lot of that has to do 
with becoming calmer and stiller . It’s not because 
calmness and stillness per se are the point, even 
though it can be quite nice and enlivening in a 
wonderful way to have a certain kind of calmness  of 
mind. It's calm that allows us to see more clearly. Then 
seeing more clearly, we can make better choices that 
can support the continued deepening of that clarity and 
stillness.  
 
An analogy for this is that in many places now in the 
world, things have slowed down because of the shelter 
in place . There's a lot less traffic and noise in some 
urban areas, and people are surprised to hear the 
sounds of birds. They didn't know that there were so 
many birds in these urban areas, but n ow they can hear 
them.  
  
  audiodharma.org  In Venice, people weren’t aware of the fish swimming in 
the canals because the mud was so churned up that the 
water was brown. You couldn’t see into it. Now that 
there's less traffic in the canals, the water has settled, 
and people see dolphins and fish sw imming there.  
 
Here I tend to forget that there are mountains on the 
edges of the Bay Area – Mount Diablo, Mount Hamilton. 
Every once in a while, when the air is clear of smog, I 
can see with crystal clarity the mountains across the 
Bay. It's a revelation : "Wow, look at that! They seem so 
close by."  
 
All of these are examples of something disappearing to 
create clarity so that we can see much more clearly 
something that was covered over at other times. It’s the 
same thing with our mind. The calmness and c larity 
we're cultivating are to settle  what obscures our ability 
to see, the underlying nature of our moment -to-moment 
experience. One of the things we're settling is our 
conceptual mind – the mind that lives in memories and 
in the future, that makes  stories, interpretations, and 
predictions – and even the quieter mind with its  simpler 
concepts.  
 
Some concepts  are quite innocent and useful. But to 
always be thinking about these concepts keeps us in a 
more active part of the mind. It keeps little things 
obscured. So for example, I'm sitting here in what's  
  audiodharma.org  usually called a meditation hall and I’m thinking in 
medi tation, "I'm sitting in a meditation hall. This is a 
meditation hall." It's true to a certain degree, but it's 
keeping the mind busy. I could let go of the concept of a 
meditation hall and just be aware of the walls, carpet, 
ceilings, and lights – and just  see them. I don't even 
have to have names for them: lights or carpets. I just 
become aware and see.  
 
The advantage of quieting the conceptual mind is that 
with greater clarity, something gets revealed. We see 
something. We start seeing what I call the und erlying 
building blocks through which we construct  the 
conventional world we live in  – the conventional sense 
of self and ideas of who I am. The value of going to 
those underlying building blocks is that we have a much 
better vantage point to see how we m ake concepts, 
how we're adding things on top of experience , and how 
we complicate it more than it needs to be.  
 
In particular, we can see that we are clinging, reaching 
out to touch and hold –  or resisting this whole world of 
clinging and grasping, which  is so subtle. Our deepest 
clinging is often invisible to us. Invisible doesn't mean 
insignificant. It's like the underlying roots, a metaphor 
that the Buddha gave. There are these roots 
underground, and as long as the roots are there, they're 
going to kee p sprouting plants. If there are the roots of 
suffering, then those roots are going to continue to  
  audiodharma.org  make suffering. So we need to get clear and quiet 
enough to begin seeing what's under the surface. When  
we're quiet, we can see the roots of greed, hatred, a nd 
delusion – of clinging, grasping, and pushing away.  
 
With this revelatory side of wisdom, the real Insight – 
insight with a capital ‘I’ – is said to be that which is 
universal to all our experiences. Everyone shares these 
things. It's not personal in t he sense that it doesn't have 
to do with our biography, what’s happened to us in our 
life, or how we were conditioned by society and life 
experiences. It has to do with what's always true at the 
underlying level of all experience. To really see that is 
called insight.  
 
There are three primary insights that are revealed when 
the mind is clear and calm enough. the first is the 
degree to which things are inconstant. Often it's called 
impermanent in English – anicca . In some ways, it's fine 
to call it imperman ence. But for some people, that 
implies that eventually, it's not going to be here. It's 
going to stop. Anicca  as a deep insight is also that, but 
the deeper moment -to-moment experience is that 
things are inconstant. They're flowing and moving. 
They're com ing here and disappearing – appearing and 
disappearing over and over again.  
 
I don't want to convince you that this is  the case. But as 
the mind gets quiet and still, we notice that the way we  
  audiodharma.org  experience things –  and that's an important term, “the 
way that we experience things,” whatever it might be –  
is not a constant stream, like it's there continuously. 
There's somethi ng about the way our senses, mind, and 
how we experience things appears and disappears, 
appears and disappears.  
 
One of the first places that I discovered this was with 
pain in meditation when I was instructed to bring very 
careful attention to the pain . It was  almost like I put my 
attention right in the middle of it. Lo and behold, the 
idea I had that pain was a solid mass of burning, 
searing, and stabbing turned out to be somewhat those 
sensations, but they were pulsing, appearing and 
disappearing, like little pinpricks coming and going, 
coming and going. It was fascinating to watch this 
dance in a little square centimeter of my knee appear 
and disappear.  
 
When I no longer imputed a solid mass of pain, but 
rather these inconstant, pinpricking sensations, I had a 
very different relationship to it. I started to see how I 
was resisting it, attacking it, building up a self, having 
self-pity, and all kinds of other things that I didn't really 
see when it was just a solid mass.  
 
But for all kinds of  things – not just painful things – we 
start seeing the inconstant nature of how things are 
experienced. The value of that – the kind of clarity that  
  audiodharma.org  is revealed – is that it highlights two things for us. It 
highlights our clinging, how we grasp, and get a ttached. 
And it begins to show us there's an alternative. It begins 
to show us the futility, suffering, and vacuous nature of 
clinging and attachment. There starts to be a transition 
where it becomes easier and easier. More and more, 
what the system does i s begin to let go, to soften and 
open up.  
 
The second insight is into dukkha  – the suffering, 
unsatisfactoriness, or subtle irritation that comes in our 
experience when we're for or against it. And the third 
insight is that of  the not -selfness of experien ce. 
Somehow the way we construct our experience, the 
way we participate in it, the way experience occurs to 
us – there is an impersonal aspect. Causes and 
conditions come together, and there's a certain way in 
which it's a conceptual overlay – the idea of an agent or 
a self that's responsible or guilty for it all.  
 
This is not to convince you that there is no self. That's 
not the idea. The idea is that, as the mind gets quiet, 
still, and clear, there's no longer the overlay of self -
concepts on the experien ce. Experiences in and of 
themselves can occur without any self imputed to them. 
It's very freeing to have that happen. It's a relief not to 
do the work of assuming or living in this idea of self. It's 
like a vacation from these self ideas. It shows us the  
possibility of freedom.

Tomorrow is the last of the five forms of wisdom, we'll 
talk about liberating wisdom.  
 
Today, it's revelatory wisdom. As the mind gets clear, 
inconstancy is revealed. Then we just allow it to be 
revealed. That's why I did this m eeting thing. Rather 
than meeting inconstancy, we allow it to just appear and 
show itself to us so thoroughly that there's no more 
meeting anymore. It's just the flow of inconstant 
phenomena in all directions, 360 degrees.  
 
Thank you very much. I so much appreciate the chance 
to have this time with you, and I look forward to 
tomorrow.
