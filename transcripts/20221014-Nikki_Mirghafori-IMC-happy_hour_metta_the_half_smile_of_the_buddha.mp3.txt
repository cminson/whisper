 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Oh, there. Okay, so, so for the practice today, um, I'd like to invite us to, um, consider, um, consider that the practice of Metta, this cultivation of goodwill, good wishes for ourselves, for others, for the world is a happy making experience, hence called, hence, happy hour, hence, hence, um, this, you know, our, our series, our, our program called happy hour, dedicated to practice of Metta and all the related Brahma viharas. They, they make the heart happy. So, so what I'd like to invite us to, um, to practice, to relate to is, you know, maybe you've had a long week, it's either Friday evening or Saturday morning or afternoon, giving, given all the time zones we're in right now in this moment in time, all of us joining in this zoo room from, from Australia and Japan and East coast and Hawaii and all the time zones, of course, not mentioned California, um, the, the could be sense of it. Okay. Heaviness fatigue, like, okay, I'm tired. Okay. This body is tired. This mind is tired. It's the end of the week or beginning of weekend. So, so, so an easy way is a really easy. If as the Dalai Lama says, if you want to, if, uh, if you want others to be happy to practice compassion, if you want to be happy, practice compassion and the compassion then Metta in some ways are in, they're not exactly the same, but as you know, they're related practices. So I want to say, if you want others to be happy, practice kindness. If you want yourself to be happy, practice kindness, loving kindness. So, so today's practice, I want to invite us to tune into, and there's so many different things we can tune into, you know, we've been practicing together for a long time. And there's so many different aspects of these practices that we can choose to tune into. It's not always the same thing. May I be happy? May I be well? May you be happy? May you be well? It's, it's never boring. It's always new and different and interesting because there's so much to learn. Keep learning, keep cultivating, keep exploring. So today, what I'd like to invite us to explore as we are practicing, as we will practice, just simple Metta, simple Metta, radiating, simply radiating Metta, simply radiating good will, kindness, just our goodness, letting our light shine. And then inviting you to tune into how lighter, even a tiny, tiny bit happier, lighter, more, more resourced our own heart can feel through this practice to tune into that. So that's the exploration we're going to do in this happy hour. So, so I think that's all the frame I want to set before we actually engage in the practice together and explore together our own mind heart. So, so let's, let's arrive. Let's arrive in your sitting posture. If you need to move, to sit on a cushion, or even lie down if you're not going to fall asleep, but your body needs that right now, that's okay. Maybe standing if you're feeling sleepy and if you want to do this practice standing, that's fine. So, I'm going to do what this body needs right now. Landing, arriving. And this body. However, it's showing up right now, connecting with the breath. Oh, it's taking a few minutes to settle, to arrive, to rest, to let go of all the busyness, all the thoughts that have come before. Taking a moment of refuge in the body with this breath. Nowhere to go, nothing to do. Now, now. Ah, just this breath. Sin breath, this out breath. Just to settle at the beginning of our sit together. Finding yourself in this moment, connecting with yourself in this moment. This dear being knows you. Maybe tired, might be excited, whatever is happening. Connecting, breathing, being breathed with yourself, intimacy with yourself with this breath. Thank you. Thank you. Letting each breath in the body be calming. Ah, soothing. Connecting you to the earth, to your own body. Feeling the sensations of your feet connected to the earth, sit bones connected to the chair, to the cushion. Hands on your lap. The intimacy of this lived experience. Breathing in, breathing in with each breath. So if you're breathing in peace. Breathing out peace and calm. With each in breath and out breath, settling more. With each in breath, body feels calmer, the mind feels calmer. With each out breath spreading your peace as much as available. With each breath in breath, breathing in with each breath. Breathing out calm and peace and maybe trying out a smile. Maybe receiving the in breath with a smile. Sharing your smile with the world. As a gift, not expecting anything back. As a sign of your goodwill for yourself also. Even if their challenge is present in the body, if the tired is a, the body is tired, achy, the heart is achy. Can there be a smile of benevolence, the half smile of the Buddha, a smile of benevolence? The half smile of the Buddha, Konyan, the caring grandmother. For yourself and the world. Realizing it doesn't take much, it really doesn't. And if the thought goes, the resistance goes, I don't want a smile, no, try it on anyway, what do we have to lose? Even if your heart is broken in this moment, can you receive the brokenness with a smile? The appreciation, the smile of the Buddha. Hello dear, hi, I see you, smile of recognition. Enjoy yourself and spreading it with the world, sharing it with the world. Let your body relax, your mind soften. In breath, the out breath, calm. Exhaling, calming, peaceful, smiling, smile of recognition. And maybe if the words want to flow, bringing, adding phrases of loving kindness for yourself. May this being always me, may I be happy? May I be healthy, may I be safe, may I have ease? Or whatever phrases you have, maybe it's a simplified version. May I have well-being? Or maybe just spending time with one of the phrases if that speaks to you right now. May I feel safe? Or may I be joyous? May I love and accept myself just as I am in this moment? May I be kind to myself? Or you can say the four phrases, may I be safe, happy, healthy, have ease, whatever works. Let them flow with the breath. Let them be blessings, gifts to yourself, not expectations, but a gift. A gift that's given freely. No expectations, no attachment. Sharing your own kindness, your own goodwill with yourself. Gentle, kind. Letting the repetition of the phrases or the words support the continuity connecting with goodwill. As if each in-breath spreads the kindness, bellows, your whole body bellows with kindness. Every cell through all your limbs, your heart, your mind, everywhere, everywhere. Sharing kindness internally, softening all the cold, frozen, tight areas of the heart, the mind, slowly, slowly. May I be well. Hey. You're welcome. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Trusting that you've done the best you can today, this week. You're doing the best you can now. May this being hose me. May this being be safe, feel safe. Feel happiness and joy. See as much as possible and have ease, my heart, my life. And I have ease, gladness, goodness. And then in your mind's eye, in the home of your heart inviting a few people who are near and dear to you, maybe friends, family, pets, opening the door of your heart inviting them to come, sit, sit with you, take seats in this room. And you sit together quietly and you breathe, breathe together. You breathe with them and with each breath wishing them well. Radiating your goodwill, your kindness. May they be well. May they feel safe, happy, healthy. May they have ease. Perhaps you can imagine, there's a raining eye outside in this imaginary space of your heart. You breathe with them, it's nice and warm, cozy with your kindness. You've given each of them a blanket of metta. You're wrapping them in your metta. They can just sit in their room. Be warm. Feel cared for. May you be safe, happy, healthy. Have ease. Feeling your goodwill, your good wishes for them. Wanting them to be well. Feeling your kindness for them. Your benevolence. Feel your benevolence. Thank you.September 20, 2018 And now opening the door, the door of your heart, wider, inviting whoever wants to come in, AKA, and take a blanket, you offer them a blanket of metta, there are plenty, there are so many of them, so many blankets, anyone can come in, friends, neighbors, colleagues, strangers, into this room that's warmed. By your good will, the fire of your good will, everyone can come, take a blanket of care and sit by the fire, and you just sit, and just sit and breathe. Wishing everyone well, wishing everyone goodness, feeling your good will, it's inexhaustible really, you don't have to try too hard, it's not like you have to push it out. You're an inexhaustible sets of blankets, it's possible to be kind to everyone. And your interactions with them, your good will, feeling kindness of your heart, this is a moment of silence, shining, beaming, radiating, may all beings be well, near and far. And you want to bring the half smile of the Buddha back to your face, to accompany the good will in your heart, acknowledging the good will. Feeling extremely, 360 degrees, no difference between internal and external. Feeling, may all beings, including myself, feel safe, be happy, be healthy, have ease. You're an inexhaustible, you're an external, you're an external. You're an external. You're an external. May I be kind to myself and others. May I feel and appreciate my own good will and kindness. You're an external. You're an external. You're an external. You're an external. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciating that we've done our best. We showed up. Accepting ourselves, smiling to ourselves with kindness. Thank you for showing up. Letting go of any judgment. What happened or did not happen. So many causes and conditions. It can give rise to agitation and sleepiness. All we can do is our best. The results is not for us to attach to. And if we can be kind to ourselves in just this moment, appreciating our own goodness. This is one moment of goodness. It's infinitely better than none. And let us dedicate, share the goodness of our practice. I think there is goodness here. There is goodness, created, co-created. With generosity with kindness, we share it as if we're beaming, beaming our care, our love, our generosity. It's the entire world, sane and unseen. May all things everywhere. Be safe, happy, healthy, happy. May all things everywhere, including yourself, be free. Thanks everyone. Ah, thanks for your practice. So we have time for any reflections, questions. You can raise your Zoom hand if you like. We share reflections, aha moments, challenges. You can also type it in chat. If you type it to me privately, I won't read your name. It will be a private reflection. I will just read the reflection if you type it to everyone. I'll read your name also. You just say what you discovered, what might have been new or different or not. And also maybe one question I ask you, do you feel, is there a more sense of calm or gladness or happiness, appreciating your own goodness? And before this practice, do you notice a shift, a difference from when you started to sit? I definitely do. I feel calmer, more connected. Bill says, definitely more calm. I guess I agree with you, Bill. I feel calmer and happier too. I feel like I want to smile more or something about the invitation to smile, right? Which is not forced that half smile of the button. I see some of you nodding, yes, in agreement. I love that. I see some smiles. Look at those smiles on the screen. Love it. Love it. Oh my God, this is so great. Yeah, I do find that you want to smile more. Isn't that sweet? Diana, I see your hand, please. I was reminded, quickly, during the meditation of a prayer when I was a little girl, when I was going to bed, my mother would have me say, and I don't know where it comes from, but it's, I wrap myself in a blanket of love and fall asleep, filled with peace. And I grew up saying that even as an adult, it comes back. So here we are, full circle with the blanket image. I love it. Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you, Diana. Oh, I love it. I love it. I never heard that before. I don't know where it comes from. Yeah. I love it. And maybe in some way I have heard it. I don't, I'm just joking, but it's just such a beautiful image. Thanks for invoking that. That you, yeah, as a little girl repeated that and it still comes back. I love that. And yes, this is an invitation from the practice. Yeah, I love that. Thanks for highlighting that. Thanks, Diana. Oh, very sweet. Andrew, joining us for the first time from Japan. Thank you, Diana. I just want to thank you for the blanket metaphor, or the visual was a nice riff on the kind of more common loving kindness phrase. I said, thank you for that. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah. There are so many different ways to do this practice and we find our ways with different metaphors and just what works and remember what works for you and and invited in. This practice is a skillful means. This practice is skillful means and there's so many skillful means. We all have individual ways. So it's that the blanket image worked. Yay. Have endless supply of blankets at the door for yourself and others. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, another reflection. Happy hour has been good medicine for me this week while I spend time with my new friend, COVID. Oh, thank you, Nikki and Sangha. Oh, so sorry. Oh, since your reflection came to only me, I won't say your name, but hope you feel better. One of our Sangha members has had COVID this week. Oh, hope you feel better. Oh, oh dear. Yeah. Happy hour can be good medicine. Yeah. Practicing while sick with with care, compassion for yourself for this body. Yeah. Yeah. I do appreciate the earlier when I asked you about the smiles. So many of you lit up. Just so sweet to see all the smiles coming and lighting up very sweet. So tell you what, let's turn ever so gently as if we're wrapping ourselves in blankets of care, wrapping each other in blankets of care. Very calm, gentle, doesn't have to be energetic, but the question, the query for tonight is can we engage with two other human beings or practitioners without the usual ways that we show up, like wanting to do like pulling forward. Can we just kind of be wrapped in our care and having them be wrapped in care? It's just gentle being together for maybe five, six minutes in the room and notice. Can you share your kindness for yourself and for others? Can you do that and be aware of the way that you're relating, the way that you're relating. Again, with kindness for yourself, kindness for others, say you can share something about your practice going alphabetically or you can say pass, just hold space. Next person can share something and then the next person or say pass. So yeah, I'm going to create the rooms and invitation is see what it's like in this other way to practice with folks. Just a very unique way of holding yourself with care, others with care. Okay, I'm going to open the rooms, be kind to yourself, be kind to others and it's okay to be silent. It's okay to just smile and be silent in the room and see what that feels like. It's very sweet actually to be smiling at other people silently. So there you go. It just opened the rooms.
