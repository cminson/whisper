The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So please take up your seats.
Those of you who have any place to sit or stand.
The body has a landing place.
The body has a landing place. Please land it there.
I was told that you tend to like to stop the formal deliveries at about four o'clock
and then have from four to five informal schmoozing. Is that correct?
Darmic schmoozing.
Is that correct?
Why not?
Okay, so we'll hop now to the realm of stream entry.
And during this putting together of this book, the way that it deployed its pageant,
Paphson and I, he's the co-abbot with me at Abhiyagiri, and he and I had plenty of time
to contemplate the format of this book and how we might put it together.
And it, as I tend to be more of the conceptualizing type,
then it evolved for me to do the pieces about the general philosophical terrain
of the Buddha's teachings on ultimate truth.
And as Ajahn Paphsono is more of the practical hands-on guy, the how-to person.
So he put his attention onto the practices and perspectives.
So the last part of the book is much more involved in,
okay, given that this is the case, this is the nature of the landscape of the island.
So what do we do about that, or how do we act or work in relationship to that?
So I thought we'd hop straight to the section on stream entry,
which begins on page 278, chapter 16.
And the first one on Sotipana, the spiritual turning point.
Bhikkhus, suppose there were a man with a lifespan of 100 years, who could live 100 years.
Someone would say to him, come, good man, in the morning they will strike you with 100 spears,
at noon they will strike you with 100 spears, and in the evening they will strike you with 100 spears.
And you, good man, being struck day after day by 300 spears, will have a lifespan of 100 years,
will live 100 years.
And then after 100 years have passed, you will make the breakthroughs of the Four Noble Truths,
to which you had not broken through earlier.
It is fitting Bhikkhus for a clansman intent on his good to accept the offer.
100 years, every day for 100 years, 300 impalings, right?
If you do the math on that, that's about 10,000 impalings per year.
A million impalings, right?
You've got the math right, about a million impalings.
Well, 365 times 300, give or take.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
I knew someone could do it.
So, a heck of a lot.
So there, and the Buddha says, it is fitting Bhikkhus for a clansman intent on his good to accept the offer.
For what reason? Because this Sangsara is without discoverable beginning.
A first point cannot be discerned of blows by spears, blows by swords, blows by axes.
And even though this may be so, Bhikkhus, I do not say that the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths
is accompanied by suffering or displeasure, rather the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths
is accompanied only by happiness and joy.
So the stream entry is also known as the breakthrough.
And the Buddha, in this one Sutta where he's very good at giving these graphic images that get your attention.
Other ones that have a similar nature is where, as a whole section of the connected discourse is called the breakthrough.
And the first Sutta is called the fingernail.
And the Buddha reaches down and scratches the ground and picks up his finger and says, what do you think, monks?
What's greater in quantity, the amount of dirt under my fingernail or the great earth itself?
Which is greater?
Oh Lord, the amount of dirt under your fingernail is very small and the great earth itself is very great.
There's no comparison, it's incomparable, there's no way you can put the two together.
And he said, even so, the amount of suffering that one who has made the breakthrough can expect to experience
is comparable to the dirt under my fingernail in comparison to the suffering the one who has not made the breakthrough
to stream entry can expect is comparable to the great earth.
And one after another, after another, after another, he gives these teachings.
So he really puts it across, this makes a big difference in your life to reach stream entry.
Now I'll read Ajahn Pasna's little commentary at the beginning of this chapter because it's very significant.
Although Nibbana is the highest and most worthy goal for one practicing the Buddha's teachings,
the thought of ever attaining the sublime nature of that goal can appear daunting.
So to show the point of access to that goal, it's often useful exercise to contemplate the first level of realisation, stream entry.
This helps to provide a clearer sense of what needs to be done in the first stage of the practice
and to provide a reminder of the practice's positive and attainable fruits.
Therefore, exploring the various facets and aspects of stream entry should be a fruitful endeavour
as there tends to be little talk about or discussion of this, quote, lowly, unquote, attainment,
which often lives in the shadow of complete realisation, Nibbana or arahantship.
Particularly in a modern western culture, inundated by advertising and the overstimulation of the consumption ethic,
the mind can be constantly searching for anything with a superlative prefacing it, the ultimate, the perfect, the refined, the exquisite.
If this is the case in our spiritual aspirations, we'll tend to overlook the foundations when trying to reach the ultimate too quickly.
This impatience can easily lead to frustration and a feeling that the goal is impossible to attain.
So, reflecting on stream entry can play a very important role,
especially in that it allows us to see what can be incorporated into our daily lives and practice.
A sotipana is one who has reached the first stage of liberation, stream entry or sotapati.
The early commentators emphasised that the stream entry had a first taste of Nibbana
and the motivation arising from that initial realisation would, without a doubt,
provide the impetus that would carry the aspirant onto the final goal.
After one has realised stream entry once full awakening is assured in not more than seven lifetimes.
This is nothing to be looked down upon.
Streamenters will not be reborn in any of the lower realms, they will at least be born in a human realm or higher.
This is a great blessing.
The ultimate goal of the teachings is not a one-shot affair.
Either you get it or you miss it completely and are forever out of luck.
There is a progressive maturing of insight into the nature of the goal that leads the practitioner to relinquish the obstructions,
blocking realisation and to fulfil the qualities commensurate with realisation.
A good example of this is the account of the Buddha teaching his first five disciples.
With this teaching, Kandanya was able to understand and realise stream entry.
Over the following days, the Buddha continued to instruct the five until they had all entered the stream.
Then, on hearing the Anata Lakanasuta, the discourse on the characteristics of not-self, they were all fully freed.
Although some people may be quicker than others in reaching the goal,
the structure of the unfolding insight is common to all.
The most familiar description of the stages of realisation contains four levels.
The stream enturer, Sotapanna, one's returner, Sakadargami, the non-returner, Anagami and the one fully enlightened, Arahant.
These levels are differentiated according to the fetters, the Sanyojna, that a liberated person relinquishes at each stage.
Then these next two sutras define the ten fetters.
The five lower fetters are identity view or self-view, doubt and the distorted grasp of rules and vows.
Sila-pataparamasa, sensual desire, kamaraga and ill-will, bhyapada.
These are the five lower fetters.
And then the higher fetters, the last of the ten, are lust for form.
That's like attachment to the rupa jhanas, lust for the formless.
That's attachment to the formless jhanas.
Sorry, the first one is attachment to the jhanas of form, the lower jhanas.
The lust for the formless is attachment to the formless jhanas.
Then conceit asmimana, restlessness, udacca and ignorance is the last, avicca.
These are the five higher fetters.
So that I feel is a really important theme and I wanted to bring that into the room.
It's something that Ajampasana stresses over and over again and I think is a worthy reflection
because people tend to think of enlightenment or liberation as this remote possibility
off in the distance but the role of stream entry in Buddhist life
and also particularly the attainability or reachability of stream entry for householders,
people who are living a life that is not just taking care of spiritual training
after a job and a family and householding in all its facets
but ever since the Buddha's time it was very, very common for people
even living in a situation of many worldly commitments to be able to realize stream entry
and this is a goal that's not beyond quote the average person unquote.
So that I feel is a very helpful thing and also just understanding what that is referring to.
So the first three fetters and I was interested in the last time that Ajampasana came and led a retreat here in California.
Pretty much the entire retreat he was talking about how to break through the first three fetters.
He didn't spell it out in saying, I am now teaching you how to break through the first three fetters
but there was a tremendous emphasis on understanding what self-view is, Sakaya Diti
and how to know that, to understand it and to free the heart from that.
Also understanding the nature of doubt, what doubt is, how to work with doubt
and to free the heart from doubt and also what is Silapata Paramasa
or its attachment to conventions or that rules, like the mistaken grasp of rules and observances and such like.
So that he made a huge emphasis on that and so that these are not sort of things that are remote or difficult to work with.
These are very tangible objects.
So when we talk about self-view, this is kind of a Buddhist jargon word
but it means that it's the illusion that I am the body, I am the personality.
I am English, I am a man, I am a Theravadan, I am a monk.
Today this is my age, I'm 53 years old and this is my personal history.
This is who and what I am. Taking that as ultimate and absolute realities, that is self-view.
The basic attachment to the experience of the body and the mind.
These are my thoughts, these are my memories, these are my ideas, these are my talents,
these are my problems, these are my crimes, these are my opportunities, these are my memories.
All of that is self-view.
It's the I am associated with a whole variety of those different aspects of memory, of the body, of our social situation, our curriculum vitae.
It's all those course-level I ams.
It's also referred to as the embodiment view, sa means true, kaya is body, diti means view, so the view of the true body or the real body.
In the process of insight meditation, obviously there is a very direct bringing of the mind to explore that and look at that.
All of the teachings about Anatha revolve a lot around that, seeing those kind of deep attachments to identification with our age, our job, our thoughts, our feelings, our moods, our mind states, all those different pieces.
Then attachment to what's sometimes referred to as rights and rituals or rules and observances or conventions.
Siddha Bhattaparamas is a difficult word to translate into English, but it's that sense of believing in some kind of social convention or some sort of ritual form is absolutely real.
Say you come here to IMC.
This building is now IMC. It's not the transcendentalist church or whoever they were before you came here.
So now that this is IMC, you don't wear your shoes in this room.
When this was a church, I'm sure it wasn't a rule they had to take their shoes off before they came in here.
In fact, if you took your shoes off, they'd say, put your shoes on.
This is a church, put your shoes on. You can't take your shoes off here.
So thinking that when someone crosses that line and they have their shoes on, the mind that goes, take your shoes off.
She shouldn't have shoes on here, that's wrong.
That's attachment to Siddha Bhattaparamas.
So that is a huge range of different things that come into that.
So it's where the mind takes hold of a belief or a social convention like things like political parties,
which side of the road you drive on, even the meaning of words.
All of these things, these are conventions that we determine into existence.
We ascribe them value, and then we get lost in the value that we give them.
We say, no, this is valuable.
An example that I and Char would always give is money.
He'd say, well, you take this piece of paper and we say it's worth 10 baht,
and then another piece of paper and it's worth 100 baht,
another piece of paper and it's called 1000 baht, or in this country, $1.
Same size of paper, same amount of ink, $1, $1,000, $10,000.
I mean, a $10,000 note, they don't even give you extra ink.
They don't even change the color.
It's all just green as far as I know.
It can't even afford a second color on that.
But this one is worth 10,000 of these, but it's because we agree,
and then they change the currency and then that $10,000 note is worth nothing.
You're just lining the bottom of your birdcage with it.
Last week it was worth $10,000, and now it's just a birdcage liner.
So it's an agreement that we determine into existence.
And so Ajahn Chah would say that if you go along with the agreement,
then it has value.
If you don't go along with the agreement, it doesn't have any value.
It's just like what the mind adds to it is something that we're missing.
We think, that really is a $1,000 bill.
That's really valuable.
Well, it's as valuable as you make it.
If the economy collapses and the Federal Reserve vanishes,
then the owners of the Federal Reserve,
which is not run by the government interestingly enough,
did you know that?
I had to learn that from my civics test when I became an American citizen.
One of the questions was which branch of the government runs the Federal Reserve?
And the answer was none of them.
Learn everything on an afternoon in Nirvana, don't you?
Okay, they all moved to the Cayman Islands for the Federal Reserve.
And then you're left with your bank account number,
and then access denied.
No one home.
I got my number.
My savings are where?
So this is attachment to conventions,
is buying into the forms, the agreements that we have,
or things like fashion.
What's beautiful? What's ugly?
You know, look at pictures of what was fashionable 100 years ago,
or 10 years ago.
And you see a picture of someone, you know,
oh, that was the 70s.
Oh, that was the 1890s.
Because what was normal and what was fashionable then has totally changed.
Now if you saw someone wearing that, you think,
oh, they must be going to some kind of fancy dress party.
Oh, it's Halloween, isn't it?
They must be going to a retro 70s party
because it's Halloween.
Because that's the convention.
And nowadays, the ordinary wear of 2009,
no one blinks out, but in 20 years' time,
they're like, oh, wow, that's so like back in the teens,
or the preteens, you know.
How strange, how quaint.
This is what you're wearing today.
It'll be a quaint retro outfit in 20 years' time.
But something says, no, no, this is normal.
We can't really talk to it.
This is 2,500-year-old retro.
This is the longest-standing fashion.
Ananda designed this 2,500 years ago.
So this is attachment to convention thinking,
no, no, that's beautiful. This is good.
This is valuable. That's worthless.
This is right. That's wrong.
And the degree to which the mind will not recognize,
no, this is just, we decide to call this IMC,
and then that means no shoes on the bit with the carpet.
If it was the Christian church, then it would be different.
Rightness and wrongness in those respects
just relies upon personal agreements.
Then doubt, the third of these three,
is not doubt about what you're going to have for dinner,
or doubt about what time you're going to leave this afternoon.
Particularly, it means doubt about what is and what is not the path.
So that's its specific focus.
Also, it's not even just the quality of doubt as a hindrance
to concentration where the mind is just caught up in random questioning.
But the doubt which is a hindrance to the stream entry,
or that which is an obstruction to stream entry,
is particularly not being clear about what practicing the Dhamma is.
And so that revolves around that sense of,
on what they call often using as a synonym for stream entry,
is getting beyond doubt, which in a way is knowing what you need to do,
knowing what is the essential element of practicing Dhamma,
and what are the supportive things, or extraneous things, and such like.
So these three, then when those three have been fully understood
and let go of, then that brings about stream entry,
which is also known as a breakthrough,
or an interesting term is the change of lineage.
Because when there's that fundamental dropping of identification with the body,
with the personality, then it says a little bit about your ancestry, doesn't it?
If I'm not the body, if I'm not the personality,
then what does that say about my connection with my parents, my grandparents?
And that if the body and the personality are not absolutely who and what I am,
then where do I come from?
What's the rest of the story? How does that fit?
So the Buddha used this phrase, the change of lineage,
in a way to expand the view,
or to represent that expansion of view that comes with stream entry.
Yes, well these are, to say to your mother,
all Dhammas are not self, you're not really my mother.
It doesn't work.
And I hate to confess that,
and one of those Arden letters back from Thailand in my earliest days,
I did try to convey that.
Never, ever try that.
It was a zealous 21-year-old trying to get mom to understand.
Took about six months to un-pick that one.
Bad mistake. Too zealous, too keen, and not enough.
A lot of faith and not enough wisdom on that one.
But it does, if the inside is genuinely there,
then it does put things into a bit of a different perspective.
Yes, these people are still your parents,
they're the anti-seasons of your biological existence,
but if this is body and this personality is not fundamentally who and what we are,
then what does that say about the rest of the picture?
Again, these are things to reflect upon and to say,
well, what is the source of all this?
Where does this come from? What kind of, what am I?
Or who am I?
And these are other themes that one can pick up and explore in meditation
and say, well, if that's not who and what I am, then where does this come from?
Or what is the ground of this being?
What's the source?
And exploring that and really working with that kind of question
with an investigative and wise, mindful approach
can really help to support the breaking through those kind of attachments to Sakai Aditi.
So these are the basic elements of stream entry
and then in the readings here,
then if we look at,
this is chapter 16, the reading number 8,
this talks about the factors of stream entry
or the things that help bring about stream entry.
So it's page 282.
Then the Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One,
paid homage to him and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him,
Sariputta, this is said a factor for stream entry, a factor for stream entry.
What now Sariputta is a factor for stream entry?
Association with superior persons, Venerable Sir, is a factor for stream entry.
As Sapuri Sir Sangseva is the Pali.
Hearing the true Dhamma is a factor for stream entry.
Hearing other people's cell phones,
is a factor for sympathetic embarrassment.
Hearing the true Dhamma is a factor for stream entry.
Careful attention is a factor for stream entry
and that's a translation for Yoni So Manasikara.
It's also translated as wise attention, careful attention.
And then practicing in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for stream entry.
So there's our association with superior persons, hearing the true Dhamma,
careful attention and practicing in accordance with the Dhamma.
Dhammanu Dhamma Patipata is the Pali for the last one.
Dhammanu Dhamma Patipata, so practicing in accordance with Dhamma.
So that means that the means whereby you try to practice is in accordance with Dhamma.
Because in Buddhism we're always recognizing the means and the end
are totally unified, they're totally related to each other.
So the philosophy of the end justifies the means is completely un-Buddhist.
If you use a kind of self-centered or aggressive or chaotic means
then you end up with a chaotic and painful and complicated end.
If you use a means which is peaceful, which is collaborative, which is harmless
then you'll end up with a peaceful and beneficial result.
So the Buddha responded, good, good, Sariputa.
Association with superior persons, Sariputa is a factor for stream entry.
Hearing the true Dhamma, careful attention, practice in accordance with Dhamma
is a factor for stream entry.
Sariputa, this is said, the stream, the stream.
What now Sariputa is the stream? Just in case you guys have been wondering.
What is the stream that we're supposed to be entering?
This noble eightfold path of Venerable Sir is the stream.
That is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.
Good, good, Sariputa, this noble eightfold path is the stream.
That is, right view, etc., etc.
Sariputa, this is said, stream entry, a stream entry.
What now Sariputa is a stream entry?
One who possesses this noble eightfold path of Venerable Sir is called a stream enturer.
This Venerable One has such and such a name and clan.
Good, good, Sariputa, one who possesses this noble eightfold path is a stream enturer.
This Venerable One has such a name and clan.
So these are four factors for stream entry are very helpful to reflect on.
So association with superior persons, hearing the Dhamma, and careful attention,
you only saw Manasikara and then practicing in accordance with Dhamma.
And so these are helpful themes or ways of saying,
if you want to, if stream entry is something that is appealing or one which is to cultivate that according to that aspiration,
then these are things that are all going to support that very, very directly.
And it's also in terms of the eightfold path, sometimes people wonder about this word right.
And the Pali is samar.
So samaditi, right view, samar, sankapo, right and resolution and so on.
And so sometimes people quaver a bit of the idea of right and thinking,
oh dear, we don't want right and wrong.
That's too abusive and judgmental and we're trying to get away from that right and wrong polarity.
But the samar of samaditi and so on, it isn't so much right as right opposed to wrong.
It's more right as in upright, like balanced.
If this is fallen over, then if you write it, then you're setting it upright again.
So that's the right view.
And an interesting observation by Ajahn Tanissaro is that the word samar is related to a musical,
to a term that's used in ancient Indian music, which means attuned.
So that when you're playing a vina, like a stringed instrument,
then you tune the strings so that they are all samar.
They are harmonized. They're in tune with each other.
So that's a helpful image to have.
So it's rather like the eight factors of the eightfold path.
They're samar when they're attuned with each other and attuned with reality.
So it's in a way that which is harmonious,
that's going to lead towards a beautiful result.
So that's a helpful way of understanding that.
So then of these latter section of the pieces on stream entry,
and that I'll field a couple of questions on that and then we'll finish with the blessings in Nibbana.
But I'll just read one more little sutra, which is in a way very closely related to the concerns of the average householder,
even though this is to someone who is the ruler of the sakhins at the time.
When the Buddha, he was the crown prince and so he stepped down from the job of ruling the sakhine kingdom.
And then others took over in his wake and one of these was called Mahanama.
So this is 16.11, 1611.
He's on page 284.
That's how I heard. On one occasion the blessed one was dwelling among the sakhins at Kapilavattu in Nigrodas Park.
Then Mahanama the sakhine approached the blessed one, paid homage to him, sat down to one side and said to him,
Venable sir, this Kapilavattu is rich and prosperous, populist, crowded with congested therapies.
In the evening when I'm entering Kapilavattu after visiting the blessed one,
or the bhikkhus worthy of esteem, I come across a stray elephant, a stray horse, a stray chariot, a stray cart, a stray man.
On that occasion, Venable sir, my mindfulness regarding the blessed one becomes muddled.
My mindfulness regarding the dharma becomes muddled.
My mindfulness regarding the sangha becomes muddled.
Then it occurs to me, if at this moment I should die, what would be my destination?
What would be my future born?
Isn't that a common kind of, not exactly the same phraseology like,
Gee, if I died with my mind like this, where would I end up?
So the Buddha replies to Mahanama, who is relative of his also,
Don't be afraid Mahanama, don't be afraid Mahanama.
Your death will not be a bad one, your demise will not be a bad one.
When a person's mind has been fortified over a long time by faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom,
Right here, crows, vultures, hawks, dogs and jackals or various creatures eat his body,
consisting of form composed of the four great elements originating from mother and father,
built up out of rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, being worn and rubbed away to breaking apart and dispersal.
But, his mind, which has been fortified over a long time by faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom,
that goes upwards, goes to distinction.
Suppose Mahanama, a man submerges a pot of ghee or a pot of oil in a deep pool of water and breaks it.
All of its shards and fragments would sink downwards, but the ghee or oil there would rise upwards.
So too Mahanama, when a person's mind has been fortified over a long time by faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom,
Right here, crows and various creatures eat his body,
but his mind, which has been fortified over a long time by faith, virtue, learning, generosity and wisdom,
that goes upwards, goes to distinction.
Do not be afraid Mahanama, do not be afraid Mahanama.
Your death will not be a bad one, your demise will not be a bad one.
So, nil desparandum, don't despair.
Any questions on those particular pieces about stream entry and its various factors?
When you said doubt is doubt of what the path is, about self-doubt, is that related to that?
That I would have more under the category of doubt, which is a obstruction to concentration.
Again, different people talk about it in different ways, but this is my understanding that the doubt that's in the list of the five hindrances,
which is probably known to most people, what is being hindered is concentration.
The five hindrances are specifically about the qualities of samadhi.
So, that can be any kind of the mind is sort of, oh, I'm useless, I'm hopeless, what am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
So, that's all under the doubt which is an obstruction to concentration.
But even if there's a freedom from that kind of doubt, then in a way the more central or significant doubt is that sense of,
okay, this is the right way to practice or this is the important element.
This is the insight that needs to be developed.
And if you want to know what that is, also one of the characteristic ways that stream entry is described,
in fact, probably the most common is when the insight into stream entry is described,
it's usually in the form of then that person realized all that is subject to arising is subject to cessation.
So, the insight which might seem like, well, that's not news, I was expecting a big spectacular and original delivery there.
That's the fundamental freedom from doubt is seeing that recognizing that whatever it is, it arises and passes away.
And that cultivating that quality of observation and seeing the changing nature of the five kundas,
form, feeling, perception, mental formations and consciousness, that whatever it is, it changes regardless of its content.
So, it's recognizing that the path of liberation is focused principally around the wisdom that arises from seeing into that transient nature
and transient unsatisfactory nature of all things.
Any other questions? Everyone's beyond doubt?
Yeah, sorry.
So, the sutra that you read just before this about asking Sariputta about the stream and the stream-enterer.
So, it's not just sufficient to be aligned with the eightfold path, but these three fetters also need to be given up, right?
Both of those are, I would say, being aligned with the eightfold path to some degree.
I mean, they're woven into each other, but the clear benchmarks for stream-entry are around those characteristics of seeing,
oh, right, how could this body have an owner?
Oh, right, of course.
And like, oh, of course.
Well, it's just in this country we drive on the right.
How could that be ultimately right or wrong?
Well, that sense of those insights into the letting go of those first three fetters,
they're all to do with being in alignment with the eightfold path,
and then that alignment becomes more and more complete and perfect as the stages of enlightenment progress, if you like,
so that there needs to be a basic alignment with the eightfold path as part of that whole process.
So then as, like, entering the stream, what is the stream?
So it's like the eightfold path, so it's like you're in the stream,
and also part of it, and why it's called the breakthrough, is this quality of irreversibility.
So using that example of once you've learned to ride a bicycle, you really can't unlearn it.
There's a body memory that happens when you learn to ride a bicycle,
that somehow something shifts.
There's a basic non-conceptual learning that happens.
So in the same way with stream-entry, there's an irreversible shift that you can't,
once you've seen how the, say, like a graphic illusion,
once you've seen the Dalmatian in the patches of sunlight, you can't really unsee it.
You know it's there, and you can't unsee it.
You can't relate to it as you saw it before, as it appeared to you before you figured out the pattern,
and then, oh, look, there's the dog. I see the dog in the patches of sunlight.
Right. So you might glance back at it and say, oh, where's he going?
But you know it's there, and you know it's just a matter of sort of shifting your vision.
Okay, I see it again. But so it's that kind of, that quality of an irreversible change.
And so that there, it's like there's an alignment with the eightfold path
that you can't degenerate beyond a certain point. You can't unsee that.
So there's a point at which bringing your life in alignment with the eightfold path
brings you to this point where it becomes basically you can't go back.
So it's an inherent kind of process that, if you're following that process, that happens.
Yeah, and also one of the ways, it's a little bit heretical,
but one of the ways of looking at the no more than seven lifetimes concept
is that once someone has entered the stream, they can only get really lost
up to seven more times. You can only get totally distracted.
Because stream-enters can blow it. They can get caught up in anger and confusion and lust and so on.
They can get deluded, but it gets harder and harder.
This is the way it's described. It's harder and harder to get lost.
It's more and more painful when you feel stupider and stupider.
So I'm assuming it becomes apparent when you become a stream-enterer then.
I mean, there's some kind of radical change in the way that you're seeing the world that makes it clear
that you can't kind of fall off the path.
Yeah, there's a change of perspective, but a person might not necessarily know
that this shift that just happened is called stream-entry.
It's just something changes in the way that they see the world and say,
oh, but they wouldn't necessarily think of it in that way.
But the actual change in terms of understanding and, say,
non-identification with the body and the personality, then that would be there, regardless.
Okay, so I see we've magically reached four o'clock already.
I don't know how the time passed.
If there's any more questions, I'll just before I read the final passage of today's abbreviated
rump through the island.
Yeah, there's a question by the door there.
So the first one you mentioned, stream-entry, is association with superior persons.
So how much does that mean actual living with or personal contact with,
let's say, enlightened beings such as living in a monastery?
Yeah, it means real humans, regular good humans, sapurisa.
And in the Majjhima Nikaya, there's a, I forget which number it is,
but it's called the sapurisa sutra.
I think it might be 13 or 137.
And the Buddha describes what are the qualities of a superior person, of a sapurisa.
And it really just means a good person.
And so he lists the various qualities, but it doesn't mean someone has to be a monastic.
But it's just generally spending time with people who live in a wholesome way,
who cultivate noble qualities, who are honest and kind,
and again encourage those qualities in you.
So it's, and then who's, also he focuses in on qualities of humility also,
that a superior person, and if I remember the sutra correctly,
over and over again he says he doesn't exalt themselves,
that a superior person doesn't exalt themselves and disparage others.
They don't, for their own excellent qualities, they don't say,
wow, I'm so, look, I mean, I'm really, I'm a very fine person.
You know, I know I shouldn't compare, but you know, just being practical, being realistic,
I am actually kind of way ahead of the other, rest of the pack.
And so over and over again he points to that,
that one of the main qualities of a superior person is that they don't,
even if they might have very high levels of concentration,
they might be very wise or have a lot of spiritual qualities,
that they don't get inflated on account of that,
and that's emphasized over and over again.
A mensh.
I guess a mensh, yeah.
A mensh.
My further thought was so not to necessarily promote monastic living,
but I can only imagine that living in the,
under the privilege of someone like Ajahn Chah
to have that one-on-one contact and interact on just even normal
levels, just to gain concentration for final lessons,
I'm just sad at the point I'm suggesting.
Well, it certainly helps.
I mean, the, I mean,
obviously that's my favourite approach.
But it's, I wouldn't limit it to that, you know, that the monasteries were set up
to be a kind of sapurisa camp, you know,
so that it's designed to be an environment where good-hearted people
can support each other and everybody who has an interest or that appeals to them,
they can shop and be part of that.
So it's for that.
But similarly, and it's a place like this at IMC,
serves a similar function, Sati Center programs,
it's a sort of sapurisa fest.
And joining together, spending your Halloween, you know,
reflecting on Nibbana rather than getting your costume ready for the evening.
Maybe you've got your costumes ready already.
I need mine.
Sometimes when we're around town, this time of the year,
oftentimes people do wonder.
People do wonder.
We can only accept it food in the morning, though.
Kind of, yeah.
So the last reading I'd like to give is this one I quoted briefly earlier,
the Dabba the Mullian.
This is in the final chapter, Ah What Bliss.
And so I'll read a couple.
The last one is where the quotation comes from.
So this is on page 349.
And this is, again, the Wudus amongst the Sakians.
And that's how I heard.
This is 20.17.
That's how I heard.
At one time, the Lord was staying at Anupya in the mango orchard.
At the time, the venerable Badia, Karligoda's son,
was on going into the forest to the foot of a tree
at an empty place constantly uttered, Ah What Bliss.
Ah What Bliss.
A number of bhikkhus heard the venerable Badia constantly uttering, Ah What Bliss.
Ah What Bliss.
And the thought came to them, hmm.
No doubt, friend, the venerable Badia, Karligoda's son,
is dissatisfied with leading the holy life,
since formerly when he was a householder, he enjoyed the bliss of royalty.
And when recollecting that on going into the forest, he uttered, Ah What Bliss.
Ah What Bliss.
Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Lord,
prostrated themselves, sat down to one side and reported this to the Lord.
Then the Lord addressed a certain bhikkhu, saying, Come Bhikkhu,
hear my name, tell the bhikkhu Badia.
The teacher calls you, friend, Badia.
Very well revered, sir, the bhikkhu replied,
approaching Badia, etc., etc.
Very well, venerable Badia replied,
approaching the Lord, he prostrated himself, sat down to one side.
The Lord said to him, Is it true, Badia, that when going into the forest,
you utter, Ah What Bliss. Ah What Bliss.
Yes, revered, sir.
Badia, what do you see that prompts you to do so?
Formerly revered, sir, when I was a householder and enjoyed the bliss of royalty,
inside and outside my inner apartments, guards were appointed.
Inside and outside the city, guards were appointed.
Inside and outside the district, guards were appointed.
But revered, sir, although I was thus guarded and protected,
I lived fearful, agitated, distrustful and afraid.
But now, revered, sir, on going alone into the forest,
to the foot of a tree or to an empty place,
I'm fearless, unagitated, confident and unafraid.
I live unconcerned, unruffled.
My needs satisfied with a mind become like a deers.
Seeing this revered, sir, prompts me on going into the forest
to utter constantly, Ah What Bliss. Ah What Bliss.
Then on realizing its significance to the Lord uttered on that occasion,
this inspired utterance.
In whom exist no inner stirrings,
having passed beyond being this or that.
Free from fear, blissful and sorrowless,
the devas are not capable of seeing Him.
As can now be seen, Nibbana brings forth the fruit of bliss.
In turn, the factors leading to Nibbana
need to be nurtured along with the other seeds,
terrain and the aspects of cultivation laid out in the Buddha's teaching.
This fruition is the Buddha's sole goal
in dedicating His efforts to teaching and training others throughout His long and illustrious life.
All the teachings compiled in this collection
are for aiding us in our search for well-being and peace.
Having recognized that Nibbana is a possibility for ourselves,
we are able to take the seeds, prepare the ground and cultivate the fruit.
The bliss of tasting and being nourished by this fruit
is a principle of nature that we are all able to realize.
A last example illustrating this principle of Nibbana
as a state of intrinsic well-being also comes in the Udana.
The previous Sutta passage by Deir describes the bliss of Nibbana
as experienced in this life.
In this passage, after the passing away of Dabba the Malayan,
the Buddha affirms that Nibbanic bliss is not affected or altered by the death of the body.
Just as the born is not known of the gradual fading glow
given off by the furnace-heated iron
as it is struck with the smith's hammer,
so there is no pointing to the born of those perfectly released
who have crossed the flood of bondage to sense desires and attained unshakable bliss.
If you don't know where you're going,
you'll wind up somewhere else.
Hopefully this day has been supportive,
helpful as to get a sense of where we're going,
where we're aiming for, that island.
Which you cannot go beyond.
So please take whatever has been useful that has been said today
and take it and use it in whatever is not useful or confusing
or just plain weird or wrong.
Then please feel most welcome to leave that aside.
So I'm not sure what form the Shmoozing takes,
but please, probably involves tea drinking and such like,
but however you are accustomed to have your four to five o'clock periods,
please, maybe so.
