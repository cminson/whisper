Okay. 
So, Bill invited me to participate in this and to join the Buddhist chaplain symposium which I had no idea what it was and then he asked me to speak on Mehta which is loving kindness is the general translation of the word Mehta and so that I was actually really important for me to get here a bit earlier as I did and hear what people are doing otherwise I would have no idea what to talk about because I, one of the features of our training in our tradition is we don't prepare our talks and just get up and see what comes out so without having a feel for the group I could have, I mean I could have got up and talked about anything really but it could have been pretty boring or useless so that there's a few different aspects of and hearing what people are involved in seems to be mostly around one prison work, hospice care in terms of dying and then in hospitals with people who are ill and with mental health so these are all areas that to me are an aspect of being able to bring the quality of say the Buddha's teachings into the world and to be able to not just the teachings but I think what's really important is the example. 
I think before we even talk about meditation techniques or whatever I think it's really important to recognize that what we communicate and the way we interact with others is very much dependent on our own foundation and the foundation that we bring to our practice and it was interesting on the car ride down this morning Josh actually asked me what my teacher in Thailand is Ajahn Chah and he's a well known meditation teacher and Josh was asking me about the instruction and techniques that Ajahn Chah gave for developing loving kindness meditation and it kind of stumped me because I don't really remember Ajahn Chah giving actual specifics around loving kindness meditation because I'm not sure why but certainly there was always an aspect of the teachings and the training of this cultivation of loving kindness but for Ajahn Chah he tended to actually embody it as opposed to teach it as a technique so that his example was one of loving kindness and I actually remember having a discussion with Ajahn Chah, Ajahn Chah passed away about 20 years ago so he's his successor and I remember him speaking, we're speaking to a couple of us senior monks and he was saying Ajahn Chah had tremendous loving kindness and he said you know that's why so many people were drawn to him people were drawn to him from all through the spectrum of society and many drew people from all around the world to him and it was and then this senior monk said a lot of loving kindness is hard work he said I'm going to focus on equanimity but the reality is there is a loving kindness is something that it's part of a giving as well loving kindness is not just a meditation technique that you do to make yourself feel better and that's a good thing to do but it's something that is really incorporated into one's living and it's interesting loving kindness when we in Buddhist teachings the divine abidings there's four of them loving kindness, compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity and with compassion it's quite clearly delineated that the word for compassion that is used as a divine abiding or the Brahma Vihara is Karuna and it's seen as more of a meditative state the word Anukampa which is the application of compassion and it actually literally means to tremble with and loving kindness and compassion these aren't distinct they're not discreet, they work together but the loving kindness is never sort of kind of distinguished between what is just a meditative state or what is something that is the engagement of application of loving kindness so that they work together so the actual development of loving kindness is a and I think one of the things that's really helpful in terms of loving kindness and applying loving kindness and using loving kindness in a setting of engagement with the world is that there's one of the one is that it's a difficult word to translate and so that it's this hybrid of two words together but it's also even when as soon as you even use the word in English language loving, love, you've got to have love and you've got to have love for everybody and you go into a situation that's stressful or difficult and then you and then you at the end of the day what happened to my loving kindness or you're meeting with people who or even dealing with a system sometimes like the people you engage with but then you're having to work within a system and it really pushes the kind of ability to be able to sustain these loving thoughts but I think it's important to recognize that the word that the Buddha uses, metta, is is a lot broader in the sense that there's, when it's translated into Thai in the Thai language what it means is to it's a well-wishing so that there is this one is wishing oneself well and wishing others well and that's a, so to have this well-wishing and the that desire for others' happiness and well-being is you can still have that desire for others' well-being and really have this strong sense of wishing good for others and still get irritated and frustrated and it's part of the picture because sometimes my loving kindness is completely failing me because I'm irritated and upset and this is a different, or some people just push your buttons or they're incredibly difficult to deal with and you can still wish somebody well but not, you don't have to even be nice to them sometimes you know so which was again sort of thinking back to my living with my teacher Ajahn Chah I mean incredible loving kindness but he could be very fierce demanding, he could expect you to live up to a standard and be willing to push you to do it and sometimes not even be so nice about it but you always felt this well-wishing behind it and that's really important that you actually cultivate that as a different, it's a different feeling because we tend to, especially in the west of that sense of the idealizing of how we should be we should be having all this loving kindness and then feeling guilty because one isn't living up to the idealized version of what a loving person is like and then just going spiraling into these complications around guilt and which is, it was another kind of, I remember one time traveling as a translator and attendant for a very senior Thai monk from Thailand, Songkrad would know him Nanda and another great example of loving kindness and just incredibly giving but we were in New Zealand and he led a meditation and gave a talk and then there was a question and answer period after and then the question was around from one of the ways of how do we deal with, in practice how do we deal with guilt and then, I have to translate the question and then I started to think and I burst out laughing because I mean I've been translating and living in Thailand and I didn't know what the Thai word for guilt was which is a whole revelation in terms of western psychology and then so then I explained to Lopapa Nyananda what I was laughing about and then I had to explain to him what a westerner does to make themselves feel guilty and then he listened to it and he had this very concerned look on his face as he was oh that's really suffering, tell him not to do that that was like so so one of the things that is really important in terms of loving kindness practice is the first person that you actually direct loving kindness towards is yourself, that's the formula and it's a really important foundation when we do the, whether it's the chanting we do on a regular basis or the cultivation of loving kindness as a formal meditation, then the first person that's directed, that you direct your loving kindness towards is yourself, so that there's a that well-wishing and feeling of well-being is established within one's own heart and it's really important because in particularly when one is working with others and one is actually giving a lot to others and then being in stressful situations that there is this source of inner renewal and loving kindness is a major foundation for that inner renewal of one's own resources so it's a, because we tend to idealize of all the things we should be doing and there's no end to the things we should be doing but so we do need to have this basis of our own renewal and it's not a selfish practice to look after yourself it's actually what you have to give and to share is from your own resources and you can't draw on theory or you can't draw on nice ideals and good ideas, you have to draw on your own experience and your own foundation of your own goodness and your own sense of what, especially when you're bringing a practice to others then more what people respond to is what you present or what you bring and even in things what you think are just completely impossible situations a focusing and returning to a center of loving kindness and clarity are, they transform and even if they don't at least you've got your own basis covered but it does tend to affect others so an example that I had was was a I think it's over, it would be about 10 years ago now I was invited to San Quentin to be a spiritual advisor, counselor during the last days before a Thai prisoner's execution so that and he'd been incarcerated for about 16 years and all the appeals had run down and he was and he'd been up for execution once and then that was there was a stay of execution and then this was the second go around and he and when I, the people contacted me because he was he had had a contact with another like a prison chaplain but wasn't Buddhist and and he hadn't really had contact with others so that and he found that actually a bit distracting coming up to his own execution and just he ended up having to look after the chaplain because she just found it very difficult to deal with and so he was keen just to not, he had a very strong meditation practice he had a very strong spiritual focus he had a very good relationship with the guards that were familiar with him so that in the coming up to the last days and he had some special privileges and but what was difficult was coming to the between just before the execution you go from the ordinary cell block area to the execution chambers and you go there about six o'clock in the evening and then the execution is at midnight and the guards completely change and it's from the general pool of the guard population and they are volunteers for that so it's not your most stellar or sympathetic group in fact they tend to be pretty nasty and the the chaplain the Christian chaplain had she had attended several, quite a few executions and so she gave me a rundown of various people who could be there and what they tended to do and also it begins with even just as you're taken there say as a chaplain then you're it's all there's a they strip search you and they you're already sort of put in your place and then your the person who is going to be executed is in one cell and then say myself as a chaplain is in kind of a kitty corner cell they're adjacent like this and so we're locked in these adjacent cells and you can talk through the corner there and then there's four guards one sort of sitting right here watching the prisoner is going to be executed another one sitting behind them and watching the chaplain and then there's two that are in the corner standing and watching and then there's two more who are around and then they spell each other off so that's yeah it's a so I was sort of it was explained to me what what was going to happen and they and how you know kind of cold and almost inhuman that they can be and it is it's that it is like that and so then I talked with his name was Jay he is the prisoner and I said and he had been a monk for a short he had been done a three month ordination temporary ordination as a young man and he knew some of the chanting and so that I said okay what we're going to do we're going to go down there and he gets taken down one way I get taken down another and then we meet up and said we're going to chant and we're going to meditate and we're going to spread some kindness and we're going to change the energy of the of the situation and and so we got there and then the head the chief guard who I had actually heard about I saw the description so yeah that's this guy okay and then so he sort of kind of runs down okay this is what it's going to be like these are the rules this six hours this is what you do and so then we and then I actually had to sort of say you know he made us he made me commit to speaking only in English and so that it was there was no and I said well you know we're going to do some chanting and there's some English chants but there's also some chants in scriptural language and I want to do those as well okay it's chanting but then some of them are translated into English so anyway by the so it's all sort of you know kind of gruff intense and and and then and so we did the chanting and meditation and of course I used Jay as a foil for one it was instruction to him but it was also instruction to the guards had to sit and listen so and so instructing Jay about loving kindness meditation and sharing of merit and and then we did he took presabs and took refuges and then we'll request and then did chanting and I'd give it I'd given a talk before that and did a short meditation and we did the chanting and that was you know it took up a fair bit of time and then the finished the chanting and then the senior guard asked do you know you've been I can't remember what he said he didn't say singing but he didn't say chanting either but he said you know you've been chanting for a long time can I get you some juice or something and then I said well actually no thanks my throat must be dry by now I said well yeah it is but I heard that it's really difficult to get out of here to go to the toilet and then come back and there's all these and he said no that's okay there's a toilet right here and he said we can make it happen we'll look after you here and so I said well in that case I'll have some more juice and then after that it was fine there was this real change it was still they had to do their duty but the feeling was completely different so that that sense of drawing people into a sphere of loving kindness including them in the directing of loving kindness and then the dedication of blessings and goodness whatever goodness comes that they were included and I think that's something that is really important in terms of the framing of loving kindness is something that is both directed toward oneself but then it goes out to others and it keeps going out and that the heart expands and drops it's shells and it's boundaries and that's actually what they say these divine abidings are for one of the translations that I really like is say the four mature emotions these are mature emotions that don't have the boundaries of me and selective of you there's a really mature it doesn't sort of select it really extends itself out and and then of course when it's shaken or it's really uncomfortable then you come back and establish it again within oneself looking after oneself again and then you can share another aspect I think that is really important when we talk about loving kindness because the medium that we tend to use is sharing of loving kindness sending of loving kindness directing of loving kindness but to me what's always worked better is that one is excellent thank you that's very kind you don't even see the that one rather than because we think of that okay we're going to the sending of loving kindness here and over there and out to this boundary and it's not like a loving kindness postman or something it's a delivery person to me what works better is actually imagining a vessel within the heart the heart is a vessel that is then we allow loving kindness to establish itself and as we establish that then we can we invite people into that we invite different beings we invite into that space and as we are able to establish that more strongly more boundlessly then the container increases rather than having to be this delivery person going off in different directions sending your loving kindness outwards this is the the foundation and as we establish it more firmly and that's what expands you can invite more and more beings more and more situations be comfortable with those situations you invite them into the space and of course especially in terms of engaging with activity and situations it's a much more practical way of looking after oneself but then also drawing in the situation into that space the the way is that we cultivate loving kindness can be quite when you read it sometimes it seems so formulaic and dry and boring actually and so it's really important that if one is cultivating loving kindness as a practice in meditation that one takes on something that has a meaning to oneself and sometimes it's like bringing up an image because loving kindness is more like a spark or warmth within the heart a feeling the loving kindness is not the phrases the more you repeat the phrases and the more at the point you win it's really paying attention to that feeling of kindness, of well-wishing, of warmth, of friendliness and there's just so many different ways that one can cultivate that and one teacher in our tradition is saying if you can't loving kindness doesn't come up as an abstract feeling or as a generate toward yourself or some within some relationship with others you can even just think of some kitten or bring an image of a kitten or a little puppy or something just something that softens the heart it's just using the things that soften the heart and get that sense of warmth and one has that sense of care on a certain level it's an ordinary motion but then learning how to tap into it and to facilitate its growth and its establishment and then bringing it into the heart the ways that we do that, again sometimes using image because some people are very visual so they're using images that help that feeling to arise some people are more it is around words and ideas so that bringing the ideas up but that then generate that feeling and that sense of I've used different freight and often times the way the mind works is that even if we've got a technique that works it'll work for a while and then you get bored it's just the way the mind works and it isn't as, oh my loving kindness practice has failed no, the mind is just displaying its ordinary tendency getting enured to something so then being able to switch or to change so that one of the I've always, some of the chants that we do have particular phrases that I find evoke a feeling like there's one of the chants that we do in our tradition that's translated from a regular chant in the scriptural language and this is may I abide in well-being and it's may I abide in well-being and it's in freedom from affliction in freedom from hostility in freedom from ill will in freedom from anxiety and may I maintain well-being in myself so that just going through that as a chant and it has a resonance to it and to me it has a kind of a nice cadence and the words can have different meaning, I mean the actual literal translation, there's another monastery that translates it and chants it but it has a different cadence to it because it's sort of may I be happy which is true but it evokes a different feeling so that you have to find and that probably works for the people who are used to that as well but those are, it's experimenting and seeing what is it that actually works because I find that these chants stick and certainly do they stick in my mind and especially you've chanted them over years and then they stick in the mind and then they can turn into meditation objects because you can revolve and you're familiar with them and then you can start to recognize the nuances. 
Say there's two sentences to phrase that comes in the Buddha's Words on Loving Kindness which is one of the oldest teachings of the Buddha one of the oldest layers of the Buddha's Canon, the Pali Canon Wishing in Gladness and in Safety May all beings be at ease and so I've used that just taking that and letting that roll through the mind because sometimes having words is really helpful especially if they evoke a feeling and you direct attention to evoking that feeling and exploring the feeling because then you can, once you know what the phrase means and you realize well it's actually, it could be translated in many different ways and then it's but it's those words help to direct our attention in a way that we would all like to be mindful and have our minds clear and spacious and blah blah blah but we just keep cranking it out sometimes just that thoughts and proliferations and ideas it's just relentless sometimes so that having these phrases to kind of cut through that tendency and then of course what it's taking you to is and what you're trying to cultivate and develop is a particular feeling and then the feeling itself will start to gain momentum and then it's like a bridge that then allows you to go into that enter into that feeling and then that's what you allow the mind to start to absorb into but it's helpful to have that bridge, it's helpful to have the tools and that's to me that's always one of the beautiful aspects of the Buddha's teaching is that he's giving us tools and those tools are we really learn how to use them skillfully and that's what our training and practice are but really learning how to use the tools skillfully rather than trying to make ourselves conform to some sort of Buddhist ideal of what they say what's the Buddhist perfect chaplain like so the another aspect of loving kindness or practice and training within a chaplaincy program in particular is the really paying attention to the realities that the Buddha points to and there's a discourse where the Buddha points out five things that should be reflected on a daily basis and it's one that we do it as a chant and you chant it on a regular basis but I'm of the nature to age I've not gone beyond aging, I'm of the nature to sicken I've not gone beyond sickness, I'm of the nature to die I've not gone beyond dying, although it is mine, beloved and pleasing will become otherwise, will become separated from me I'm the owner of my Khamma, heir to my Khamma, born of my Khamma related to my Khamma, abide supported by my Khamma whatever Khamma I shall do, for good or for ill, of that I will be the heir and Khamma it's important I think too because there's quite a variety of people with experience and Khamma is the verb to do actions, I'm the owner of my actions, heir to my actions sort of actions by body, speech and mind so Khamma is not some complicated philosophical or cosmological theory about something this is actions and results so that dealing with people and this ties in very directly with loving kindness in the sense of one has to be grounded in the realities of human existence to respond in a way that is not intimidated by or frustrated by or fearful of these are, this is that somebody gets old or gets sick or dies or there's separation, painful things this is ordinary, this is what the world is about and to be able to place that front and center is a real kindness to oneself and a kindness to others because I think one of the things that's really important in dealing with people who are suffering is that one's not intimidated or fearful of any of it, one has to be able to have really take it on board and this is, that's not just them that's me and it's not just me, it's everybody this is what we all have to contend with or deal with or experience, we all have to experience these realities this is what I said like my teacher you get born, you don't get a warranty card with it some sort of guarantee that it's going to be the way you like it or the way you think it should be there's no warranty, there's not quite sure when it's going to run out, how it's going to run out, what's going to happen and to be able to really internalize that and the more clearly we internalize that the more natural it is to responding to oneself and others this quality of kindness and empathy because it's, you know, on a certain level it all sucks but well yes, exactly which is why the response is one of caring and kindness because you realize that you can, those are the opportunities especially when people are in difficulty those are the conduits that they can then tap back into their own loving kindness or their own compassion or their own joy or their own equanimity and that's, and it's because they've got an example but it's you can't be intimidated by it or you can't expect it to be any other way so that's a you know, it's like well, my own teacher one of the great meditation masters of the era respected all over and he was completely incapacitated, physically incapacitated mentally incapacitated by the time he was 63 a degenerative brain disease wasn't really understood at the time he had a period of degeneration, physical degeneration, there was diabetic, there was all sorts of physical problems going on and then he was having a lot of dizziness and then and then he had a fluid on the brain which was then, that was really creating tremendous pressure and so that was relieved, he felt better for a while and then he just continued to degenerate and so both and then he was almost about 10 years bedridden, unable to physically move and unable to communicate so he lost all of that and completely bedridden and so it was like a very advanced dementia but he was all, as it was happening, one of the things he was, he was actually very clear in saying this is what's happening and he could also see, he'd be very careful, there was times when he would pull himself back from engaging because he couldn't quite trust what was going to come out of his mouth because he was, he knew that he couldn't trust his perceptions and he had his attendants there and he let them know and then, and then of course as he lost all his motor coordination and speech then all that was left was his eyes and if and we set up, we built as he was in hospital for quite a few months but really trying to get to grips and it was probably about almost a year after his brain operation where they put a shunt in to relieve the pressure in the brain and and then maybe about eight or nine months and then he was in hospital for quite a few months with the Queen of Thailand had him flown down and all the best doctors too but it was just basically we had a diagnosis, we didn't have a real treatment except to be able to look after him and continued to sort of during that time we built a dwelling place for him specifically to knowing that he was going to be bedridden, we didn't know for how long and then we set up a system of the monks looking after him and which was a great opportunity for us as students to look after him and to care for him and everything and as he continued to because there was a slower degeneration of how he could be fed and how he could be looked after and everybody had to there was at least one monk who was very experienced as the head monk and there was a sort of a day shift and a night shift and then there would be another monk who was experienced but maybe not quite as experienced as the first and then there could be two monks who were completely inexperienced and then a novice so that they would look after all his needs and one shift for the day, one shift for the night and then every two weeks they would change and it would be on our lunar observance days, either the full moon or the new moon and there would be monks coming from all around because Ajahn Chah had many, many branch monasteries and he affected many people so that they would come and wait and then hope to be able to get in the roster and so ten years of being bed ridden unable to sort of look after himself and he never had a bed sore which is for those people who have been that kind of care that was something kind of attentiveness but also a part of what wasn't just a physical care but there was also the say if monks were there and they started talking worldly chit chat or kind of getting involved in contention or aggravating each other speaking unskillfully everybody who was there you'd always say Ajahn Chah the eyes would be on and there would be he couldn't do anything else but all of a sudden they'd feel Ajahn Chah's eyes on and there was one time there was one Western monk and I think there was two Western monks and they got into a bit of an argument with each other and then Ajahn Chah and they were like it was his bed and then there was probably six, eight feet and they were sort of down toward the end of the bed away from the bed and they're kind of back and forth with each other and then Ajahn Chah sort of gave this kind of a cough but at that time he had a tracheotomy so this gov of Flynn shooting out and hit the wall right between them and that was the end of there that was the end of there so that again looking out you don't need to be getting in their stone that contention kindness of Ajahn Chah's manifested in different ways and even as a very incapacitated and I think one of the things that right now in Thailand there's probably about 300 monasteries associated with Ajahn Chah so that during the time of Ajahn Chah's illness because he was still alive but he wasn't teaching or physically leading then the community had to learn how to work together much more and that was on a certain level again it was a act of kindness for Ajahn Chah to be ill for such a long period of time because it did give gave his student senior monastics the opportunity to really learn how to work with each other and which oftentimes doesn't happen when a often times when a really senior great teacher passes away and there's you know there's harming enough to get him cremated and then there's you know the kind of squabble start and the contensions and competitions end up and it's something that didn't really happen and that's I think so that illness and incapacity you don't know what is coming out of it and to be able to come to it with this perspective of loving kindness and also a lack of fear because I think that's one of the things in a American culture, western culture in general is a tremendous amount of fear around death which means a lot of fear around illness and that somehow it shouldn't be this way it shouldn't but it's not the way it is. 
You know if I were going to design a perfect world then I would design it different but I actually can't so I have to accept what it is and then that's that quality of well-wishing and kindness and concern and willingness to be present and that really makes the difference in how we negotiate these transitions and these realities and so maybe I'll talk for a long time and sort of end here and open it up for questions. 
One of the things I did bring, one of the things that we do in our tradition is publications for free distribution so we brought some along if there's anybody interested and I again didn't quite understand the get my mind around the people and what you all do and there are a couple other publications at the monastery that if you're interested you can go to the website and there's PDFs there or if you want a physical book you can just write through the website and make a request and it'll be put in the mail at some point in time but there's one there's a small booklet of my experiences with Jay, it's called The Last Breath and then there's another little booklet it's called Like a River that's my experiences or our monastery's experience with a young boy who he started coming to the monastery when he was about four or five and he died when he was nine he had a genetic condition with Thalassemia so the hope was of it was quite severe and then he was given a stem cell treatment to be able to change his whole blood system and it didn't work so that he was ill for quite a few months and then finally passed away it's a nice sweet kid who took temporary ordination with us and as he was dying and it's getting towards the last days and you know he knew he was dying and his mother he was Thai but he grew up in America so that he would, they lived up in northern Washington but they have to come down twice a year to the Oakland Children's Hospital to get treatment and so they'd always come to the monastery and I'd been up to their place and then when they go to Thailand and they'd take him to see different monks there and he as he was he had several dreams as he was getting closer to death and he woke up after one night of having dreams and told his parents all the monks that I know came and they were all around my bed last night chanting for me and then his mom asked was Ajahn Pasana there Ajahn was not there mom I told you all the monks were there all of them were there that's a nice little booklet so those are sometimes having these experiences as a monastic I mean that's one of the I think sometimes there's a perception that you know a monastic lives in a kind of a monastic bubble and doesn't really have much contact with the world but the particularly in Theravada tradition and my background in Thailand you're actually completely interrelated, intertwined with people's lives because the monastery is a refuge and so people come the doors are open there isn't any people come with all of their generosity and goodness and their aspirations and they come with all their difficulties and problems and the monastery is a place where it's a space where it all can fit so anyway if anybody's got questions yeah thank you I really appreciated your story about Ajahn Chan taking care of him for those years and it made me wonder what sort of plans you have for your aging monastic community and the realities of the difficulties of the complications of aging and sickness and so forth yeah because we're riding down in the car together so two monks from our community are teaching at Mindfulness Care Center today doing a day long on the 32 parts of the body and one of the monks is Ajahn Krunidamal and he has a master's degree in hospital administration and former nurse as well so he he was joking talking about or getting people to sort of memorizing different aspects of the suttas and remembering different aspects of the discourses of the Buddha and he was sort of the only thing I can remember these days is that 522 regulations of blue shield the Buddha is not the only this maker so it's you have to deal with it it is dealing with the healthcare system it's painful especially when you have a community many people we're all on individual policies we can't get a as a religious non-profit you can't get a can't get a group policy and especially where Mendocino County it's all on individual policies and it was actually one of the conditions or that in terms of the foundation that supports the monastery or looks after the financial aspects of the monastery that sort of requiring all the residents to have healthcare policy insurance because it's just the liability for the monastery it's necessary so we have to deal with this and looking at we've got a fairly young community I'm the oldest and but I'm certainly getting older and but it's also part of the part of the monastic training is learning how to look after the sick especially learning how to look after each other there's a discourse or there's a situation in the time of the Buddha where a monk was neglected and he was kind of left on his own with severe diarrhea and you know, ill, weak in his own waste and the Buddha and another senior monk Ananda his attendant and they were doing wandering around checking things out and they found it came across a sick monk and they saw that he was neglected so they went ahead and helped clean him up, look after him, get him settled and then the Buddha called a meeting of the community and kind of upgraded them for their shortcomings and said you've left your home in the world and you only have each other to look after each other so you have to look after each other and so that and he said you know whoever looks after a sick monk is the same as looking after me as the Buddha so he put that as a priority so there tends to be if one takes the training seriously then from the time you're quite young as a junior member then you're starting to learn how to look after each other, how to pay attention how to help out in times of illness and especially our monastery like right now we've got I mean it's getting to be a kind of a joke in the monastery because we're there's four of them on benches now and there's one of them he's one of the younger guys and there's three of them with bad knees and one with and the sort of problems with hip and knee and feet so that just to end we've got 280 acres and it's like this if anybody's been to Abhigiri and seen where the meditation hall is and where the house in the leech field that's the flat part of Abhigiri that's it, it's very small so that we have to negotiate steep terrain, physically you have to put forth some effort so we have to learn how to look after each other we are fortunate that we've got we've got one doctor who he lives in the adjacent county he's a Buddhist and is very he actually moves there to be close to Abhigiri so if we have any need for consultation we'll check in with him and he's very responsive we've got a good local doctor family care practitioner who's very good and he gives us time and we pay for it but he's really sympathetic to the monastery he helps so these are.
