There is an interesting pairing of qualities , which  can be 
a useful  reference point for practice : the pairing of 
contentment  and discontent . It’s not either -or, but more  
like a range. There can be degrees of discontent and 
degrees of contentment. In the middle where the two 
are balanced , I don’t know what that looks like , but there 
is a range. If you have  contentment with the ordinary 
circumstances of your life , the practice of meditation 
works really well .  
 
For example, b eing here at IM C, you have all the 
housing you need for the next two hours  – you have a 
roof, protection from the sun , and some privac y inside to 
meditate . You can be  content with the clothes you have  
– you are all adequately dressed.  Hopefully y ou are 
content with the food you had , and content with the 
circumst ances you’re in. There  might be lots of 
discontent in your li fe, but the circumstance here is a 
place where you can f eel content during  this time.  
 
Contentment supports meditation by allowing t he mind 
to settle. If you don’t avail yourself  of a certain degree  of 
contentment with your life , the disconten t gives rise  to an agitated  mind . If it’s agitated , it doesn’t settle. 
Meditation is about settling the mind , and i t’s supported 
by feelings of contentment. I like to call this “wise 
contentment. ”  
 
There are two things you might think about this morning. 
One is simply to recognize for yourself where you fit in 
that range of contentment  and disconten t at different 
moments. How do contentment and  discontent work for 
you?  
 
The second thing is that, for some people , the idea of 
contentment is not an operating princi ple they think 
about. It’s not something they’re concerned with. They 
have better things to do than to be content  – except 
may be after eating a meal , when  they may be  
content ed for a little bit. But contentment can be a more 
regular part of how we see our  lives. Maybe there are  
more opportu nities to be happily or wisely contented 
within reason. In just being here this morning for the 
next two hours , it’s reasonable that there’s a lot to be 
contented  with.  
 
There’s a lot  in the world to be discontented about, but 
let the world be the world. Let you be here , and see if 
you can find some modicum of just being content to be 
here: content to be breathing, content to be walking, 
content just to be alive in this circumstance wh ere so much is going well. Maybe  that will support your 
practice here.  
 
May you be content. Thank you.
