 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So for this session, I thought we would take a look at scarcity and sufficiency, which get highlighted when we connect with the quality of mudhitta or empathetic joy. So just as a review, mudhitta, this third of the Brahma-Viharas, is the ability to be fully present with anyone's success or happiness. So it's unrestricted, open-hearted joy at another person's success and good fortune. And one thing that mudhitta will bring into focus as we cultivate it or connect with it is our relationship to qualities like scarcity and abundance and sufficiency, or perceived scarcity and abundance and sufficiency as it sometimes is. So we might think at some level that there isn't enough for everyone based on prior experiences with scarcity. Or if we have abundance in some area, we might not consider that others might have a small portion. So there can be a little bit of inability to connect if we have unresolved issues around scarcity and sufficiency. So it's interesting as we begin to look at this quality of the heart, this particular flavor of joy, what areas of our life do we have a feeling of scarcity, perhaps? There's a lot of different dimensions where scarcity issues can play out and they end up being different, they end up having different impacts. And it might be that we have a whole bunch of areas where everything is fine and then there's that one. So I'll just name some common ones and you can kind of consider how it is for you, areas of life where we have feelings of scarcity. So one of them is food. Another one is love. Another very common one is attention and also money. So there can be a sense in each of these areas and so many others have some kind of an inner story of scarcity. And so we feel like there isn't enough for everyone or there isn't enough for me or I didn't get the right amount of that, something like that. So when we have that kind of story, if we haven't seen it in our mind, then it's possible that we will have some of the common resistances to mutita, the biggest one being envy or jealousy. No, I want that. You shouldn't have gotten that, these little feelings. And sometimes they're kind of subtle underneath, but they're there. Or also we can sometimes have a responsive greed. We think there isn't enough, I've got to get it. I've got to make sure I get it so that that can come to the fore. But when we shift, when we're able somehow to shift to a wider view, to a mindset of sufficiency and sometimes even of abundance, let's say at least sufficiency, that there is enough for everyone, then what you tell opens and it allows us to be happy for anyone. We feel connected. We feel that others delight is our delight. It's kind of a sense of unity and connection. So I heard from another teacher, a nice analogy for this. He said, it's like when a big truck comes and dumps a whole bunch of water into a pond and right when it dumps it in, the level goes up just in that area. But really the whole level of the pond goes up. Even if the truck dumps it into one spot. So I remember I hadn't really done a lot of work with, formal work with Mudita or quite a ways into my practice because it feels to me like this Brahmani Hari gets short shrift compared to the more popular ones of Metta and Karuna and Upekka. So goodwill or love, compassion and equanimity. Those three seem of interest, but empathetic joy, not as much somehow. So I hadn't done a lot of practice with it, but I went on a retreat where part of the focus of the retreat was proportion of the retreat we did intensive Brahmani Hari practice. And so that was the sort of all day, everyday, going with the cultivation of these line states or phrases or we were actually doing radiation. And so then I got to work with it and it was interesting, I ran into some of the resistances, but I also found the ways in which it was natural to me. And there was one period, remember this is on retreat, we might not get this at home, but I was fairly focused and I felt like the mudita was flowing and it just kind of settled into my mind. It's like it just suddenly filled my consciousness and I didn't need to really do much to maintain it. And so I thought, wow, that's really interesting. And I got up, I was in sitting meditation and I got up and I went outside and I was on the retreat center on the East Coast where, and it was, I think, January. And so it was cold and snowy and the trees were all bare and there wasn't that much life. But there were some birds and squirrels. And I remember I was walking with this sense of mudita and it was a sunny, a bright sunny day, but cold. And I would see the birds getting just a few little red berries that were left on the bushes and I would see the squirrels finding a pine cone that was still available. And I just had these waves of joy going through me. Oh, the bird found a berry. It's like it felt so abundant, even though there's nothing abundant about the plant life in the East Coast in January. But somehow it was just, it was an easy connection. And then I thought, yeah, okay, so with that as a reference point, of course, I'm not there all the time. We're not there all the time. But with that as a reference point, it's really been helpful in connecting with other people's joy and success. Sometimes in this world where there's so much dukkah and so much strife and conflict, we almost don't want to turn toward the goodness of the world. But there is just as much happiness and peace and joy and generosity going on that we can feel this quality of mudita for. We can celebrate that those things do happen in this world. So the wholeness, mudita points to the wholeness of life and the celebration aspect of being alive. And there is enough. There is enough. So with that, let's begin our meditation. Settling in, finding a posture that feels comfortable, peaceful, allowing the body to be soft, even as it's also upright. If you're comfortable doing so, you can close your eyes, allow the lids to be soft, with the eyes relaxing, the eye sockets. Imagining a small space between the top of the spine and the skull, letting the neck relax, the chin drop slightly, softening the jaw. Letting the shoulders relax, let the shoulder blades slide down the back. Letting the arms relax into a natural, settled posture, maybe resting on the thighs, maybe folded in the lap. And inviting ease all down through the torso area, the ribcage and chest, diaphragm, down into the belly. Connecting fully with where you're sitting. Imagining your seat, melting into the chair, the cushion a bit. Softening all down through the legs, all the way to the feet. Perhaps taking a deep breath to reconnect with the whole body sensation. A general sense of the body sitting, or perhaps you're lying down. So I'll invite a brief recollection. It should be a relatively simple memory, if you can. And that is to recall the time when someone was openly and sincerely happy about some success that you had. Some good fortune, some achievement. And you shared it with someone and they smiled when you were happy in just a simple, open, sincere way. Feel that feeling. Maybe it was your grandparent, or your favorite aunt, or a teacher celebrating some success of yours. Connecting to that feeling in your heart. Feel how it softens the body. It doesn't have to be a perfect moment, but something along those lines, or someone had an idea for you. And sense that in this world, there are many beings who are experiencing good fortune today. It was a sunny day, they were happy. However, today was the day they felt better after an illness. There are people like that in the world right now. They saw someone they hadn't seen for a long time, who they care about. Today, somebody gave them something that they weren't expecting. They said, there is a gift. There are people like that right now. Connect again with this sense that there is joy and happiness in this world. Like that truck dumping water in the pond, the level of happiness goes up slightly. Connect to that, join it. And seeing if you can rest with this feeling for a while, dropping the thoughts around it, the reflection, feeling into the bodily sense of mudita. Resting with that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And when it feels like the right time, it's fine to shift away from the feeling of mudita to some other object like the breath or just the flow of body sensations. Or you can continue with the sense of empathetic joy, allowing the practice to flow as it feels natural now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks to all of you for your practice. So now we'll move into the breakout rooms for those of you who want to stay. And it might be interesting to consider the question, how do you move in your own experience, your own life, how do you move from a feeling of scarcity to a feeling of sufficiency or abundance when you notice that in your mind? So that might be one way to orient your discussion. So welcome back. It's nice to see all of you. I've run the time quite close up to the end, it looks like. But I also heard that it was a good session among yourselves. So I would love to hear some of your wisdom or if you have any burning questions. Oh, I see a heart. That's very nice. Thank you, Quentin. The group wisdom, the group, the group of people that I was lucky to meet, they had the wisdom. And I feel the privilege to have that moment with them. Wonderful. That's what we hope from. Hope for with small groups is that you'll find each other's wisdom. Oh, there's Jun Yao. Please go ahead, Jun. Yeah, Kim, I really enjoyed this practice. Normally, I don't really hear about starting from the abundance point of view. So this is a paradigm shift for me. Oh, good. Yeah, great. Yes. Thank you. Anything else on your mind? Getting a couple of things in the chat. Thanks, everyone. Okay, well, then maybe we're all just content and feeling abundant. And I see some thumbs up. So we'll just say goodbye to each other then and dedicate the merit from our time together to the abundance of the world. May we be agents of amplifying and spreading joy because it keeps echoing as long as people keep it in their hearts and keep it going. That's how it works. So may we be one that allows joy to continue to flow through us. The world so much needs it. Thanks to all of you for your beautiful practice and have a wonderful evening or day. Thank you so much for what you brought to this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.
