Greetings from the Northern Hemisphere from Mountain View, California, on Cin√© d'Oloni land. It's lovely to be with you in this moment in time where it's chilly, it's a chilly morning here. So let us gather, let us gather in community this day and continue our explorations with the practice of generosity, the practice of generosity, Donna. And the invitation today is the culmination of four days of exploring this topic together, is during our guided meditation, actually, we might as well just start and I will, whatever you need to know, I will invite you during the meditations. So let's just begin. Let's just begin. So arriving, landing in this body first. Here, here, here, transitioning from the busyness, from whatever has come before. Greeting, greeting this moment, creating this moment of being human, being alive in this body, this form here, just as it shows up. It has never been and will never be like this ever again. Greeting this passing moment with a smile. Arriving at your seat. Again, internally arriving at your seat. Taking your seat on this earth. You are alive. I am alive. Taking your seat in this moment in time, in this body. Relaxing, softening, receiving, receiving the sensations of the body, just as they are. Pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. It's all a gift. It's all a gift. Pleasant as well as the unpleasant and neutral. It's all a gift. Can we see it that way? Is it possible to open up just for a moment? Just for a moment. Receiving the breath. The breath is gift. Enlivening, bringing life to this body. And the abdomen, lowering the center of gravity. From our head, where it usually is down to our lower abdomen. As if the abdomen, the belly is an organ of perception. As if it knows, it receives. The breath on its own, senses. You are alive. you and now I have an invitation for you to try on for size if you would bring to mind someone who for you represents complete generosity of spirit generosity of heart complete it could be a person a being someone you know have known it could be a cultural icon someone is someone historic maybe like the Dalai Lama or Martin Luther King or it could be an archetype that works for you whatever works for you can be non-denominational could be the Buddha could be Jesus could be being of light naked whoever works for you whatever works for you or even divinity themselves this sense of complete generosity complete generosity generosity of spirit generosity of heart which includes loving kindness forgiveness letting go last perspective whatever whoever helps you tap into this vision bringing them to mind and imagine them saying okay let me show you what it feels like what it looks like for this moment and you invite them please show me please show me they agree as if they enter your heart your eyes your body looking out through your awareness inhabiting your senses so that your practice of meditation with breath with the body with awareness is infused with ultimate gracious open-hearted generosity for some for some it might feel again if it's appropriate for you the eyes of God expansive spacious or your inner Buddha make it personal what is meaningful for you based on your history and background no shoots here just tapping into the sense of generosity of heart however is accessible you and just sitting resting nothing needs to be done you sitting in with this perspective of expansive generosity of heart towards yourself towards all phenomena thoughts sensations emotions that arise that's it simple you you you you you and if thoughts and distractions Insight See how they are met from this ultimate, ultimately generous perspective.
