 with the end of our first full day of retreat. And this is a... I think worthy of a congratulations, particularly for those of you who are on your first retreat. It's a... it's something getting here, isn't it? So maybe, maybe some of you just kind of slid right in and was smooth sailing all the way along. But for many of us, it can be a bit of a bumpy ride, landing. I sometimes think of it like you're in a car that's moving really fast, and you come to a sudden stop. And there's a... there's a little shimmy in the car. And that shimmy shows up for us in our bodies. It's achy knees, tired back, fatigue, restlessness. It may show up in our hearts as sadness, anxiety, or doubt, or contentment, or peace. And for many of us, it shows up in the awareness of the busyness of the mind. It's the one used in the opening group, the... term the eggbeater mind. So whatever... whatever has been true for you as you've kind of ridden the waves of the first day, you've made it here to the end. To the end of the first day. And the one thing that I will promise for sure is that however it was today, it will change. I won't promise how it will change, but it won't stay the same. And so I want to invite us all in this last little stretch of time to do a little reflection back on the day, and to offer some gratitude, some appreciation, particularly to our bodies. So as we've been suggesting, please take a posture seated, standing, lying down, any way that allows you to feel both kind of awake and relaxed, the sense of ease. And turning or tuning your attention inward. Just taking a moment to check and see what's here. Making any adjustments to the posture that might be helpful. Bringing this attitude of a spacious, kind awareness. Meeting this moment. Whatever it is, however it is. And then inviting you to let your awareness or your attention come into the heart center. So staying grounded, present in the body. But tuning in, listening in to an area at the center of the chest. If it's helpful, you could place a hand or hands gently across the chest. I like to imagine that I could literally breathe in and out of the heart. And beginning just by noticing what's here. The tone or color or flavor of the heart center now. And on the next inhalation. Imagining you could breathe in through the heart. Breathing in a sense of appreciation. Gratitude of kindness for yourself. Reflecting back over the day, the evening. And the various highs and lows, twists and turns in your practice over the course of the day. This process of settling in. And as you breathe in, bringing a sense of gratitude of thanks. Appreciating whatever sincerity, intentionality, fortitude, dedication. Appreciating whatever it took for you to show up, to be here for whatever might have arisen. Breathing in through the heart. Imagining you could fill the whole body with this quality of gratefulness of kindness and care. And especially letting your well wishes for yourself, your appreciation, touch any of those places in the body, the heart, the mind, and there may have been difficulty or struggle. Or not looking to try to change them or push them away, but just to meet them, to touch them. Let this kind of wise and tender appreciative heart. And continuing to breathe in through the heart. Appreciation, kindness, care. On your next exhalation, as you breathe out, extending the same qualities of the heart to all of your fellow travelers on the path. The others who have been sitting with you, little boxes on the screen. Appreciating the ways in which we've begun to create this Sangha community together. Supporting one another in this way. And so you're welcome to continue, if you like, this fairly simple practice. Breathing in and breathing out through the heart center. Receiving and extending. Appreciation. Gratefulness, kindness, and care. And if you prefer, you're also welcome to let that practice go. Just return to the simple resting in the body, aware of the body sitting. And the body breathing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And before we bring the final formal sitting of our first day to a close, do the practice of sharing the merit, offering up any goodness, any insight, any of the beautiful qualities of sincerity and dedication, care that you've cultivated through the course of today. And as we end the day, the formal part of our day of sitting, just inviting you to open your hands, open your hearts, sending out, extending, sharing all of that goodness with the many, many beings, known and unknown, seen and unseen, all across our wide aching world by the power and truth of our practice together this day. May all beings everywhere be happy. May all beings be safe, free from inner and outer harm. May all beings live with ease. And may we together with all beings everywhere awaken and be free. So I think you know that the virtual meditation hall is open. And so for any of you, feel some momentum or energy from the sitting from today and want to continue to sit in a less structured way. You're welcome. Some of you may be tired and want to go to sleep. And if that's the case, you're welcome to continue your practice in that way. Getting up from your seat, taking care of whatever you need to before you go to bed, and really doing your best to continue this, what do we call it, seamlessness. It's kind of a 24-7 practice as Eugene expressed. And everything we do, whatever it is, is part of the fabric of the retreat. And if any of you who may be on different time zones or just have a clock, an inner clock that wakes you up early, you are also welcome to come into the meditation hall before the first scheduled sitting. And again, sit in the... It's nice the picture of the meditation hall is kind of quiet and dark. So it's like that in the evening, it's also like that in the early morning. And just to know that it's there and open and welcome. So however you choose to practice as we close our formal part of the day, please stay close to your bodies and take good care of yourselves. And we'll see you tomorrow morning. Thank you very much for your practice today.
