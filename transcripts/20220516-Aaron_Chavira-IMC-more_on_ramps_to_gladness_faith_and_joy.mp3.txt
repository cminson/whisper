The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Hi, welcome. Nice to see you here tonight. And hello out there on YouTube. Thank
you for being here as well. So, this last week I've been thinking more about
noticing, continuing to notice this this idea of receiving moments of gladness or
joy, faith as they come up. And, you know, it's interesting. I was also noticing
kind of where I don't connect, where I don't allow myself to take in the
goodness. And, you know, this, we really do have to stay present to receive, to
receive the gladness and the joy that come up in our lives, even the simple
ways. Yeah, I'm so helpful to, you know, really, truly try and notice these moments
and take them in. It's very easy to skip over the little, the little gifts of the
day. This week one of the things that I noticed was, you know, there can be
things that happen in life, can you turn the volume down just a little bit, that
are kind of in that space of like, this could be seen as good by the mind or it
could be seen as difficult or not good by the mind, depending on how the mind
engages with it. So, for example, my, I had said something to my daughter that was,
I was trying, I was being joking in the moment, but it really hurt her feelings.
And so she told me, didn't come out exactly, directly that way, but she told
me that, you know, what I had said had hurt her feelings. And there was a lot
of gladness that she could tell me, right, that we could talk about what
happened. And I could apologize. And there was this appreciation. So my
daughter is 25. So the maturation of our relationship, our ability to, to talk
things through, right, and not just to have a lot of reactivity, which we used
to have a lot more reactivity with each other. And, you know, we got to a really
good place. It was good. It was a really good thing. And I noticed that the, you
know, I went to bed happy and the next day I got up and I felt happy, but then I
noticed starting to like, well, I wonder, I wonder, you know, she's still okay. She
feels okay this morning when she wakes up if she feels good about the talk. So I
sent her a text just to check in and I didn't hear back. And so, you know, I'm
sort of a little later, halfway through the day, I'm like, oh, I didn't hear back.
And I'm like, what does that mean? Right. So I sent another little text and I
still didn't hear back. And so during the day, I could feel myself kind of
having a hard time staying with the fact that we had this really good
conversation, that there was this energy of worry or this, you know, yeah, worry
that maybe there was more, more conflict to be managed. I could be really clear
in my mind that I was really glad that we had the conversation. It was really
healthy. I knew these things. And I could feel the energy pulling kind of, I'll
call it right here, the sense of anxiety or tension in the core of my body. And I
was thinking about sort of, are you guys familiar with the hindrances? The
five hindrances? Jim, you know, you know them, they're good friends of yours.
There's these five hindrances that are discussed by the Buddha as being pretty
significant interferences in our meditation, and I'll say in our daily
lives and our lives in general. And so it's like really like naming, okay, the
hindrance of restlessness and worry, right? This is one of the five
restlessness and worry just kind of keeps, keeps coming in. And while I have
this clarity, like a mental clarity of this is a good thing, there's this other
energy that's kind of keeps stirring things up. And so, you know, as the day went
on, I was like, okay, it's like just pull over the metaphor of a driving or a car,
you know, the mind when it gets going, it feels like you're driving. And when
your restlessness and worried, it almost feels like you keep trying to find your
way somewhere and getting lost, right? You're just like this relentless searching
feeling. And so it's like the opposite of that was just pull over and stop and
breathe in to the gratitude for the, the contact, the event, the sharing that
happened between my daughter and myself. And keeping myself there, right? So last
week I was talking about savoring, right, that the brain needs our help to
savor or take in the good stuff, especially when we've got a hindrance
going on in our minds, we need to help it settle and to help it take in and
recognize and attend. It's like a fork, right? We can keep fork in a road, we can
get caught and pulled off, right, into the mental kind of hindrances or
worries or we can, no, just stay, stay here, just take in what's going on here. So
this week I found gratitude was a really helpful way to help myself work to take
an entrance to gladness, right, to a sense of gladness and that gladness
supported a light, lightning of the heart, right, a lightning of the being. So we
pretty much all know, right, that our minds are, different things are happening,
it's not always just peaceful and common here. And Saiyadau Utejaniya, do you
guys know who he is? He's a monk, Burmese monk, and he has a lot of very pithy
little direct sayings that have to do with mindfulness and daily life. And one
of the things, his quotes is, it's inevitable to make some wrong turns in
daily life, but you have to learn to profit from these experiences, learn to
profit from them, these wrong turns don't allow just the difficulties to keep
running the show, but learn from them. So these hindrances, and I'll list them in
a moment, it's good to get to know them, it's good to recognize when
they're present. One of the, yeah, one of the simplest things to do is kind of to
do what the, in the sutta, some of the suttas, when the Buddhas are facing some
challenge, some difficulty, he will reference Mara. Mara is the representation,
embodiment, like of a, the temptress to all the ill will, and the desire, and the
aversion, and that, you know, he'll say, Mara, I see you when those qualities are
coming up in the moment, sort of this turning toward, you know, I see you, I
see you that you're, you know, restless, and worry, I see you, I see you, I see you
here. It's a really important way to help us start to, to benefit, to learn from
these visitors. So what are these five, let me just list them for you. Typically
they're listed in the following order. One is sensual desire, so a lot of desire
for pleasantness, for objects, for, you know, feeling good. The second one is ill
will, so anger, hatred, wanting to strike out. The third one is restlessness, no
sloth and torpor, actually there's a, yeah, sloth and torpor, so a sense of
tiredness, fatigue that can be both mind or body, or mind and body, or one or the
other. And then there's restlessness and worry, which I was sort of alluding to,
and the last one is doubt, and this is like a doubt in the practice, or a
doubt in ourselves, right, that's kind of a, not a, not a very helpful doubt. So
Shaila Catherine says that just as an oyster transforms the irritating
presence of a grain of sand into a pearl, meditators convert irritants into
wisdom. So this goes back to that statement by Saidao Tejania, you know,
like let's take advantage of it when these things come up in our lives, learn
from them, you know, let them become the pearl, the wisdom that guides us. These
hindrances are, you know, energetic, they affect our body, like just think about
the experience of having a strong desire for something, what does that feel like
in your body? There's like generally just even just thinking about maybe even
imagining something you know you really, really want, and as I'm even just
imagining it, you see my body is leaning forward, right? Do you notice that? That
tends to be what happens energetically with our bodies is we, we lean toward it,
and there's a feeling of a pull. Now contrast that to ill will. When you
really don't like someone, when you have aversion, just kind of bring that to mind,
something, some event, some person, some food, just as you imagine that, what do
you notice in your body? How's that energy feel different?
You want to lean toward it? Probably not, right? There's more of a sitting back or
a pull back in general. So I'm pointing to this because this is partly how we
start to recognize that the forces are present of the hindrances, is we can
start to see it in our, the body will start to give us clues. In terms of sloth
and torpor, well, when we feel really tired, there's a sinking, right? There's a
sinking energy which can be felt literally in our bodies like just a
sleepiness, heaviness, but sometimes the torpor in the mind can actually get
really drifty and dreamy and quite pleasant. So it's also important to
recognize because we can kind of be losing touch with the present moment in
meditation and not really recognizing it because it feels, it can feel somewhat
pleasant. So in that energetic state, when we're, you know, feeling slothful,
there's usually a heaviness, a sinking feeling, right? With restlessness and
worry, for me that there's this kind of habitual pattern that feels a little
like, like this I'm doing, you know, like a settling, okay, okay, and then a
stirring up and a settling and a stirring up. There's a difficulty settling,
period, right? With restlessness and worry and it can manifest, you know, very
much in the body and you can see it just in the mind, just sort of the circular
thinking that we tend to get involved in when we're caught. And then without, what
does that feel like when you have a lot of doubt? What do you notice in your body
when you're really, really questioning, doubting if this is the right thing to be
doing? For me, what comes up is there's this a way in which it feels, it's almost
like there's a frozen feeling in a way of the energy and like a little, does that
resonate for you? Any other words, feel free to speak up you guys to describe
what it feels like for you when you, you're feeling a lot of doubt, uncertainty,
stockiness, comes to mind. Have anything else you want to say? What's that? Back and
forth, okay, okay, yeah, like not the, that speaks to that energy of do I want to, do
I not want to kind of like, is this right? Is this good? Is this bad? Kind of, and some
freezing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so it's said that these hindrances weaken our wisdom.
They're like a sieve because they drain the mind. There's a lot of pretty strong
language used to describe them, obstructing, hindering, blocking, enveloping. I think
it's, they're all, it's really, really helpful to think about them in strong
ways, but it's also like they're, this is part of being human. These are all
experiences every human being has. And, you know, it's better, I think, to, to get
to know them, to understand them, to sort of normalize them, than to vilify them.
In my view, Gil Fraunstall talks about having a hindrance is like wandering
through a maze, staring at the ground, where you're never looking up, right? Like
that. And he says, in contrast, being mindful is like standing above the maze
to get an overview, right? Without eliminating a hindrance, mindfulness gives
us a better perspective of what's happening. So when we notice, when we
recognize, oh, look at me, I'm, I'm experiencing restlessness and worry. It is
like having that above view of, oh, look what I'm doing. I can see it now, right?
Before you maybe are just feeling it and getting drawn and driven by it. But when
we can start to have that awareness, recognition of its influence, we have an
opportunity to kind of get more free.
So, you know, last week I was sort of emphasizing that, you know, when
suffering happens in our lives, it is an opportunity to recognize it. There's an
opportunity to notice the pain, the difficulty of it. And in doing so, we can
do that thing like we see the maze. And when we see the maze, we have freedom, we
have this opportunity. And that can be like, it can help us see that that
suffering that was happening that was going on was actually an invitation, you
know, to, to freedom if we listen to it, if we listen to its call. And we, we
recognize it. So, maybe I'll talk a little bit more about the, the five
hindrances. There's some really cool similes in the suttas. So, with central
pleasure, it's, it's compared to the experience of being in debt. So, having a
huge financial burden versus being free from it, like the difference between
like, oh, anybody, anything, like that feeling of freedom. And then there's other
similes that are related to water. And this one is with, with central pleasure,
it's related to a colored pool of water. So, here's the sutta from that I'll read.
If there is water in a pot mixed with red, yellow, blue, or orange color, a person
with normal facility of sight, looking into it, could not proper, properly recognize
and see the image of their own face, right? The water is discolored, might be
pretty, but in the same way, when one's mind is possessed by central desire,
overpowered by it, right? It's really driving us. One cannot properly see, you
know, see the escape, see the clarity. It's not available. And then, when we, we
don't kind of see and see the way out, we don't understand, right? We don't really
understand what's happening. It's like being in that maze and looking down at
the ground. Yeah.
So, I think I'll just kind of go through with the similes and then we can see
where we want to go from there. But with ill will, it's compared to illness or
disease. A sense of, you know, feeling really sick, right? When we feel really
angry and hostile, there's great sense of discomfort, disease in the body. There's
a, often it's talked about as like wanting to strike out or push, push
something away. And so, with the simile of the water, and if there's a pot of water
heated on the fire, the water is seething and boiling, and a person with a
normal faculty of sight, looking into it, cannot properly recognize or see the
image of their own face, their own mind. They can't really see what's going on in
there. So, when we're possessed by ill will, and we don't recognize it's there, we
don't know our way through the maze, right? We don't know our way out. With
sloth and torpor, it's equated with imprisonment, or being locked in a cage,
that feeling of not being able to move. And the simile for it is, if there's a
pot of water covered with moss and water plants, this is, you know, it's full of
that sludge. So, we really don't even see hardly any reflection at all, not even a
distorted reflection. With restlessness and worry, I like to think about it as
being very very caught, like in a tide pool. And with the simile, it describes
that there's a water and a pot stirred by the wind, agitated, swaying, or
producing waves. That that's the way it distorts the surface of the water and
makes it impossible again to see clearly, to see into our own minds. And for
skeptical doubt, it's equated with the dangers of a desert journey, no water, no
relief from the heat of the sun, no safe space to rest, we just can't. Maybe
that goes back to what you were saying, like we just, there's no settling, right?
And then with the water simile, it's described as water that's turbid, stirred
up and muddy in a dark place, right? Do you connect with those, those images? Do
they resonate for you? Yeah? Yeah. Can you imagine which of these hindrances are the
most often visitors in your lives?
What would you say, if you feel comfortable saying which ones are the
most common for you?
Sensual desire. Yeah. Yeah. Doubt. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? I still didn't. It'll
will and it will. And you say that. So yeah, like almost like embarrassed, right?
Yeah. There's so, it's just, this is so much just a part of our psychological
makeup and our evolution, really. If I, if I step back from all of these forces, I
think, well, of course, we need to have sensual desire, right? That's sort of what
propagates humanity. And, you know, and at this point, we're living in such a
capitalistic society, right? So much about sort of, you know, so much greed in our
society, right? So that's just, wow, really fed. And then the hostility and ill
will, right? Well, we do need to, or we used to need to. Maybe we shouldn't need
to now to have that sort of hostility with other beings. But if, you know, at
some point, if you just watch animals, right, it's just, it's an instinct, you
know, it's an instinct. And sloth and torpor, right? You know, it's sort of a
natural response in some ways to if we are feeling overwhelmed or bored or
disengaged. It's a natural thing. We're not connecting with our lives. We're not
connecting with our experience often. A lot of times when people talk about
being bored, I feel like they're leaving themselves in a way. They're leaving
their experience. They're not interested in it. And with doubt, again, you know,
it's important, actually, it's important to have doubt, right? If we didn't have
doubt, we might just believe a commercial and do whatever, you know, we're
told to do, right? The beautiful thing about working with doubt in the practice
and the Buddhist teachings was, you know, just this encouragement to listen to
what works, to trust your experience. Not so much your ideas about what's supposed
to be happening, but just to trust your experience to really, and then we need to
commit ourselves to it, too, right? If we've got too much doubt, it's hard to
commit to a practice. It's hard to commit to sitting, right? But if we can really
help ourselves commit to the practice, then we can stop afterwards and reflect
on our actual experience and trust it. It's also without really helpful to talk
to a teacher or read the teachings or, you know, seek wisdom to help you. That can
be very helpful. So, do you have any kind of, any direction you'd like me to go
with this talk? Do you want me to go back to this idea of, you know, joy and
gladness? Or would you like to hear more about any one of the hindrances or tips
for working on them in daily life? What would be helpful? And people in YouTube,
feel free to write in the chat if there's anything for you as well. Great. Let me
just think about that. Yeah, take your time. When do you, when do you see these
five hindrances as something, as maybe like, these are indications that I need
to work on in my life, that maybe use them to your own benefits, or at the same
time, compared to just like, I need to fix, or maybe versus, I need to fix my
mindset so I'm not having these hindrances come up. Like, how do you compare
in contrast, compare in contrast? Maybe like, maybe the doubt you're having is
beneficial for you. Yeah. But versus like, maybe I shouldn't be having this doubt. I
need to be confident in myself. Same thing with desires and it will, because
sometimes they are beneficial for you to have them. Yeah. Versus, I need to fix
myself. I need to be more aware so that I don't have them. How do you compare in
contrast? That's a great question. I don't know how succinctly I can answer it, but
it's a beautiful, beautiful right on point question. And I would say number one
is trust your experience. Study your experience. Notice the impact of the
hindrances when they show up. And notice, one thing that can be really helpful is
notice when they're absent. Right? So when we're not in the grip of them, it's hard
to have full understanding of their impact or when they're useful or
potentially, you know, more useful when you're under their spell, because you
can't see clearly. And then what's really amazing is to have experiences of their
absence, because it is pretty blissful. It's pretty surprising how these things
that we're so familiar with, how much they actually do block our joy, block our
capacity to be really present. But this is not something to know intellectually.
This is something to know directly through your experience. When I'm trying
to recognize for myself, like I'm trying to think about, you know, desire, right?
Kind of one of the other things you can look at is what is it you're desiring? And
you can use some discernment, right? Around like, am I desiring peace and
freedom? And so I'm motivated to get to the Insight Meditation Center and
sit on my cushion. And there's very, there can be very wholesome things that
desire supports us in. But if the desire isn't wholesome, right, it's not leading
toward a beneficial outcome, that's a very clear indicator for us that we're, the
hindrance itself is keeping us connected to something that's not helpful for us
in our practice. Does that make sense? Jim or Richard, do you want to take a stab at
responding in any way? Add to what I've said or? Yeah, okay. So I'm going to look
here at the chant, or not the chant, the chat. Graham says, I definitely find that I
can be drawn into the hindrances much easier when I have not fully appreciated
their absence. Yeah, I really agree with that, Graham. Thank you. That when, when
we're, it goes back to, and that's similarly really pointing out to, we can't
see clearly when the mind is under the influence of the hindrance. We were in the
maze looking at the floor. We, we aren't seeing the conditions. So the evaluation
of what is useful and not useful is much more clearly seen when we're free from
it. And it is helpful to notice those moments of freedom. What, what is that
like to have a moment free from wanting things, wanting things, right? Or in the
case of ill will maybe not wanting things, right? Or what is it like when you don't
feel doubt? When you feel confident, right? What's it like to have a moment of
contentment free of that like wanting, like, oh, it's just everything's okay. What
does that feel like? It's, it's so much more peaceful, really. Yeah, yeah. To
mentioning how maybe let's focus on what the absence of these hindrances are like.
Are there some exercises that we can do? Is it maybe just so more like reflection
every day, writing something? And how can mindfulness help us? Because a lot of
times when we're meditating, these hindrances are coming up. Yeah, so what
can we do to actively work on and maybe in terms of exercises or mindfulness that
will help us like avoid these hindrances and secondly be more aware of the
absence of them at the same time. Great, great question. Yeah, it's sort of
related, but so I think what Tonya's pointing to with the, you know, practicing
with hindrances is really understanding, first of all, being cognizant or
recognizing hindrance. So that's a really great reflection, like you're going
through the day. If you're completely absorbed in a story in your mind about a
conversation that you had earlier in the day and it didn't go the way you would
like to it had gone or all the stuff that goes on, the mental activity, you
recognize at that moment, oh, this is restless and worried, this is some
clinging to wanting a different, this is greed, this is wanting, this is aversion
if you're really angry about it. So yeah, so seeing that is working with the
hindrance and so over time, if you continually bring your mindfulness to
that process, eventually you'll notice, oh, I don't, I'm not experiencing that
hindrance in a sense. You may even be kind of looking around for it, you know. I
don't know if that makes sense. Yeah, work that muscle is a great way to put
it. So I'll just go through a list of things I wrote and I'll keep, and before
I actually read them, I'll say there, there've been many times I've taught and
other people have taught a five-week series on the five hindrances here and
so those recordings are all on audio Dharma and if you go to the website, the
IMC website, you can actually find the handouts and the handouts have
suggestions, tips for practicing for the week, really fabulous ones. So under
documents on the, yeah, and you can even, if you, you know, have trouble, you can
search. There's a little search feature of five hindrances and a lot of stuff will
come up. So that's, that's written stuff and then there's also the recorded stuff.
So, so I want to share that resource and then Gil wrote a book that's on Amazon
and unhindered, it's called unhindered and he has a tremendous, a number of
reflection practices in there, just really a lot of lovely material. Yeah, and in
fact, most of the handouts and stuff are, you know, evolved into this book. So the
book is just a great, it's a few bucks on Amazon. Yeah, so one of the things I think
about is just going back to this idea of we, you know, wanting to have moments of
gladness, you know, enjoy in our lives. It's helpful to actually believe that we
deserve to have these experiences. Just starting with this, like, it's natural and
it's a good thing and it's good for me and I, I believe I, you know, I'm deserving
and I want to have moments of ease. I think if we orient our mind toward this
idea that this is natural and beautiful and a good thing, it helps us to
recognize that when it happens. And this again is kind of helping reorient the
mind away from just the negative. The mind has a negativity bias, a threat
bias. And so by creating this other thing that we value, we help the mind
orient toward it. It's helpful to know and recognize the absence of the
hindrances because then we also get to consciously, mindfully experience the joy
that arises when we're free from them. And the more we're aware with that and
allowing that, the more it strengthens our kind of the value that we can place
on them, on that freedom. It is, the more quickly we recognize them, the better, not
in some sort of evil way. But, you know, if the water's not totally boiling yet,
it's easier to deal with the pot, right, than it is if it's been roiling for a
long time. The energy builds with all of these hindrances. So, you know, being like,
yeah, I want to notice. I want to notice what's happening in my body. I want to
notice what's on in my mind. It's not that it's bad news. It's like, no, it's
really good to start to get to know these things. It's good to notice which ones
are your frequent visitors. Get to know them, maybe name them, give them a color,
you know, shape, size, help those, those kinds of things all help, help us sort of,
oh, that's familiar. That's, oh, yeah, that's what that is, right. It's also
helpful to notice, not just the pleasantness of their absence, but the
way that they negatively impact you. They end up, so maybe it's not the
beginning of the little desire that's a problem, but that it leads to then
overspending or over, you know, gaming or whatever it is for us that then leaves
us exhausted or depleted and we're not doing the other things that we wanted to
do with our time or spending time with the people we wanted to spend time with.
So helping us consciously connect, like, if I go ahead with the greed or go
ahead with this hating energy, initially there might be some thoughts of
pleasure around this or satisfaction, but then it feels like this and then this
happens and then this happens and I'm more likely to do this and then I'm more
likely to do that. So kind of playing the tape out, helping your mind think all
the way through if we just get caught in these energies where they're going to
lead potentially. And what that does is grows your wisdom, right? It helps you
not just get enamored in the moment. It's good to make changes in your daily life
to help protect yourself from the things that you know trigger the hindrances,
right, for you. What are the things that tend to trigger your hindrances? Media,
right, can be a big trigger. Shopping or overeating and these various things that
we can do, that we indulge in, can kind of be food for the hindrances, can
support their arising. The other thing that really helps is to actively
cultivate alternative mind states like contentment, like really practicing with
the idea that it's good enough. I don't have to make a go-way, I don't have to
make it better, it's good enough. Literally just really inviting yourself to just
sort of notice the niggling and go, you know what it's good enough, it's okay. It's
also, you know, yeah, I think the Brahma vahara is in general, so that's loving
kindness. Practice, are you familiar with that? Yeah, so it's another practice and
it's another talk and it's 8.59, but there are other qualities that are
considered very noble and sort of a, what is the word, I'm not thinking of the
word, but heavenly almost, right, and they're feeling and then generating a
loving kindness, their compassion, their sympathetic joy and its equanimity, those
are the four Brahma vaharas. So there's practices that support arising, those
kinds of mind states, and those are all protected mind states where we're pretty
much free from the hindrances when we're fully engaged. So there it is. Thank you
so much for your comments and questions that helped help me find some energy to
respond to you and focus. So I appreciate it. Yeah, thank you both, you guys. Yep,
and everybody out there, have a good night and may you be free from the
hindrances and may it be a benefit to you and everyone in your life. Thank you.
