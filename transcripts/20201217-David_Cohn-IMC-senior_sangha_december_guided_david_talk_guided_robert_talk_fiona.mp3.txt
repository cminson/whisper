The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
What I suggest is, as we're joining here, coming together, is you look around at these
faces, or one face, or two faces, and realizing that the person you're looking at wants to
be free, wants to be happy. That person has spiritual aspirations. Maybe that person wants
to live in awareness, wants to be kind, doesn't want to harm others, wants to be virtuous
in her or his interactions. Noticing this field of goodness, all this goodness, all these
faces have so much goodness. And now notice your own warmth at looking at these faces,
your own kindness as you look at these faces. And knowing too that you, just like them,
you would like to be free, you would like to live in awareness. You're kind, you're
nice, pretty much to everybody. Don't try not to hurt anybody. If you can find your own
square, look at your own square, look at you. What a nice person I'm looking at, what a
kind person makes lots of mistakes, but so what? So love ourselves, love that square.
If you can, sometimes it's hard to love ourselves, wish ourselves well, best wishes on your
journey. I hope you're free all day long today. I hope you're happy today. Okay, so let's
change. So if you could assume an alert posture, awake,
but more so comfortable, so that your body is at ease, your heart is at ease, your mind
is relaxed. And welcome yourself. Opening and widening your awareness.
So that it takes in your entire body, like the sky, touching, touching the back of your
torso, touching your hips, legs, and feet, letting the awareness wrap around your arms
and your hands, like warm hands holding your hands. A warm hand over your heart saying
it's okay. A warm hand touching the small of your back, allowing your heart to expand
and open your lower back and allowing your belly to relax and open. And a warm hands
cradling your head, softening your jaw, your eyes, cradling your head, touching your forehead,
softening your brain, and dropping back into the body.
And relaxing.
Welcome in yourself. You don't have to try here. You don't have to strive for anything.
It's okay with awareness. Awareness is like the bright sun in the sky, shining equally
on everything.
The sun shines on the west wall. And then the west wall is removed. So it shines on
the earth. And the earth is removed. It's a luminous sun that lights up the whole sky,
shines on the water, because ancients thought that water was everywhere.
And then the water was removed. And it shined on nothing.
Rumi said, return to the nowhere that you came from.
This awareness is empty.
Empty of me and mine. Empty of any possible reification.
Relax into this emptiness.
Some people call it a backdrop. A backdrop that's always here with us.
This nowhere that we come from.
At the same time, this awareness is luminous.
It does shine on many things. It knows many things.
It knows our body.
Everything that is known emerges from this emptiness.
Constantly emerging. Thoughts emerging. Feelings emerging.
All these manifestations, miraculous manifestations of awareness.
Empty yet luminous.
It shines on our judgments.
It shines on our comparisons, our measurements.
It emerges out of awareness and dissolves back into awareness.
We cling like waves that arise from the ocean.
And then it relaxes back into the ocean.
Everything is sacred.
Our judgments are sacred. Our clinging is sacred.
And relaxing into the body.
Allowing the heart to relax.
And being equally with everything that arises.
With whatever you're feeling right now.
Allowing whatever emerges to emerge and dissolve without judging.
Relax.
Into this non-judging field of awareness.
Without trying to create some special state that we reify.
Allowing all the manifestations of awareness.
The glorious manifestations.
It could be your own woundedness emerging.
Allow that.
Be kind to that.
It could be well-being emerging with the kindness.
Allow that.
If there are thoughts, allow thoughts. Be mindful of thoughts.
Disolve back into awareness.
This awareness has been compared to a jewel.
Sometimes the jewel is kind of buried.
Surrounded by mud.
But it's still a jewel.
Feeling your own intrinsic kindness.
Your own intrinsic maybe happiness.
There's some happiness here for you.
When some of the mud breaks off.
Without any effort.
Just falls off.
If judgments arise and the heart contracts.
Just give yourself a hug.
And relax back into this field.
Where there's peace.
There's some happiness here for you.
There's some happiness here for you.
There's some happiness here for you.
Thank you all for meditating.
And thank you for being here.
I'd like to break into small groups for a little while.
And maybe 10 minutes.
And share how you are.
How your practice is going.
And this is a kind of a complicated time right now with the shelter in place and the holidays.
So maybe a discussion prompt might be something like,
How is your practice helping you now?
And I don't mean, you know, I've been on this retreat or I sit with Gil every morning or inside.
How is it for you inside?
Okay.
So Chris, can you send them off?
Send them off.
Okay, so I think most of us are back now.
So how was it?
You could help us all by sharing what was discussed in your group about how your,
how your practice has been benefiting you during this complicated time.
We'd love to hear from you.
Please.
Well, I thought that was lovely being with these three other people and sharing being human.
Which is, which is not easy.
I bet we can all agree on that one.
And that being able to meet those say the judges that come up in our minds and the measurements and just be able to see them as thoughts.
Don't have to rule us.
They seem to. And we talked about the predicament of having the goal of having no goals.
Even that, you know, then we make a goal of that.
And the suffering can ensue.
But just a joy to be with everybody.
And drink each other in this form. I never thought that that that I would appreciate something so electronic as zoom.
It's all in us to commune together and I'm grateful and I really liked that guide and meditation.
David, thank you so much.
Thank you, Kale.
Someone else, please unmute yourself.
This is Carol. I'm on a phone and it's really different.
So I don't have my computer.
We all decided we all felt that things were definitely more difficult as time moves on.
And I think we were all living alone and kind of dealing with that.
And we did find practice has been a support, at least a couple of us did that.
And also just the importance of allowing ourselves to feel whatever is there and is.
And kind of and meet it with compassion and care seems to be very helpful these days.
Thank you, Carol.
We talked or I talked a little bit about I enjoyed the guided meditation to and kind of reluctantly was able to slip into a sense of peacefulness that was delightful.
And what I noticed about these times is that I just seem not to be able to get there on my own. So I've, you know, I listen to Gil every weekday morning and sometimes I get there and sometimes I don't but it's.
I feel like the guided meditation is, is, I don't know if it's a crutch or it's just something that helps me with the overriding anxiety about COVID and the state of the country.
Thank you, Lorna, being in touch with our own kindness can be such a support so that whatever comes up. I mean, we fight with ourselves. We fight with our thinking minds.
We fight we fight with our contractions with our with our clinging we judge ourselves and so just kindness kindness is as is as wide and spacious and always here always here.
It is who we are this kindness and this illumination is always it is who we are that's all we are this illuminated empty kindness so just relaxing back into that and whatever happens is fine.
And the judgments, even being kind. Okay, hi judgment.
We talked in our group about how nature has helped us being in contact with nature has helped us since all of us are in isolation and so I thought I could share a view beautiful items that I saw this morning.
I love to get up around sunrise and go for a walk. And we, I, yesterday, I actually had gotten the text from someone at who was doing your work at IMC so I went down and helped sweep leaves and it also it felt really good to connect with someone.
I mean, we were both masked and socially distanced, and then we also got a chance to chat briefly with Gil when he came out so we, we miss three of us in our group are would always meet at groups at IMC so we miss that physical connection but in a way I feel like, you know,
you know, with zoom with nature with the various singing groups that I'm involved with that, I feel like my heart is expanding out. And I also do feel that I am helped a lot by guided meditations because I can have a very active mind and so for me it's a lot more challenging to do sitting meditation on my own.
Thank you, Gloria. I, I just want to mention that we do have small groups too. So some of you are new. You may want to join a small group and we do have guided meditations every small group meeting they meet every two weeks.
Just let's write to the senior song website. And I just want to say, Gloria, I know how much you appreciate nature and I do too. And I was on a walk today and I was seeing everything as not out there, but as a manifestation of this as a magnificent sacred
manifestation of this awareness. And how could it be otherwise, it's all taken in with this one awareness.
And the flower you showed, flowers are appearing all the time, flowers are appearing in our hearts, in our thinking, all manifestations of awareness. So if we can, you know, really see things, understand these qualities of awareness that are always here.
This, the quality of the backdrop that we are coming from nowhere. We are empty. And we're manifesting everything, everything is being manifested out of the sun, the sky of awareness. And that can help settle us.
And it's true. It's not, that's not contrived. That is true. We can experience that.
So thank you all for your, for your sharing. And thank you all for everything. Thank you all for being here. So wonderful to you all and have this wonderful song. It's so supportive.
So let's take a five minute break. And after the break, Professor Acusik will bless us with his great wisdom. And, and when, when he, when Robert is done, then we'll hear the beautiful words of Fiona.
So please come back after the break, five minutes. So if you could just make it kind of brief. Any time, Robert, I think most people are back.
Is everyone back? Pretty much. Yeah, I think so. Pretty much. Okay, everyone. So I'm going to put it on gallery view and it's very nice to be here with all of you again.
I've been trying to recall how long this senior sangha has been going, but I think we're almost at a year, if not more now, which was just an idea and that came out of emptiness.
And look at what we've manifested here. So it's really nice to be here with all of you. And I know that it's not easy to, especially for some of us as we're getting older to weather this pandemic with the degree of social isolation that it's imposed on so many of us.
So people look for ways to, to deal with it and everybody finds their own way to deal with it or not to deal with it.
So I really want to say that I'm ready to hire David to come and teach my compassion course, because he's talking about kindness and goodness and resting in these qualities and it's a beautiful, it's a beautiful practice to try and cultivate.
And I want to follow up a little bit on what he was talking about in this first part of the, or this first hour and talk a little bit more about awareness, touching awareness, resting in awareness, recognizing the quality of awareness.
So I was listening to a talk recently that Joseph Goldstein had given at some point or another, and don't know when he gave it or I can't even remember what the talk was titled.
But he was speaking to the topic of reality, relative reality and absolute reality. So those are obviously big, deep topics. And he was talking about how, how these two levels of reality, if we want to talk about it in that way actually work together.
And in the context of that talk, he suggested that compassion is perceived in two different ways. And in the relative sense, he described it as a natural response to suffering.
To mental suffering, physical suffering or to mental suffering that we and everyone else in the world goes through.
So we know that when we are aware of suffering within ourselves or in the environments or the world around us, that the heart will respond with a sense of caring and a sense of wanting to actually engage in some way to alleviate that suffering.
But he goes on to say that compassion actually operates on another level, which is when people begin to awaken.
And I'm guessing he's talking about people who have spiritual practices and actually pay attention at a deeper level when people begin to awaken even for just a little bit to the fact that we're basically living in a dream.
He suggests that we can have compassion for those who don't know that they're dreaming.
You can have compassion for people who are really just lost.
So I don't know what you think about that. I have an idea what I think. I'd like you to just pause for a moment and think how that lands for you.
Relative compassion and then compassion that emerges from a place of seeing the human condition and how we are caught in it.
So what I'd like to do is maybe just go through a little experiment with you and then I might not actually put you in a breakout room.
I might open it up to a general type of facilitated discussion.
So this is what I have in mind. So I'd like to invite you to close your eyes if you're comfortable doing so.
And I want you to slowly just begin to relax into this sense of turning inward.
Just the sense of letting go of the external input that we live with normally and allow your awareness to slowly, slowly scan throughout your own body.
You may notice that your perception of body of body itself.
It moves and shifts.
At one moment, the focus may be centered in the area of your head.
In another moment, it may be centered in the area of your heart.
Or you may be perceiving your limbs.
It's possible for you to consciously direct your attention to your index finger.
Or to your left ear.
Or to your nose.
Simply notice the quality of awareness of wherever attention is directed, whether it's your finger, your ear, your nose.
Or a general region of your body.
And notice, as you explore your own body in this very, very simple and straightforward way, that you also may naturally begin to embody the felt experience of form.
Knowing the quality of form, a head, or a hand or a leg.
Perceiving a leg as form, a head is form.
Notice as you're scanning your own body and noticing the form of head or leg or hand, the form that's so familiar to you, that you may naturally think it's your head or your hand or your leg.
And if it's not your form, then who's is it?
So just be with that question for a few moments without trying to answer it.
Without making the mental effort it takes to think what the answer might be.
Simply rest in the quality that knows the perception of body.
That head, hand, leg form itself.
Notice the mind that takes ownership of all of that.
Period.
Don't think about it.
There is a knowing that's going on.
And it's available to every one of us.
So see if you can rest into the quality of awareness that knows body, form, sensations.
That recognizes pleasant and unpleasant pain and pleasure.
The knowing quality that is aware of all that but is not affected by what is being known.
Seeing the world through the lens of our limited perceptions as being true,
is really a little like banging our heads against the wall all the while pretending the wall's not there.
So explore, investigate the feeling right now of the wanting mind that's so reactive,
that wants to understand, that wants to take ownership.
There's a teaching from the Buddha that our bodies can be afflicted, can be painful,
and the mind can be unafflicted.
So I personally find this a very challenging teaching,
but it does at least give me the opportunity to investigate the nature of knowing, of awareness itself.
We can practice, but it's like to recognize and be with a mind that's non-reactive to wanting or not wanting.
You can learn to practice resting in this quality of knowing.
And as we do, Joseph suggests that the knowing is the same even if the body is afflicted and the mind is unafflicted.
The knowing is not in any way affected by what is being known.
So for the last few minutes of this sort of prompted exercise or guided meditation,
I want you to explore the feeling, the familiar feeling of the wanting mind, just the quality of it.
It's not important what it wants, it's just what does the wanting mind feel like, wanting to understand, wanting to be.
So notice how it feels just as you can move your attention from your head to your hand to your leg.
I want you to now notice how it feels, the quality of the actual experience when the mind is free from wanting.
When the mind lets go of needing things to be the way it wants, it simply allows relaxation.
And the purpose of this exercise that I'm leading you through is to bring you to this very point, to this very prompt,
where I'd like to ask you to explore or investigate or notice how it actually feels when you allow knowing and when knowing is not there.
I'll say it in another way. Notice what it feels like when you're present with yourself and experience, experiencing knowing
and simply notice the quality of when that experience isn't there any longer.
And whenever you're ready, you can open your eyes.
So I hope that exercise, you were able to stay with that.
And rather than opening it up the way I intended, we do have 15 minutes so we could break into the breakout room, which I'm going to ask Chris if you would set the break up rooms up again.
And the prompt I would like to give you is how do these two levels of knowing work together in your own experience and does it make a difference to you, whether you live in the world of presence or otherwise.
So how do these two levels work? Does it make a difference to you? And the last one is, if you were dying at this very moment, would that question be important?
And you can choose to explore any of those or anything else that the guided meditation may have stirred up in you.
Claire? Yes? Okay. And we'll bring you back in about maybe about eight minutes so that we have a little bit of time to do a full group debrief and then Fiona will begin at 12.30.
Would you begin your sharing because other people weren't back in the room yet?
Oh, and this and well, I can give you a person to go to who just did a interesting talk about it. This goes back, I don't want to take all the time. So I'll just say that by connecting with the various divine attributes that are taught in Kabbalah, Kabbalah, and putting them with each body part.
It gives it another layer of meaning.
Okay.
But I really liked the process that you just took us through.
I don't know anything about what you're referencing. So I can't really comment on it, but there are many, many roads to Rome. That's the thing that I've learned the older I get. There is no one way to find truth or freedom or kindness or happiness or, you know, emptiness.
We each have our own path to walk and we're each our own teacher.
So I'd like to welcome any any shareings that you would be willing to offer to the group just as a way to as a gift to one another.
And since since this quality of knowing is available to all of us, and whether we are conscious of touching that, we all do touch it frequently.
And sometimes we're aware of it and sometimes we're not.
It has this quality for me, I'll just say maybe to prime the pump. It has this quality of spaciousness of letting go of. It's a sense of, you know, maybe I don't know exactly what's going on there, but it is really a place where there's not a sense of trying or pushing
and so it has a quality of freedom.
And it's not disturbed.
What is what is it like for other people?
Because basically what we're talking about is awareness itself.
For me, I started out with something that was a clinging and unpleasant and I had an ache in my heart and an ache in my belly.
And when I removed my mind's knowing from that experience, the aching disappeared.
It reminded me that wherever I put my attention, that becomes more real.
Thank you, Trudy.
Thank you.
And being able to, usually when I do body scan, I'll start in my feet and just go, you know, it'll be very ordered, orderly, going through, you know, my body parts and kind of like the experience of moving to different places.
And, you know, so that my awareness went to that place and then seeing the form of it, I guess, and, you know, so like I might have been with my leg, but then I was with my shoulder.
And they're all connected anyway. It just was a different experience.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's amazing how we just think shoulder or leg or hand or something.
And then we recognize that there's a knowing of form itself.
See, and you begin to just rest into this quality of there's so much going on. And we are just part of this dynamic unfolding experience.
And that that which knows isn't affected by what is being known.
But where does where does what happens when, when our attention gets pulled into, into stories and so on.
So there's no, I didn't do this exercise with you folks to like, prove something I just wanted.
I just wanted, because I've been working with this in my own practice, coming to a place of recognizing what it's like to know and what it's like when I don't know.
See, what it's like when I'm present with myself and what it's like when I'm upset about something or triggered by something.
And in being able to be with those experiences.
I'm more able to investigate further what the nature of those two qualities of awareness are like.
And it allows deeper and deeper resting.
And for me, it's, it's resting in the, in the not knowing and not being so impatient that I have to move out of that and, and cognize some truth that is just a made up perception.
So I get to see it deeper and deeper levels, what freedom is like, it's freedom from all that stress of trying and creating.
And simple, I mean, in our day to day experience, we can, we can explore these things at profoundly deep levels.
It doesn't have to be like some, you know, major event that makes us stop and think about these things, we can simply notice what it's like when we scan our body and take ownership.
So, okay, well, I hope it was a useful exercise for you. I can't tell because everyone's being so quiet, but I know it's a big, it's a big topic.
But since David was talking about awareness, I wanted to just maybe share how awareness isn't as big of a topic as some people think about it, that we can, we can touch awareness.
When we pause and just start to pay attention for a few moments.
So, I hope that you all can rest in awareness more and more often and that you can all touch that place of freedom, because it's yours and you're the only one that can claim it for yourself.
So, I wish you to be well and happy and safe during these really uncertain times.
And into practice with, with awareness, what it's what it's like for you when you're with fear and when, when you're free from it or when you're with boredom and you're free from it.
So, so with that, I want to turn, turn this over to Fiona, and she has some thoughts to share with us.
And, and I thank all of you for, for being here and being part of this really wonderful community that grew out of an idea in David's heart and mind.
So, thank you all.
Thank you. I would like in the future, I don't know if you'd want to, but I'd really like to explore going through dealing with various distress so it could be fear and going to depth with it from our perspective of insight.
Sure. So, so we don't have time to do that. No, but I also want to mention that in a larger group to take, take that on could be really a little bit.
You have to be careful when you're doing that because people can touch trauma.
They can, anything we've simply want to. Yeah, I understand proceed cautiously. Thank you again, Fiona.
Thank you. Thank you, Susan.
So, let's see.
I guess.
I'm trying to get on. Can you hear me?
Yes.
Well, I feel, I'm sure many of you, this wonderful teachings for the last hour and a half and the sharing on awareness, both expansive and looking at how we know.
Um,
I was going to share, so I hope this is not too great a departure from this topic.
For me, last month I had mentioned, you know, my looking at the coming of the dark, the longer nights, the shorter days and at the time it felt for me, somewhat oppressive, onerous, it's just challenging.
And, but we are a few days away from the solstice and that has been over the last decade became more and more important a celebration that I would share with my husband.
We didn't have our son at home, no children.
We're no longer working at the Episcopal Church that we had worked at for 20 years where we would, as the token Buddhists, we would rev up and make everyone happy and enjoys the celebratory and busy.
And so the solstice became really this deep precious time of acknowledging the dark and looking to the light.
And I was thinking about this in my own memories, childhood memories, the light.
My, my background is my dad was Norwegian.
And so the, the holiday with Santa Lucia, which was the, this beautiful little child bringing light candle, her wreath of light, you know, coming to bring light so she could bring food to the starving children.
And Advent, I'd mentioned again, in my background, it was the four Sundays before Christmas, kept lighting a new candle, a big, so each week there was more, more light.
And then on Christmas Eve, my mother, our big deal was to have ice cream with a little candle in it.
The lights would go out and in Scandinavia, there's this chimes with the candles.
You'd light the candles and the chimes would ring and all the lights would be out and it was magical, this, you know, so with all the things about gifts and busyness, what I remember the most is these moments of light in the darkness.
And I, I think I shared with you a few months ago, I have this muse on Insight Timer, this fellow named Ben, a truck driver in Alberta, Canada, who, who shares his inspiration, he's the, the poet truck driver for me.
And last March, he shared this long entry about, this is when COVID first came to Canada in the shutdown.
And he was out putting his garbage out and his neighbor had, they were talking from a distance about their fear, you know, it was this long winter, it was coming into spring, and COVID had hit.
And I want to share something that he, in his conversation with his neighbor.
I promise him, his neighbor says he's afraid.
I promise him that we will both die.
There is a strange sense of relief in this simple and undeniable truth.
We shift to experience. It is a beautiful day.
While our cool world is still buried, buried under two feet of snow, the promise of spring is in the air.
Even at minus five degrees, the sun is warm on our faces.
He agrees that today is a great day to be alive.
He seems comforted with a reminder that a moment ago in his worry about tomorrow, he was missing out on the majesty of today.
He was grateful to be brought back to the experience of here now, without those specific words.
We turn to enter our respective homes for dinner, and he thanks me. He tells me he's relieved, inspired, inspired to experience a moment.
What else can there be?
This was back in March.
So, in December, in the meantime, he's lost his father-in-law in a nursing home, and he's still trucking, delivering on these lonely roads in Canada.
And he says, still, I have a light to offer and a smile to give.
It seems so little, yet it's all I have. Even this previously natural response to the world takes tremendous effort some days.
And he shares with one of the persons he delivers to that thinks, well, it's not COVID isn't that bad, only the old people die.
And he listens, and he goes away. He leaves his customer.
And he says, I see and acknowledge my own fear.
He says, I fear not having enough light to give, that I'll run out of smiles, as if it's my light that I'm passing along, as if it's my light that I'm passing along, and that it will run out.
And I see the dark corners of my heart whispering to me, you better hang on to it.
But not today. Today I will spread light everywhere I can.
And later in the morning, I visit the Christmas tree that I've decorated out in the woods.
Another string of lights has been removed.
Someone has received it. And I simply replace it in wonder again, how long can I keep this up?
And then, together, we will reflect this light, if I keep, keep touching in, even into the dark corners of my own heart.
The sun sets and a bright moon rises.
It's as if neither has a care about the drama of humanity, of life and death. They just shine, because that is what they do.
Let us continue to shine, because that is what we can do.
I am so touched by my poet truck driver in Canada.
And a few days later, he wrote,
Every day for the first few days after decorating this tree in my favorite woods, I visit it only to find something's missing.
One day it's ornaments, then a string of beads, then a string of lights.
Just when I start to lose faith and question, what am I doing?
I show up to find some chocolate, candy canes, a candle, and an angel figurine at the base of this great giving tree.
And my faith has been restored.
I think about that inspiration when I was a little girl.
Just the light. I hardly remember the presence of Christmas.
What I remember is the magic of this light.
And Gil the other day, when he was teaching on the Brahmapiharas and started out with Meta,
he was talking about this touching into this inner quality through awareness of touching into this light of awareness.
And I think he even used the word this quality of love in looking at everything right here in this quiet mind,
that there is light and there can be this deep natural quality of love.
And sort of this Robert was talking about the outer and the inner awareness and this touching on the outer light is a reflection I deeply resonate with is reflecting this inner light beneath personality, beneath anxiety, thoughts, worries,
the fear that my truck driver expresses.
There's something so at home and so familiar. David was talking about, you know, this awareness that's just here.
Someone quoted Thich Nhat Hanh the other day that everything is important.
Everything is worth our awareness, our attention is precious.
And if we can relax into that, just be present.
What a gift.
Last month, I shared this picture with a copy of a copy of a copy.
It's called Winter Solstice and I actually found it and I treated myself to get the Jigle print of it.
It's a children's illustration and I'm going to hold it up again.
It's called Solstice and the outside world is very dark, beautiful stars, but it's dark and inside there's this rest and light going deep within and touching into this light within.
And trusting the safety and the inspiration that our deepest heart, our deepest knowing can guide and support us in the dark.
We don't quite have time for small groups and I think this time of shorter days and longer nights,
maybe if people just want to share their memories or their experience of outer or inner light at this time of year, I think it's important to acknowledge
what is moving our hearts, what warms our hearts, what is an expression of our deepest love and our deepest knowing.
I'd like to go.
Thank you, Abraham.
Yeah, when I was a kid and I was raised in the Christian tradition, there was a lot of choirs and I sang a lot and beautiful, beautiful harmonies and sacred music always indicated light to me and because it wasn't a choir, I was sharing it with others.
So that's a very dear memory for me. So when I look at it now and I see how dark it is in the morning on a more internal level, it's a great time to meditate and there's a lot of light in the meditating in the darkness.
There's a book was introduced to me and I just love the title. It's by a Zen teacher, The Light Inside the Dark. I love that.
May I share?
I have been taking quite a few walks right at sunset, right around sunset and I have been just feeling wonderful and I've always liked, you know, since I've moved to the Portland, Oregon area, seeing light in the darkness with all the decorations on people's houses.
Right now I really feel like they are, like I'm receiving their loving kindness by sharing, like these lights are outside to share with everybody and we've never put up lights outside and we have ours up too now.
I just feel happy to turn that on and to share that blessing of light.
Yeah, thank you.
And for me, coming from Jewish roots, this is our last night of the Hanukkah celebration and all eight candles will be lit and it's a joyous way of celebrating the solstice and everything else.
So they're my candle arbor, my menorah will be in the middle of my kitchen, my dining table, and there'll be a little lights all around the inside of my house and these electric remote control candles.
And that's, to me, that's such a way of celebrating the season. So thanks, Fiona, this was a beautiful closure to our time together and a reminder of what we have to be grateful for.
Thank you.
So those lines in cell also be kindling the Hanukkah lights, and it's the eighth night in which we celebrate the ability to be who we are and practice our own religious paths, spiritual paths.
We light the lights at our house, we always think of sending a brighter life in every respect to everyone in the world, so that the candles are extending their light from us out into the world.
So we always have that thought in mind, and the light symbolizes so much for us, as well as dispelling the darkness.
Thank you, thank you.
From where I'm sitting I have a large picture window that looks out on an enormous liquid amber tree, which is always the last one in the neighborhood to lose its leaves so it is still full of golden, golden leaves and the sun is streaming through it,
and the wind is blowing, and when David gave us our first meditation, this time I kept my eyes open and I just watched the sunlight streaming through this wave of golden leaves, and it was so sweet and calming.
Thank you, thank you.
Hi, I have a tradition that I sometimes do with some friends at solstice time, we make a labyrinth out of little tea lights, and we walk the labyrinth to the center, and at the center we say a prayer for ourselves and a blessing for the world.
And I'm sitting here in Edinburgh just now and there's a tremendous gale outside, and I find myself getting anxious, oh I can't do it because the tea lights will get blown out, and what will happen, and I'm doing it on my own.
And I felt this kind of wave of anxiety and then I thought, well I thought, whether the lights are lit and stay lit, or they're not lit and they're blown out, it doesn't really matter whether the light is visible or the light is invisible, the light is there anyway.
And I found that tremendous, it was just like, oh right, so let it be.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Speaking of a labyrinth, I was part of Hillary Morrison's Women's Circle of Mindfulness that helped restore a labyrinth up on a hillside that looked down towards the bay.
And a week ago, I was out there, right, as the sun was rising and there were, there were pink clouds above, and above me, a brilliant, tiny crescent of the waning moon, and one young man who was very mindfully, slowly walking the labyrinth.
It was just him and me. It was wonderful.
Wow.
Thank you for these thoughts, Fiona.
Oh, thank you. Thank you all. I am deeply touched by the teachings here and your presence and your practice.
And I love sort of touching into this image of the outer light and the inner light and really trusting this journey, trusting this journey.
This practice.
So, thank you deeply. Thank you for your presence here, for your spirit, and your courage to look, to look deeply.
And thank you, Robert. Thank you, David.
And may you have a really blessed month until we meet again as a group.
So, with much care to you all.
Thank you, Fiona. Goodbye, everyone. Happy holidays. Be safe. Be well.
Yes.
Bye, everyone.
Bye for your life.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
You all. So nice to see everyone.
Yeah.
Yes.
Bye.
Be well and safe. Be well.
