Practice Notes: Where Our Attention 
Goes

One of the very interesting and useful areas of 
mindfulness is being aware of and exploring how our 
attention operates, how our awareness is used, or how 
we use it. Do we use it? Is it used by other things 
besides our self -conscious deliberateness?  If there ’s a 
really loud noise outside, probably your attention goes 
there without much choice – it just goes there. But then , 
if you ’re left to your own devices, with not much stimulus 
is coming in, where does your attention go then? And if 
you receive meditation instructions, then maybe it would 
go to the breath. So you then you choose to go to and 
pay attention to the breath. But if yo u have, somehow or 
other, gotten the message that your personal problems 
are really important and significant, then part of your 
attention is going to go to your personal problems, not 
the breath.  
 
If you ’ve heard teachings that in meditation, something 
is supposed to happen – you’re suppo sed to get calm or 
concentrated – then part of your attention is looking out 
for the calm and the concentration, and you might actually be doing two things, focussing  on the breath, or 
looking for the meditative effects happening. Or you 
might be so caught up in the meditative effects that this 
is really what you ’re doing. You ’re searching for those, 
scanning those, and occasionally checking in with the 
breath. Or it m ight be that your mind has a mind of it s 
own and thinks that some fantasy is really compelling, 
and so your mind goes into the fantasy; that ’s where 
your attention goes.  
 
How much of your attention is deliberate? How much 
are you in charge of it, and you a pply it? How much of it 
is influenced by things you ’ve learned, things you ’ve 
been taught, ideas, values you have, things that you 
want to have happen? So your attention is ki nd of going 
in that direction. The last thing is how much is attention? 
When you ’re doing meditation, for example, it ’s a great 
place to study this. How much is attention , if you allow 
it, if you don ’t let it go into other times and places and 
things out side of yourself  and you relax?  
 
Is there a place within, like a center of gravity , where 
attention just wants to go and collect itself? What is 
attention itself? Where is it drawn or pulled into? Or 
where does it settle? Is there a place that feels very 
intimate and close, where your attention wants to go, if 
you allow the attention to  go into that intimacy?  
 It’s kind of like water:  if you leave it alone on a hillside, it 
will roll down the hill. But if you put up a dam, it will 
block it. Or if you put in various kinds of barriers, you 
can direct the water to go left and right and diff erent 
ways. But what happens if you just remove all the dams, 
and let the water just flow down hill? Where does it 
finally settle? Where does your awareness, attention, 
settle if you allow it to go into some place that ’s intimate, 
or some place that ’s close  in, or close at hand?  
 
What you do with your attention, how attention is used, 
how it operates, are really fascinating and important 
issues in practice. And becoming a little more sensitive 
to it can help you use the attention much more wisely, 
and will s upport you in this practice that we have here.
