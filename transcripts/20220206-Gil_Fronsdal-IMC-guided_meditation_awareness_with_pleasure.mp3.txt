 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome to our first time back after our latest pandemic pause. So those of you who are here, welcome. It's very nice to be together. It's actually, I think I underappreciated how valuable it was to be together as community. I mean, I always valued it. So two years ago, I would have said, of course it's valuable. But now I feel it's a whole different dimension of value and just sharing and being together. There's something almost like, like if you're thirsty and you drink some refreshing water, oh, that feels good. There's a whole feeling of being a community that I get now that something I didn't know needed to be satisfied or get satiated or something. So welcome back. And for those of you online, welcome back. And know that there's about 25 people here at IMC. And so I'll have both of people here in my mind and also all of you online. So for the meditation today, I want to offer a variation or a dimension of this mindfulness practice. I think it's a relatively common human phenomena to get preoccupied with something and to be fixated on something, be concerned with something. And they say that some of us have negative biases. So sometimes we get focused on what's negative or difficult or off or something. And sometimes when we hear the meditation instruction, like just focus on your breathing, some people translate that to themselves, oh, this is another time I'm supposed to be fixated, narrowly focused on something, just be with that. And then there's this tension between being narrowly focused because it's effort to do that and the mind wants to wander away or something. So there's an art to not having the meditative attention fixated, to not translate one-pointedness to holding the attention tight on something like the breathing, but rather to have the attention, to have a softness to it, a floating quality to it, that allows you to take in the wider context of what's happening. So it would be a little bit like if you're walking in a park with a friend, you're involved in the conversation with a friend, that's the focus of attention, you would say, the center of gravity of attention. But you're also taking in the park as you walk because you have to make sure you don't step on a rock or on a branch that's fallen, and you don't even think about it, but you're synchronized so you come to a curve in the path, you both curve around together. So you're taking in the wider context, maybe even the niceness of it, the beautiful greenery, the peacefulness of it, and it just feels good not taking in, the kind of being relaxed or something inspired by the park setting, as opposed to walking next to the freeway on the shoulder with your friend, the car is rushing by, it would be very different, right? So this ability to kind of take in the peripheral context of the situation, it can be very helpful for meditation. So as you're focusing on the breathing, it's not just important to stay with the breath, but in a relaxed way, almost like you're opening attention up, you're also taking in the wider context of you sitting there. And one of those contexts is that which is going well, that which feels pleasant, where there's some sense of ease. And the chances are that somewhere in the field, in your field of attention, in your body, in your mind, there's probably something that feels pleasant and enjoyable about sitting quietly here. What might be loud is that something that's not enjoyable, not pleasant. Can you be open enough in your attention not to deny anything that's unpleasant, anything that's difficult, but to be wide enough, you can also include what is pleasant, what's an easeful, what's enjoyable about it all. So if you're focusing on the breathing, relaxed, soft attention of the breathing, kind of like you're resting on the breathing, but without working at it too much, just kind of gently open. And there's some kind of embodied context for breathing that feels nice, that feels good. It feels pleasant or easeful, or even if it might feel, you feel lousy today. We're not denying you're lousy, feeling lousy, not you. I'm denying you're lousy, but that you might feel lousy. Does that make some sense? Those of you here are nodding, good. So let's try that a little bit. So assuming a meditation posture, in a way that feels nice for you, can you adjust your posture so that it feels nice to be in your body? Some of you it might help to relax something. Some of you it might mean sitting up straighter, sitting up in a way that feels more confident. And then as if you're going to enjoy yourself doing it, slowly, luxuriously, take a few long, slow, deep breaths. Maybe exhaling in a way that feels enjoyable or pleasant. Maybe part of the enjoyment is as you exhale to relax your body. And then letting your breathing return to normal. Perhaps you can continue relaxing on the exhale. But if you're able to soften or relax some muscles, take the time to feel the pleasure of that, the goodness of that. Relaxing the muscles of your face. If you can soften your shoulders. Does anything in that softening feel pleasant? On the exhale, relaxing the belly. And perhaps on the exhale, a global relaxation of your body. And then sitting here quietly, notice if there's any pleasure, global pleasure or pleasantness that resides in your body. Even if parts of you feel uncomfortable, maybe there's a subtle, global feeling of aliveness, awareness in the body, a tingling or vibration that has a kind of subtle pleasure to it. Maybe it's a kind of global or maybe it's very specific. Sometimes it can be just simple as a feeling of pleasure with the lips touching, especially if you make a little half smile. And for a few moments, let your global awareness float around your body, touching into wherever in the body it feels comfortable or feels pleasure, pleasant. Or where there's a sense of ease. Not so much looking for it, but it's just allowing it to, your attention to float and settle, float and touch in, randomly, wherever it goes. And letting that be the peripheral attention, center the awareness on the sensations of the body breathing. Almost as if the breathing body is like a wave in a vast ocean that goes up and down. But the wave is part of this larger ocean. So the breathing, the sensations of breathing in and out are part of this wider global experience of the body. And is there some way that you can help the attention be enjoyable, a soft floating awareness that floats along with the comings and goings of the breath, not fixating an attention which is receptive. Loose awareness. That part of the peripheral awareness is a very simple pleasure of being aware. And as you focus on your breathing, the central focus, the center of focus is breathing. And all around it, peripheral awareness supports you with a feeling of pleasure, pleasantness, however subtle it might be. Shining happiness, What's your name? I'm so sorry. I was just trying to be honest with you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for the pain. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for the pain. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for the pain. ah ah ah ah ah If you're wondering off in thought, if you quiet your thinking mind, and you feel better the pleasure of being present here, and have that pleasure support the attention resting when breathing in. If you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought. If you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if you're wondering off in thought, if something within you is a little bit calmer or settled, then when you started meditating, perhaps you can feel the pleasantness of that calm or subtleness. No matter how subtle it is, and gently breathe with it, breathe through it. And then from with whatever is pleasant, enjoyable, or has a feeling of rightness within you, from that place turning your attention outwards to those of you here, to the people sitting in this room, to the people online, to the others who are sitting online meditating now. And see if there's a simple way to consider the people around you in the context of your pleasant feeling, perhaps wishing for them some of the same pleasantness, calmness, ease that you're experiencing now or that you have experienced in the past. And to end this meditation with the aspiration, the wish for the welfare of others, may all beings be happy, may all beings be safe, may all beings be peaceful, and may all beings be free.
