It is my honor tonight to be able to introduce our speaker, Ajan Tania.
And I would like to, as an introduction to that, just tell you a little bit about a new
foundation that has been formed, the Sara Naloka Foundation, which will be a nonprofit eventually,
with the intention that it will help to bring the nuns in Ajan Chah's tradition to America
to teach, and hopefully at some point to maybe have a center here where they could live and
people could go and visit and stay.
So Sara Naloka is brand new, and if you have any questions about that, Brenda, who's sitting
right over there, or I could answer your questions at the end, we do intend this year, next year
in 2007, to bring two of the nuns to America to teach across the U.S., and so that will
be the first teaching tour that we'll sponsor.
So tonight, it's very exciting for us because we haven't had one of the nuns in the tradition
here for many years.
Some of you may have been familiar with Ajan Sundara, who taught here a number of times
a few years back.
So tonight, we have Ajan Tania, and Ajan Tania has been a nun for 16 years, and is the senior
nun at Chithurst Monastery, or Chituviyueka Monastery, actually, in Chithurst.
I just learned that tonight.
She was born in New Zealand and has practiced for a number of years with a meditation group
closely affiliated with Lungpur Cha and the Thai Forest tradition.
This is the same tradition that Ajan Amaro is with, if those of you who have heard Ajan
Amaro speak here also.
In 1990, she went to England to join the monastic community there, and she is in America this
year to teach with Ajan Amaro a Thanksgiving monastic retreat in Santa Rosa that's happening
starting next Friday, so while she was visiting us, we invited her to come and speak here tonight
and be with us.
So it's a great honor to have you with us, and as Maureen said before, we're going to
do something slightly different tonight, and so this will be wonderful for all of us.
So you can go ahead and ring the bell and take off here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just checking the tone.
So talking with a few of the people here tonight, we just were talking what I might
like to offer to your spiritual space, and it seemed that you might enjoy actually just
participating in some of the traditional chanting we do, and then meditation.
I could give some short reflection and then some question and answers.
So realizing for some of you who haven't had much experience of the monastic community,
the Tiruvannamunasic community, I thought just to bring some of the aspects of our life,
of our practice, so part of what rounds out the kind of formal meditation.
So things like chanting or recollections.
So we thought to do something that's actually quite straightforward, is this chant I've
written up here, and we'll do it, it's just like a round, yes, it's repetitive.
It's in the traditional language of the Tiruvannamunasic scriptures in Pali, which is like a common
form of Sanskrit.
So essentially for those of you that are newish even to the concepts of the Buddha,
Dharma and Sankha, what we're chanting is, to the Buddha I go for refuge, giving my life
to realize Nibbana, and you can take Buddha as a kind of historical figure, but it's more
helpful to think of Buddha as this aspect that we all have that can actually be awake,
kind of knowing quality of the mind, the sense of the knowing.
So that is a place of refuge, there's the ability of the mind to know or be awake,
and then the Dharma is the way things are, so we're taking refuge in the immediacy of
the present moment, and the Sangha is this embodied activity, so we can see it as people
are just a simple act of waking up to the present moment, to the way things are, and
this is where freedom is and true possibility is, so it's a sense of just letting that sense
of taking refuge or taking shelter in this possibility, so we chant it and let it really
just start to infuse the body-mind, it's a recollection, and it's an ongoing contemplation
to know what this really means, what it feels like and the possibility it gives, so you
don't really have to understand it really, you just let the thing do you, so I'll just
chant it and what we keep doing is coming through what would say the three jewels or
the three refuges, and you join in when you feel confident, my approach to chanting is
you just chant, come from your heart and the sound doesn't matter, if you keep chanting
you get this sense of entrainment, they say in drumming circles where the thing just comes
together after a while, the art of it is just to keep relaxing, not worrying too much about
the sound and letting the heart bring it into tune, so the words are a bit foreign I recognise
but for some of you they'll be familiar in the sense that they've got the most of the
traditional refuge words in there that you may be familiar with, bodhung, saranang, gitarmi,
to the border I go for refuge, so this is really to the border I go for refuge giving
my life to Elias Nibbana, so the sense that we really dedicate ourselves to waking up
in the present moment freeing the mind from selfishness, coming out of confusion, so
we'll chant and you just join in, we'll chant the English first so you just hear it and
then we'll go into the Pali, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana,
to the Dhamma I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the Dhamma I go for
refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana,
to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for
refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to
Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life
to Elias Nibbana, to the border I go for refuge, giving my life to Elias Nibbana, to the border
huge quality of that. So letting the chanting, letting be here, just sweep away any thoughts
of what the day is held, what your life is held really, and any movement into the future.
We just set the mind rest here in the present moment, but not even holding that and letting
it do what it does. So this mind here, light, feeling the body, allowing the breath, letting
these things just heal, rejuvenate, and gladden the mind. It can be helpful just to really
consciously acknowledge you're in a place of safety, of okayness, with people committed
to waking up, and so letting the group support you, the place support you, you can really
go.
