 So one of the things I believe that Buddhist practice asks of us is to study our relationship to change. Different people relate to change in different ways or relate to different kinds of change in different ways. If things are pleasant, then sometimes we don't want them to change. We don't want them to be different and we hold on. If things are unpleasant, we can't wait for the change to occur. Just knowing that things change is a great solace when things are terrible. This is going to change. This will change. It certainly helps with child raising to know that, oh, it's one of those days. They go through two-week cycles. Oh, just two weeks. Whatever. Some people look at change as something, if they don't like what's happening, they look at it hopefully as it provides some kind of relief. Some people look at change as being a problem. Some people look at afraid of change. They are afraid of entering into relationships with all kinds of things because they feel it's going to change. People are going to die. When they lose it, it's going to end. I've been burned before. There are people who hold back from being engaged in life and participating. There are people who refuse to get involved in intimate relationships and to really love someone because they're afraid of loving, because they're going to die. The thing that I've never talked about when people get married is the joyful time. You don't say, what you're doing when you're committing yourself to being married for life is that you're basically committing yourself to having one of you die before the other. It's not a very pleasant thought, but that's what's built into the system. There's a certain level of change and loss. Some people hold back and don't want to be part of that. Sometimes they feel that having no heart is better than having a broken heart or a painful heart. I think the way the psyche works is that it's much healthier to have a hurt and aching heart, a broken heart, than it is to have no heart at all or to be numb. What's the relationship we have to change and to things changing is the question each of you has to answer for yourselves. Buddhism has a lot to say on the topic, but I think that it's more interesting perhaps for each of you to look at your own tendencies to think first what is your most prevalent, most likely response to change, a generic way of doing this, a generic change. Then what's your relationship to specific things that change? How do you feel about that? It's been said sometimes that the ... I've heard it said that the one thing that most people or all people can agree that they really know certainly if you ask me, what do you know? Absolutely for certain. People say that things change, that things are impermanent. Some people then will appreciate impermanence in a lot of spheres of their lives, but sometimes one response to impermanence is to say, well, things are changing all the time, things are unreliable, so I'm going to find that one thing or those things which are reliable, which I can hold onto and depend on as being permanent and unchanging. People hold onto all kinds of things. You can just go through the litany of things that you've held onto your life or other people have held onto you've seen. There are things we hold onto that we don't really realize we're holding onto until it's taken away from us. Sometimes it's our health. We don't realize the degree to which our health has been a source of security or we've counted on it. Then our health changes in dramatic ways sometimes. Then things have changed and you realize maybe your health can't be relied on in the same way. What is it that is reliable is another question that Buddhism poses each of us to answer for ourselves. What can we rely on? Part of the Buddhist teachings is over and over again to point out how everything is impermanent. Part of the teaching is everything is impermanent is a little prod to keep you asking, what is it that's reliable? What is it that's reliable? Is my house reliable? My friend Rana's house disappeared in Oakland Fire. Is your bank account reliable? Is your relationship reliable? Is your health reliable? One of the things I liked about sitting here in Bortola Valley and one thing I didn't like about sitting here is the fact that we're right on top of the San Andreas Fault and things can change. Even the ground is not reliable. There was an earthquake in Yaka Valley one year. Yaka Valley is a retreat center which we used for many years for Vipassana retreats. In the middle of one of the retreats, I think it happened during the Dharma talk, there was a series of earthquakes and aftershocks. One of the comments that some of the people I knew who were there said was that they thought always the ground was really reliable and stable. They just saw the ground buckle and wave through like it was the ocean. What is it that's reliable if everything is changing? Sometimes we can use change to help us with change. What I'm thinking about here is that one of the most useful things I found, especially in meditation and daily life also, is the changing nature of breathing. That the breath, the alternating sensations of breathing in and out, the expansion and contraction of the torso, the belly, all the various sensations of the breathing are a wonderful place to anchor ourselves in something which is changing. What's fascinating about the breath is to notice the ways in which the breath is held. If we're anxious or afraid or in a hurry, it's all kinds of reasons in which we're holding. We resist, we're bracing ourselves against life, against change, all kinds of reasons that the body is being held. One of the first things I often do in the beginning of a sitting is I check into my breathing. How is my breathing? More often than not, I find out that my breath is actually held a little bit. Then I'll breathe into that. I'll try to relax that little bit, let go of that, or just be with that for a while if it seems kind of tenacious. When the breath is held, I think it's fair to say that it's often an attempt to hold onto something, to resist change or impermanence. Fear is often a resistance to the way things are. We don't want things to be a certain way. Our anger can be a resistance. Sometimes it doesn't have to be. But certainly resentment is. Resentment, I think, is frozen anger. It often gets frozen in our body. Often enough, frozen with the way we breathe. So I drop down into the breath and let the breath become fluid again is one way to help us not have unhealthy holdings or resistances to life itself. I call the breath the great lubricator because it lubricates life. It makes life a lot easier to flow and change. I'll come back to my breath over and over again throughout the day. Even while I'm talking to you, I come back to my breath. And I find even when I'm talking to you, giving these talks, there are reactions that I have to what's the whole event that sometimes appear in my breathing. So I drop into my breath and more often than not, I find my breathing, the place where the tension, the holding is in relation to the breath, has moved up into the chest, kind of up into the, I don't know what it's called, but the cavity above the diaphragm. And I find that it's much better for me to let that upper holding of the diaphragm to be released and to kind of let the center of gravity or center of weight of my breathing apparatus kind of be lower in my belly. So I find that being with the impermanence of the breathing in a relaxed way, an uninhibited way, makes it a lot easier for me to be present for the impermanence and change of life around me. And also I find it very helpful in an investigation of understanding what my relationship to change is. Because it's not simply just a matter of noticing the holding and letting go of it, but also noticing where we're held and then trying to understand what's all about. Seeing that clearly to understand the roots of it. Why is it that there's resistance? Why is it that there's fear or anger or holding on or wanting things to be different? And there's all kinds of slew of ways in which we hold. One of the ways which we think we use change in our favor is through hope. And things are changing, so we hope that things will get better. We expect them to be better. But hope is a very curious feeling or idea. I've heard a lot of spiritual teachers say that, Buddhist teachers, for example, say there's no place for hope in Buddhism. There's no hope in Buddhism. Buddhism offers no hope. And the reason why they say such things is that hope is, the claim is often based on fear or resistance to things as they actually are. With projection into the future rather than becoming some realistic and liberated relationship to how things are right now. Now impermanence is a pretty common observation for humans. And you don't have to be a Buddhist to understand the importance of impermanence. Buddhism perhaps has taken the subject of impermanence to its limit perhaps, but maybe not. But it's quite common. We have in the Western tradition here a Kletus who said, you know, we can't step in the same river twice because everything's always changing. And a lot of the wisdom that can come from life, learning how to be a wise person in life comes from understanding impermanence and having a new relationship to it. Impermanence impinges on life all the time. So encountering death, for example, can bring certain kind of wisdom. Encountering all the changes that are obvious in life and coming to terms with that and having some ease with that can bring a lot of wisdom. As I've often enough said, at some point I realized that one of the reasons why elders in our society, people who are getting on in age, why they're considered to be wise is not because they've had a lot of experience, which is what I thought before, as probably part of the reason, but it's from their proximity to death. And as you get a sense that your death is really close, you know, it's only a few years or whatever, you can kind of imagine it. When I was 20 I couldn't imagine the end of my life, but now I certainly can. And that proximity to death creates a different context for understanding our lives and can bring a lot of wisdom about how we relate to things. Wisdom has a lot to do with our values and priorities and the meaning that we assign to things. Meaning is much more impermanent than a lot because meaning is quite flexible and changeable. And often when we relate to reality, we're relating through the filter of the meaning that we apply to it. But meaning can be changed quite quickly. And then how do we relate to the changing meaning of things? There's a great story that you probably heard many times, I've told, of something like, well, it happened in Afghanistan this time. And there was this guy who had a little farm, you know, off in the dusty mountains of Afghanistan. And he was an old guy, he farmed it with his son. And one day his son went up into the mountains and found a wild horse that was just free up there. And he brought it home and it was quite wild. And the neighbor said, oh, you're such a lucky farmer. You've been eking out in existence for so long, you're so poor. And I don't know how are you going to get by this season with your old worn out donkey who's to plow. But now you have this great big stallion who looks strong and you're so lucky. And the old man says, we shall see. Or maybe so. And then this young son tries to tame the horse and is thrown off the horse and breaks his leg. And the neighbors say, oh, you're so unlucky. How are you going to manage without your son to help you do all the work? And this must be really terrible. The old man says, we shall see. And then the neighboring warlord declares war on that county. And so all the young men are constricted into the army. But the young man's son has broken his foot so he can't go fight. So the neighbors say, oh, you're so lucky. And all the other young men are going off to fight and they're probably going to die. And your son's going to stay. He only has a broken foot. He's probably going to be fixed by the time the war's over. He only lasts 100 days around here. And so then the man says, of course, we shall see. Now this story has no end. Because he just goes on like that. He has a certain equanimity about the meaning we apply to the changing circumstances of our life. We don't know until how things are going to work out. In the ancient religions of India, people were very cognizant of the fact that life was impermanent. And some of the religious traditions rose in relationship to that understanding. And somewhat simplistically, you can understand that one of the religious responses to impermanence in ancient India can be described in a very simple equation. The world of impermanence equals suffering. And if you have that understanding that the world of impermanence is the same as suffering, then if you want to stop suffering, you have to in some way or other stop the world of impermanence. And so these often religions of transcendence arose from this kind of understanding. That there's some transcendent reality that you can relate to that was completely separate and different from this life that we're part of. And where there was some kind of transcendental state of consciousness, or some transcendental plane of heavenly kind of plane. There's various kinds of transcendental kind of goals that people then established because they had to somehow not relate and not be involved in this world of impermanence if the two were completely connected and equated. The Buddhist kind of equation is an equal appreciation of impermanence. And equal appreciation is a lot of suffering. But the equation in Buddhism is suffering plus clinging equals impermanence plus clinging equals suffering. And when you have an equation like that, perhaps actually the Buddhist is a little bit different, it's impermanence times clinging equals suffering because it's magnified by our clinging. So when you have an equation like that, you don't have to get rid of the world of impermanence necessarily. What you have to do is you get rid of the clinging. And if you get rid of the clinging, then the suffering falls off the equation also. And that's the task that Buddhists have taken in relationship to the world of impermanence, is to understand where is the clinging, where is the holding, where is the resistance to the way things are. And to the changing nature of stuff, to phenomena, to experience. How do we relate to it? And so just study in our clinging, in our attachments. So certainly we can be very fond of this place here and a little bit sad about leaving it. But there can also be a tremendous suffering built in with it being attached to this place. Or maybe a person is attached to the kind of meditation they have in this place. And so this place is not so important, but it's the kind of meditation they have here. I mean, this is the place where you can meditate, you can listen to the equestrian announcements. And it just puts you just in the right mood and it keeps you focused. And they don't have anything like that there in Redwood City. And so we're attached to a certain mood perhaps that we have, that we like. And we'll have our own environmental peculiarities with that site. But mostly you'll notice them if you come between 10 and 12 on Thursday or Friday. You'll have to come and see. It's a very quiet environmental peculiarity, but it's quite dramatic. What did I tell you? You know, we're right across the street from Planned Parenthood. And at 10 to 12 in those days, there's one man, a couple of people usually in particular, who show up with anti-abortion posters. And the posters are really quite large and they're all the same thing. And they're quite gruesome photographs of looks like, well, it's an aborted baby. I don't know if it's aborted, but anyway, it's a quite gruesome photograph of a large embryo cadaver. And so that's quite something to deal with, to go by there. I introduced myself to them when we first had a chance to try to be friendly. And so the world of impermanence and change and how we relate to it. The issue of impermanence, I was going to start earlier to say that there's a lot of wisdom that comes from impermanence. And the Buddhist, in a lot of the Dharma talks, people talk about impermanence. They're giving wisdom teachings on impermanence often about it. And you hear people give talks on being with their father when the father was dying and how that affected them and opened their hearts or the understanding and wisdom that they came from that. In the Buddhist tradition, there's a distinction that can be made between wisdom and insight. The wisdom is part of human being and the insight part. And the insight comes not just simply from the kind of understanding that can come kind of conventionally from being part of the impermanent world. But insight is when we entered very deeply into the world of impermanence, when it's not just simply kind of large things, conventional things we see as changing, but how we see that moment to moment sensations of our experience changes over and over again. And we see that our thoughts arise and pass and how impermanent they are. And we see impermanence almost at an atomic level is when practice enters into the realms of insight. And then it's at that level of very deep seeing of impermanence that the mind can notice where the most subtle forms of clinging exist. And it sets the stage for deepest transformation of releasing the deepest kinds of clinging that we have. One of my first Zen teachers gave this meditation instruction, place yourself in your senses and then give up control. And this is a great instruction. And this is partly one of the things we're asked to do in Vipassana practice because Vipassana practice is in some degree very much founded or based on being in our senses, being in our sensations in our body, our tactile sensations in our body. And if we can really be present for those in a very intimate way and give up control, you'll enter into a phenomenal world of impermanence and change. And then we learn to kind of go with that or surrender to that. And the more deeply you can surrender to that impermanent flow and sensations in your body, the freer you'll become, I'll venture to say. So whether it's the wisdom side of understanding impermanence or the insight side, the insight is really to enter into the flow of impermanence, not simply to relate to it. Both I think can give birth to a lot of kindness. And I think that kindness is one of the things that the world needs the most of. And I've known a lot of people, including myself, who have encountered impermanence in the form of people dying, or September 11th, for example. And one of the things we really feel after that, it's really important how we relate to my neighbors and my family and my friends. And maybe I haven't told them recently that I love them. And maybe I don't know, I don't know, maybe I won't have a chance if I don't say it now. Let me say it now. Let me call them up and say it now. Or maybe it's more important to be kind to someone, because who knows how long, who knows when things will change? It's really precious. We see the impermanence of things now quickly, life can disappear. And we realize how precious it is. And rather than being closed up and numbed by that, it's an inspiration to really enter life more fully and perhaps to be kinder to the people we meet, to meet with more love and care. So I think one of the things that's born from the wisdom side of seeing impermanence, I hope, is kindness. And the same thing I believe is born from the inside side, as we kind of surrender to the actual experience of impermanence at a very deep level. The places of holding and restrictions we have in our heart gets released. We can't hold them anymore. And then the natural love or kindness or tenderness of our heart shines and goes forth naturally by itself. And I think that born out of impermanence is that heart's capacity to be kind, to be loving. So rather than seeing impermanence as being bleak or being frightening because the loss that's inherent in suffering, the entering into it, it's kind of an acceptance of it, entering into it, not resisting the way things actually are, gives a chance for the beauty in our heart and our minds to shine forth. And part of that, I believe, is kindness. Part of it is gratitude and compassion. So I feel phenomenally grateful for this room, for Portola Valley Town Center and all the town of Portola Valley for letting us use this for these three, four years. And they've been very generous to us, giving us a discount. And they've been very accepting of us, letting us come here. And we've even had the mayor of Portola Valley coming, sitting with us. So that feels like we've been very much included and welcomed here, I feel. And also very grateful for all of you who've come here. I've been very fond of Sunday mornings here. And it's a bit of a lovely place and a lovely environment, kind of semi-rural to come and sit in. And you've all come, I felt, with great kindness and attentiveness and dedication, sincerity. And it's been really lovely for me to come and sit here and sit with all of you and for all of us to be practicing together. I feel it's really a fortunate thing in life to have other people to practice together with. And I'm practicing with you as much as you're practicing with each other and with me. And I'm very grateful for all of you for these years of being able to practice together. And I hope that in the years to come that the impermanence of life hopefully will flow in the direction of all of us practicing together for a lot longer. So thank you very much.
