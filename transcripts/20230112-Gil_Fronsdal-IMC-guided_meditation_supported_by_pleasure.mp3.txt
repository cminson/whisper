 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good day everyone, warm greetings. And to come and sit in meditation for me is often a very kind of homecoming, but it's also kind of a, I don't know if sobering is the right word, but it's a time to settle down in a meaningful way into the fullness of life and all the different aspects. And since this week we're talking about challenges. Even when I've had major challenges with tragedies and things, I've always felt that coming to meditation was not an avoidance of it all, but there was a rightness, there was a satisfaction in sitting present for it all that borders on being pleasant. But to say it's pleasant seems to be too much given the enormity of what's happening. So I say there feels like a rightness to it all. It's right to sit in the middle of it. It's right to be with what's happening. It's right to be non-defensive, non-resistant, non-critical, non-externalizing. It's right to be here for these minutes in the middle of it all, breathing present. And even though it might seem disrespectful to the challenge we have, that sense of rightness can be a partner or be a sibling or be the same as a certain kind of pleasure, a certain kind of pleasantness, a certain kind of pleasantness that comes from breathing easy, a pleasantness that comes from an awareness of it all that is tender and gentle, kind, supportive, compassionate, or is again non-resistant, non-critical, non-caught up in thoughts and ideas. So sometimes in Buddhism we call this wholesome, wholesome attention, a wholesome attention to what is difficult, where in all the cracks of our preoccupations and thoughts, maybe we begin getting a glimpse of this feeling of rightness and even maybe we call it bordering on pleasant, pleasant attention. And when there are no challenges, it's a time to train, develop our capacity, to take in the pleasant. A big part of this practice is to show up for what is happening, but we often have a selectivity, bias, sometimes to the negative. And there's an art to this practice of being present for what is, that takes into account what is pleasant, takes it into account enough that it has an influence on us, that it kind of settles us, helps the mind want to be in the present moment. So to enter into your meditation posture and adjusting your posture, looking for a posture that has some modicum of rightness, feeling right, feeling right for the purpose of being attentive, not right for the purpose of being relaxed, though that's nice. But through the emphasis is on alertness, gently closing the eyes and taking some long, slow, deep breaths in a way that's right for you, feels like a good way of connecting to yourself, to your body. How deep that is, is up to you. And relaxing on the exhale, letting the breathing return to normal and scan through the body, see where on the exhale you can soften and relax the body. And as you do so, to feel whatever pleasantness or relief comes from that relaxation. And then to calmly, settle into the body breathing. As we're awareness has a light enough touch with breathing, most like the physical sensations of breathing, or the place where awareness touches the body, where the touch is light, soft, where awareness yields to the sensations of breathing, the movements in the body of the breathing. And is there anything pleasant in the cycle of breathing, the in breath or the out breath, anything that feels pleasant or satisfying or simply has a rightness, a goodness in attending to it? Thank you. Without denying any unpleasant or painful experiences in the moment, as you're aware of your breathing, also be aware of what is pleasant. And can you relax the mind that's mindful so that awareness, mindfulness of breathing itself has some pleasure in it, some rightness, that the awareness of breathing is open, allowing, receptive, kind, gentle. Or there's a certain joy or delight in the application of attention. It may be as similar to joy or delight of playing a musical instrument or doing a craft, being involved with breathing with interest and giving ourselves over to it, where whatever is unpleasant now is included on the side, the center, taking in whatever is pleasant in the moment, without holding on to it or insisting on it, just gently here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When we tighten up around something, resist something, when we become antagonistic towards something, afraid, all those movements of mind are unpleasant, and that unpleasantness has an influence on us. As in, if those things are happening, recognize it, but don't linger there. Look for what is pleasant. See if you can adjust and find a pleasant way or to be aware, to be present. Let yourself be influenced, conditioned by what is pleasant, no matter how small it might be, so that you're less likely to be adding the unpleasantness of reactivity. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, is there a way that you can now bring to mind the people of your life, known and unknown strangers and known people, friends and neighbors, colleagues, to bring them to mind or gaze out upon them in a way that feels has some pleasure in it, some positive feeling of pleasantness, to relax, settle back, to calmly gaze upon the world where the gazing has a kind of pleasantness in it or goodness in it that you wish for all people to have. May everyone have the ability to be aware, pleasantly, calmly, where they enjoy attending to others, where there's a rightness, no, where there's no stress, where there's no resistance or worry mixed up with the awareness of others. So to gaze upon the world kindly and to wish others to have also to have well-being, to be able to come from a place of their goodness, their kindness, their care. May all beings know their own goodness. May all beings know how to tap into the pleasure of awareness, the freedom of non-clinging, the warmth of generosity, the safety of non-harming. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free.
