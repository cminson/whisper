 happiness or goodwill or kind of a kind of maybe a kind of maternal I think maybe it's appropriate to call it a maternal feeling for yourself or for others and the sutti the sutra on loving kindness which I have copies which I might have it might be enough for everyone here and you might want to take it home and read it and some people actually get a lot of benefit from memorizing it and you're sitting in the traffic lights or something and you can just recite it rather than having just you know whatever kind of random thoughts you have and or it might you know if you memorize it sometimes it penetrates more deeply into you and then just thinking about understanding it intellectually and also it might float up into your consciousness at times that surprise you it's like a resource that's available and suddenly it comes up and wow that's what I need to hear it's just available and in that sutra that it it doesn't you know say it's loving kindness is maternal feeling but it does take make the analogy with a mother watching over her child willing to risk her own life to protect her only child so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings suffusing the whole world with unobstructed loving kindness so you know I think so the point I wanted to make last week is that the maternal instinct a maternal feeling or a feeling of wanting to take care of oneself or a feeling of care for oneself or for others or wishing someone well will arise naturally for anybody who does a mindfulness meditation mindfulness practice it's almost as if it's an it's a nature of the heart or nature of our inner self to want to express a radiate loving kindness when the clouds you know if delusion or whatever are clear a little bit and maybe she didn't get one oh that's something else so I passed out the wrong thing I wonder that actually that might be something different you got the original I don't want to get let go of that yeah we're gonna bring some more next week and just pass them out and so the loving kindness practice is the practice of not just leaving loving kindness to chance that might you know made or you know let it just happen to happen when it comes naturally out of the practice or out of whatever conditions but actually trying to cultivate or reinforce it or or be actively involved in cherishing and nurturing and watering the seed of that intention and the intention that's important not so much the feeling even though we often talk about the feeling and extending the feeling kind of the maternal sense or warmth the friendliness or whatever but it's really the intention which is important for the practice and what I like to say often is that there historically there was a tendency for Western just studied Buddhism to think that Buddhism was kind of an ascetic religion that had no feelings or emotions attached to it and you became kind of world-renowned seeing an indifferent to the world and you find some scholars famous scholars in the 1800s who wrote about Buddhism that way but I always say it's a little bit different that Buddhism doesn't want it it's not really a denial of anything we're not trying to deny ourselves or deny our natural instincts and feelings for others but what we're trying to do in a sense is to universalize them so we take our natural ability and capacity to love ourselves to be friendly towards ourselves and also to love and feel friendship towards people around us the family or friends or whoever it might be and we celebrate that we enjoy that we allow that to be there and we use that as a foundation we strengthen that and then from that we try to try to universalize those feelings so they're no longer just personal just for oneself or just for the ones personal acquaintances until it becomes boundless becomes universal it encompasses all living beings everywhere and for a religion that stresses no self it's also a religion that stresses a very much at the importance of of feeling loving-kindness for oneself of feeling warmth and tenderness and care and nurturing and whatever for one's own well-being also and to appreciate oneself and so the Buddha said that that if you traveled throughout the world to find someone who is more worthy of loving-kindness who it you would find no one who is more worthy than yourself and in the West that seems a little odd because we're not supposed to sometimes we're not supposed to kind of praise ourselves so much in the West it's kind of considered arrogant or whatever and but through our own eyes in a sense everyone is equally has a right to be happy and if you're looking the person is most close at home as yourself and you have just as much right as anyone else to to receive be the recipient of your own good wishes and happiness however loving kindness is not a the state of loving-kindness even though in part it's an intention in part is a feeling a sense it's not something you can have an objective relationship to it's not like you can so it's difficult if it's something you have to find yourself in rather than something you can have and then try to create from the outside you have to kind of be in the middle it's something that's very intimate to into yourself you can be in the state of love but you can't be up here kind of and having love in your heart somehow and just thinking that you can manipulate their tinker with it so there's a kind of softening and perhaps a kind of surrendering into maybe the heart or into the body because it's only in the body or in the heart I think that you really can open up to the possibility of love and friendship and and care and compassion and I say that I think is very important to say that because we often many of us think it's just intellectual exercise and and I think the real intimacy we can have with others really can only happen if you're embodied if you're in your body that that needs to happen so we drop down into our body and the embodiment side of mindfulness practice becomes very important for being able to discover what's in the body and discover the physical capacity to feel these wonderful feelings that come that are there so last week we did loving kindness towards ourself and then today we'll do it towards friends towards benefactors usually it said when you when you move loving kindness from yourself to others the first category traditionally is the benefactors an idea being that benefactors easy to feel loving kindness or friendship or to a benefactor someone who's helped you out and the West sometimes we say that or sometimes we just say you know a friend or a good friend or someone you care for traditionally it said when you choose a friend or benefactor it should be someone they say someone of the same sex because they're worried or concerned that if you choose some of the opposite sex that the least for I guess heterosexuals that that you would confuse loving kindness with some other kind of more romantic feelings for someone and in fact it's very easy to confuse I think loving kindness with the kind of intimacy or wanting come in loving kindness it's very easy to confuse it at times with romantic feelings and there's a lot of people you know get them to feel a bit funny sometimes because they're not so sure where the boundaries are but so it says traditionally is you shouldn't choose someone of the opposite sex and in the West we tend to ignore that instruction most people in the West are impatient with that kind of attitude and most of us are adults and you know and we're not going to get caught by that thing we think but but as we do this you might take that into account and if we if you choose someone to do loving kindness towards you should at least pay attention you know what happens if you do it towards someone who you feel some kind of romantic attraction to and or maybe see what is that was that really the right thing or is that kind of funny and maybe next time you should just avoid that and do it towards someone who's more romantically neutral or whatever that's for you to you discover I'm not going to tell you what to do I just give you the traditional teaching and you can struggle with it why just struggle oh struggle I was being a little bit I think little bit glib here but there is a traditional teaching of avoiding people of the opposite sex and the struggle that I'm talking about is what are you going to do with that traditional instruction are you going to accept it and so it would really avoid the opposite sex when you do loving kindness which is what the tradition tells you to do or you're just going to forget about what the tradition says and just do whatever you want or or are you going to kind of pay attention to that and kind of use that to maybe discover something that's what I meant you can just I just give you the traditional teaching and you can do with it as you find fit but what was your concern I just wondered why that would exclude loving kindness or why loving kindness would not be loving kindness and was directed towards someone it doesn't it can very well be and and it's really wonderful to to sit and have feelings of loving kindness or someone you feel deeply in love with and romantically engaged in with but but I guess the danger is that it's possible that the loving kindness slides over to become a very different kind of attitude and that different attitude was traditionally considered to be somewhat problematic so for example if if lust arises then well lust is not loving kindness and then you're sitting there you know dealing with your lust you know that's and that's kind of what I think the ancient tradition that's what they were they were concerned about romantic love so much you know they didn't even know what that was but they were concerned about lust what I said and they didn't know what that was yeah so I don't know you know we can I don't know I don't know how to speak for other cultures but do these there's these studies that say the romantic love arose in the west and you know with with Dante and the troubadours at that time in 1300s or whatever I mean I don't know I think everybody it's human to feel love but you know what happened there in the 1300s that defined the kind of love that has is so pervasive in the west I'm not sure I haven't studied it and but if that's the case if the western a lot of western notions of romantic love are tied to the troubadour tradition in 1300s and India didn't even didn't have a troubadour tradition in 1300s then do they have a different understanding of what love is and I don't know it's always so challenging to study anthropology because suddenly the thing the categories you think are so sacred and you know you die over your opinions about them suddenly wait a minute maybe they're just culturally conditioned products so maybe that's enough for a kind of introduction and so let's do a little bit I'll do some guided loving kindness and so when you do loving kindness meditation you should it's more important in loving kindness to be comfortable in your meditation posture than it is for mindfulness practice so do what you can to be comfortable but to sit upright in an alert way and if you need to change your posture as we go through this you can do that and close your eyes and take a couple of deep breaths using the exhalation to settle into your place into your body and then letting yourself breathe normally feel your body for a few moments a body that happens to be alive at this moment in whatever way it presents itself to you just become aware of how you are after maybe busy or hectic day or whatever feeling your body from the inside checking in with yourself as a way of changing gears from your ordinary day to being present and then if it's simple to do you can also relax some of your big muscles you can relax and soften your stomach sometimes it's possible to soften slightly the chest and also the shoulders especially sometimes it's possible to soften a little bit on the exhalation and sometimes it can soften relax the forehead and the eyes the jaw and then feel now your breath within your torso the arising and passing of the breath the expansion and contractions and as you breathe out very silently to use to yourself ever so slightly you can give a little sigh as a way of settling in relaxing as you breathe outside and then breathing normally again let your attention settle on the area around your heart center of your chest and simply feel what is there without any notion of right or wrong and if you don't feel much at all that's fine it's enough just to keep your attention your awareness resting in that area so so and then you can imagine perhaps that as you breathe in you breathe in through the heart through the chest and perhaps you breathe in a feeling of warmth or loving kindness toward yourself tenderness embracing the heart with the in-breath with a feeling of goodwill maternal loving kindness and that as you breathe out you're breathing out calmness peacefulness so so and then continuing to breathe in and out through your heart through the center of your chest you can repeat these phrases quietly to yourself the phrases of loving kindness allowing the meaning or the intention behind the phrases to resonate with your heart with your body so then silently to yourself you can repeat may I be happy may I be filled with joy may I be free of whatever worry predominates in my life may I be free of whatever anxiety troubles the mind and the heart so may this wonderful body of mine dwell at ease may this body be filled with delight may I be at peace may I be at peace so and getting a sense as you sit here of your aliveness in this body the sense of being alive the vitality of life that has to be present as we sit here however vaguely you sense it and our aliveness our vitality is partly who we are and it's something very precious and feeling the preciousness of being alive of being here can you open yourself up to desire to take care of that aliveness to take care of the spark of life that is you may I be happy may I be free from suffering may I be free from mental harm may I dwell in joy and delight and then continuing to breathe in and out through the middle of your chest bring to mind some friend that you have and bring to mind a memory of a time when this friend was with you and this friend was very happy full of delight joy maybe you can remember what their face looked like smiling or their eyes sparkling or perhaps you remember a particular event or a time you were together with this person and how you shared in that delight or in that happiness or joy and then holding this memory or this image of your friend see if you become aware somewhere within even an inkling of it a desire or intention that this person this friend of yours may they be well may they be happy may they be free from harm and danger may they prosper and if you can feel even a hint of that a feeling of caring for that person and even if you can't then you can repeat these words sinking into the meaning of the very phrases may my friend be happy may my friend be free from suffering may my friend's life be filled with joy may my friend be filled with delight may my friend dwell in safety may my friend be at peace may my friend dwell in safety and then continuing to breathe in and out through the chest now bring to mind some child that you've met perhaps recently maybe you took some delight in or you felt some care for and sometimes it's easiest to have caring loving-kind feelings for children small children we naturally want them to be well and happy so bring to mind some child that you met recently or some time ago may this child be happy may this child be happy may this child be happy may this child be happy may this child be happy may this child be happy may this child live in safety may this child be filled with joy May this child be healthy. May this child be filled with delight and perhaps little mischievousness. May this child be at peace. And then letting go of the memory or the image of the child. Now bring to mind someone who has been a benefactor for you. A mentor or a teacher, a sponsor, a supporter, a guide. Letting them bring to mind someone who has been a benefactor, who was a benefactor because they cared for you. They helped you out. May my benefactor be happy. May my benefactor be free from worry and stress. May my benefactor be filled with joy. May my benefactor live at ease. May my benefactor feel in his or her heart the gratitude or the appreciation I feel. And then we can continue for a little while in silence. And you can breathe in through your heart, breathe in loving-kindness, breathe out calmness or peacefulness. And if you want, you can think of other people, other friends or benefactors and quietly in your own way express whatever loving-kindness you might feel for those people. And then again, having a felt sense within of your own aliveness. Of your own inner presence or vitality. And maybe having a sense of this, allowing it to be held by your body, by your awareness. Perhaps appreciating your own aliveness. You can end this period of loving-kindness by once again directing a little loving-kindness to yourself, saying whatever phrases of loving-kindness that seem appropriate. And then when I ring the bell in a few moments, you can take a few deep breaths again using the in-breath to connect to your body, to the place, to the cushion. And when you're ready, you can open your eyes. So loving-kindness is in part devotion towards the welfare of oneself or to others, or developing or fostering or nurturing feelings of welfare, of goodwill, of caring, of loving-kindness or love. And just repeating myself again, but it's really something that happens in the body. If you realize that those feelings arise out of the body, then you may be more likely to surrender or relax or settle into your body because that's how it's going to happen. And if it remains just intellectual exercise, I don't really think it becomes, you know, can't really become fully developed. You can't be tender without being tender physically. You can't be just tender-minded. So how was that, to do that session? Yes? I think I crossed myself up because in the first part of the exercise, I began thinking of my schoolmates who were killed in the Second World War. One was killed on the beaches of Tariroa. The other one was killed over in Germany. The 17th one. But I did the exercise. I'm not supposed to help it. I think that, you know, last week one of the things I said is that when you do loving-kindness, the metaphor is kind of like you're softening some of the crust on the heart. And what's deeper in there will have a chance to show itself. And often what we carry in our hearts is not necessarily, you know, not just loving-kindness, but there's many things there. And there can be great sadness and great grief. There can be great anger and rage that resides in our hearts. And that the part of doing loving-kindness sometimes is softening enough to allow those feelings to come. So in the capacity to feel sad or the capacity to feel compassion, I think, is a beautiful capacity. And even though it's painful, it's part of what it means to be a human being. So just for you to say that to me, you know, we're all pretty open. Our hearts are kind of soft from doing this loving-kindness. I mean I feel the sadness, I feel the pain. And in a sense, both loving-kindness and compassion can grow out of that. You don't have to turn away from it. So you didn't do it wrong. Yes? Question. Are there different words for loving-kindness and compassion? Are they distinct things? Yes. They're distinct. They're closely related, I suppose. But loving-kindness is wishing for the welfare of others, the happiness of others, whereas compassion is feeling the pain or the suffering of someone and wanting to alleviate the suffering. And you can have loving-kindness on top of compassion. You can already want to alleviate the suffering, but you want to actually be happy. But compassion is mostly a desire to alleviate that suffering, to take care of things or write things for them. And one understanding in Theravada Buddhism is that the other kind of wholesome social emotions that get cultivated or get reinforced through Buddhist practice arise out of loving-kindness. So sympathetic joy, feeling joy in someone else's joy, and feeling compassion for someone else's suffering, that arises naturally out of a heart or a felt sense of loving-kindness. Because loving-kindness in a sense is kind of an open tenderness of heart, the foundational tenderness of caring. And if you have a tenderness in caring and that tender, caring heart confronts joy, it's going to resonate joyfully. And if it meets the encounter of suffering, that tender heart is going to feel naturally compassion. Is that...yes? You're welcome. Thank you. I was really touched, actually, how many of you come. There's even more people. I thought usually I did for sure. There'd be fewer people today than last time. And it made me feel kind of filled with kind of warm feelings of loving-kindness, just naturally, just seeing so many people are interested in such a thing and willing to go along. And so thank you all. Someone else? Yes? I'm going to go to the meditation. Is there a guided meditation? Yes, I talked to Alison. And it's being taped and something happens to them. And also the Dharma Sea Tape Library, which is this place in Massachusetts, sells kind of these long, longish kind of guided loving-kindness meditations from the different teachers. And sometimes it's nice to hear it from different teachers because different voices, different whatever, kind of work better for different people. So does anybody find it was easier, more difficult to do it towards yourself the second time in the end than it was the first time in the beginning? Than last week. Do you have any sense why? Maybe just by practice. What about from the ... We started off by doing it towards ourselves today. And then we did it to come back to ourselves at the end. Was there a difference in ease between the beginning of today and the end? Yes, the end of today. So yeah. Someone else? Yes. I noticed that my awareness of just the area of my heart and maybe the breath as being attached with my heart going in and out, I became more and more aware of that as the meditation progressed. So by the end I really felt like I was in my own heart and that I wasn't like looking at my own heart. So it was easier to do loving kindness than it would be intuitive. Good. I think for me I always had this resistance to do it for myself and I was really reflecting on why I have this resistance. And somehow I got into a place where there was a voice inside saying that I wasn't a good person. And then I started writing all these things down. And somehow that came ... I felt like my father when I was a little girl. And then I really looked at it and it's not true. So just really seeing what I was really seeing way down deep. And I do that when I have these deep knots in my body. It's like I say to myself, this voice says, well you deserve that because you know you're not a really good person. I don't know. Right now I'm thinking that I'm not all that bad. Any more than all the best. I think on that greed hate delusion my thing is ... I tend to have a lot of aversion and judgment. And I think that that's the thing that's really holding me up. So one way to do loving kindness practice is to get a sense of what that is like. Feel it, feel the knots, feel the voices, whatever. And then do loving kindness towards them. To the knots? Yeah. And may you be happy, may you be well. And when you hear that inner judging voice saying, you know, you're terrible, may that judge you be happy, may the judge you be ... So rather than kind of dismissing you or trying to judge it again, just do loving kindness towards it. And all things ... there's a wonderful quote that I should probably try to memorize by Rolke. He says that all things that are ... all the demons within us are really these precious princesses that are whatever that are asking to be loved. That's good enough. Yeah. Talking of demons, I've had a really terrible day. And I can't remember feeling such anger and even hatred, wishing bad things to happen to a person. And I've just had such difficulty really allowing myself to have those feelings. And behind that, it's like we've been studying Salzburg, Spoke, you know. And I feel like up until today, I've never had such loving kindness for myself. And I'm wondering if the two are balanced. I can't believe the pain I was in over having these feelings. And I couldn't get rid of them. And I did all my two walks of techniques that I know, you know, press work and everything and it was like I couldn't let it go. I wanted to let it go and I couldn't let it go. So what I most feel it's saying in response, which is it's very unteachly because it is not to say anything. It's what? The unteachly thing for me to say is not to say anything about it. So that's what your experience was like today, this way it is. You were really furious and then you felt all this loving kindness. It's really great. That's all you need to know. You don't necessarily have to understand why. I could come up with some nice ideas, but I think it's maybe more profound just to let it, this is who you are right now and that's okay. You don't have to, it doesn't become better by understanding it. Just, oh, that's who I am today. And that's precious. What was it like to feel your inner, your vitality, your aliveness? Is that something you could connect to? And those of you who could connect to that, was that something that felt precious? And connecting to that, was it easier to have a loving kindness then? To feel like you were precious and not so terrible? Did anybody have difficulty with this? Yes, Genevieve. I'm not a resistance. Much more so than I am. Couldn't seem to sort of get to a place where I could think about it. There's a lot of internal inter-resistance from the body. It's really soft. And I find it's sort of kept coming back to me behind me, and trying to let the resistance be there, along with all the other feelings of kindness and hunger and all these other things that I think were in the way. But I think we found that in the United States. Yeah. Yeah. I'll give you a question. And loving kindness is a very powerful practice. And you don't necessarily feel more loving from doing it. It's kind of just softening that happens. And sometimes there's a tremendous resistance, and all these other things start happening, and grief and sadness. But you have your choice what to do. You could always switch and go back to mindfulness practice. You could open your eyes and get up and leave. And it's important that you feel that you have some choice in the matter. That you don't have to sit and just sit and take whatever comes. So you can say, well, now, yes, that's what I feel. It feels right to me to feel my sadness. And it's all open to it. And maybe this class, that's the opportunity. For you, it's not to develop loving kindness, but to give yourself half a chance to feel the deep well-springs of sadness. And out of that will come maybe a renewed ability to feel loving kindness. And so I certainly would expect that there are people who have exactly your experience. And again, if you feel like you're doing it wrong, you're not. It's working for you. Maybe other people have problems with sleepiness. This is a good ad for them today for me. And can you say again what to do about that? I was wide awake when I got here. You put me straight. Well, this is the problem. I'm wondering sometimes what I should, develop more of a drill sergeant voice. Yeah. You over there. Open that heart. And you've heard some instructions around that. You might do loving kindness practice with your eyes open, if you're really sleepy. Do it with your eyes open. Loving kindness meditation with your eyes open. And it might be probably much more difficult to fall asleep. And what your visual field is happening there is not that, it doesn't matter so much whether your eyes are open or closed. And maybe you want to, sometimes people sit in front of a window and get some light coming in or sit in such a place where it's a little bit simple in front of you maybe. But keep your eyes open if that helps. And it could just be this time of day for a lot of people it's difficult. And there's a lot of, end of the day people are sleepy and worn down and all kinds of things. So this is the time we're doing it, so you have to allow that to be as part of what's happening and kind of accept it. I thought it was always very interesting when I, I used to sit, every afternoon I would sit at 5.30 or so, 5.45 to 6.30. I'd come back from work and I'd go sit. And I'd sit for 40 minutes. And the first 20 minutes always was this tremendous unwinding of my fatigue. And sometimes I'm nodding off, and I'd feel all this tension, all this energy going through my body, all this stuff, you know, I could accumulate through the day. And then after 20 minutes of kind of just resting and settling and relaxing and falling asleep briefly and whatever, I'd settle enough and then all of a sudden a wakefulness would arise. And I just knew that was the pattern. I needed to give myself a chance to rest. And for me the rest I got in 20 minutes of sitting was so much more thorough than it would have been if I had a nap. So I didn't beat myself up because I was sleepy the first 20 minutes. So I realized that was a condition that had to unfold. So you could sit with your eyes open. You could just allow it. You could do loving kindness, your sleepiness. You could... And then the other thing to be said, you know, is that loving kindness can be very powerful and there can be like a lot of resistance to what's there. And sometimes sleepiness is a defense. It's another way of having resistance. But I think for most people this time of day, it's just, you know, just... It's the time of day and your blood sugar or whatever. Yeah, Bonnie? Can you say a little bit more about what you said about that it really resides in your body, that what kind of comes out of your body and so what you said was, maybe if you realize that or think of that, that you'll sort of relax and sink in. Yeah. Can you talk a little bit more specifically or say anything else about what you might do and pay attention to your body or anything like that in your world? Well, one thing you can do, which is interesting, is if there are times, whether it's through loving kindness practice or whether it's in daily life, if you're in a situation where you feel a lot of love or loving kindness or strong friendliness or whatever, take a few minutes to do mindfulness practice and feel where the felt sense in the body is for that emotion because every emotion will have a felt sense in the body. And what you'll find probably, at some point, it might not be obvious for a while, but you'll find that the felt sense of it is probably somewhere in the torso. And you recognize that and maybe you recognize it's like loving kindness is a kind of tenderness in the torso. It's kind of like... We say open-hearted. I think it's a good reason we say open-hearted. It's kind of a relaxation, a kind of open feeling. And it's kind of tender and vulnerable often. But if you know that that's a capacity or possibility for you and it's in your body, then you might be more likely to relate to your body, willing to be in your body, take the time to be in your body, and to maybe surrender. I think for loving kindness practice, it's going to be a nice word. You surrender into your body. And there's a much more higher chance that you're going to feel your tender heart if you surrender into your body. If you stay up in your thoughts and your ideas and your fantasies, there isn't that connection anymore, unless it's going to happen. But other things besides the body too. What else might talk is if you think it's something very pleasant that's a really happy moment, and then contrast it with something unpleasant that you're trying to know, you can really feel it, what it does to your attention, just to try to contrast my health too. I never noticed how much my thoughts affected just the level of physical sensation when it kind of contrast it. That's just a good thing. Nice. So, anybody else who was difficult for?
