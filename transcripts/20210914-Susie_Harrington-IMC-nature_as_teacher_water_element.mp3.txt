 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. The water elements were made up of 60 to 90 percent water, apparently depending on your age. When we're younger, we have more water in us. We're juicier. As we get older, we're more earth. We're more ground. But we're still more than half water. And hopefully in that meditation you are starting to feel that combination, that beautiful combination that the water element offers us. This cohesion of holding the earthiness in us together. And yet it does it in this completely pliable, flexible way. Water is such a magical thing, the way it takes the shape of everything that it touches. On a river, it takes the shape of the river. In a cup, it takes the shape of the cup. In our bodies, it takes the shape of our bodies. And the Buddha, I read you part of a quote yesterday about the earth element. And I want to read you, he talks about the water element. He talks about the elements very similarly. But here's what he says about the water element. And I want you to notice in particular where he talks about internal and clinging. So notice that as well as his list of what the water element is. And he's again speaking to his son, Ruhula. What Ruhula is the water element? The water element may be either internal or external. What is the internal water element? Whatever internally belonging to oneself is water. Watery and clung to. That is bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joint, urine or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is water, watery and clung to. This is called the internal water element. Now both the internal water element and the external water element are simply water element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus. This is not mine. This I am not. This is not myself. When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the water element, particularly as mine, and makes the mind dispassionate towards the water element. And he's speaking here very clearly how internal it we name it internal when we cling to it. When we're not clinging to it, it's neither internal nor external. It's simply water, water flowing through. And we can feel this identity, this need. Isn't it amazing that we call this sack that we have so much ownership and so much idea about this sack of water that is right here. More than half water but somehow this water is mine, is me, but not the other water. Clinging, it's like we freeze. It's like we make the water instead of its natural fluid, we freeze it in place. And we can feel this in our concepts in our way of moving and acting in the world when we're frozen, when we are rigid, cut off. Very much like frozen water. Clinging to who we are, what we've done, our roles, our identities, our stories. It's so easy to see in a river. If we look at a river and we give it a name nearby here is the Colorado River, and we give the Colorado River this name and we can easily see. It's not hard to notice that, oh, the name Colorado River is an idea concept that I have, but the water in it and how it is. And if you live near a river or you've been in it, you see that it changes, not just the water in it, but the banks, the sediment, the color, the volume, it's all constantly changing. And it's so easy to see that our name for it, the Colorado River, is just a concept that we overlay on this constant oscillating changing thing. And we're like that. I'm a river named Susie, and you are a river with your own name, constantly changing everything flowing through. And when we freeze ourselves or freeze other people into some limited view as if we were static. And I've so clearly pointed that it's making this static nature that makes us believing, believing in that static nature that causes our suffering. So can we recognize our own fluidity, our transparency that's coming through us? Can we feel this water, this sacred water flowing through us, this giver of life? We are vessels of sacred water, part of the cycle moving around in permanent. Just shift your posture a little bit, just sort of move a little bit and feel the fluidity in your joints. Feel how you're just kind of like a pool, a little stream that's moving a little. Let yourself sense your body. The sacred water we carry. It's so lovely to think that human beings our whole time and animals too, organized, right? Where we lived based on water. We lived by water. We lived where there was streams, where there was water to drink, water to move on. I was, not long ago, I was down in, last winter, I was down in Phoenix and there were these houses that had been built that apparently the people who built them knew there was no water, you know, they couldn't dig wells, there's no city water available. And so the water has to get trucked to their house and put into a holding thing. And I could feel in myself a kind of dis-ease in that. Like there's a way, oh, we're supposed to be connected into the cycle and now we've had to like, those people have to have their connection into the hydrological cycle, go through a truck and drive down the highway. And there's something that when we feel in our bodies and feel the clouds and the water flowing through, the sacredness of water. Robin Wall Kimmerer in a book you may be familiar with, Braiding Sweetgrass, talks about the error of buying bottled water. Like we've interrupted its cycle and we're not letting the whole thing come through and turning it into a commodity, this most sacred of elements. They're all sacred, but this sacred element. This element of water gives us the opportunity to feel how powerful water is and how pliable water is. There's a beautiful story from Ajahn Chah where he asks someone, he asks a group of people, you may know the story, he said, have you ever seen moving water? And the other one's like, yeah, I've seen moving water. And he says, have you ever seen still water? Yeah, we've all seen a pool of water. And he says, have you ever seen still moving water? And how can we in our practice be this moving, flexible, pliable water element? And yet there's a stillness of like a still pool that the pool is letting the mud and silt settle out to the bottom. Pure water has a clarity to it. Letting yourself feel the simplicity and clarity of water as it enters and flows through you. And we, like the world we live in, is full of disruptions of water, floods and droughts who become very aware of the disturbance of water. And yet when it sits, it stills, it calms. And the next aspect of water that I just want to drop in is water as like the juiciness of aliveness, the juiciness of metta really, that is what we share. You know, we often say, oh my, you know, that's a juicy person or I need more juice in my practice. You're feeling this nourishing, abundant quality of the water, the way when you water a plant, you're giving it love, you're giving it appreciation, and it has the opportunity to grow. I'll end today with a poem from Rilke. May what I do flow from me like a river, no forcing it and no holding back the way it is with children. Then in these swelling and ebbing currents, these deepening tides moving out, returning. I will sing you as no one ever has streaming through widening channels into the open sea. May you be a widening channel or as Rosemary said at the beginning, a wren, an asteroid or a lemon. Feel your wateriness. So I encourage you today, as I suggested yesterday, exploring your earthiness as you go through this day, feel very much in your own body, in your joints, as you move around, that you are water. You're part of the cycle of water in its juiciness, moving through your day. Enjoy that. Let the drink of water when you drink, when you drink it in, feel the streams, the ocean come into you. And I wanted to let you know today we're going to end at the regular time, and tomorrow, the next three days I'll end at the regular time like this, and then we'll also continue for those who can for 15 minutes with questions if people would like to bring those. We'll still end it quarter till and then have the option of continuing for those who would like. So may you have a juicy watery filled day. Be well.
