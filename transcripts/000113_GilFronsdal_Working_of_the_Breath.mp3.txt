 Our minds are amazing creatures. And I think anybody who meditates has to stand in awe of their minds. One of the things about our minds and our thoughts and our concerns is that it's very easy to have a certain kind of myopia in our lives, be myopic. Near-sighted. And to have certain concerns, maybe many preoccupations, and have our mind be really tight around them. So that it seems like it's occurring in a very little room. And so each thing that happens seems so monumental and so significant. And we can get actually sometimes quite frantic and quite preoccupied and lost in all our concerns. Or even if not lost, then we know they're there. But there's kind of this logic where we think that the only solution, the only way of relating to our thoughts and our concerns is in the very world of our thoughts and concerns themselves. It's like if you're in the middle of a maze, and the maze was just a little bit higher than your eyebrows, the walls of it. And you're walking around looking for the way out and kind of bumping into walls and going down this little alley and this little alley trying to find your way out. And it seems so important to get out and so difficult. And then if suddenly you stood on your tippy toes and looked over the edges of the wall, it was really obvious to you where the way out was then. You had this great vista then, you'd say, oh, I'll just follow this track and get out. From a higher vantage point or a larger vantage point, our problems can be very different. They were right in the middle of it. We only think there's only one way to solve them. The story of the ruler of a kingdom, a great queen in her queendom, decided she wanted to find some wise people, one wise person to be her right-hand minister to help run the country. And so she gathered together three of the wisest people in the queendom and put them up in a high tower in a dungeon. And on the inside of the door was this big lock. And she said, whoever gets out of it, you have three days to get out of this room. Whoever gets out of this room figures out how to get out of the room will be my minister. And the other two, something dire will happen too. And so two of them immediately started going over and studying the lock and looking at it and slowly kind of moving the combinations this way and that way and writing, taking down notes, listening to it and shaking it. And the third one just sat there and went to sleep in the corner. And at the end of the third day, when it was right near the deadline, the two of them were just pulling out their hair and wondering, what should we do here? We can't figure out how this lock works. And the third one just got up and pushed the door open. The lock was on the door, but no one had ever locked it. So sometimes we can get so caught up in this narrow focus of our problem and not see there's a different solution. And one of the things that can happen is that we can get so caught up in the details of our life, the concerns of our life, and our mind can get so tight and contracted around it. And there's a way in which a tight and contracted mind is a magnet for more concerns. You notice that? And more problems. Everything becomes a problem then. And then in the most harried, frantic times, when you don't have any time for anything, you just sit down and meditate or do something that just calms you, take a little nap or something, but sit down and meditate. You might find that after half an hour of meditation, maybe, that suddenly you've gotten really calm and your problems are still there, but you relate to them very, very differently. They don't seem to be so oppressive. They don't seem to be such a major consequence. Myopia is not there. And maybe the problems go away. Maybe they're still there. But it's more okay to have them there because the mind is not contracted around them. So that was kind of behind the way I did the guided meditation today. It's very useful to develop greater familiarity and even love of our breathing. Just be with our breath and feel it. And that was part of what guided meditation was about. But also I was hoping to see if in doing a guided meditation and the breathing, whether it could pull some of you into a little bit more concentrated state of being, a little calmer state perhaps than you usually are. And in doing that, maybe see the contrast between two different ways in which you can be involved in your preoccupations, two different ways you can relate. So now I'm curious to hear from you. Did you notice a difference between before and after, the beginning of the sitting and the end? Yes. I noticed a really large difference. In fact, I almost went to sleep. And then my consciousness got kicked upstairs, you know. And I felt I was in the middle of a very quiet, stable, calm space. And I was really observing my breath and it was desirable to do so instead of following thoughts. Very interesting. That's great. One of the things that is helpful in the process of meditation is to somehow be convinced or have faith that it's actually more interesting to stay present for the breathing or to follow the breathing than it is to follow your thoughts. And most of us, maybe unconsciously, are quite convinced that our thoughts are of monumental importance. And, you know, off we go. We're so readily seduced by them. So to have an experience like that is very helpful to give you confidence. Someone else, what was that meditation like? It was really great then. I had the same experience then. I didn't look out the usual couple of experienced ideas. Usually I do. I was making the concept of much that. Being guided that way. Great. Yes, please. I found myself competitive in comparing the last week's meditation. Competitive? But I didn't have the same experience. I wasn't worried about having the thing, but I couldn't get my mind off of the track. Hoping it would be like last week's or comparing it. Or just thinking too much, just comparing and thinking too much things. But definitely felt my body relaxed. My mind was going like crazy, but my body really relaxed. I felt very specific all down to the powerful. Great. Thank you. I noticed the distinct difference between the first start of sitting tonight, drawing my attention to and focusing on that ground. Very long, very busy day. Very busy morning when I first stepped out. Just promising to follow in the place. I've noticed another meditation in the zone, down into where I'm to find myself. I actually focus, just trying to forget everything else, and just watch my breath. That seems to relax and make me center. It gives me a bigger mind, a bigger outlook. Tonight for the first time though, there was a time where for a few breaths I thought, it's actually pretty exciting and glorious. Just the simple thing, but it's really, really neat. A simple breath, you know, and it's my connection with the planet and being alive. But without this, I simply won't exist. That wasn't a scary thing, but it was just kind of profound. And that this machine, if you will, that's my mind and body, it really, I need it. They work really well. It's really kind of neat. Just being and not doing. Great. Thank you. I really like the idea of enlarging the space and the concerns that were running around in my head before we started were bumping up. It's like they had built up every single possible area. They had room to go and jump around it. Well, I've got plenty of room here and there's even strength in there. And there's some coping skills. You can worry about these things later. So there's a real distinct difference between before and after. Great. Thank you. Yes. I really appreciated the opportunity to feel my breath in different parts of my body. I felt really, really good. I don't think I'd have done that before. And the concerns that I had in the beginning, I registered right away that two of them I felt open about and one of them I felt very constricted about. And I don't know that anything really changed at the end. But the difference in those three concerns are two. Noticing a difference. Great. Yes. I'm amazed at how difficult it is to breathe in. And it's funny because I breathe out and it's so relaxed and that place of nothingness is so nice. And it's really an effort to take another breath. And I get shortness of breath a lot, kind of anxiety. And even in meditation it's so hard with this effort to take a deep breath. So what's interesting to me, that kind of statement, is how varied people's experience is in connection to the breath. And some people have the opposite experience to you where it's so comforting to breathe in and it's so frightening to let go. And the emptiness of the end is just dreadful. They can't wait to get it over because nothing's there. And so some people have a lot of trouble with the beginning of the inhalation. Some people have trouble with the beginning of the inhalation. It feels like an invasion. Some people it's the end of the inhalation. They simply don't want to let go. They want to hold on to it. Some people it's the letting go that's difficult or the end of the letting go, which is really frightening because it's a lack of control for some people. For some people some of their most subtle, underlying attitude towards life are expressed in their relationship to their breath. So sometimes it's a doorway into understanding something profound about ourselves. And it might be your case and it might not be, I don't know. But what you notice is very important to notice it. Yes? I felt more comfort at the end and while relaxation was my concern. But one of the things that was happening to me was a lot of my tension in my throat and my jaw. And when you were taking us from one spot to another, I started thinking about what I felt from here and I felt a no-breath. It was as if my breath would skip that section of my body and I could feel it elsewhere but I couldn't feel it where it was very stressed out. Often when there's a lot of stress or a lot of tightness, we lose our sensation there and we kind of go numb. And mindfulness meditation is not our job necessarily to enliven it but to be very attentive to that numbness. We just feel it for a while and get familiar with it. Sooner or later the practice by itself will bring attention to the places where there's that kind of holding. So one of the main points I wanted to make today is that, which maybe I've already made well enough now, is that many of us have our concerns that sometimes really preoccupy us, sometimes preoccupy us very powerfully. And we don't consider the fact that the way that we relate to that concern may be optional or that there are different ways of relating to that concern than the one that we have at this moment. Because it's very easy in the middle of a concern, if the mind doesn't have much space and we're kind of contracted around it, to feel like, oh, the contracted world, the contracted concern, that's the only thing I know, that's the only thing that makes sense. You're kind of running around inside the maze, not realizing you can stand up on your toes and get a broader view. So the rules or the laws or the patterns or what needs to be fixed in our life can be very limited if we only feel like we're going to fix it at the level of the thoughts themselves. So we're looking for the right thought, the right understanding, or what's this understanding, or is this a better understanding, or let's find a more positive understanding here, or always looking for some kind of understanding that's going to do the trick, that's going to solve it, or some solution. And it can sometimes be like just rearranging furniture on a Titanic. It might not be that helpful, but we think it's really important to make these arrangements and fix things on this level. And what we don't realize is that we can relate to the... we don't have to let go of the preoccupation necessarily or the concern that needs to be addressed, but it's possible to change radically the way in which you're relating to it. And that, I think, is one of the powerful things you can learn through meditation. Because most people don't realize that. They kind of think that whatever way they're relating to it, that's the way it should be, you know, what their mind is doing so it's natural, isn't it? Or whatever, they don't even think that much. But the way in which the mind relates to a problem is different than the problem itself. And one of the things we learn to do through meditation practice is we can choose that we can actually change the way we relate to some kind of issue. And because we can change it, we might be able to change it to a kind of relationship where it's actually easier to be with, or easier to problem-solve, or easier to relate to it. And one of the functions of a concentration practice is to create that shift. We tend to latch on. We often have a lot of energy, a lot of strength in the preoccupation, the concern. But what we're doing in concentration practice, either very gently, kind of gently and compassionately and with a lot of acceptance, or sometimes with actually a lot of firmness, is we're slowly developing a strength of focusing on something more wholesome, focusing on the breathing, and therefore, thereby weakening our concern or overriding our concern with our preoccupation. So if I'm really concerned about my job, what's happening to my job, there might be good reasons to be concerned about it. Meditation's not supposed to stop you from addressing real concerns. But you can be so locked on, and so much of our energy is going in there, flowing in there. But as we slowly begin to have strength and turn the light of awareness towards something else, the strength of a preoccupation and tightness around the job concern begins to weaken. And the mind begins to find some rest or some openness or some relaxation, some calmness begins setting in. And then slowly we kind of loosen our grip on our preoccupation. And then sometimes you'll feel actually a lot of calm or a lot of spaciousness or a lot of room. One of the ways of describing meditation is it's not changing anything, it's just giving yourself a bigger room for your life to occur in. Isn't that nice? It's very kind of non-violent. It means you don't have to be any different than who you are. You just have to have a bigger room for yourself. But in order to help that creation of more room, it really helps to develop concentration. And to develop concentration it helps to appreciate the value of concentration. It helps to appreciate that it's actually useful to focus mindfully on something as simple and mundane as the breathing. How many of you at some point in your meditative career have sat paying attention to your breath and felt kind of like cardboard and said, this is the most unspiritual thing in the world, why in the world am I paying attention to something so silly as the breathing? How many of you have thought that? Or at least won't admit it. It can seem very strange, the idea that you're supposed to let go of all these concerns are so important for you and focus on something as simple and uninteresting as the breath. It's not connected to anything. You're not going to write the great American novel by focusing on the breath. The breath is just a breath. But as you can focus on the breathing and develop more stability and more relaxation, more resting on the breath, more continuously, find and take an interest in the breath. Really take an interest in feeling it. Feel it like you've never felt it before. Let yourself be absorbed in the breathing process. Have a great devotion and love to it. Almost like you're floating on the breath. That kind of absorption or involvement of the breath will begin weakening all the kind of preoccupations or the tightness we have around the preoccupations. And you'll probably find that you'll get more calm and more space. And then you have a very different relationship to your concerns. You might realize a number of different things. You might realize you didn't have a problem to begin with. That's nice. You might realize that maybe the problem is not such a big deal anymore. Maybe you really do have a problem, maybe it's not such a big deal. And because you realize it's not such a big deal, maybe you'll address it in a different way than you would otherwise. Maybe you have enough fresh air to look at it that you see it in a new way and you see some solution for it, which happens sometimes. And perhaps the most profound thing you can sometimes feel from deep state of really being very simple with the breath and getting very calm is that there can be a feeling that it's completely okay to have this problem. It goes so far, as some people will report, that their sense of being complete as a human being includes having the problem. That many of us, we have a problem, and we think I'm only going to become whole or healed if I fix that problem. What you can learn from meditation is that you can actually be so much bigger than your problem that you can actually feel complete as a human being, even if you have that problem. Isn't that great? You don't have to fix it in order to feel complete. But some of us are so concerned about fixing and self-improvement and making it better for me or my suffering and my this and my that. When the mind becomes quite spacious or open or relaxed, it's possible to experience difficulty, something which is of concern or some problem, and not even have the idea that it really refers to me personally. It's there, it's part of this life here, and I'll address it the most responsible I can. But it's not a personal statement about my own failings, it's just the difficulty. We tend to interpret very quickly, and that interpretation makes often a very small room. It's possible to have the experience of feeling like you're complete as human being. Everything is right in the universe while you still have a problem. Isn't that great? I hope you hear this is a great relief. I have a question about that because I think I can remind you of saying that we continually create our own suffering from the present moment. Uh oh. I'll leave you. Sorry. I've heard you say before that we continually create our suffering from the present moment. Yes. In other words, we don't have this problem, we continually are making up this problem. Oh yes. Right. But kind of what it sounds to me like you're saying now is that here's this problem kind of separate from ourselves. It may be, but the distinction here is the distinction between suffering and a problem. If driving over here today, if I got a flat tire, I would have had a problem. Whether I suffered around that problem is optional. If I've been running around Palo Alto today, trying to do all my shopping and do all this stuff and been really harried and oh my God, you know, it's five minutes to seven. I'm never going to get there on time and these people are going to be upset with me and maybe they'll go home before I get here and what am I going to do and now I have a flat tire and I don't have a spare and you know, how am I going to get fixed? Oh my God, it's such a, my whole life is a disaster and this is it. This is the end. And there's a way in which our frantic kind of harried life sometimes reinforces the problem, makes it much bigger than it is. But making such a big problem out of that flat tire is optional. You know, I don't know, I could, oh, it's a flat tire. Oh, it's a problem. I've come late to my sitting group. It's not very nice. People are waiting, quietly meditating, I hope. You know, but, but, you know, it's a problem, but I don't have to suffer because of it. That's the distinction. So our suffering we create moment by moment. Our problems, we don't create our problems, you know, the nail on the road. I created that problem. That's a very important distinction. Does that make sense, the distinction to everyone? Yes. Does that distinction hold true for and true probably with life or being? To a great extent it can be. We could have some kind of disease and then we can relate to it in ways that cause suffering. We can relate to it in ways that don't cause suffering. We can be filled with fear. We can be filled with hate and aversion towards it or confusion. Or we can not. We can constrict and get tight around it and worry or not. And I know that our diseases are more comfortable, generally speaking. Our diseases are more comfortable and heal more quickly if we don't have a relationship of aversion to it or fear to it. Does that make sense? Another way of putting that, could you say that you would not have an attachment or a particular outcome? In other words, you'd be more open to accepting whatever, you know, about the tire or the disease or whatever. Yeah, I mean, if I, yeah, yeah, in a sense. I mean, I wouldn't be too accepting about the flat tire. You know, the tire was going to keep me from getting here in time. All these people are waiting for me to show up and stuff. And I feel some responsibility to come here. I'm not going to accept, you know, sit there on the sidewalk and sooner or later someone will come along. Sooner or later someone will notice I'm sitting here and wonder if I need any help and offer some help and everything will be fine. And, you know, there's no hurry. I mean, I can just take my time and, you know, I'll go get some coffee while I'm, you know, wondering what to do. And then if it's after 8 30, I'll just go home, you know, they won't be there anyway. So I wouldn't operate that way. I wouldn't have that level of acceptance. I would actually, my mind wouldn't get contracted. My awareness, my heart would accept the fact. But I would still operate. You know, I have a responsibility to get here quickly. So what would be the most efficient, quickest way to fix this problem? That hadn't occurred to me. Thank you. So I'm saying, I said mostly yes to you, but I'm saying we'd only be too naive of what acceptance means. That we could still be concerned about the outcome, but we can do it in a very relaxed way. And if it doesn't turn out the way you want it to turn out, then it's okay too, maybe. Yes, Barbara. Well, first I'd like to ask everybody to pray for me that I could do something in a very relaxed way and not be constricted. I was taking a story as I was preaching that, you know, and the one guy, so I guess I didn't get it. He didn't do anything, but then he walked to the door and he got out. I've heard this before, I still don't get it. Because during this meditation, I came in and my main problem was my back was really bad, which I got scoliosis and it was the bad. So I tried to do the breathing and not focus on how I'm comfortable and the pain and stuff. And so I guess I'm trying to deal with the difference, later on, how you, you know, not attachment. I tried to be not attached to it and I found myself constricted and clinging to it. And furthermore, I made a resolution for the year 2000 that I was going to live in the present moment and be really cool. And so I wasn't at all. So it was like, you know, anyway. So I don't get how the heart, you know, you can track if the heart stays open or how you can... I didn't want to feel the pain. I wanted to like, you know, just breathe and all that stuff. And so then I let myself come down and lay down and I feel like I still look there. But you know what I'm saying? One of the great truths of life is that reality often has a different agenda than you do. And so if we're kind of stubborn with our agenda and reality, which is a much bigger thing than we are, has a different agenda and we're kind of stubborn about our agenda, we can create a lot of suffering. So in your situation, I'm a little bit responsible for it because I was guiding you with a particular kind of practice. So, you know, it was kind of a setup then to kind of maybe think that, oh, I'm supposed to be doing this, the breath, rather than paying attention to my back. But in your situation, something really strong like that is really calling for your attention rather than struggling against it. The trick is to enter mindfully in the present moment with your pain. And as you do that, then various things can happen. You can develop concentration on that, which can be very helpful in the way of me talking about today. What do you enter mindfully in the moment with the pain? Enter the pain. So it's not trying to make believe it's not there? Absolutely. Don't pretend it's not there. Go feel it carefully. Don't try to run away from it. Don't try to fix it. Just feel it really intimately. And you might find, in doing that, you might find a different relationship to it. Or you might discover what relationship you do have to it that's adding to your suffering. Because physical pain and suffering in the same way are two different things. I know. So, you know, I know these things, but when I look at that, and also when you're thinking and still have some worrying and planning and stuff, you know, doing all that stuff, my goal for the year 2000 is not to be my problems. So if I meditate, and I think that's all that comes in, I hear you saying, as we keep trying to focus on the breath. We can get away from being our own problems. Yes. Sometimes I work that way. And what I was teaching today was a very simple breath meditation for the purposes of concentration. A mindfulness meditation, of course, is much wider in its scope than a simple breath meditation. So there are some times in your life where you might find that just doing simple breath meditation is really helpful and useful. And it's the foundation of mindfulness practice also, so it's a good thing to do. But that, as a person understands the instructions of mindfulness, they learn that it's quite appropriate to let go of the breath at times and bring their attention, the meditative attention to other areas of their life. To their physical pain or their emotions or their thoughts or whatever. And so part of the skill of someone learning to meditate is to know where to bring their attention. And that skill is not necessarily easy to learn, but it's more things we have to learn. So the thing about disease, I remember someone asked me, I was interviewed on the radio some months ago, and someone asked me about depression. And how mindfulness can help someone who's depressed. And there's many ways it might help. There's many ways it might not be helpful. But depression is such a huge wide-ranging phenomena. So many different things that can bring on depression. So any simple thing you might say might be not really addressed to a particular person. But one of the kind of universal things that I think is true often with many states like depression or grief or sadness or whatever, is that it can be very helpful to look at how we relate to it. And we might not get rid of it or might not fix it or solve it. Depression might be either the shame associated with it or the guilt or the aversion or the embarrassment or all these other associated or fear. The associated things we add on top of it, that might be able to be addressed and resolved by seeing it very clearly through mindfulness. But the depression might never go away, but it becomes a little bit more okay to have it because you're not so embarrassed by it. That makes sense? So other thoughts and concerns that you might have. Yes? What happens sometimes in my meditations, and I kind of enjoy it in a kind of strange way, is I don't regurgitate my concerns of the day, but I have these kind of fantasy memories of my parents, of situations I never was in with them. You know, my mom and my dad were both in the seas now for some time. And it's like, it's almost like a surreal experience, like I'm back there with them. And maybe what's going on is I'm dealing with an issue of attachment or loss. So it's not like, Jim, we're not going broke today, or I'm going to burn somebody's house down with my work or something. But what happens with me, I think, is at a deeper level, is that's an issue, and I kind of see that sort of what kind of comes up. And I'm trying to be mindful. I'm not trying to... These thoughts come up not when I'm fishing for them. They come up, it's spontaneous. And if I go try to fish for those kind of thoughts, they don't happen. It's also possible that the more concentrated you get, the calmer you get in meditation, the more likely these things are to surface. Yeah. I guess probably, maybe it's like I should say it's unresolved business or something like that, but it's not a concern of sorts or a problem. But it's more a matter of just, maybe it's just an issue of my psyche that has to be somehow dealt with or something. Yeah. Or maybe it doesn't have to be dealt with, it just has to be... Sometimes in meditation certain things just arise as part of... And I'd say this way, that the appearance of some things is just... It doesn't represent a problem or something needs to be fixed, it's just the end run of something, just the final purging of something that has to happen. It's a symptom of final purging, or emptying of something. And so it's not necessarily a matter to be addressed, it's just a matter to let it happen when it happens. That's one approach. There's a lot to maybe be explored with what you pointed out, and if you... That's something maybe just that. One of the things that can be help interesting to do in this kind of situation, they might point to a little bit more clarity what's going on, is if as soon as it's happened, or soon after it's happened, this memory, is to see... Notice what is the emotional state that is currently present, and what was the emotional state that immediately preceded the memory arising? And sometimes seeing the way the emotion might be might give you some clue about what is going on. And more importantly, it's often the emotional level that needs to be processed, not the level of the memories and the thoughts. And so if you can feel the simple emotions connected to that event, sometimes the processing can happen easier. You don't have to do anything, you just have to feel it. But that makes sense? Yes? I have a similar experience to that. I seem to repeat the most. I'll come and I'll sort of start up, and several minutes into the meditation I will be able to sit up straight up. Yes. So I always know what needs to happen. I always get to become more alive or something like that. And then after a period of time, I guess I become relaxed. And I get similar kinds of experiences, but usually they have to do with vacations that I've been on or something like that. And then it's very hard to stay awake. And what I have noticed is that if I'm focusing on the breath immediately, my mind goes to something else, but all falsely. I mean, my head will just fall down and I'll wake up. And I do that with chiseling. I'll do that 10-15 times in a half an hour in the last 10 minutes of the meditation. I'm alive, I'm not sure. But it's usually towards the end. Often as we get more settled and more concentrated in our sitting, the body can write itself a little bit more. It's easier to sit up like you described. And as that process of deepening, settling, or further concentration continues, it can bring on a little bit too much calm. And when there's a lot of calm and together with some concentration, it's fairly common for people to begin thinking about some very pleasant thoughts. And maybe the vacations are very pleasant for you, the vacations you've had been on. And so your mind goes down this pleasant track of remembering those. And that pleasantness then can further seduce you into further calm, and the mind starts shutting down and going to sleep. So you might want to, when you notice these kind of memories of vacations coming up, you might be trying to bring up a little bit more energy into the system. Just a little bit more energy in applying your mindfulness to the breath or to what's going on. And being diligent to let go of those thoughts as quickly as you can, so that you can have a balance of energy and calm. It isn't that you have to become less calm or less concentrated, but you have to match that level of calm with a level of engagement with the practice. You could also worry some more. You can, you know, click the list of really the top 10 best worries, you know, and have it in your pocket. If you start getting really sleepy, just pull it out. I think it's very, very similar in my experiences. And there are times that I just go to a standing meditation. And it really does really work, because now I just have one more thing that keeps me mindful. It's balance when I start to notice it. And it's like, okay, fine, concentrate. That's great. Yeah, so standing meditation is very helpful when you, if you feel like you're getting sleepy or feel like there's not enough energy in the system to match, then standing up can bring that energy in. Sometimes just sitting up straight or intentionally can do it. Standing is a great, great thing to do. Also doing walking meditation. So last one, and then we'll sit some more. It's just one, I thought there was a distinction between the plasma sitting and concentration practice. And now it seems like it's the same. There is. There is a simple meditation, breath meditation. It's more like concentration. There isn't, there isn't a difference. People love this to explore this, this, this distinction, but no, no, it's fine. I mean, it's a good, good question. The too much is made of this distinction because a certain amount of concentration necessary for mindfulness practice, certain amount of mindfulness necessary for concentration practice, it has to do with the proportions of each. And with pure concentration practice, there's much more concentration than mindfulness involved. With mindfulness, there's much more mindfulness than concentration, but you need concentration to do mindfulness practice. It's also possible to use the breath to cultivate both up to a certain degree. So just being with breath is a mindfulness practice, and being with breath because it's one simple experience helps cultivate concentration also. There's a tendency in Buddhism to be somewhat pragmatic. And it's a little bit about what, so we kind of figure out what do I need right now in my practice. And if the mind is really scattered, maybe the person needs more to develop concentration in that particular day or week than they do to develop mindfulness. And so they might then spend more time just being really simple with the breath and not paying attention to anything else than what we do with mindfulness. But if some reoccurring thing occurs that really makes it difficult to be with the breath, then maybe just forget about the constant string of breath and bring the mindfulness to bear on that other thing. So it can be a little bit fluid, the distinction, and it's not such a sharp line as the books want to say it is between the two of them. So tonight we just did a very simple breath meditation, and if you find that useful, it's really great. And then if you don't find it useful, then do the mindfulness practice. And for those of you who might be new, maybe this will all be in a little more sense starting next week. Because next Thursday is the beginning of the five-week introductory course, and that means that the Thursday schedule changes. We still start at seven, but instead of starting with half an hour of meditation, we start with some discussion and instruction, and then we have some meditation in the hour and a half, but not as much as we do on these regular Thursdays. Because I'm going to go through the five-week systematic instructions on the basic practice of mindfulness meditation. So that's next week at seven. Before we sit, I might also say that on January 22nd, which is a Saturday, we have a one-day sitting, a one-day retreat at St. Mark's, which is an Episcopal Church down the street in Colorado. Six hundred Colorado, and it's from nine to four thirty, and everyone's welcome to come. And if you've never been there before, you might wonder. There's a whole bunch of newsletters now out in the table outside that has the address and what you need to know about coming to it. And the other thing is, the following day, which is Sunday the 23rd, we're going to have a Sangha meeting, which is periodically we have kind of a meeting of our community, meditation community, which everyone's invited to come to, where we kind of talk about, I don't know if business is the right word, but kind of talk about our fears together or our concerns together as a community and what we're doing and our organization. And also it's a forum for people to bring up concerns they might have that aren't a little bit not addressed, you know, on Thursday or Monday night, where it's a little bit more have to do with the practice itself, as opposed to wider concerns like, if someone has some problem with me, you know, they might not want to bring it up here, but these community meetings is a good place. Hey, you know, I wanted to ask you about this thing you. So there's a whole range of things that might happen these community meetings. One of the things will happen this time is we'll give an update on what's going on with our search for a building to get our own center. So that's Sunday at 6 30 to 8 30 on January 23rd. And that's all at St. Mark's also 600 Colorado, the Parashaw. That's also in the newsletter announcement for that. Sorry. And it's not dinner, but it's a feast.
