The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

In our practice, exploring ourselves as we are,
we're encouraged to notice things that are not so helpful,
that tend to create stress and suffering,
and being mindful of experience begins to point this out to us,
begins to actually point out to us what does create stress,
suffering, unsatisfactoriness, feelings of distress or unease.
So mindfulness is really helpful in pointing that out to us,
what is helpful and what is unhelpful.
The teachings kind of have a fairly simple definition in a way,
things that are unhelpful are states of mind that are rooted in greed,
aversion and delusion, wanting things to be a certain way,
trying to hold on, trying to make them be a certain way,
wanting to get rid of things we don't like, confusion about experience.
What is wholesome or helpful in our experience is rooted in the absence of those qualities,
non-greed, non-aversion, non-delusion.
That can be expressed in positive terms.
The wholesome qualities can be expressed in positive terms,
love, kindness, compassion, wisdom, patience, joy, delight.
There's a whole host of many lists.
I think many of you know that the Buddha loved to offer lists in his teachings.
And several of the lists, quite a few of the lists,
include a whole bunch of these beautiful qualities, wholesome qualities of mind.
And we're encouraged not only to recognize what is wholesome and unwholesome,
what's helpful and unhelpful.
And mindfulness helps us to recognize both sides of this.
As I said a few minutes ago, you know, when we notice things that are unhelpful,
when we notice things that are based in greed, aversion and delusion,
we recognize that actually we feel the distress of it.
And in that recognition, our system begins to learn and to understand
these things are not helpful.
And on the other side, as we begin to touch into qualities that are wholesome and beautiful,
the delight and joy, patience and kindness, wisdom, equanimity,
as we begin to feel into those qualities as they arise,
as we recognize what it feels like when greed is not happening, when aversion is not happening.
We feel the...
What's the right word?
There's something in us that kind of feels the rightness of that or feels the non-constrictedness of that.
It feels like we're not suffering.
And so there's a kind of a way that the taste or the touching into those wholesome qualities
or beautiful qualities with mindfulness begins to give us a very direct experience of,
oh, this way, this actually feels like the way to ease and peace in my life.
This feels like a way to navigate my life with much less reactivity.
And so the teachings, the Buddhist teachings kind of give equal balance in the teaching on wise effort,
equal balance to recognizing, letting go of and refraining from engaging in the unwholesome
and cultivating and maintaining or supporting the wholesome.
The teaching on wise effort encourages us both to let go of,
to recognize the conditions that create the arising of the unwholesome and to let go of that
and to create, shape, cultivate the conditions that support these beautiful unwholesome qualities.
The main, one quality of mind that does both simultaneously, I'll just say this up front,
one quality of mind that does both of those things simultaneously is mindfulness.
Because as we are paying attention and noticing what's happening, mindfulness itself,
when we are cultivating that quality to just have that curiosity, what is this?
What is this experience? That mindfulness itself is a wholesome quality.
It's rooted in wisdom. And so right there we're cultivating that wholesome quality.
But if we are kind of meeting a difficult state of mind like frustration or impatience,
something like that, with this quality of mind that is balanced, that is curious,
sometimes as we're exploring that, as we're kind of able to just be curious,
it's like, oh, what is this impatience?
Sometimes we can actually feel into the qualities of mind
or the sense of what it feels like to have that connection or care
as I spoke about in the guided meditation, the care that I care about what's happening here
as if it is a good friend. As I said in the guided meditation,
if a good friend sat down with you and you were really frustrated and your good friend said,
how are you? I really want to know how you are.
We would feel held. We would feel like, oh, somebody sees me, somebody understands something.
Maybe they don't directly know everything that's going on, but they're interested.
So there's a feeling of love, of care, of connection there.
And so sometimes when we are noticing something that's challenging
or some kind of difficult experience with mindfulness,
we can recognize that the container or the field in which that experience is being held
has some softness, has some care, has some love or kindness in it.
And in the guided meditation, I was encouraging you to see
if you might be able to touch that or just have a sense or taste that
sense that even just the simple act of being mindful
is a very beautiful and caring thing to do for ourselves.
And so this kind of exploration or curiosity, just with mindfulness,
can begin to strengthen that quality,
that beautiful wholesome quality of care, of love, of connectedness, of concern.
And so mindfulness itself, whatever's happening in our experience
if we are paying attention to difficult qualities of mind,
mindfulness will be supporting the letting go of that difficult quality.
It will be supporting the release of that difficult quality
through the understanding that we gain in terms of recognizing,
oh, this actually hurts, this doesn't feel so good.
But it is also at the same time shaping and connecting us with
some of these beautiful qualities of mind in some of these lists,
like confidence, faith, and delight, kindness, care, patience, balance of mind.
So the mindfulness kind of brings those qualities along for the ride.
And so this is mostly, this is a lot of what we teach in terms of the practice here at IMC.
We explore mindfulness as this way to both let go of the unwholesome
and cultivate and nurture the wholesome.
And there are some things that I want to just touch into
because we don't speak as much or I don't talk as much at least
about directly cultivating the wholesome.
What are ways to touch into that, to support and nourish those qualities of mind?
Because those two will support us in our path, in our journey.
So as I said, there's a lot of different ones of these wholesome qualities
and I'll just name some of them.
I've already named a few of them, but there's a few lists
that if you're interested you could look up these lists.
So the Brahma Vaharas is one list of wholesome qualities.
And that includes for heart qualities, love,
I'll say both the English and the Pali, love or metta, compassion or karuna,
sympathetic joy or murita, and equanimity or upeka.
So those are some wholesome qualities that the Buddha talked about a lot in the text
and encouraged us to develop them and cultivate them.
He both encouraged us to develop them and cultivate them
and also to recognize that they are kind of natural results
as we let go of the reactivity.
And this is one of the key understandings about some of these wholesome qualities
that as the mind lets go of greed, aversion and delusion,
as it lets go of reactivity, as it lets go of anger,
it's much easier to kind of connect with love and care.
As it lets go of greed, it's much easier to connect with generosity and connection.
As it lets go of delusion, it's much easier to connect with wisdom
and equanimity and balance of mind.
And so sometimes we can find that just the release of the unwholesome,
just the kind of the balance of mind,
just the mind that understands and lets go of reactivity.
Sometimes we can find that some of these qualities of the Brahma Vahara
naturally arise in that release.
But sometimes, and for me I think I was one of these people
that these qualities, these wholesome qualities were not my...
I hadn't spent a lot of time with them in my childhood or occasionally,
but they weren't my go-to things, they weren't my go-to strategies.
And so I didn't have a lot of familiarity with something like compassion for instance.
I could feel a lot of ease or balance of mind,
but I didn't really quite touch into the quality of compassion.
And so there were some explorations I did around this
and these are the kinds of things we can explore around some of these wholesome qualities.
I'll talk about that.
I'll just mention for myself how that unfolded around compassion
just to kind of give you a flavor of what I'm talking about.
So in talking with people sometimes I was listening to them,
like I wasn't being a really good friend, I was listening, I was hearing,
I was really able to be present for people.
And what people said back to me was how much they felt like I was really...
it was the feeling of being cared for,
they had the feeling of compassion or love or something coming from me.
And I thought that was interesting because what I was mostly experiencing
was really just interest and kind of a balance of mind.
I was not reactive, but I didn't experience the feeling of compassion.
But people were telling me how much compassion they were feeling for me
and I was like, well, this is really curious, I'm curious about this.
I know I'm not feeling it, but what's going on?
And I talked to a bunch of different teachers about this.
And several of them just said something like, oh, don't worry about it, it's already there.
And I thought, okay, but that's not very helpful for helping me to actually feel it.
How do I know it's there? I don't feel it.
And then one teacher talked to me, as I described this experience,
he actually had an instruction for me.
And he said, you know, when you're talking to people,
your mind probably is really naturally orienting to kind of the...
just the nature of experience as empty.
And it's like, he said, try when you're in that kind of a situation
to think about the person, connect with the person you're with.
Think about them as a person, just in a simple way.
Like, oh, this is so and so sitting in front of me.
There's just a very natural way my mind would just orient to things arising and passing.
Oh, this is what's happening, this is arising and passing.
And so I had an opportunity, just a few minutes after this teacher talked to me.
And sitting with somebody, I was listening to them and hearing them,
and I thought, oh, here's an opportunity.
And I turned to think, oh, this is this person sitting in front of me
and they have their issues and concerns and worries,
just like connecting, thinking about them as another being.
Just in an ordinary way, thinking about them as a person.
And instantly I felt the compassion.
So it was like a part of my mind that...
The other teacher was right in a way.
It was very accessible.
Once I turned my mind to orient to the entirety of the experience
in a different way than I had been.
And it's hard to quite describe how I had been orienting,
more just like, this is what's happening, this is what I'm experiencing,
this is what this person is saying,
just kind of like very...
in very much this the way of just knowing experience as experience.
But not so much the ordinary everydayness of connecting with somebody.
And when I did that, when I just oriented towards that connecting,
the feeling of compassion was there.
And this was really...
I mean, this makes a lot of sense to me as I think about it
because these emotions of the Brahma Vaharas are emotions of relationship.
And so it was in the relationship as I connected to the relational that I felt it.
So this was a kind of a piece that I saw,
oh, for me actually I may need to lean in a little bit
to cultivate some of these wholesome qualities.
They're not just going to appear for me when Greta version and delusion fall away.
And so how can I cultivate some of these qualities?
What can I do?
And so we don't have a lot of time here this evening,
but I want to just offer a couple of thoughts,
and just some kind of basic overarching thoughts.
So one is kind of an interest or kind of in a way
picking a particular quality that you may be interested in cultivating.
You know, the Parames is a great list.
I'll just name the Parames right now.
I'm going to forget them, so I'll pull them up in front of me.
So there are ten Parames,
and these are beautiful qualities that they can kind of be thought of as a kind of a,
one supports the next as a kind of a list in a way to generosity,
virtue, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience,
truthfulness, determination, loving kindness, and equanimity.
And so, you know, you can, some of those,
some of those are really great daily life qualities to cultivate.
Generosity, ethics, patience particularly, truthfulness,
you know, all of these, loving kindness,
all of these are very much relational qualities.
And in fact, the qualities of the Parames are said to be kind of like,
in Asia that's understood to be a daily life practice.
You know, that if you go to the monastery as a lay person,
the teacher will often ask you,
how's your Parames practice?
You know, what Parames are you working on?
What Parames are you cultivating?
And so, if you have these list of qualities in your mind,
you could pick one that feels particularly resonant or interesting for you.
For a period of time, I picked patience,
because impatience was so big for me.
And, you know, so, you know,
just picking something that feels resonant for you.
And then playing with ways to cultivate that quality.
Some of these wholesome qualities have whole practices associated
with them, like Metta, for instance, loving kindness,
has a whole series of meditations that support cultivating it.
But looking, I like to explore and to encourage people to look at
what it might mean to cultivate that in daily life.
What are things we might explore or do that would cultivate it in daily life?
And here's where I would encourage you to just be creative.
For you, what would support cultivating that quality?
So for me, around compassion, you know,
I asked a whole bunch of teachers about this,
and finally I got this one tool.
It's like, pay attention to the relationship.
So I started doing that a lot,
and felt much more into the relational emotions that were available.
Both the emotional, relational emotions of the wholesome
and some of the, I was pretty familiar with the relational emotions
of anger and frustration, but less familiar with the wholesome ones.
And so, you know, just orienting towards that relational peace
with mindfulness was a way for me to play with cultivating that in daily life.
So find some ways to, you know, picking one of these qualities
if you're interested in exploring cultivating the wholesome,
picking one of these qualities, and then looking at it.
So there's a couple ways you can explore this.
You know, look at when kind of the basic ways are notice when it's there.
So for me, that was pretty hard with compassion because I wasn't noticing it.
And notice when it's not there.
So notice when it's absent and just be curious about that.
So it's not there.
And in a way, that's what I was doing too.
It's like, I don't feel it.
You know, even when I try to turn and people say, oh, it's there,
and I turn, it's like, I don't find it.
I don't get it.
I'm not feeling it.
And so just noticing that, that helped me to kind of do this investigation
and check in with teachers and then find this tool to connect with the relational.
But you can also just notice like the presence and absence of the quality itself.
That's one way.
That's using mindfulness to support the quality.
So for instance, with patients, cultivating patients, you know,
you could notice when patience is there.
The other day I was, maybe it was even just this morning.
I don't remember.
Very recently, you know, I was just really noticing the quality of the mind
was really at ease and I was like in the kitchen, I was doing things.
And there was just so much kind of spaciousness.
There was kind of a sense of, oh, I have lots of time
and there's the quality of patience that was there.
So I noticed that.
I noticed that quality in the mind.
And then there was a time later in the day when I noticed, oh, yeah,
I'm a little bit like rushed or something.
And so I was noticing a little bit of the impatience.
I was working with ants in the kitchen.
I was scooping them up to put them outside
and just a tiny bit of impatience with that.
I've got something else I need to do and I have to deal with these ants.
So just noticing that impatience and trying to slow down a little bit
and be careful.
So that kind of piece of just cultivating,
knowing when is present, knowing when it's absent.
And then for patients in particular, I created this.
And this is where I encourage you to get creative.
It's like, I'm not going to go through all of these armies
and try to give you a practice for each one.
But if one of them resonates with you, you can explore for yourself.
First noticing the presence and absence.
And then potentially seeing what might help me to cultivate that.
What conditions might support cultivating that?
Can I play with it?
Can I create a practice for myself?
So the practice I created for myself around patience was...
I noticed that when I was impatient,
often my actions got kind of jarred or jerky.
So I noticed this when I was at the drugstore one day.
I actually just told the story the other day.
So this is a recording very recently.
I was at a drugstore and I was really impatient,
feeling like I needed to get done with being in that drugstore.
And I noticed I was picking things up off the shelf
and throwing them in my basket.
And that was how the impatience was expressing itself.
And so I just decided,
okay, I'm going to play with this.
I'm going to not try to repress the impatience in my mind.
I'm going to know it's there.
I'm going to fully be aware of it.
I'm going to see if I cannot let it leak out into my behavior.
So I'm going to just be...
Anybody looking at me would think I was really patient and at ease,
even though my mind was not.
And so I started moving slowly.
I picked the thing up off the shelf
and I put it in my basket carefully
and then I'd walk a little further and get the next thing.
And I did that, not repressing the impatience in the mind.
Really clearly aware.
Yeah, wow, this feels really interesting.
It's like I'm an actor
and I'm acting against the grain here.
So I was feeling the impatience,
but acting as though I had as much time as I needed.
But what was so interesting to me is in that
was within about a minute or two,
the mind shifted.
So it was like the activity of slowing down the behavior
had a rebound effect on the mind.
And so that gave me a really fun thing to play with
when I experienced impatience.
And that's kind of what I was doing the other day with the ants.
It's like, oh right, I can slow this down.
I can just be careful with this.
So being creative in daily life with finding ways
to cultivate the wholesome.
Familiarizing yourself with these lists.
I've given two of them.
I could say two of the key ones,
the Paramis and the Brahma Vaharas.
And if there's any of those that seem interesting for you
to cultivate, exploring that,
and particularly in daily life.
In sitting meditation,
I really like to encourage people to just be mindful,
practice mindfulness, and notice what's here.
You're cultivating the wholesome quality of mindfulness there.
And you're cultivating the stability of mind with concentration,
another wholesome quality of mind.
But in daily life, it's a real opportunity
to begin to see, kind of do inventory,
take in what are the Paramis that might use some development.
Like for myself, I did an inventory once,
I'm like, oh yeah, impatience, that's pretty strong.
So let me work on patience.
Let me explore that.
So you could explore cultivating wholesome in this way.
