So now we're going to do our metapractice. Yeah, get comfortable.
Yeah, go ahead.
Getting settled in your little nest, breathing in and out from your heart
center so that you can feel your shoulders relax, your body relax, and your heart relaxed,
your fist area around your physical heart. And what we're going to do is begin with oneself
for the benefactor and go on through the individuals and then radiating out in widening circles
around us to include more beings. So as usual, traditionally, we begin with oneself and if
that's challenging for you, remember you can begin with someone easy, benefactor or friend you can
easily open your heart to. I'll use the wording for oneself and you can just change it as needed.
So have a sense of yourself just sitting here in the way we're going to offer Meta to oneself is
not only to offer but also to receive. Feeling the breath coming in and out from the heart center
and from that place taking some time to reflect upon whatever goodness of your own life of your
own heart of your own beingness, you can bring up recognize and acknowledge the very fact that
you've come to this place to bring attention to what's going on within you so that you have
greater knowledge of yourself. This is a good thing to do and your ability to do the best you
can to stay with it, to stay open to the guidance to apply it. So reflect on your goodness.
And even during that reflection of your own goodness, if you tune into that Meta opening in
your heart, whatever that is for you, a feeling of more acceptance, feeling of gratitude for
yourself, appreciation for all that you have in your life, tuning into that and radiating
that aspect of Meta throughout your whole body, kind of welling up from your heart center like
a fountain or use the words that help you to tune into your intention for offering and receiving
goodwill. I'll repeat them again but you can use your own words as you need to. May I be safe
and protected from all harm. Peaceful and happy. May this body be healthy and strong.
My heart be at ease no matter what's happening. Using those words as intentions of goodwill
towards yourself or any words you wish to use. Allowing that intention to radiate from your
heart center throughout your whole body, your organs, your bones, your muscles, your cells.
Radiating up through your heart center, up like a fountain, pouring out that Meta outside
of your body as well. Safe, protected. Use your own words.
What is your most noble intention for yourself? A blessing? A blessing? A blessing? A blessing?
You bestow upon yourself.
Gently keeping that momentum going.
And
when you're ready, moving on to a benefactor or you can remain with oneself. Choosing that
being who has benefited you. Having a sense of who it is. A visual sense, a felt sense.
And use the time to reflect on this person and their goodness as a way of connecting
more fully, more clearly.
Offering your goodwill to this person.
Hearing the phrases that you connect with. May you be safe, protected. May your heart
be at ease. And if the words don't come, you can just connect with that pure intention
from your heart. Letting that intention radiate out from your heart center to this person.
As an energy or a light, sometimes people see a color. Let it represent that pure intention
of goodwill.
Letting that intention radiate out from your heart center to this person.
Letting that intention radiate out from your heart center to this person.
Letting that intention radiate out from your heart center to this person.
So, in your own words, what would be the most noble wish you could offer to this person
as a blessing of goodwill?
Thank you.
And moving on to the next individual or remaining with the benefactor
if it feels strong for you. The next one is a dear friend or a family member, a loved
one. Again, someone you can easily open your heart to. I have a sense of who it is. See
if you can remember this person in a place where it makes it really useful for you to
offer your goodwill.
What do you remember about this person that makes your heart open? Something that you're
grateful for about this person in your life?
And if, and when you sense that kind of unconditional friendliness, you stay with that.
Rating that towards this person, the friendliness of your heart, towards this person. No need
for words sometimes. Or use the words that work for you. Representing your pure intention
to offer goodwill. Peaceful and happy, healthy and strong.
Peaceful and happy.
When your mind wanders, just come back. Begin again.
Thank you.
Now moving on to the next individual, someone you feel relatively neutral towards.
Who's the person that you would like to offer Meta to?
Could be someone here, perhaps someone on staff.
Someone you don't know so well in your neighborhood.
It could be a sibling, someone you feel fairly neutral about.
Someone who doesn't stand out so much in your life.
And what we reflect upon with this person is the fact that all beings wish to be happy and peaceful, just like ourselves.
We have that in common with all beings.
Just as I wish to be happy, this person also wishes to be happy.
Now let the momentum of the Meta that has been developed flow on to this person.
Use the words that help you stay connected.
Just as I wish to be safe and protected, may you also be safe and protected.
Keep going in your own way.
Keep going.
Keep going.
And now let the momentum flow on to the last individual, someone you feel difficulty in your own heart towards this person.
So have a sense of who it is, could actually be someone you love very much.
But there's also this difficulty.
Have a sense of who it is visually or a felt sense.
If you're the visual type, you might remember this person in a place that's easy for you to offer Meta in a safe place.
A person could seem farther away from you, not right next to you.
See what feels comfortable.
And if it's possible, remember something about this person that kind of softens your heart.
Maybe it's like they're doing the best they can.
Sometimes it helps to remember their suffering, opens the compassionate heart, an aspect of Meta.
And if you sense that kind of unconditional friendliness in your heart, let that flow on to this person, releasing it, pervading it, even without words.
And by intention, I offer you my unconditional goodwill.
Use your own words.
Whenever you find it difficult, you can go back to oneself and offer yourself Meta.
Returning back to this person whenever you can, if you can.
If you can.
Then allowing that person to remain in the field of your loving kindness, your Meta.
And see what happens when you place your dear friend to one side of the person, benefactor to the other side.
What happens when you send Meta to this person within this group, offering all of them Meta, including this one you're having difficulty with?
May you all be safe and protected, peaceful, happy.
Enlarging that group to include everyone here in this room.
Spreading that Meta out in a bigger circle.
May all beings here be safe on your journeys, your inner journeys, your journeys through life.
May you all be safe.
May all the blessings of the Dharma be bestowed upon you.
Now enlarging that circle so that our families are included.
The ones nearest and dearest to us, the ones we always remember.
Family and friends.
Provading that loving kindness to everyone, without distinction, living no one out.
May you all be peaceful, happy.
Enlarging that circle further to include all the beings here on this land, all the human beings.
Maybe there are some that are not here in this room for one reason or another.
All the animals, the creatures around, the guardians of the land, those seen and unseen.
May your home always be safe and protected, peaceful, happy.
Expanding to include all the neighbors around us.
Allowing the force, the gentle force of that momentum of Meta to grow, going out over the land around us.
To the neighbors, to the villagers here in this small village town.
The energy from your heart center flowing out.
And expanding further as far as you feel safe to go.
All the beings on this land, this continent, find your way.
See it in your own mind and heart.
All the beings of the land, may you all be safe and protected.
May no harm come to you.
All the beings of the waters, seen and unseen, known and unknown.
Happy, peaceful.
Energy of the heart, radiating out.
Gently, no force, just let it flow.
All the beings of the air, of space around us.
Safe, protected.
May all beings of this planet,
all the leaders, all of our elders, all of the children, everyone in between.
May your hearts be filled with goodwill.
May the leaders be righteous.
May all beings everywhere in every direction, without exception.
May you all be safe, peaceful.
May all beings be truly free.
