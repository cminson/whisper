 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Hello, friends. Hello. Greetings from Mountain View, California, where I am, on seated Ohlone land. And good morning, good afternoon, good day to all of you, wherever in the world you are. I'm delighted to be with you this week and supporting Gail and all of us. Greetings from... Oh, great. There. Okay, I'm going to call it glitch. Yes. Feeling into gratitude, feeling into my gratitude for this moment in time, for us being together in this way, dispersed in space, perhaps in time for some who will watch this later, but coming together with our heartfulness to practice together. Brings me a lot of joy to feel your presence all around the country and the world. And I actually invite you to take delight. I see so many hellos and greetings from different places, from different time zones. And just to start with that sense of appreciation, gratitude for Sangha, for community, for the teachings, and for the possibility of waking up. So, so having expressed my appreciation for our practice and time together, I'd like to invite us to, to practice together, to meditate together and I will introduce the theme for this week through the guided meditation ever so slightly. And more so, I'll speak about it during the offering, the Dharma. So, so let us begin. Let us begin. Let us arrive. Let us arrive in this moment in time. Let us arrive in our bodies. Let us land in the body. Feeling the connection of our feet to the earth, our legs if we're sitting on a cushion, our sit bones. Relax. Let go of your weight. To the earth, feeling supported. To the earth, feeling supported. Breathing this breath in the body. Ideally in the lower body in the abdomen, greeting this breath, the sensations of the breath. As if spring, as if new. As if they are fresh in each moment. And not as if actually they are new and fresh in every moment. A sense of possibility, openness, open-heartedness. Thank you. Thank you. And now can we bring an attitude of play, an attitude of curiosity, of interest. The curiosity and interest are not so heavy, are not leaden. They don't have gravity but they have a lightness, a playfulness to them about this moment in time. They are experiences that arise and pass all the possibilities arising in every moment. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to invite you to try this on for size, not in your head but in your body. Breathing this reflection, feeling it in your body and the reflection is. What if this moment of awareness, this moment of being alive, this moment of being mindful is not so tight, so serious, but giving it more space. That this character always you, this character in the play or game. Is playing an infinite game, an infinite game without winners and losers. It came with curiosity, with interest. Like children, the way they play games, endlessly curious, creative, with wonder and awe. What if we receive this moment, this moment's experience, the breath, sensations, thoughts, emotions, all of it. The whole catastrophe, what if we receive it, receive all? As if we were a child, engaging in this adventure, this curiosity, this interesting game. Learning, growing, delighting. These are the invitations for the practice. Can we practice with this perspective, this attitude? Can we practice with this attitude? Can we practice with this attitude, this attitude, this curiosity, interest, delight, freshness, levity, awe. You know this, we've all been children, or witnessed them. Your body knows how to do this. Receive each moment. This perspective. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I feel heavy and tight. Maybe through this perspective they feel lighter. They come and go. Lightness of being. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe through lightness of being perspective. the mind is lighter. The body is lighter. There are more possibilities in this moment. More space, more ease, more freedom. More space, more freedom. More space, more freedom. More space, more freedom. More space, more freedom. We treat moments of life not with lots of shoulds Like a grim duty, but imbued with lightness, lightness of being, lightness of heart, possibilities. As if we're playing this infinite game. With the light of a child. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You
