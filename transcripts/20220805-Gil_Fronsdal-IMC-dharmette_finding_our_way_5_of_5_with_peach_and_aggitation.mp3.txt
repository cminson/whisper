So in Buddhism is often associated with peace. 
And in fact the emotional manifestations of awakening, of freedom that the Buddha points to is most commonly associated with happiness and peace. 
Peace and happiness. 
And the opposite of peace is maybe agitation, conflict, and that's part of our world. 
We navigate a world where we get agitated, where we're calm and then we're not so calm. 
We're maybe so much peaceful but then we're not peaceful. 
We're agitated and then we're less agitated. 
And so how do we find our way in this world of navigating in all of this? When do we emphasize peace, appreciate it, value it, cultivate it? When do we allow ourselves to become agitated or less peaceful or allow there to be energized in a dynamic way that doesn't feel very peaceful? And there are times for both. 
And living in this world there are times when it's appropriate to put aside our peace and let ourselves kind of enter into the world of doing and activity. 
And not being so concerned about whether we're agitated or not or lost or calm or not. 
So there's times for peace and there's times where peace is not really the name of the game, not really appropriate. 
And there are times when there's agitation which is inappropriate and really a challenge and it makes our life much more difficult. 
And there's a time to allow ourselves to become agitated or lose some of our calm. 
It's easy to argue that it's maybe always good to be calm but realistically I don't know if that's really going to happen unless we're living in a solitary, quiet lifestyle. 
If you're living in some place and your neighbor comes knocking at your door with a big injury and asks you to take them to the emergency, that's not the time to be excessively concerned about your calm. 
And as you get to the emergency and maybe your neighbor can't talk much at this point, so you're having to explain and be engaged in the activity. 
And I think that chances are that that's not going to keep your calm, you're going to be activated in some strong way. 
And enough so that when your friend is finally being taken care of and you can sit quietly, you see how much activation there is, you're spun up. 
But that's not wrong to have that happen in the circumstances. 
In fact, to be holding onto the calm and the peace and let's kind of make our way to the car slowly and peacefully and count our steps and every step say peace, that's not really the name of the game. 
We have to let go of any emphasis on peace and just engage in what's needed. 
Being in the world with what's needed is part of what dharma practice is about. 
And so certainly it's possible to be attached to peace and hold on to it. 
It's possible to kind of pretend we're peaceful or kind of hold ourselves, kind of contain ourselves in a certain kind of way. 
So it's kind of like we're not agitated and physically we're not moving around a lot or we're kind of staying close to something that looks like peace. 
But it's more attachment and manufactured and not really real. 
The ability to navigate between kind of activated states and peaceful states is a lot easier if you're fluid to go between them and this fluidity. 
If we resist one or hold onto one, then we're not fluid. 
And then it's not easy to go back and forth between them. 
In fact, one of the principles of dharma practice that I value a lot is not that we attain any particular state as if that's the state that we're supposed to be in. 
There's all kinds of mental states, embodied states that we can experience. 
And to be free is to have fluidity to be able to move between them and back and forth. 
And if we have that fluidity, then we can kind of navigate this world of all the differences much quicker and more easy. 
If we don't have that fluidity, we become fragile, we're holding on, we're resisting, we are threatenable. 
And because what we're holding on to is threatened or what we're afraid is going to happen will come and overwhelm us. 
But if we can surf with it, kind of navigate and with fluidity, with ease, with relaxation, not holding onto anything and not resisting much in the inner life, it's much easier to let go. 
It's much easier to not be troubled by things. 
So there's activated states in life and there's peaceful states, calm states. 
And sometimes it's healthy just to move between them with fluidity and it's okay to be activated. 
It's okay to kind of lose our calm sometimes. 
And sometimes it's not. 
Sometimes we lose our calm and we make mistakes and we make the whole thing worse. 
Agitation can create a lot of stress and exhaustion. 
And so navigating between this is part of this. 
And it's much harder if we're, as I'm saying, we're clinging, clinging, grasping, holding on, resisting. 
All those create more agitation and less peace. 
Non-clinging, non-attachment, create more fluidity, less attachment, more appropriate peace and a greater capacity to flow out of that peace when something else is needed and was no longer needed flowing back to a calm state or be centered. 
So finding our way with peace and activation, peace and agitation, some of this has to do with becoming connoisseurs of both. 
Not just become experts on peace, but become experts on agitation itself. 
That mindfulness is really to see and understand how our life works, what's really like these things we go through. 
And so spend time and when you're agitated, and with a question, what is this agitation? How am I experiencing it? What's being triggered? Where does it live in me? What's my relationship to this agitation? Do I believe it? Do I go headlong into it? Am I resisting it? Am I judging it? Am I critical of myself for being agitated? There's all these things to study and become much more aware of. 
And we can study it. 
We can bring a peaceful mindfulness to that. 
A non-conflictive mindfulness. 
This is how it is. 
This is how it is. 
And equally well, we want to study peace. 
We want to get to understand and become connoisseurs and recognize it. 
Even the small hints of it, even when it's a very minor piece, be able to recognize when it's available. 
Peace is much more available than most people realize. 
Most situations we're in have more peace somewhere in the center of them and the corner of them than the busy, activated mind allows ourselves to tune in to. 
So to study these things, get to know them more. 
And that brings us into the capacity to recognize when we cling, when we resist, where our attachments are. 
And as the practice deepens, there's a process of letting go or relaxing or softening our attachments. 
It goes deeper and deeper and deeper, more and more to the core of who we are. 
And we start letting go of small things that's a training to let go of the deeper attachments and the deeper attachments. 
And then we don't want to become attached to letting go. 
We don't want to be attached to these deeper states of well-being and peace that might be there. 
That is a recipe for agitation again, unhealthy agitation. 
And then to drop down deeper and deeper to some of the deepest places we can let go. 
And so the deepest peace is what's called release. 
Release is peace. 
The deepest peace comes from a profound release where we're no longer in the world of polarities between peace and agitation. 
Where we're centered in such a way that the kind of a peace goes with us, a calm goes with us, even when we're busy and activated in doing things, it's not far away. 
That the deeper the letting go can be, the more thorough it can be. 
It's like it creates a space of absence, a space where there's kind of a spaciousness in our minds and our hearts and our bodies some place. 
And that spaciousness can feel calm, can feel open. 
And because it's more like space, things can happen to us and they go right through that space. 
If we are peaceful but peaceful is kind of like we're holding ourselves peaceful or it's very palpable, a kind of state of peace that is a kind of feeling, that's wonderful. 
But that also is not the empty space of freedom where things can just go through or there's space to hold everything. 
And so this letting go is what creates this inner space which provides a qualitatively different kind of peace, different kind of calm, different kind of well-being and room for all of ourselves. 
So to navigate this world of ours with the idea that we want to make room for all of who we are in this way, this particular wave where there's no attachments, no clinging. 
And on the way there we have to make room for our attachments and get to know them as well. 
So it's a wonderful journey finding your way and I'd like to end this little series on finding your way with these different states that one of the lessons I'm trying to get across is don't have a categorical right and wrong for almost any state that you have, any way that you are. 
Take time to look at it and sometimes there's almost a time for everything. 
And certainly a time to study it and get to know it and that finding our way, navigating this world of ours when we're a mindfulness practitioner has a lot to do with bringing mindfulness and space, mindfulness and room to how we are so we can learn to find the wisest way and the freest way to navigate this life of ours. 
So thank you for participating in this and maybe for this weekend it can be a theme for your homework, home practice to study your relationship to agitation and peace, agitation and calm or tranquility, whatever you like. 
And to see how there's a pendulum that swings between them, do you prefer them, do you hold on to them? What happens if you spend time with each studying them or getting to know them, becoming more familiar with them? Become the connoisseur of your agitation and of your peace. 
Thank you.
