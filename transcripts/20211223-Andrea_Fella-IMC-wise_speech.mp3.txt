The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
We're in a holiday season right now and I thought it might be useful to reflect
on why speech, since many of us will be with family or at gatherings perhaps, and
this can be an area that's challenging or charged at times. So I just thought I
would reflect a little bit on it and then open it up. Hopefully my intention is
to have some time for questions so that you can check in about what might be
particularly relevant for you in this area.
This is not an easy area to engage with to be mindful of our speech. You know,
there's really, there's, there's, there's being mindful of speech and there's the
teaching on why speech and I'd like to talk a little bit about both of those.
The teaching on why speech we could say is a support to help us be mindful of
speech because it encourages us to be aware of particular kinds of speech
to, to avoid. This is, this is teaching of why speech and I'm using why is here
rather than right but right speech is kind of the traditional way that's framed
in the Noble Eightfold Path. One of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path is
right speech and if we think about what right means in this definition it's not,
I wouldn't, I don't think of right speech here or right in the Noble Eightfold
Path, right, right intention, right understanding, right intention, right
action, right mindfulness, right speech, right action. I don't think of that right
as being right versus right in terms of good or bad but right in terms of the
right direction. So we might, we might, you know, ask how do I get from here to
here and somebody will give us some directions for how to go and if you
follow the directions well you'll get to where you're going and so that's the way
in which this, I understand this as right. It leads us in the direction of less
stress, less suffering, less reactivity, moving in the direction of ease and
peace in our lives. So that's the way in which it's right, it's right, the right
direction. In our sitting practice we cultivate mindfulness of what's happening
in our experience, we cultivate the awareness of body sensations, we
cultivate the awareness of what's arising in the here and now but with
speech we are asked to be aware of something extra and that's content. A
few weeks ago we talked about being aware of content in our daily lives but
we didn't so much talk about the speech side of it but that's why I think in
some ways it's a little more challenging because with content when we're
engaged in content we are in a world that's not directly here and now
necessarily. We're in our thoughts, we're in our ideas and yet we can be
aware of that and so this is this is a piece that's a little bit extra for us
to attend to. What is the content of what we are intending to say? What is the
content of what somebody is saying to us so that we then also become aware of how
we are in relationship to that content. So we talked about that a couple of weeks
ago in terms of engaging in activities in our lives, the content of
how we go about our lives that we have to engage with content. In speech
content is a big piece of what is going on, what we want to communicate, what we
want to say. So I'm engaged in content here, the content of the talk is why
speech. So there's the content to be aware of and then how are we in
relationship to that content and not only that but what is the reason, what
is the motivation for wanting to share the content. So this is an important piece
in being mindful of speech, to be aware first of all that we're going to speak
and and and being aware that we're going to speak, we may be aware before we speak
of what we intend to say and then we can kind of check in how is it for us to
think about saying that. So this is a little bit about about being mindful
with speech and this is this like pausing before we speak is one of the
key tools to help us out. It's not easy, it's not easy to do especially in
charged situations but if you can pause before you speak then you may get a
little bit of a gap, a little bit of a moment where you can check in what am I
going to say and what is the motivation for why I'm going to say it. So those
pieces can be really helpful in exploring working with speech. In the
teachings on why speech, in the Eightfold Path, the Buddha points to not the
kind of speech to say, which is what we might think of why speech, you know, what
is why speech, why speech, you know, we might think of it as being an indication
or a encouragement to say certain kinds of things but the Buddha points out for
us in this teaching things to avoid, types of speech to avoid, four classes of
speech to avoid and I'm not going to do a detailed going into each of these but
just give you a little bit of an overview here. So four kinds of speech to
avoid and why speech, refraining from false speech, refraining from harsh
speech, refraining from divisive speech and refraining from idle chatter. So just
a little bit about about each one and I think one of the keys here in all four
of these is that the encouragement is to avoid speaking intentionally when we
know it's going to be false, divisive, harsh or idle chatter. So if for
instance we say something, you know, with a kind intention but it's received in a
way that is understood or we see that it's been received as harsh, then you
know that we haven't intentionally like tried to engage in that wrong speech.
These kinds of wrong speech are like intentionally engaging with, lying
with a speech, the harsh speeches is speech that's intending to hurt someone.
Divisive speech is speech that's intending to divide people. False speech
is speech that's intending to deceive. Idle chatter maybe to find slightly
differently as speech that does not communicate is not purposeful, let's say.
Speech that is not purposeful. So intentionally not purposeful, essentially.
So the this kind of bringing in intention is, I think it helps us
sometimes to understand that these
instructions on avoiding certain kinds of speech is, like if I accidentally say
something like the other day I was talking to a friend and we were
disagreeing about the coronavirus and she said coronavirus causes colds and I
said no, coronavirus doesn't cause colds and I'm wrong, I was wrong, you know.
I looked it up later, it's like oh I was wrong, you know. I wasn't intending to
deceive there, it was a kind of a, it was speech that was not, I didn't
know that I was saying false, I didn't know I was saying false speech. In fact, I
thought I was saying true speech, so you know, we can do that. So you know, it's
like I'm not, I don't have to beat myself up, I'm not beating myself up about
having said that, it's not, I did not lie to my friend. I had a mistaken
impression that I communicated to my friend and actually my friend sent me an
email saying here's some information about this. It's like okay, yeah, I see this.
This is, so I had, you know, said that thing that was not true, but that's
essentially, that's something we can learn from. You know, when we end up
saying something that it ends up being received, in the case of this false
speech, it was, it was false. It was, you know, that I learned something. You know,
I learned, I learned, I had had misinformation and I learned something. And
in terms of harsh speech and divisive speech, if we end up saying something
that we learn has had a divisive effect or a harsh effect when that wasn't our
intention, there is probably something to learn, you know, something to be curious
about. What happened there that this thing that I said had that effect? So to
not just, you know, brush it aside and say, well, I didn't intend that to happen,
you know, so it's not my fault that it happened, but instead to be
curious and to learn from it. You know, what can we learn from when something
lands in a different way? Maybe there's something about the other person, about
the situation, about something that we don't know, for instance, am I not
knowing about coronavirus being, you know, causing colds, you know, that there
might be something for us to learn or to understand, to deepen our sense of the
situation or the other person. With idle chatter, I want to speak about that for a
moment because this often comes up. There's a lot of questions that come up
about all of these and I'm not going to try to get into all of the kind of
different, what we might call gray areas in all of these. I want to leave some
questions and if some of those gray areas come up, I'm happy to respond. But
with idle chatter, you know, often, and I was actually just having a
conversation with a fellow colleague today talking about, I'm going to be
speaking about this tonight, and the first thing she said was, I have an
issue with the idle chatter one, you know, that it feels like it's not
always idle, you know, and I think that this is an important piece
around the holidays particularly, you know, we come in and we end up
talking about the weather or, you know, a book we're reading or something that
may, you know, not necessarily be the most deep conversation that we could
have, but maybe a deep conversation isn't appropriate with somebody we're
meeting for the first time, and it's appropriate to to make a connection. And
so sometimes idle, what seems like it might be idle chatter, is serving the
purpose to connect us. And so again, looking at the intention I think is
important, you know, why am I saying this? Why am I having this conversation? Why
am I bringing this topic up? You know, it's somebody I don't know, it's like
this feels like we have some conventions often and in culture about where
we can start, you know, maybe it's a sports or maybe it's weather, you know,
wow, isn't the rain great, you know, that like this is an easy topic for us in
California right now, because we don't get rain that often, and you know, so it's
a place we can connect, and then perhaps the conversation can, we can learn a
little bit about each other, and it can move into a little bit more meaningful
conversation. So I don't think that what seems to be idle chatter that we have to
avoid it entirely, but it is interesting or useful I think to look at or
reflect on, what is the purpose? You know, if we define idle chatter as
being speech that doesn't have any purpose, then we can understand that when
we're speaking to connect each other that that is the purpose. It's not about
the content, it's about the emotional kind of field that we're creating with
that content. So two more pieces I want to just mention or bring up, and
then opening it up for questions or comments. So the Buddha talked about
these four kinds of speech to avoid in terms of right speech, and I think, you
know, our our work very much is in in that area of avoiding speech, is to be
aware of what we're going to say, and then check in, you know, is the
motivation to divide, is the motivation to harm? I mean sometimes to hurt
somebody, you know. It's painful when we see that, but that's the value
actually of being mindful of that, of those kinds of motivations, because we
see it doesn't feel good to want to harm, to want to divide, to want to deceive. It
doesn't feel good. So seeing those motivations, we we may be able to avoid
the that kind of speech, to stay silent or to change the subject, or to find
another way to say what we want to say that has some kindness to it. So that
that piece of being kind brings in another teaching, another way that the
Buddha talked about speech, more from a positive side. So the right
speech instructions are, you know, avoid these kinds of speech, but the another
place he talks about speech that's helpful, speech that's beneficial, and
it's got a few different pieces to it. Instead of framing it speech to avoid, he
said we should speak speech that is true, that is beneficial or useful, and that is
kind, with a heart or mind of kindness. So speaking kind words from a heart of
kindness, and then he adds to that, that it should be said at a useful time or at
a helpful time. So the this, I think the true useful kind is a really helpful
kind of mnemonic, is what I'm going to say true, is it useful, is it kind, that
that's a great way to shape, hopefully, what we want to say. The piece about the
proper time, that's an interesting question. What does it mean? What
does it mean to say, to speak at the proper time? I think that the place it's
talked about, I'll read this little section, in the case of words that the
Buddha knows to be factual, true, beneficial, but disagreeable, unenduring,
and disagreeable, he has a sense of the proper time for saying them. So this is
speaking about himself, he's speaking about himself. This is how he kind of
decides when to say things. So in the case of words that I know, the Buddha
knows, to be factual, true, beneficial, but unenduring and disagreeable, he has a
sense of the proper time to say them. And in the case of words that the Buddha
knows to be factual, true, beneficial, and endearing and agreeable, he knows he
has a sense of the proper time to say them. So in the other parts of
the Sutta, if it's not factual, if it's not true, if it's not beneficial, he
says, I don't say them. But if it's true, it's factual, it's beneficial, he has a
sense of when it's useful to say them. And I think what this might
mean is, when will it be able to be heard? When can somebody hear
what I have to say? If this, for instance, with the disagreeable information,
something that is true, that's beneficial, that could be useful for
this person to know, if they're not in a state of mind to be able to hear
something that's hard to hear, probably not the time to say it. And on the other
side, if it is something that they want to hear, I think that this
may be, the Buddha knows when they might be able to hear it without puffing
themselves up about it. It's true, it's useful, it's kind, it's agreeable.
So the Buddha might be praising somebody. And in fact, the Buddha
talks about praise and blame at times and says, the Buddha speaks in praise
of what is, where praise is called for. The Buddha speaks in dispraise, where
dispraise is called for. And so when there is praise, I think the proper
time is a time when perhaps that person might not be inclined to have pride or
to identify or to use that information in an unskillful way. So for us in
speaking, these questions of is it true, is it useful, is it kind, is it a good
time to speak about this topic? So for myself, I think unless somebody else
brought up politics in a holiday gathering, I probably wouldn't
bring up the topic. I just would think, okay, this is not the time for this
conversation. So just some general like, you know, basic things that feel helpful
to avoid in certain situations. So these basic guidelines, is it true, is it
useful, is it kind, avoiding false speech, harsh speech, divisive speech, idle
chatter. Then the last piece that I'll say before opening it to some comments or
questions, is that one of my teachers, Sayada Utejnaya, talked about at a time
before he ordained, before he became a monk, that he decided to include these
three extra speech encouragements from the wise speech section of the teaching,
as additional precepts to follow. In the in the Buddhist teaching, we have five
lay precepts, which are five guidelines to support us in not harming. And I think
that these guidelines around wise speech, also the main intention behind these
guidelines on avoiding the false speech, harmful speech, harsh speech, divisive
speech, and idle chatter, the intention, the primary intention, is to not add harm
to create a kind of an environment of harmlessness. And so the five precepts
are guidelines that help us to avoid harm in our activities, refraining from
taking life, refraining from taking what's not given, refraining from creating
harm through our sexual energy, refraining from false speech, and refraining
from intoxicants that lead to heedlessness. And so the the false speech
one is in there in the in the precepts. And so Saira Utejaniya said he decided to
add to those five precepts that he was following in his daily life, the three
additional precepts about speech, or three additional, he created them as
additional precepts about speech, so that he would take the precept to refrain
from, as a training rule, you know, I undertake the training to refrain from
false speech, I undertake the training to refrain from harsh speech, I undertake
the training to refrain from divisive speech, and I undertake the training to
refrain from idle chatter. And he said, when I'll actually read this to you, one
of the practices I did when I was a layman was keeping the five usual
precepts plus an extension of the speech precept. I tried not only not to lie, but
also to also undertook to abstain from harsh speech, from divisive speech, and
from idle talk. I soon found out that I needed a lot of mindfulness to keep all
those speech precepts, and that's when my practice really started zooming. So he
found that it was really helpful for his mindfulness in daily life to add those
as precepts. Now I want to speak a little bit about what it means to have
them as precepts, because when we take a precept, I think we might think of it as
like the Ten Commandments, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not
lie. The way they're framed in the Buddhist tradition is, I undertake the
training to refrain from taking life, I undertake the training to refrain from
false speech. And there is the intention to follow that training, but the way
the precepts basically work is almost just mindfulness bells. You know that if
we're getting ready to do something, we're getting ready to kill an ant in our
kitchen, or we're getting ready to say something that's false, and we're aware
that we're getting ready to say something that it's false, then the precept
can serve as a little bit of a check on us. And so it might help us to refrain
from doing that action. But at the same time, it's not about like being
harsh with ourselves if we find that we have taken the step to speak
falsely or speak harshly. It's more about kind of like that. It'll tickle our
conscience, I think, maybe a little bit more. It'll tickle our conscience, oh, I
took this precept, and I spoke harshly. And so the the encouragement when we find
that we have not followed one of the training guidelines that we've taken is
to take it again, to commit again, just to recommit. Not the instruction is not,
you know, be really hard on yourself, tell yourself you're a horrible person,
and beat yourself up about it. But it's notice that you've done that and take it
again. Just remind yourself this is important to me. I want to try that.
And so I think the speech precepts can serve not only as a support for
mindful speech, but also for helping us to notice when we have stepped into that
terrain of harmful speech. So we have a couple of minutes for questions, and you
know, I'm happy actually to stay afterwards again as I sometimes do. But I
also wondered if it might make sense to to see, you know, going into this this
time, you know, next week to ask you, so what are your questions about about
working with speech, mindfully, because I think this is a rich time and a rich
conversation. So anybody have any questions for today that you're interested in?
Yeah, Charles Lee. Hi, yeah. I guess I have a question of when when it's not
speaking, I guess, unwise, I could, you know, you know, if you're in a position of
power privilege and you're witnessing, you know, you know, somebody, you know,
something bad happening, and you know, you kind of choose to stay quiet to avoid
conflict or something. Does the Buddha have anything? Does that fit into why
speech or is that a different? Well, I don't, I think it fits in more in the
broader picture of, I mean, like for instance, there is one place the Buddha
does speak about. I don't want to try to remember the language. He's talking about
speaking in praise and blame. So when to tell somebody they're doing well and
when to tell somebody this is not okay, basically. So speaking in that way. And so
I think that this falls into that to some extent is like when to say something. And
the Buddha, somebody, somebody, he was he was talking to another person there and
he said there's four different ways of going about this. You can speak praise
where praises do, but if, but not speak dispraise where dispraises do, or you
could speak dispraise where dispraises do, but not speak praise where praises do,
or you might not speak praise where praises do, or dispraise where dispraises
do, or you might speak praise where praises do, or dispraise where dispraises
do. And he said of those four, what seems to be the most valuable to you? The
Buddha is asking somebody and that person said, well, it seems to me that
somebody who's really wise would not speak dispraise or praise, because
equanimity is what's valuable. And the Buddha said, no, that's not actually
what I would do myself. I would speak praise where praise was do and dispraise
where dispraise was do. So to speak when there is a reason to speak. And again, I
think he does speak to the will it be heard or, but even in the case, I think,
you know, sometimes things like in social justice kind of areas, and maybe
that seeing something or witnessing an injustice, whether it's, you know, the
person who's committing the injustice will be able to hear it or not. It has
value in any case, you know, it has value to let the person, to let a
person know that somebody else has seen this, this. So, you know, I think that
the, you know, the timeliness of it, it's not just about the timeliness of it, I
think it's a really complex evaluation. You know, is it the time to say something?
And so I think that what you're talking about does come into this part of wise
speech, but I also think it comes into just the general teaching on non-harming.
You know, what, what is it? What, like if for instance, non-action is not always the
least harmful thing to do. You know, in fact, it is a, it is a harmful thing to do
sometimes. Non-action is a harmful thing to do. And so the, the, I think that we,
we need to be really honest with ourselves about why we choose to do what we do,
whether it is action or non-action. If we're not acting out of fear or not
acting out of confusion or not acting because we, you know, fear is the one that
keeps coming up in my mind because we're afraid something's going to happen if we
act, then that's, that's not acting, that's not acting skillfully. And yet, you
know, there are times when we, we might not have the ability to do that and we,
we, you know, we, we need to just revisit, I think, learn. Again, like I was saying
earlier, you know, learn from our mistakes. We need to learn when we have
spoken or done something that's caused harm that wasn't intended. We need to
learn from that. And I think in the case too, when we find we can't speak, we need
to learn from that. What can I, what can I learn so that we don't just, you know,
brush it under the rug, but keep learning from, from what, what, both our actions
and our non-actions. This is, non-action is a choice as well. So it's important, I
think, to understand the motivations behind that as well. So I think it's
bigger than speech in a way. Your question is bigger than speech.
