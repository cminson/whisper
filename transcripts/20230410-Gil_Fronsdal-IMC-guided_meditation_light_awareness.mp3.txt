The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Good morning everyone and welcome to IRC today, the Insight Retreat Center,
where I am teaching for the week. And I wonder, could I have just a sound check
to make sure that the sound is working for all of you. The system is a little
different here, so that's no sound. Let's see.
muted. So let me, so probably I need to go back to the OBS and, okay, so I'm
wondering if we have sound now. And we have sound. Wonderful. So, so welcome. I'm
at the Insight Retreat Center today. IMC is Retreat Center in Santa Cruz County
in California. Then I'm teaching here for the week and so I want to, so hit this
is the place for which I'll do the broadcasting. And I'm happy to be here.
Maybe end of the week we can zoom out or zoom around and you can see the
meditation a little bit more, those of you who would like. And also that we have
here three people attending, you know, all these years that I've been doing
YouTube from IMC that's always been alone. A couple of times one person came,
technician came, one of our Sangha members who helps a lot with it. And here we
have two of the resident volunteers at IRC and one of the big volunteers who
comes here to help. And so they're sitting here in the meditation hall with me.
And so it's nice to have company here. So welcome to the beginning of the week.
And last week we did a series of teachings on different ways of being
aware. And for this day I would like to suggest another variation on awareness
that can apply to all the different other ways that you're aware. But that is to
the choice between letting the awareness be very light and having awareness
being, I don't know if heavy is the right word, but a little bit more intense or
serious or weighty. And sometimes the idea of lightness, kind of like awareness
has a very light touch for what it's being aware of, can be very helpful
because anything more than a light touch can be sometimes too much effort being
made. And the art of effort is to have a light touch, a lightness to the
effort, but to be committed to it. So it's continuous and really stay there. And so
a light touch and a light touch with how awareness touches the breathing, the
sensations of breathing, a light touch and how we know it in the knowing of the
sensations that if there's mental noting, a light touch with the noting. So that'll
be the kind of the addition to the meditation this morning. So to take a
comfortable alert posture and to gently close your eyes and to take a few long
slow deep breaths. Exhaling, relaxing on the exhale. And the part of us what can
be nice with taking a few deep breaths at the beginning is that when you stop
doing it, you can appreciate the lightness or the more simple way of
breathing that's not intentionally taking deep breaths. So you might try that
now kind of return to an ordinary breath and appreciate maybe that
ordinariness of it or the lack of that extra effort and force to deep
breath deeply. And just with a light touch be aware of your breathing. A light
touch that doesn't interfere with your breathing, doesn't have an agenda with it.
Just there, feeling it coming and going. And as you exhale, without making a lot of
effort, just a very light effort, almost as if the lightness of the effort is
part of the medicine. As you exhale lightly, relax parts of your body, being
content with just a little bit of softening at a time, softening in the
face, softening in the shoulders, softening in the belly.
And then settling into your breathing.
If it's easy enough to feel this, have there be a light connection with your
body and the movements of breathing.
Feeling that part of the movement that feels free. The movement that feels
like it, the movement that feels like it moves easily, lightly, even if it brushes
against tightness, pressure. And with this emphasis on lightness, as you exhale to
lighten up in the mind, maybe a sense of soft touch in the mind.
And if there is anything that's heavy or challenging for you as you're sitting
here, thoughts or feelings, sensations, see if the mindfulness of it can be
light. Almost like mindfulness is a soft feather that gently brushes across
whatever difficulty there is.
Awareness is a soft cotton ball that gently touches what's heavy or
difficult and then gently pulls away, lightly touches briefly with no force, no
insistence. Just a gentle, almost like a gentle hello.
Whatever mental effort you're making to be aware,
mindful here in the present moment, can that effort have a lightness to it easing
up so there's an ease in how you're encountering whatever it's happening
here, moment by moment.
And with this emphasis on lightness, as you exhale to lighten up in the mind,
with a light touch of awareness, you can sometimes feel as if whatever the
experience is of the moment, that it is touching you lightly.
And with this emphasis on lightness, you can sometimes feel as if you're
milking it.
And if there is any,
suffering or distress or fear or difficulty,
when we can feel it lightly, the light touch, the feather touch,
then there is more room for compassion,
for care, for kindness,
to touch our challenges with a light touch of awareness.
So there is a room for a tenderness.
And then as we come to the end of this sitting,
to bring to mind some person or animal for whom it's easy for you to
have a warm regard, love or friendliness, kindness,
maybe an admiration of a kind.
So someone for whom it's easy to have goodwill,
and think of this person or this animal
with a light touch,
so that the awareness of it is not mixed up with desires and fears.
It's just very simple.
So the lightest touch of goodwill, love,
that needs nothing in return,
that's asking for nothing,
love with a light touch,
and then that light touch of love, imagine that it has a door that you can open,
a wide door that opens up, and the same light touch of love or care, kindness,
can be as extended to all people in your life that you know.
They don't have to know you're doing it.
A light touch of kind regard in all directions,
and with a light touch, a lightness of heart,
and opening your goodwill up in all directions to all beings everywhere.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
Thank you.
