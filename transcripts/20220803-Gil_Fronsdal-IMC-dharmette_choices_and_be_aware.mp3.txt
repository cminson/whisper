So, I think it was in Joseph Goldstein's book, Experience of Insight, that I came across this the first time. 
Joseph is one of the founding teachers of our Insight Meditation Movement here in this country. 
And he refers to traveling through Afghanistan, Iran, India, some place like that, that as many people did in the 60s, westerners, hippie kind of people. 
And crossing like a large desert. 
And in the middle of the desert was the border between two countries. 
And there was nothing there. 
There was no natural line that was like a river or mountain ridge marking the difference. 
It was very arbitrary where that line was between two countries. 
And all this stuff had been made up around this line that humans had created, this imaginary line. 
And so we do this for ourselves all the time and we do it with our attention. 
We apply our attention in one direction across a line more than another direction. 
And their attention is motivated, driven by values, ideas, what we think is important by desires or fears. 
And so this wonderful thing of attention, if we are to have a tendency to be anxious and you come to IMC, you might, not you, but someone might come in here and look, where are the threats here? And like, where is it dangerous here at IMC? Someone else whose interest is pleasure might look around and say, where are the most comfortable chairs? Where is the best, where is the lighting the best? Where do I get the most something? And so the attention is being driven or pushed by or defined by the anxiety or the desire, what we're interested in. 
It might be that we want to be fully enlightened. 
And so then we've read five different techniques of how to do that. 
And so you go through like, what should I do today? Should it be the breath? Should it be this? Should it be that? Maybe I should do metta. 
And so then whatever you decide on, your attention gets directed in that direction. 
Or maybe, I shouldn't say you, because this might not apply to any of you, but there might be some day, on a rare day, someone who comes here who's self-centered. 
It just might happen. 
And so their attention is mostly going to themselves. 
The impact everything has on them. 
Other people make noisy and they affect me and my well-being. 
And it's all about me, myself and mine. 
Someone else is more concerned with how other people are doing. 
I wonder if I can help. 
And these are people, people come to meditate. 
Some of them are here because they're suffering. 
And maybe I should do nice things and be supportive of them. 
And their attention is focused outward. 
So we make a lot of choices, sometimes unconsciously, unknowingly, about where attention is directed to. 
It's helpful to start noticing what side of the line, what direction we prioritize. 
And so even in a conversation with other people, is your most of your attention in the other person, paying attention to the other person as if you're supposed to, or as if that's where the danger is and you better really pay careful attention to know what's really going on? Or is your attention primarily in yourself? Me and myself and mine, I have opinions and I can't believe what this person is saying. 
And I can't wait to tell them what I think because I know, why don't they stop? I have important things to say and I'm getting impatient because it's my turn. 
So the attention is on yourself more, in a sense. 
So where does your attention tend to go? So when you sit down to meditate, for example, there might be some idea of where your attention should be, like in the present moment, maybe it should be on the breathing, perhaps you practice that. 
What's important as part of what you pay attention to in this practice, is pay attention to what you're not, when you're not doing the practice, the way you think you're supposed to be doing it, that's not a time to criticize yourself and be upset. 
It's actually a time to be mindful. 
What is my mind doing? Where does my mind tend to go on its own? And having that reference point of the breathing can be really helpful to notice what your mind is doing in a way we can't in everyday life, we're just kind of busy, involved with everything, maybe, all kinds of things. 
And we don't really see the choices we're making, we're just kind of doing our thing. 
Isn't this normal? I'm just being normal. 
Because you're trying to stay focused on the breathing, any time you can't be with the breath is an opportunity to learn something about yourself. 
It's also an opportunity, when you're trying to be with the breath and you can't be with it, it's a golden opportunity to be critical of yourself. 
I'm just a meditation failure, but don't do that. 
There's no point to that unless you're using that, oh, look at that, I'm the kind of person who keeps being self-critical. 
That's what I do with my attention. 
Any opportunity I have, I'm back criticizing myself. 
So the point I'm trying to say here is that we try to do something with meditation. 
When we can't do it, that's not failing meditation. 
That's actually giving you opportunity to highlight and see more clearly what you're doing that you can't see in daily life so clearly. 
So if you're not in the present moment, but you notice you're not in the present moment, what are you doing instead? What is your mind prioritizing? Where is your precious attention going instead? Oh, that's where it's going. 
I keep having those kinds of concerns. 
My attention keeps going there. 
That's where the attention keeps being directed to. 
That's invaluable to know about yourself. 
Then you can ask yourself, is this what I most want to do? Is this the most valuable thing I can do with my attention? Is there something more valuable? What I'd more like to do than keep having these things here? Probably all of you are infinitely wiser than me and never do anything funny in your mind. 
But I do a lot of things in my mind which are completely ridiculous. 
Completely has no point, has no value, really. 
And sometimes I'll notice that. 
And I'll say, Gil, you don't need to think about that anymore. 
You've done enough of that. 
Let me think about something more useful. 
Sometimes I'll choose something else to think about. 
Sometimes I'll think about, what should my Dharma talk to me about today? And I'll give some thought about that rather than thinking about, I don't know what. 
I'm 68 years old. 
I'm getting in my cars now 10 years old. 
If I have another 10 years, then I'll be 78. 
I wonder what a good car is for a 78-year-old. 
And I'm an old guy. 
And if I'm going to get a really fancy sports car, I should do it before I die, right? But what should I do? What should it be? Should it be red? You're probably getting bored already. 
So I see my mind doing things like that. 
And I'll say, wait a minute. 
That's interesting. 
It's nice for my mind maybe. 
But it's not really anything of any value. 
Is there something more valuable to do with my time, with my attention? One of the things that might be more valuable is to see what's the emotion underneath that kind of thinking. 
Maybe it turns out that I feel some feeling of unease and feeling of emptiness, lack inside. 
And I'm filling it with ideas about sports cars. 
Turns out that that sense of lack and unease, that's important to pay attention to. 
It could be that it's just kind of completely ridiculous, idle thoughts that are not connected to anything at all. 
And I think I'll think about the Dharma talk, or something else that's useful. 
Or maybe I'll simply pay attention by driving, since I am driving. 
So we start having choice about what we do with our attention. 
And we start noticing that we're choosing one side of the border, one side of reality over other sides. 
And maybe it's not the best side. 
Maybe it's arbitrary to some degree what line we've made and what we've picked up. 
So we come into IMC, and rather than choosing that country where it's all about pleasure, or that cross the border into it's all about making myself safe, maybe there's no choice made at all about what you focus on when you walk in, but rather you focus on just looking around. 
What's happening here today? What is this place? I've been here before, but every time it's going to be fresh. 
And take the time to look around. 
What is that? What is here? There are the pleasant spots, there are the frightening spots. 
There's this and that, and there's me having these thoughts and concerns. 
But it's kind of like more open and available and curious. 
Kind of like coming into a new spot without an agenda, except to discover what is here. 
And perhaps that's coming into a spot without making a border, without making a line that's kind of arbitrary, but just being available. 
What's here? And then you'll see, you do that for a while, and then you find suddenly you make a border. 
You make a line between something you want and something you don't want. 
And then you can say, is this wise? Is this appropriate to do that? And it might be. 
You come in, you look around and say, okay, they rang the bell to meditate, and I'd like to have a meditation cushion. 
So now you focus on the meditation cushion shelves. 
That's appropriate. 
Now you're choosing to focus on that. 
But how do you focus on it? How do you use this attention? What are you being driven by? And what are the concerns? And how is your attention narrowing or expanding? And what's happening for you? And so as we begin navigating this world of attention, we learn so much about ourselves, what drives the attention, the unconscious or subconscious choices about what we prioritize with our attention. 
All this is material to learn about ourselves. 
One of the benefits of this learning is that we can learn more and more not to make borders, not to make lines. 
Even line inside and outside is not necessary. 
Awareness can be like open space. 
It can operate as if awareness is like coming into a new place without any agenda, any knowing, just let's look at all of it. 
Let's include everything. 
What is here? Inside of me, outside of me. 
Come in through the door of IMC and let's look around and see what's here. 
And let's look around and see what's inside of me that I'm here. 
I'm a new person coming in here. 
How am I now? And there's no line though between inside and outside. 
The attention just is fluid and moves and just kind of is interested. 
And maybe you can be much more like you're always walking around in open space more often than you have. 
Well, you're just there, available for the whole everything until something is needed. 
You get in your car and drive your car, don't be that open. 
Prioritize the traffic, the road, the car. 
You know, we do have priorities we do, but then we know, we understand ourselves well enough to know that we're making a choice. 
We catch ourselves when the mind makes other choices for us. 
Suddenly you're looking at the red sports cars where you're supposed to be driving. 
I don't think this is the time to do that. 
Let's wait until I'm 78. 
Something like that. 
So I hope that this gave you something to kind of orient yourself around. 
So we will have those of you who stay now.
