 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning everyone and good day. Welcome here to the start of our week, the start of a new theme. It feels nice to be here with you all, sitting here at IMC. And also I kind of feel like it's a special Monday because I mark today as the end of three years of these YouTube meetings and the beginning of the fourth year. It seems quite significant. So thank you for being here. As an introduction to this meditation, I would like to make some distinctions. So, and the distinctions are progression kind of deeper and deeper into the source of ourselves. So if we begin with what we're doing, whatever it might be, if we're doing something, a little bit deeper inside, was a decision to do it. If we go a little bit deeper inside, there's the wish to do it. The desire to do it. So the decision, there's a desire, there's a decision, and there is the doing of it. If we go a little bit deeper down below the desire, the wish to do something, for that wish to really be something to arise, well, there is a place deeper down where there's space for it to arise. There's room for it to appear. There is a source deeper in from which that desire arises. And that can be one of two sources. It can come from our reactivity, or it can come from something deeper, something that is the seat of our kindness, a very, very simple tenderness or gentleness or kind of feeling of nurturing or nourishing or tending. Both exist within us. There is the reactive place and there's the nurturing, tending place. And within minutes we can go from one to the other. We could be nurturing and tending a little kitten, and we could be yelling at someone who has driven their car over our lawn. And a very different kind of response, a very different source within us. When we're sitting in meditation, it's possible to step back into these layers of where things come from. It's possible to, and especially it's possible to do so when we're doing loving kindness meditation, goodwill meditation, when we're bringing kindness or friendliness to the forefront, and we're kind of centering ourselves with a friendly attitude as the kind of the organizing principle, the organizing principle of the mind, of the heart while we're meditating. So it's possible to do loving kindness meditation, and doing it might be awkward, might be difficult, it might be easy. The doing can be complicated, but before the doing there's a decision to be kind, a decision to practice being friendly, to practice goodwill, metta. Before that, there's a desire to do so, the wish to do so. Before the decision, let's get to work here. I'd like to propose that the decision to do so is independent of how well we can do it. Sometimes doing loving kindness practices, people say it's difficult, they say they can't do it, for whatever reason. However, the wish to do so is the beginning of love, beginning of kindness. Simply the wish to do so, and independent of whether we can. And to step back into that beginning place, just the wish to do so, the desire to do so, and appreciate that maybe is the beginning of a kind of goodwill, a well-wishing to ourselves, or caring for ourselves, caring for others, caring for the world. And then also it's possible to go a step further back to the, maybe to the place where there's space, room, for that desire to arise. If we're claustrophobic and with our experience thinking a lot, or cut up, or pushing, or wanting, or something too much, there's no room. And stepping back before even the desire to have loving kindness to making room for our experience, that is precious. That's a place also of a kind of a love, a kind of a care, a kind of a valuing, respecting what's here. And in that making that room, there's a better chance for the desire to be kind, to be part of the nurturing, tending, caring, loving apparatus that's within us, rather than the reactive. So we'll do some kind of practice, but with this as a background. So to sit upright in a meditation posture, that is a posture that you assume to care for yourself, as if the posture itself is a healthy posture for you to meditate in. And to gently close your eyes. And it takes some long, slow, deep breaths, pausing at the end of the exhale, just for a moment or two, to make room and space and silence for the inner life. Deep breath in, long release with the exhale. Pausing at the end of the exhale, to make room for things to get quiet and peaceful, settled, and to feel the natural urge to breathe in and allow for that. And then to let your breathing return to normal. And then to gently, see if you can find a place within you that has the wish for kindness to yourself, or kindness for others, whichever is easiest for you. That wish is not dependent on being able to do it, not dependent on having active kindness, but it's just a wish, simple, ordinary wish. What a good idea, it would be nice, if only. And in your own way, see if you can give thought, words to that desire, gently, quietly, almost meditatively. Give a voice to that desire, or let there be an attitude, or maybe an emotion to appear that maybe is part of that desire. Deep down inside where the desire to be kind arises. It's very private, no one needs to know that kindness can be there independent of justification or rational reason. Whoever you have kindness, want to have kindness for, that desire can be independent of whether you or anyone deserves it. It's just a good place to be. It's a good, very simple, healthy source within. To sit here quietly breathing with it, giving space for it, becoming quiet around the simple manifestation of kindness, which is the desire to be kind, the wish. And if you have no desire whatsoever, for love or kindness, goodwill, go deeper into the source. To where there is space, room, lots of room, to feel the depth within us. The space in the room that doesn't judge or doesn't pile on beliefs, attitudes and reactions. Simple, spacious awareness that has room for everything, just as it is. Simple, spacious awareness that has room for everything. Simple, spacious awareness that has room for everything. And is there a place in that spaciousness or space for a simple, tender, nurturing feeling, caring for yourself? A simple, now a simple desire for your own welfare. It doesn't require you to act or do anything or decide anything. It's just a nice, simple glow of goodwill, kind regard. A wishing to be kind, a wishing to be loving. Simple, spacious awareness that has room for everything. Simple, spacious awareness that has room for everything. Simple, spacious awareness that has room for everything. Simple, spacious awareness that has room for everything. A place deep inside where there's a desire to be kind, desire to be loving. Before judgments, before decisions, before action, before right and wrong. Good and bad, capable or incapable. Deep in the privacy of your own heart. The most basic kind of kindness, the wish to be kind. Gently say words that give expression to this. Or half words or silent words, attitude to this simplest form of kindness. The wish to be kind. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. And then to turn your attention out into the people around you. Your home or your neighborhood or your province, wherever you are. Perhaps you can have the wish that from this day that you have goodwill, metta for them. And stay connected to the wish before actually practicing metta for them. Simply stay with a wish, a private wish. Where it's good for you to have that wish. It's a satisfying feeling. A simple ordinary wish for other people's welfare. Press in some words in your mind, the wish for others welfare. Silence. And more deeply still, not the wish for the welfare of others, but the wish that you had that wish. Wouldn't it be nice if you could wish for the welfare and happiness of everyone. And wishing for that wish, may that come out of you from someplace deep inside that satisfying simple. Maybe cozy. May it be as we come out of this meditation that more often we wish well for others. May the wish for wishing be a fuel and a support for wanting to act with the welfare and happiness of others. May our wishes lead to decisions to act and may the decisions lead to action. May we in some way give expression to this great idea, the idea that others might be happy. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
