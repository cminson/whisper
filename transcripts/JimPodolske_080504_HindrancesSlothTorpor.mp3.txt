 So tonight I'm going to be talking about the third of the five hindrances, which is described as sloth and torpor. I'm wondering how many of you have been to the previous two talks here? So a number of you. I thought since this is halfway through the series, I would review the five hindrances so that I'm kind of up to speed on that. The five hindrances, the first one is sensual desire, and that's the striving after certain sense experience, typically pleasant sense experience. When there's nothing wrong with having pleasant sense experience, it's just when one gets caught in trying to hold onto or pursue sense experience, it can get in the way of being with the moment to moment experience of your life. The Buddha had two sets of similes to explain what these hindrances are like. In one of the sets of similes, sensual desire is described as being and debt. So there's some connection that one has a hard time getting free of. I guess in our culture, being and debt is so common that that probably doesn't seem like much of a hindrance, but I think perhaps in India in the Buddha's day, being and debt was something that you may never get out of. The other set of similes, sensual desire, is described as looking at yourself in a pool of water that has a very bright dye or paint in it. So what you see reflected back isn't really a true representation of yourself, that it's colored with this dye. The second hindrance is called ill will or aversion, and that's sort of the complement to sensual desire. That's the pushing away of experience, the not wanting an experience that's arising to be there, so it could vary anywhere from mild irritation to strong hatred. The presence of ill will was described by the Buddha as likening onto having a disease. So that's an experience, again, all of us have had, that it's unpleasant and there's usually nothing that can be done immediately to relieve it. In the water similes, the presence of ill will is like looking into a pool of boiling or bubbling water. So again, you don't see clearly what's there. The third hindrance is actually split into two, it's called sloth and torpor. And I looked both of those words up and it was a little bit confusing, but as I understand it, one of them refers to sort of a mental dullness or laziness sometimes, said, and torpor is more of a physical dullness or drowsiness. And being caught by sloth and torpor is described as like being in prison. So that is an experience I've had, although I was in graduate school, so it felt like doing seven years to life. But again, there's kind of a restriction on where you can go and what you can see. And in the pond metaphors, sloth and torpor is described as like a weedy, mossy pond, so things growing in it on the surface so that you can't really get a clear, accurate representation of reality. The fourth hindrance, again, is also split into two, it's called restlessness and remorse or restlessness and worry. Restlessness referring to kind of an agitation of the body or the mind and remorse or worry coming from some kind of guilt about what may have happened in the past. That in the presence of restlessness and remorse is described as being like a slave, so that you don't have free will as to your action. And in the water metaphor, restless and remorse are described as being a pond that has wind blowing over it, so it's covered with ripples. The fifth hindrance is skeptical doubt, and that has to do with doubt about the practice, doubt about the Buddha's prescription for becoming liberated from suffering. And that's described as like being lost on a desert road. I've never been in a desert in India, but I know in the Mahavi desert you can be out and there's nothing to really orient yourself, that it's just all flat and you don't know where your source of water and food is going to be. And in the water similes, skeptical doubt, the presence of skeptical doubt is likened onto looking into a muddy pond, one that has been stirred up so the mud obscures the seeing. So you might ask, what do the hindrances refer to, and why should you be concerned about them? Well the hindrances, what they hinder is the development of concentration and the development of insight. So it's very important in this practice that over time the development of concentration allows the deep insights into the nature of your experience. And the hindrances get in the way of developing that concentrated mind. So the concentrated mind is also important in developing rapture, deep energy, joy, and equanimity, which are all factors on the way to enlightenment. So before coming to practice, I don't think I was even aware that there were hindrances. And I thought that's just the way my mind operated. And as I heard about this list, it at first was kind of overwhelming. I mean, how are you going to be able to overcome all of these experiences? And the best way to start is by just rather than developing an aversive relationship to them. Aversion to the hindrances is just another hindrance. So the best thing is to be able to bring mindfulness to them. And bringing mindfulness to sloth and torpor, I find particularly difficult. I chose to talk about this subject not because I'm an expert in it at all, but because it's probably one of my most challenging areas of practice. Sloth and torpor really work directly against mindfulness, that when things arise, when sloth and torpor are present, they tend to dull a mind. And so you don't always pay attention to what's going on. Let's see. So I found that the developing mindfulness of this hindrance started by seeing at first the most exaggerated forms of it. And that was in meditation when I would close my eyes and start falling asleep. I mean, it was kind of hard to miss when you're about to slump over that something is going on. And also I could notice when the hindrance wasn't present, noticing when I felt like my mind was really sharp and clear, there was a lot of energy, and it was fairly easy to get concentrated, that this hindrance wasn't present. And then from there I'd worked towards seeing the more subtle manifestations of it in meditation. For example, when my mind would start getting dull, or my energy would start getting low, I'd noticed that I wasn't paying attention to my breath. I mean, I wasn't noting what was going on. And I couldn't remember what the last note was that I made. Let's see. So it's important to start by just being mindful of this hindrance. And from there you can learn to find what tools or what techniques are useful in working with it. For me, it took a while to develop a familiarity with not only this hindrance but all of the hindrances. In particular, I would find that sloth and torquer often arose right after one of the more unpleasant hindrances arose. So for me, restlessness and worry are extremely unpleasant. I mean, I can't miss those when they arise. It's a very strong bodily sensation quite often. Very agitating for the mind. It's hard to find or stay connected with that quiet place where wise action comes from. So I would know that something needed to be done, but I had no idea of what it was. And the mental dullness, the sloth and torquer would often then arise after that and kind of dull out the sharp edges of restlessness. And it doesn't really solve anything. I mean, it's sort of a temporary effect. And sometimes I would then be able to kind of regroup and start looking more carefully at the restlessness directly. And sometimes the sloth and torquer would just kind of cover over the restlessness kind of like a blanket. And over time, the energy of the restlessness would build and then break through, and it would be even more suffering. So I've learned over time to recognize when that's happening. For me, particularly, restlessness starts to arise at about three or four in the morning when I'm in bed. And if I catch it, if I realize restlessness is going on, and I pay attention to that directly, then I can work with the restlessness and the sloth and the torquer and the dullness doesn't arise. And when I don't recognize it, or when I decide that I'm not going to pay attention to it, then the dullness will set in and I'll sleep for another fitful three or four hours and not feel very rested. Something similar happens also for me with aversion and sloth and torquer, that when aversion arises, I also find that a strong unpleasant experience. And again, if I don't catch it, if I don't pay attention to the aversion, then the sloth and torquer will arise and kind of dull it out until it gets even stronger and it reaches a point where I can no longer ignore it. I think each person is probably made up somewhat differently, so your strongest hindrance may be different. But sloth and torquer is probably one of the most persistence of the hindrances. In the path to enlightenment, skeptical doubt goes after the first step. There's four levels to the attaining of total enlightenment, but sloth and torquer doesn't go until the very last step, so you're going to be working with that one for a while. So after becoming familiar with this hindrance, then it's important to start developing techniques to work with the hindrances. For this one, it's characterized by lack of energy, often a lack of interest in what's going on in your experience. And so to turn that around requires then bringing a deeper investigation to what's going on. So strengthening investigation, strengthening your exertion, and bringing up more energy. In the suttas, the Buddha talked about six different ways for working with this hindrance. And the first one that was listed was seeing overeating as one of the causes of it. Last fall, I did a six-week retreat at IMS in very Massachusetts. And in that retreat, I decided to follow a program that was suggested of not eating any solid food after the noonday meal. And at first I thought that that was going to be quite a struggle, a real difficult thing to not eat from, say, one in the afternoon until 6.30 in the next morning. But what I found was that in that whole six weeks, I probably only had one or two sleepy sits, which is fairly unusual. Usually I have one or two a day. But by really eating slowly and mindfully and noticing when the body had enough food, I found that I didn't miss the last meal at all. And I had a lot more physical energy. I never felt like I was going to fall asleep. I did have times when there was sort of a mental laziness, but that didn't seem related to the eating. So that was one of the areas where I felt like I was able to bring some wisdom to eating. Now in day-to-day life, it's not always like that for me. I find that particularly when I'm feeling stressed, eating is often a way to kind of dull the pain or the unpleasantness of the uncertainty and the chaos of my day-to-day life. That just not knowing exactly what to do, the major and minor conflicts that arise both between myself and others and just within my own mind about what to do. And so there's a strong habit for me of going to eating as a way to dull that pain of the conflict and the chaos, but that doesn't really solve anything. It just dulls out. It doesn't really work through that suffering. So that's one area to really pay attention to, to investigate. Another technique for working with sloth and torpor is changing bodily posture. On meditation, if you find yourself succumbing to drowsiness or indolence or boredom, then it can be helpful if you take a somewhat more upright posture. And for kind of mild drowsiness, that can often be quite effective. And that isn't just sitting on a cushion either. It's also sitting in a chair. I've noticed over the years that how I sit in a chair at work really affects the kind of energy I have and how I pay attention in meetings and things like that. So how you sit and how you stand can often have a fairly significant effect on your alertness, both in meditation and in life. Also, in meditation, if one gets quite drowsy, like you think you're going to fall over or just, you know, there's absolutely no way that you can stay awake, standing up can bring a lot of energy to the body. And in long retreats, it's pretty common at the end of a sitting when the bell rings and you open your eyes to see one or more people standing. And that's a perfectly acceptable way to work with this drowsiness. I've even taken to that sometimes in science meetings. I work as a scientist. And after a couple of hours of listening to presentations, sometimes, and I don't drink coffee because of blood pressure. So the best way to avoid the embarrassment of falling out of my chair is to stand up and stand in the back of the room, not at the front of the room. So changing bodily postures is another way to work with this hindrance. A third one that the Buddha talked about was thinking of the perception of light. Well, that's... I'm not sure I've ever been successfully been able to sit with my eyes closed and think about light in a way that was strong enough to arouse energy, but certainly kind of in between just sitting more upright and standing up during retreats is opening your eyes and letting in some light. And the trick there is to keep your gaze at maybe a 45 degree angle so that you're not kind of looking all over the room and kind of getting interested in the outside world. But just looking at something that's fairly neutral like the floor, but letting the light in so that it'll arouse energy in your body. The Buddha also suggested staying in the open air. And depending on where you're sitting, say if you're sitting at home, you could open a window or say if you were here, you might go outside and sit in the fresh air. Let's see. The fifth technique that the Buddha taught was noble friendship. I'm not sure that that's so applicable to meditation, but I think in day-to-day life it can be extremely effective. If you pay attention to what's your energy like when you're around different people, I find that when I'm with people that I know from the meditation center in particular, and other groups that practice forms of mindfulness and consideration, that it helps cultivate an energy and an aliveness and an interest in my experience. Whereas if I'm with people that are more cynical or somewhat coarse in their sensitivity to others, that over time, unless I'm really paying attention, there's some dullness that sets in. That I think is an interesting area to work. I don't think that that means that you need to be only with a small group of people from your spiritual community to the exclusion of the rest of the world. It's important to stay connected to the world. But it's also important to pay attention to what effect does being around other people have on you. Related to that is the sixth one, which is having suitable conversation. I think that the remedy for all five of these hindrances, the first ones are different, but noble friends and suitable conversation is considered anecdotes for all five. When I was thinking about this last one, suitable conversation in relationship to sloth and torpor, I realized that probably my strongest mentor in this area is a friend of mine that I've known since kindergarten, who's not a Buddhist, he's not a meditator, but he's someone who has always had an amazing level of interest and investigation into the world and into his experience. Now most of it has been more in the area of the physical world, like cars and machines and things like that, as opposed to the psychological. But I realized that his joy in investigating life has rubbed off on me and has affected me over the 47 years that we've been friends. So I think the suitable conversation really again is something that you can pay attention to in day to day life. What does the conversation feel like? What's the energetic quality of it? Does it feel like it's strengthening your awareness, your mindfulness, or is it bringing some dullness or drowsiness? Disconnection. See, there are also a number of other lists that he had for things to do to work with sloth and torpor. One has to do with the recollection of death, that life is uncertain but death is certain. So we don't know how much time we have for doing the practice. So now is the best time to be cultivating mindfulness. Also the development of sympathetic joy. One of the kind of easiest ways for me to get in touch with sympathetic joy, which is delight in the joy of others, is when I bring to mind my nephews and niece who are between three and eight years old. And although they're not always joyous, they often just have a happiness that seems to come almost out of nowhere. And when I can connect with that joy that they demonstrate, then that brings a sympathetic joy for me that raises both my physical energy and my mental energy. And then finally there were a list of five dangers, things to think about which to motivate yourself to really practice now. One of them is considering that as you get older it's going to be harder and a time may come when you can no longer practice, physically or mentally you will not have the capability. So now is the time. There's a good chance that in the future you'll become sick and ill, maybe very acutely ill, and it'll be hard to practice. It'll be hard to develop mindfulness and concentration. So now is the time to practice. Right now I suspect all of us have had a meal in the last day, but in the near or far future we may be faced with hunger, and hunger will make it harder to practice. So now is the time to practice. Right now our society is fairly peaceful and crime free, relatively, but that could change. There could be great chaos and uncertainty, and that would get in the way of practicing. So while we have this social harmony, now is the time to practice. And finally, now we have a harmonious community of meditators, people to support so they can support each other in practice and in following the path of the Dharma. That may not always be so, that may change, that may make it harder or impossible to practice. So now is the time. And then finally I wanted to end with a reading from a book by Ayakema, who is a German nun called, Being Nobody Going Nowhere. Ayakema was a very fierce and strong-willed practitioner who inspired one of my teachers to go into teaching. So I never got a chance to practice with her, but I feel like I've had some connection through my teacher, Lee. She says, meditation has to fascinate one. Then there is no reason for the mind not to be alert. At the beginning of the practice, meditation is not delightful at all. It seems bothersome. It seems to be difficult. It has the ingredients of suffering. But when the mind has an understanding about what one is doing, namely watching each moment as it arises, it becomes fascinating to get to know one's own mind. What could be more fascinating? Talking to other people or just reading a book is only knowing about others. But if one watches one's own mind states arising and passing, arising and passing, that is the most fascinating thing one can do and the most profitable. So I hope that you can take that encouragement to continue to practice and continue to work through the dullness and drowsiness of the third hindrance. So are there any questions or comments or rebuttals? Things you'd like to say about this hindrance or any of the other hindrances? I think there are a lot of things going on. This is me with information overload and all kinds of things coming in. If you did put into hindrance of just walking the valley and not paying attention and then I would be a perfect life coach to be more mindful about what I choose to listen to or be more mindful about what I allow in but not just kind of put it out there and something else going on. One of the practices that's taught on retreats is developing guarding the sense doors. So knowing that the news is out there and things are out there. So being aware that they're there but being mindful not to let them in unknowingly. I was just thinking about all my, I've done a lot of retreats and a lot of late nights at my stay. Just the so many different things that go into being sleepy. Because I always thought that once I'm sleepy along about 11 or midnight or something that it was over and I might as well go to bed. There's just so many times when you get a second wind, if you can go through it or if it turns out to be just kind of, that actually I was awake but I was afraid of the whole night with no activity. Or just a sort of fear of there's nothing between now and breakfast. And it's just that fear kind of turned into sloth. So it's just pointing out that there's so many different, you can just be dead sleepy and then all of a sudden wide awake, it's just an energy thing that comes and goes. Or then there's just being always sleepy and there's just so many different things that appear in the same way. Yeah, I've had reports from many friends of how you can pick up a book and it becomes so interesting that they'll just read throughout the entire night. Yes? And then I'll sort of invite Torquere to come along. It's like at the point where something adverse will happen and there'll be this impulse to collapse. Intuit, I'll sort of dive into the collapse just because I don't know what to do. It's like, oh no, it's 2.30. You know? And it's like, aren't I supposed to be asleep? And I'm not. And so I haven't learned how to cope with that. And using the torpor, which comes in reaction for me to something else, I don't think that that's a very skillful thing. It's convenient. Because I like to leave. What do you think, Chris? Well, I think aversion, I think, typically. Because you're wanting to get rid of it. So in the sense that you can't really... Typically it would be aversion, I think. I mean, you could have any of these reactions to it. It sort of depends on how your mind works. It could make you really restless, for example, because you don't recognize that you have pain. You're trying to kind of skip around and pay attention to anything else or to put you asleep. But if you're really aware of it, you're having pain and what you're feeling is thoughts that you're having pain, it's probably aversion. But it doesn't have to be. You can have the pain and not have the aversion to it. But if you're unable to be mindful of the pain, then you keep getting lost in thoughts about it and so forth. And that's kind of a self aversion. Yeah, that's what I would do. Yes? On her, which was not well-being, to me it would seem more like desire. I guess those are sort of flip sides of the same coin, right? But it would be the desire to not be in pain. Mm-hmm. One of the fears of the new, now you're thinking about why don't you stand and drive it, and I'm looking forward to that a second. Yes, and some of you seem to focus on if only there was a positive thing happening instead and someone is going to focus on if only it was this. It just looks like it's in the city. It feels so good when it stops. Yeah. There are ways to fix it, you know, or something like that if only I had a nice pack or something. Yes? Well, when I think of sort of the drowsiness, laziness, whatever, sort of in my life or whatever, and I think it's basically due to a lack of motivation. I mean, that's more of a common sense thing. And it seems like that isn't necessarily a look at it, that you're giving it. You talk about a lack of motivation and try to motivate myself harder, that's like a whole other trap to fall into. Well, that's an interesting area. I feel like I've been exploring that myself. One of the ways, well, one of the antidotes for Sloth and Torpor is investigation. So there's a practice known as reflection practice where you might go for a long walk and after maybe half an hour when your body is, you're kind of in an even rhythm asking questions like, what is your deepest intention? What is it that's most important to you? What do you wish for? And in asking that question, just allow the question to come out. And you don't have to get an answer. The description of this practice is somewhat like taking a pebble and dropping it into a pond. So posing the question is like dropping the pebble and then you can just watch the waves. So doing that kind of practice, asking that question of what your deepest intention is, and then paying attention, what goes on? What emotions come up? What thoughts come up? Physical sensation? And just trust to let whatever unfolds unfold. And you might find that just bringing that kind of investigation to what really motivates you, not what you think automotivates you, but what really more deeply motivates you may lift the dullness. Well, if we don't have any more questions, how about if we sit for about another five minutes? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So thank you all for your attention, and thank you for your practice.
