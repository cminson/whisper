 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning, and welcome to our meditation, Monday morning meditation, beginning of a new theme for the week. And we're continuing kind of in the ongoing series on the basic foundations for meditation and the way we teach it here at IMC. And this week it's going to be talking about or working with, practicing with thinking. And I'd like to use an analogy that is somehow you received a gift of an amazing thousand year old clock with all kinds of gears. It's very, very precisely made and sophisticated that has gears that keeps the time for nanoseconds and seconds and minutes and hours and days. The years, including the leap years and the cycles of the moon, the seasons and light and dark through the year. Centuries, it's amazingly precisely made and sophisticated math and arithmetic and engineering to make it all work and all the gears. And it's a great present to see in awe of it. But then it turns out after working perfectly for a while, one of the gears decides to go faster than everything else. And suddenly the gears start getting confused and not working properly. And we put under a lot of tension and the whole clock doesn't seem to work very well anymore. They worked well for a thousand years. But under your watch, one of the gears started up to go too fast. So we as human beings are even more sophisticated, complex system than such a complicated watch. Amazing amount of interconnected parts of the human being that all have to work harmoniously for us to stay alive even. And it's kind of amazing. It's amazing that we exist and all that it takes to keep us going, all the interconnected, kind of complicated, deep gear work of this biological systems that we have. And there's one system, one of those gears, that if it works faster than the others, it kind of begins messing it all up. And that is our capacity to become tense. That anything that becomes tense, anything that begins working faster, makes it difficult for everything else to go smoother. And if we could relax the tension, then the whole system that we have begin to operate much, much more smoothly, emotionally, intellectually, biologically, physically, emotionally. All these begin to kind of come into kind of more of a harmony, more working together. And so relaxing in meditation is really good. It's possible to focus on it too much. It's possible to, in a sense, get too relaxed. But in a sense, then some of those gears and the clock stop working if they get too relaxed. But if there's identifiable tension in the system, in your body, it's really good to relax it. It helps the whole thing. So today we'll focus on relaxing the body so that you prepare the ground so the mind can relax, the thinking mind. And I use an expression called the thinking muscle. And this is the activities of the mind that are constructing and spinning out thoughts. And our brain is also a complicated neurological event. And when there's tension there and something's working too fast there, that also kind of messes up the whole neurology of it all, the mind. And the thinking muscle is, you identify it by the physical manifestation of thinking. And if there's a lot of tense thinking, the jaw might be tight, the eyes might be locked, the forehead might be scrunched, there might be a lot of whirling and agitated energies in the skull and the area of the brain, the brain itself might feel contracted and tight. It might be other parts in the body that get activated, the muscles of the hands even, the shoulders, the belly. And all those together I call the thinking muscle, especially the ones that are up in the head. So at some point you recognize the physicality of this and then relax. So assuming a meditation, a posture, and seeing if you take a posture that allows you to be alert, but also to be sensitive, be aware of where there's tension in your body, and the upright cross-legged meditation posture is not required or needed for meditation, but it has some advantages. And one is that it is a posture that can reveal unnecessary tension while not relaxing in giving up or collapsing from it. To stay upright, reveal where it's tense in a healthy way and begin to relax. Lowering your gaze, relaxing your focus of your eyes and closing your eyes. And to enter into this body, body and mind that we're here with for this minutes, taking a few long, slow, calm, deep breaths. And as you breathe in deeply, really feel the global body, whatever is easy to feel of your body, the three-dimensionality of the body. In a long, slow exhale, just letting go, relaxing, softening wherever in your body your mind lands where you feel there's tension, let it soften. Breathing in and feeling the body, exhaling, relaxing. And then to let your breathing return to normal and continuing as you exhale to gently, without ambition, relax your body. Exhaling and softening the muscles of the face. Sometimes feeling a coolness in the face can help relax the heat of tension. The coolness of the air around the face. On the exhale to relax the shoulders, softening. Sometimes feeling the weight of the shoulders can help relaxing. Sometimes shifting where your hands are. If moving the hands someplace allows the shoulders to not be propped up, but to allow them to hang more. And as you exhale to soften the belly. And maybe in the belly if you feel the warmth there, if there is. Perhaps the warmth of the belly can give a kind of comfort that supports some kind of relaxation. And then take a few moments to notice your thinking. For these moments you have permission to think. And notice if your thinking is fast or slow, forceful or gentle. If your thinking is insistent or at ease. And if you think in images, is there a location for those images to occur, like on a screen? If you think in words or in an inner voice, is there a location where that voice is coming from? There doesn't have to be a location, but if there is, sometimes it's possible to notice if there's any tension in that area, that location. There might be a physical association or manifestation of thinking. Tightening, tension, pushing, pressure, contraction. Something that feels stressful in the body connected to your thinking. And as you exhale, see if you can relax the thinking muscle. Relax the tension in your body that you associate with thinking. If there is a location for thinking, let the location get larger, spread out. Maybe like the surface of a lake that the waves get quiet, the surface spreads flat out to the horizon. Sometimes a thinking mind has been working so long that it's tired, weary of all the ongoing thinking. Often repetitive. To relax any ways in which you are investing in your thoughts. Relax even the interest that keeps you glued to thinking. Allowing thinking become calmer and slower. And then returning now to breathing. Wherever you feel breathing most pronounced in your body. Feel the inhales and the exhales. Gently on the exhale, either let go of your thoughts or relax around your thinking. Relax your thinking mind. Feel your inhale and riding the exhale, relax the mind. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Listen better. Let your mind, thinking mind become quiet so you can listen better to your breathing. Here. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax.
