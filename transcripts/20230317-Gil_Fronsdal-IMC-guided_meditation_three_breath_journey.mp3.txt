 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello and welcome to our meditation session. I met in India many years ago an Indian insight teacher named Munindra, Munindraji. One of his sayings that he was well known for is that he said, if it's not simple, it's not Vipassana. So this idea of simplicity is challenging because we have our challenges that we think are complicated, that we can't figure out, we're confused about, or lost in, or so many different factors involved. But if it's not simple, it's not Vipassana. If it's not simple, it's not love. If it's not simple, it's not going to be...let's leave it at that. So what I'd like to offer this morning is something very simple, a little technique that can be used in so many different situations. A little technique that it's going to be hard to say there is no time for it unless there's something really pressing, happening really at the moment. And it's a variation of what's called the three-breath journey. And so let's do it together and taking your meditation posture and just very simple and you don't have to do anything really, just close your eyes. And with your eyes closed, take three simple ordinary breaths, but really be present for those breaths, really feel the breathing in the body. Okay, so then is there a difference between how you felt before the three-breath journey and afterwards? Sometimes in daily life, just taking three breaths to stop and close your eyes can interrupt the mind stream, can...we can step off the trains of thoughts that are spinning along and always in danger of derailing. But to step off the trains and take a moment to just let go, be present, can relax things, we can let go things, can give us a different perspective. It can take the edge off the challenges we have, the edge that comes with our alarm, our tension that we carry with us. And I don't know how well it worked in the morning, the first thing to do this, but I'd recommend that in your daily life you try. And now I'd like to suggest a different variation of the three-breath journey. And I'll go through it a little bit slowly, and I don't know if my speed is going to match how quickly or your speed in which you breathe. But if I go too fast, then just remember and just, you know, just do it, you follow afterwards. If it's too slow, then maybe you can do it over again or do two breaths in a row doing the same thing or something. So with the eyes closed, just take a breath and feel the breathing. Then take a breath, on the exhale soften in your body, and then take a breath, and on the exhale ask the question, where's the love? So we can do it again. First, just feel the breath, one breath. Second, soften in the body. And third, where's the love? And let's do this two or three more times on your own. And the softening also means letting go of any criticism or resistance to doing this. And to do this without any expectations or measuring or judgments about how you are. Just an open, allowing exercise. Breathe, soften something within and ask, where's the love? And just dropping that question in, allow whatever happens to happen. So, having introduced this to you, now kind of starting over again in the meditation, maybe taking a few long, slow, deep breaths to refamiliarize yourself with your body and your meditation posture. Long exhales to settle. Letting the breathing return to normal. And still take a few moments to relax, let go, the body, and also to relax and soften the thinking mind. And then if you'd like to continue with the three breath journey, first breath is to breathe, just breathe and be present for it. Second breath is to breathe and soften, relax something. And the third is to ask, where's the love? Not expecting an answer, but maybe just opens a sense of curiosity, presence. Or maybe you discover that the love can be found in asking the question, the care, the tenderness from which that comes, that question. And you can do this through the whole sitting, just go through the three over and over again, or periodically as you wish, or just sit here silently. You could simplify the third breath. Do not have a question, but just say the word love quietly to yourself in your mind. Maybe be saying, breathing for the first breath, soft for the second, love for the third. And saying the words as quietly as the mind is capable. If you find yourself thinking a lot during the meditation, then the three breath journey might be a better alternative. If you find yourself thinking a lot during the meditation, then the three breath journey might be a better alternative. If you find yourself thinking a lot during the meditation, then the three breath journey might be a better alternative. If you find yourself thinking a lot during the meditation, then the three breath journey might be a better alternative. And then as we come to the end of the sitting, perhaps the three breath journey, three breaths, could be done in preparation or ending the sitting and being ready to enter the world again. One breath to breathe, one breath to soften, and one breath for love. Where's the love? And then taking some deep breaths, and on the exhales, sending out into the world your goodwill, your well-wishing, your love. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
