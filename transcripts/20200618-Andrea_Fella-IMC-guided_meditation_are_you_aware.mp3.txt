When the mind is not relaxed, it tends to be caught up in thoughts of past or future or just engaged in some machinations in the mind. 
Yet when the mind is relaxed, it's not engaged in thoughts of past or future. 
Its nature is to be aware. 
So the relaxation is a condition that really supports this natural capacity for awareness. 
So we'll begin with kind of just scanning through the body. 
Starting with relaxing the body is a condition that supports relaxing the mind. 
So we'll start with just to scan through the body. 
And just notice where there might be tension and seeing if it can be softened or the muscles can release a little bit. 
Just checking into your head, the top of your head and face. 
And seeing if there can be a softening. 
Relaxing. 
Relaxing particularly across the forehead, around the eyes, the mouth, the jaw. 
These areas can be held kind of with habitual tension. 
And sometimes just tuning into those areas with the intention to soften can allow there to be some relaxation. 
Relaxing the neck and shoulders, the arms, the hands. 
And this process of attuning to the body and exploring relaxation is cultivating mindfulness while we're doing it. 
We are aware of the body. 
It can also be useful to be aware of what happens as you relax. 
How does that affect you? As relaxation may be available. 
Relaxing the chest and upper back. 
The muscles across the stomach and abdomen, the middle and lower back. 
Relaxing the hips, the legs and the feet. 
And maybe you might have noticed that this process of relaxing the body has shifted the experience more generally, the mental quality. 
Perhaps you've noticed that. 
Because relaxing the body does, there is a supportive condition for the mind to more naturally relax. 
And perhaps the mind can relax a little bit. 
Perhaps there can be a letting go of tension, worry, concern, mental tension. 
Worries and concerns. 
Just seeing if they can maybe be set aside for now. 
Maybe the mind can relax. 
Often that's not something we can do so much, but sometimes there is a way into that. 
The feeling of softening the mind. 
Relaxing mental tension. 
Sometimes since the, or a common experience is that the mind is located in the head sometimes Gil suggests an analogy. 
Maybe the brain can relax. 
That's a way into a different way of being in the mind. 
As the body and mind relax. 
That is a condition for this very natural capacity, natural aspect of our human system to know what's happening. 
Our mind isn't caught up in all its thoughts and worries. 
We'll very naturally be aware. 
So can you feel that or taste that possibility? Are you aware? Just to know exactly how you know you're aware. 
Just a simple kind of recognition. 
Yes. 
The mind is present with the body. 
You know that I'm sitting here. 
In fact, that simple instruction. 
Sit and know that you're sitting. 
Be aware of sitting. 
One teacher, one of Joseph Goldstein's teacher, Moon Indraji, said that if you sit and know that you're sitting the whole of the Dharma will unfold for you. 
It's really simple. 
Are you aware? Do you know that you're aware? And awareness being here is naturally knowing something. 
So sometimes I like to point to this aspect of receiving. 
Receiving what's already, what awareness is already knowing. 
This is already aware of. 
Settle back. 
Let experience come to you. 
I used to think that if I wasn't directing my attention, aiming towards some particular thing, like the breath, that it meant I wasn't being mindful. 
This is a different kind of approach. 
We notice that we're aware and we receive whatever is obvious. 
That might be body sensations. 
It might be a breath. 
It might be sound. 
It might be this recognition of hearing, the sound of my voice. 
It might be emotions or moods. 
Sometimes even if our eyes are closed it can kind of be the visual field. 
What is obvious? If you've mostly practiced with the directing of the attention, you can sometimes take some time to let go of that habit and just settle back and be willing to be the passenger like you were the passenger in a car rather than the driver. 
Just watching things go by. 
Receiving. 
Receiving whatever is here. 
And much like an experience of being a passenger when you're not in charge of the driving, the experience changes dynamically. 
And that's fine. 
That's actually the nature of our experience. 
For some moments perhaps there's the experience of breathing and then the attention shifts to hearing and then to an emotion or a mood. 
Maybe even an awareness of a thought going by. 
And then another body sensation. 
This practice of receiving is kind of stepping out of being in control of where the attention is. 
That it is a commitment to being available to receive. 
Be aware of what's obvious. 
With curiosity, what is this experience? And exploring practice in this way a receptive kind of practice. 
It's helpful to every now and then kind of check in and see how am I in relationship to what's happening. 
This place of our relationship to experience is so often where struggles start. 
There's something happening and we don't like it or we like it, we want it, we don't want it. 
It takes us off of balance. 
We're not simply with experience as it's arising. 
We want more of it. 
We want to get rid of it. 
Or maybe there's confusion. 
So every now and then checking in. 
This is what's here. 
Checking the relationship is kind of like broadening. 
I almost say it's saying, is there something else here that's useful to be, to receive this relationship to experience? And then gliding towards the curiosity and allowing what is arising to be received without pushing or pulling. 
Simple, non-judgmental awareness. 
This is what's here right now. 
And of course the mind will wonder. 
And equally naturally the mindfulness will return at some point. 
In that moment that mindfulness returns. 
Awareness is here again. 
There's not much we can do about the fact that the mind was wandering. 
But what is your relationship to that moment when awareness returns? Often there's judgment. 
That can be received as what has arisen. 
Notice that I was thinking and judging is happening. 
And there is the possibility for kind of curiosity about that moment of awareness returning. 
It's kind of an amazing moment. 
Mindfulness has returned of its own nature, of its own accord. 
You did not have to make any effort for that moment of mindfulness to arise. 
And so it helps us to begin to recognize the possibility of a less effortful practice. 
Mindfulness has arisen and awareness is here again. 
And simply receiving. 
That is obvious. 
Just a light touch of remembering awareness and receiving experience. 
You don't have to jump on any experience. 
It's whatever wants to show up and be known. 
That's kind of enough. 
Relax. 
Are you aware? It's obvious. 
Thank you. 
Thank you.
