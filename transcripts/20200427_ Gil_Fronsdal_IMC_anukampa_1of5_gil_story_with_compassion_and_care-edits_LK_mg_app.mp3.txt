Hello  again.  Today  I begin  another  five-part series  of 
talks for these  morning  sits. What  I’d like to do this 
week  is introduce  one of my favorite  Buddhist  topics.  
I’ve been  reading  the Buddha’s teachings  for a long 
time,  but I didn’t really  see this conce pt there.  I didn’t 
pull it out of the texts and understand  that it was there,  
partly  because  it was translated  in a way that made  it 
more  obscure.  Translated  by the word  ‘compassion, ’ it 
may seem  on the surface,  to be a pretty  straightforward  
concept.  
 
It turns  out there  are two words  in the Pali texts  that 
well-known  translators  will translate  as ‘compassion. ’ 
One is karuṇā, and the other  is anukampā . By 
translating  both these  words  as ‘compassion, ’ we don’t 
see how the two are distin ct from each  other.

When  I started  looking  into this ,and seeing  what’s 
specifically  said about  anukampā  in the suttas,  it 
became  quite  meaningful  for me. It touched  something  
very deep  inside  that I came  to recognize  as having  its 
own specialness.  In the past,  I think  I would  have  
identified  it as a quality  of compassion.  That’s fine, but 
now anukampā  seems , in a wonderful  way, to be 
something  much  more  fundamental  and broad er in 
scope  than compassion.  
 
I tend to translate  anukampā  as ‘care’ or “caring  for the 
world,  for oneself, and for others.” I like the English  
word  ‘care,’ because  of its double  meanings.  To care 
for others  means  to value  and appreciate  them.  But it 
could  also mean  to actively  do something  for them  – to 
help,  provide  for, and support  them.  These  two 
meanings  – to value  and to provide  support  – are 
beautiful  things  to do.  
 
Today  I would  like to say something  about  my own 
journey  in the Dharma  in relationship  to three  beautiful  
qualities  of heart  that can grow  through  this pract ice – 
compassion , loving -kindness,  and anukampā  or care.  
The way this came  to me and became  strong  was in 
that sequence.  
 
I’ve been  doing  Dharma  practice  for 45 years.  So, to go 
back  and look over how it’s evolved  over all these   
3 
  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK decades,  I see a slow change  over what  was salient  
and really  important  for me in different  eras of my 
practice.   
 
In the early  years,  when  I had a lot of personal  suffering  
and challenges,  I was doing  Zen practice.  As I started  
to develop  and deepen  the practice,  the language  of 
Zen meditation  and the way I described  it to myself  was 
tenderizing , in the way that meat  can be tenderized.  
Because  meat  can be tough,  you can put something  on 
it to make  it more  tender.  I felt that zazen  – Zen 
meditation  – was tenderizing  my heart.  
 
After some  years  of practice,  I slowly  realized  in 
retrospect  that one of the things  happening  for me in 
those  early  years  was that I was becoming  
‘compassioned. ’ I was becoming attuned  to my own 
suffering , and then to the suffering  around  me. The 
salient  quality  that met, responded  to, and supported  
this was a quality  of compassion,  warmth,  an extreme  
‘caringness ’ that was specific  to suffering.  At first, I 
wasn’t conscious  of this actively  happening . I think  one 
of the first signs  was that I found  myself  very strongly  
drawn  towards  Buddhist  statues,  drawings,  and 
paintings  of Avalokiteshvara , Kuan -yin, or Kannon  – the 
bodhisattva , the great  being  of compassion.  I would  
draw  them , and put photographs  of statues  on my wall. 
I didn’t think  about  it much.  I just found  these  images  
and put them  up.

When  I would  see people  or objects  in the world,  I 
would  identify  them  as being  people  or objects  of 
compassion.  I remember  saying  to others,  “Now that’s a 
really  compassionate  person,” and they were  surprised  
that I would  see compassion  in that person,  because  
that wasn’t their association.  But I was seeing  this 
around  me. Even  sometimes  just the breeze  of the wind 
against  my cheek  felt like a breeze  of comp assion.  I 
think  in Zen it’s sometimes  called  the golden  wind.  
 
In retrospect,  I think  I needed  a lot of compassion.  I 
needed  the medicine  or salve  of compassion  in order  to 
meet  and be with my own suffering.  Or perhaps , rather  
than needing  it, it just was the byproduct.   
 
I think  one of the reasons  that compassion  arose  for me 
in Zen practice  is that Zen is very simple.  The way I 
understood  and practiced  it was as a thorough  
acceptance  of the moment  as it was. Since  I had a lot of 
suffering,  it became  a certain  kind of acceptance,  just 
being  with it, and allowing  it. This allowing  and being  
with the suffering  that was there  had a tenderizing  
effect.  I would  let go of all the resistance  to and 
judgments  I had about  my suffering , and the discursive  
thoughts  that would  get trigger ed. I would  come  back,  
and just feel and be here with what  was. And what  was 
here was suffering  – and that was tenderizing.

  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK In those  early  years,  one fortun ate thing  was that I 
didn’t know  very much  about  meditation.  So I didn’t 
have  meditation  techniques  to try to work  with suffering  
or fix it. I just sat in an open,  somewhat  simple  way with 
experience,  and doing  so changed  me. It changed  me 
so much  that this compassion  grew.  It became  the 
orienting,  organizing  principle  of my life.  
 
At some  point,  I decided  I would  dedicate  my life to 
Buddhism,  Buddhist  practice,  and maybe  teaching  
Buddhism , as my response  to the suffering  of the world.  
I never  had any sense  that I was going  to be effective  in 
doing  so. But I did have a clear  sense  that that’s what  I 
wanted  my life to be about.  When  I started  this road,  the 
image  I had of myself  wanting  to respond  to the world  
out of compassion  was to have  a little storefront  Zen 
center,  a meditation  hall. I would  get up in the morning.  
I would  keep  it clean.  I would  let people  come  in, and 
we would  medi tate together  in the morning.  That would  
be the core way in which  I supported  people.  So now,  
many  years  later,  we have  this 7:00 a.m. sitting,  which  
for me is the fulfillment  of a goal I had many  years  ago. 
 
I discovered  some  of the ins and outs of compas sion.  I 
discovered,  to my surprise,  that compassion  can feel 
nurturing  and sweet.  A wonderful,  pleasant  feeling  can 
come  with pure compassion.

  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK At some  point,  I started  doing  vipassanā  practice.  In 
United  States  especially , teachers  would  teach  loving -
kindness  practice  – mettā . When I was a young  student  
with a Zen background,  loving -kindness  practice  
seemed  to me to be too sentimental  and artificial . And I 
would  simply  tune out the teachers  that did guided  
loving -kindness  meditation s.  
 
But in the course  of sitting  long retreats,  especially  the 
three -month  retreats  at the Insight  Meditation  Society,  
at some  point,  a sweetness  and warmth  started,  and 
that again  may have  been  tenderizing.  Something  
began  to open  in me that had a sense  of joy, delight , or 
happiness . Then  when  a teacher  started  to talk about  
loving -kindness  and loving -kindness  meditation,  I said,  
“That’s it. I know  what  they’re talking  about  now.” 
 
Then  the idea of loving -kindness  and loving -kindness  
meditation  had a wonderful  meaning  and value  for me, 
but it had a very different  flavor  than compassion.  It still 
had to do with caring  for people , and caring  for oneself  
– but it came  with a sense  of delight  and wanting  them  
to be happy.  To have  this more  open,  relaxed  
experience  was a very different  affect  for me. For a long 
time I wondered  whether  it was something  about  Zen 
versus  vipassanā  – one manifesting  as compassion  and 
the other  as loving -kindness.  Or perhaps  it had to do 
with a particular  phase  of my life – what  was useful,  and  
7 
  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK what  came  with this tenderizing  and opening  of the 
heart.   
 
Certainly  loving -kindness  started  to come  when  I didn’t 
have  so much  suffering  anymore.  I had become  a bit 
freer, and had real moments  of suffering  dropping  
away.  Maybe  what  made  loving -kindness  possible  as 
an expression  of a caring  heart  was sitting  there  and 
practicing  without  suffering  as a reference  point.  
 
As the decades  went  along,  I noticed  that there  was a 
shift in my experience  of care,  wanting  to respond  to the 
world  with this certain  kind of love that I felt. I started  to 
become  simpler  and simpler , in a way that I didn’t quite  
associate  with compassion.  Even  though  I could  call it 
compassion,  it just seemed  so simple.  Also I didn’t quite  
associate  this experience  of care with loving -kindness,  
because  that seemed  more  active,  energized,  and 
relational  in some  more  complicated  way.  
 
There  was something  simpler  that I associated  with the 
sense  of freedom,  ease,  and peace  that had come  with 
the practice.  It was this idea that there  was very simple,  
caring  responsivity  – wanting  to support  and work  for 
people . But it was clearly  connected  to a sense  of 
peace,  well-being,  and ease.  Ease seemed  to be 
almost  part and parcel  of it. But as soon  as I would  refer 
to it as loving -kindness  or compassion,  it seemed  to get 
more  activated,  conceptual,  and involved.  There’s  
8 
  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK nothing  at all wrong  with that, but I like the 
peacefulness.  At times  I struggled  a little bit 
conceptually : “Is it okay  to stay that simple?  Shouldn’t I 
be more  activel y concerned  or compassionate? ” But 
this way just felt so right.  
 
Then  I started  studying  how compassion  is talked  about  
in the suttas.  I started  seeing  a distinction  in the suttas  
between  compassion  and anukampā . The big 
difference  is that anukampā  is the primary  word  the 
Buddha  uses  for actively  caring,  supporting,  teaching,  
and being  generous  to other  people.  In the suttas,  that’s 
described  over and over as being  done  out of 
anukampā . It’s never  described  as coming  out of 
karuṇā. Karuṇā has a very different  meaning  in the 
suttas , and it’s certainly  different  from what  it has come  
to mean  in translation.   
 
Anukampā  is the active  word  and emotion  for caring  for 
others.  It’s not defined  in the suttas,  but over and over 
again  when  someone  has anukampā , they’re 
concerned  for the welfare  of others.  This idea of welfare  
for others  is broader  in nature  than compassion.  
Compassion  is certainly  about  the welfare  of others,  but 
it is specific ally not wanting  others  to suffer , or wanting  
to allevia te suffering.  Loving -kindness  is more  about  
letting  people  be happy.  There  can be a lot of 
compassion  there  too and concern  for people’s 
suffering,  but it’s more  specific.

  Transcribed  by https://otter.ai -edits  LK  
What  I came  to understand  in the suttas  is that 
anukampā  is the broad  feeling  that encompasses  all the 
brahmavihāras  – compassion , loving -kindness,  
sympathetic  joy, and equanimity.  It’s more  like this is 
the broad  term for being  involved  with care for the 
world.  
 
That anukampā  is the foundation  for the other  forms  of 
love is not from the Buddha,  but rather  my own sense  of 
it. I associate  anukampā  with something  very deep  and 
peaceful  from which  my care comes.  I’ve said,  “Oh, 
that’s probably  anukampā .” Having  a word  for it has 
really  made  a difference  for me. It brought  me delight  
and joy. It freed  up anukampā  to be there  as its own 
thing,  and now I’ve come  to translate  it as ‘care.’ 
 
The fundamental  capacity  to care can be very simple  
and uncomplicated  – coming  from a sense  of ease,  
peace,  and freedom.  That can be the foundation.  Then,  
as appropriate,  it can get expressed  in different  ways.  
 
So that’s what  I want  to talk about  this week  – 
anukampā . I hope  that offering  my own story  of how I 
came  to it sets the context  for what  we’ll do for the next 
four mornings.   
 
Thank  you for listening,  and I look forward  to tomorrow.
