So, as we said this morning, the theme for our retreat is the Satipatana Sutta.
And this morning, Pam spoke about and guided us in instructions on some aspects of mindfulness
of the body.
That's one of the four foundations of mindfulness, or four establishments of mindfulness that
are talked about in the Satipatana Sutta.
Satipatana basically is the, that's the Pali language, and Sati means mindfulness.
And the Patana part basically means something like standing with, or sometimes foundation,
something like that.
I happen to like Bhikkunalya's translation of establishing mindfulness, because foundation
sounds like a thing that we can like land on, and like just something solid.
And establishing mindfulness with experience sounds more like a process.
And that is my experience of what mindfulness is.
It's a process of connecting with experience.
And the Sutta talks about various areas of experience that we connect with that essentially
cover the entirety of our experience.
So this afternoon, I'm going to talk a little bit about, just in an overview, a little bit
about the Sutta, the four foundations of mindfulness, the four establishments of mindfulness, and
then go a little bit more into the body section of that Sutta.
So the Sutta begins with a kind of a definition of what it means to be mindful in a skillful
way.
How do we observe experience?
The Buddha asks.
He says, we should observe experience in a particular way.
There's a particular sentence he uses to describe for each of these four areas, each of these
four aspects of experience.
The body, mindfulness of feelings, whether experience is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
Mindfulness of mental states, what's happening in our mind.
And then the fourth foundation, a little bit harder to describe concisely what it is, but
we could say it's looking at experience through some of the perspective of the Dharma.
All experience can be understood, experience arising as experience can be understood in
terms of the perspectives that the Dharma offers.
And some of those perspectives have to do with how the various functions in our minds
and hearts, how the various processes that make up this mind and body system, how those
various processes relate to each other.
So that fourth foundation is looking at that area.
But the succinct definition that the Buddha offers for each of these four areas, he says,
we should abide observing the body as a body.
Experience as feelings, mind states as mind states, and experience as experience, ardent,
fully aware, mindful, having set aside greed and distress for the world.
So this single sentence repeated four times, one for each of the four foundations, includes
a lot actually.
It's a pretty succinct and clear exploration of not only what we attend to and experience,
but how to attend to it.
The first word abides to me that just evokes the whole like container of relaxation.
Abide with experience, not dive into it, not dig into it, abide, live with, be with the
phrase Pam use this morning, abide observing, connecting with, being with, abide observing
the body as a body.
Now that little part of the definition also I find very interesting because it really
points to in a very clear and simple way what the perspective of wise mindfulness is, the
perspective that this whole sutra is pointing us to, the perspective of noticing experience
in the present moment.
This is all of course experience in the present moment, the only place we can know experience,
experience as experience arising in the present moment.
We know the body as a body, we know feelings as feelings.
Simple kind of connection to experience, just knowing experience in and of itself.
This perspective sounds like, you know, it just sounds like nothing sometimes, you know,
just like, well, the body is a body, okay, but if we really explore what that means in
our present moment experience, it's a very different perspective than we usually bring
to our connection with experience.
Usually our relationship with knowing experiences, something about how does it relate to me?
Well can I get out of it?
Not just simply this is experience, this is the experience that's arising right now.
We have some relationship to it that's usually connected either to greed of wanting something
to be a certain way or of aversion wanting to get rid of something or of confusion, not
knowing how to relate to it or relating to it from particular views and beliefs and ideas
as opposed to just simply understanding this is what's arising right now.
That's the perspective of mindfulness.
So we abide observing the body as a body, ardent with some engagement, a connectivity,
a sense of heart, heartfulness in the connection to the experience.
With some kind of persistence, ardency also pulling in that kind of connecting, being
present with some engagement.
Fully aware that piece also pulls in a whole host of understanding.
The suttas describe a kind of a definition of what it means to be fully aware is that
we understand the arising and passing nature of experience, that we are with experience
kind of more continuously and seeing that it is arising and passing.
So again this brings in kind of a wisdom perspective of understanding.
We notice the body as a body in its nature of arising and passing away.
The sensations come and go, nothing in our experience lasts for very long.
Feelings come and go, mind states come and go.
One abides observing the body as a body, ardent, fully aware, mindful.
Seeing aside greed and distress for the world.
So this is again pointing to the perspective of not that we repress greed and distress,
but that we don't have the familiar relationship to it of following it.
Perhaps we can recognize when that's arising or perhaps at times we can just simply say,
yes, I'm just not going to attend to that greed and distress right now.
I'm going to attend to experience as experience.
This sentence that I've just expressed here in just a few minutes, it could be unpacked
much more thoroughly.
Each word could be unpacked and we could explore in more depth what each of those words means.
But just for now, given the brief description I gave, you connect with your bodily experience
right now and explore what it might mean to abide, observing whatever bodily experience
is just as bodily experience, sensations, bodily sensations, a breath, a pressure, a tingling,
a coolness, abide, observing the body as a body, bodily experience as simply bodily experience.
Being engaged, persistent, to stay present with, ardent, fully aware of your experience
and mindful.
Another aspect of the Satipatanasuta with each of these four areas of experience, the body,
feeling tone, mind states, and experience in general, each section of the Satipatanasuta
has different exercises or different pointings to how we can explore that particular aspect
of experience.
The section on the body for instance has six different ways in to exploring bodily experience.
With each one of those exercises all the way throughout the Suta, the Buddha follows that
exercise with what one scholar monk, Bhikkhu Analyo, calls the refrain.
Like in a song, a refrain in the song repeats, you get to know the refrain as it repeats
each time.
So the Buddha repeats this encouragement for us to be curious about our experience in a
way that supports insight and understanding.
Two aspects I'll highlight from that refrain.
He encourages us to be aware of our bodily experience internally, which is what we normally
mean or think we mean when we're talking about being mindful of the body.
We think about being mindful of this body.
What the Buddha encourages us to be mindful of the body internally and externally.
There's not a clear definition of what that actually means, but the commentaries say what
it means is being aware of others, being aware of the bodies of others.
So an encouragement to recognize not only our own experience in the present moment,
but the experience of others in the present moment.
We do this primarily through our senses.
We see, we hear, what others are doing, we make inferences about what others are doing.
And part of the exploration here is not to land in the inferences, but to really recognize,
oh yes, this is what is happening externally.
I've heard this, and it just happened on one retreat, I was sitting outside, and a cat
was walking by, and I began just noticing the cat's movements as just bodily movements.
My mind was doing a lot of noting practice at that point, the practice was a lot of knowing
so when I was walking, for instance, I was going lifting, moving, placing, stepping,
stepping.
And what I found myself doing as I observed this cat was something like stepping, stepping,
stepping, stopping, shaking, itching, just watching that being, its process of movement
unfold.
This may sound like something that would create a distance between us and others, but it actually
does just the opposite.
What our minds usually do around other people creates a distance.
We create a separation, I and us and them, me and them.
Because we usually see people through our ideas about them, our concepts about them.
And Buddha is encouraging us to notice this being as a being, the way we're encouraged
to notice our being as a being, a body as a body.
And so it actually, at least in my experience as I've explored this, it kind of seems to
strip away or pull away some of the ideas and views and concepts that we carry about
people that supports us to actually just notice them as other beings and can actually open
our hearts.
And so this is one, I find on these online retreats, this is a beautiful contemplation
to hold while you are out doing your walks in the neighborhood or if you have to go
to a grocery store or to an appointment or if you're living with family, just think if
you can explore remembering this part of the Satipatana instructions, explore noticing
the body internally and externally.
Another aspect of the refrain points to noticing the impermanent nature of experience, being
aware that experience is arising and passing away.
This is something we can kind of orient to recognize.
We can choose to kind of, in our day, be aware of the changing nature of experience throughout
the day.
It's kind of attuning to that aspect of experience.
How when you're chopping vegetables, the vegetable changes its form from being whole
to being in pieces, how it transforms when it gets cooked or eaten.
We can contemplate impermanence in this way, just kind of orienting our minds that way,
noticing the change of light and shadow in the day and then more kind of close in, noticing
how nothing that we experience lasts for very long.
These two pieces, the internal, external and the impermanence, are both pointing us towards
a way of observing experience that helps to undermine the ways that we habitually cling
to experience, resist experience, the ways we habitually try to control experience to
be what we want it to be.
The exploration of impermanence helps the mind to understand that there's nothing worth
clinging to, nothing lasts for very long.
I think the internal and external helps to undermine our so thorough, usual perspective
of experience from inside our own system, almost begin to recognize what's happening
out there.
This can get particularly interesting around mind states, not that we know really what's
happening in mind states, but we have ways that we infer that.
When we see somebody frustrated or confused, can we know that, oh, there's frustration
happening there.
As we see in our own experience what it's like to navigate being present with our own
experience, we begin to appreciate how hard it is to be a human being and how little control
we might have over the arising of some of these mind states.
In exploring that, oh, yeah, there's frustration arising here internally.
There's frustration arising externally.
It's just frustration arising.
It can help to separate that or to reduce that barrier or that boundary of us and them
in terms of just understanding the process and nature of experience.
This is the larger framework of the Satipatanasuta, the sentence of describing how to attend
to experience and this encouragement to attend in a particular way internally, externally,
with an attunement around impermanence.
The foundation of the body is an excellent place really to ground the attention, to connect
with experience.
It's kind of one of the more obvious areas of our experience.
It's a place where we can begin and perhaps that's why it's the first of the four establishments
of mindfulness, the first area the Buddha points us to familiarize ourselves with.
The other, the next two aspects of the Satipatanasuta, feeling, tone and mind states, turn towards
observing what's happening in the mind, which is a subtler kind of phenomenon.
The fourth foundation actually includes instructions on both body and mind, but these first three,
the first one, observing the body, getting familiar with bodily experience and the next
two, feeling, tone and mind states, are pointers to particular aspects of mental experience.
I think this is an interesting thing to begin to recognize.
The Buddha is basically talking about different processes at work in this being.
If we begin to get familiar with what the experience of the bodily process is, we start
to begin to kind of tease apart and understand that there are differences between bodily
processes and mental processes.
These two get kind of conflated, they kind of intertwine.
Something happens in our body, feeling a strong pressure or a twisting or a burning sensation
that is experienced as unpleasant, a mental experience of it as unpleasant, and then there's
often reactions to it, aversion wanting to fix it or control it.
Understanding these as different parts of experience and being aware of them as experience
helps the mind to kind of tease apart the experience in particular around body, tease
apart the bodily experience from the mental reactivity to it.
This is huge, this really helps us in navigating our lives with less reactivity.
We begin to see that that mental activity, that aversion, that greed, that frustration,
that anger, that confusion, that mental activity is constructed, conditioned, and optional.
It may not seem optional, but because it is conditioned, it's not directly the same thing,
like for instance the pain that you experience, the physical pain you might experience in
some part of your body, is a different thing than the aversion to it.
As we start to tease those apart, we begin to recognize, oh, there can be pain in the
body and the mind does not have to hate it, the mind doesn't have to be angry about it
or frustrated or confused about it.
That begins to give us a taste of a whole different way of relating to experience, that simple
experience of noticing that physical pain, physical unpleasant sensation can arise and
not be reacted to with our usual habits.
That opens the mind to a whole different approach to relating to experience, with compassion,
with care, with love, with wisdom, instead of with our habitual greed, aversion and delusion.
So in the foundation of the body, there are six exercises, the breath, the mindfulness
of breathing, which Pam explored this morning in our guided meditation.
There's posture, aware, just simple of knowing that you're sitting while you're sitting,
knowing that you're standing while you're standing, walking, lying down, just aware
of the posture.
Actually many of the instructions in the body point to a simplification of orienting to
being aware of the body in a way, with the mindfulness of breathing.
There's in that section of being aware of the breath, it starts with just breathing
in, knowing that you're breathing in, knowing whether you're breathing in is a long breath
or a short breath, just know that.
You don't have to know a lot of little details about it to begin, just breathing in, knowing
that you're breathing in, breathing out, knowing that you're breathing out.
Being curious about where and how you know that, and pointed to kind of, you know, where,
how do you know you're breathing, you know, what's the sensations that let you know you're
breathing, and just, you know, sometimes it might not be so clear what that is, but we
can know that we're breathing in, we can know that we're breathing out, and then it points
us to a kind of a stepping back, a kind of a relaxing, and at least in my experience,
it helps to relax as we explore breathing while experiencing the whole body.
You can try that right now, being aware, just knowing that you're breathing, just that simple
knowing that you're breathing, and see if while that's happening, you can relax and
kind of just take in the whole field of the body while you know the breathing.
Tanasaro Bhikkhu offers an analogy that I find really useful in exploring this particular
piece.
He says that if we're in a room that has a candle in the middle of the room, we can
look right at the candle, know something about the candle and the flame, or we can notice
that the light from the candle lights up the whole room.
That's kind of what this encouragement is around being aware of the whole body while
breathing.
You don't have to look right at the breath there, but while you're breathing, let that
breath light up the whole of the bodily experience.
My experience, a very relaxed approach, is helpful here.
It's not something we're looking at directly, it's more like it comes to us, that receptive
quality.
Breathing in, experiencing the whole body.
Breathing out, experiencing the whole body.
Relaxing, maybe it's not that you experience the whole body, but kind of a piece of the
body.
Maybe you're experiencing the chest and the torso.
The fourth aspect of attending to the breath that's in the section of the body is that
we train to calm the breathing, calm the body.
And so exploring perhaps a way to breathe that feels comfortable, it feels easeful.
When I practiced an extended period of breath meditation with Tanasaro Bikku, he encouraged
me to play with the breath a little bit.
It makes it feel comfortable, maybe breathe a little longer, a little shorter.
Maybe a long breath is more comfortable right now.
Exploring, experimenting with that.
I would play with that for a little while, but after a little while, the effort to do
that exploration may get a little bit tiring.
And so then just another way into it is just kind of like to ask a request.
So okay, mind and body, can you show me how to breathe comfortably?
Maybe, maybe the breath become comfortable.
I would drop that little request into my system and then just see how the system responded
and often there'd be some little loosening or kind of relaxing around some area.
It just made the breath a little more easeful, a little more comfortable.
May the breathing become comfortable, easeful.
May there be relaxation with the breathing.
Another area of the body that I'd like to explore with you in a little more depth right
now is what's called the elements.
And Pam pointed to this in our guided meditation this morning too.
This is, Masuta uses language that wouldn't necessarily be that resonant for us.
It says, in this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire element
and the air element.
But even the commentaries, the old commentaries point to what he's talking about there, what
that's referring to.
Noticing the earth element, this noticing sensations that are connected with heaviness,
weight, density, solidity, the fire element is noticing experience connected with heat
and coolness.
Even the water element is noticing sensations connected with moisture and dryness.
The air element is noticing sensations connected with movement.
That includes a whole range of sensations like vibration, pulsing, tingling, as well as physical
movement that happens like with the breath.
In this body there are these elemental sensations.
This is in a way pointing down to use the language of the Suta, a more elemental experience
of the body closer to just what is actually going on in the body.
We typically relate to our bodies through concept.
We think, you know, we're experiencing our hand or our shoulder or our knee, but what
is the experience of hand?
Letting your attention perhaps right now come into that place that we call hand and what
sensations are there?
Maybe there's some vibration, pulsing, tingling, those three air element sensations.
Maybe there's a sense of moisture, stickiness maybe on the hand, that's water element, or
maybe there's dryness, the absence of water element.
Maybe there's a temperature quality, a warmth or a coolness, or a sense of solidity and
structure of the hand.
We could say in a way that this exploration of this elemental experience is kind of like
exploring how the body communicates with us, the language of the body.
The body speaks in these sensation level experiences and then we put it together in our minds and
create a hand out of it.
But the body is speaking to us at this level, this elemental level of experience.
I'm going to go through these four in a little bit of almost a guided practice for you right
now.
Just taking in this body sitting here, the earth element, the aspects of the body that
are solid sensations like solidity, the weight of yourself, perhaps a hardness where the body
is pressing against the chair or couch or cushion.
Maybe a sense in the uprightness of the body or if you're prone, just in the posture that
you're in, something of the structure of the bones, the solidity of the bones.
I've heard teachers use this phrase that evokes something, maybe this body is earth sitting
on earth, may touch into that quality of the solidity of this form in this place.
In the air element, maybe in this experience of the body, shifting to explore a different
terrain experience, maybe there's some place in the body where there's a sense of tingling
or pulsing or vibration.
Maybe this sense of movement as the breath comes in and goes out of the body, the expansion
and contraction of the chest, the sense perhaps of pulses of pressure in the nostrils and back
of the throat as the breath comes in, this is air element, fire element, the temperature
difference between your hands and your face, and that highlights the sensation of temperature
there, for me the face is warm and the fingers are cool, and then the water element, moisture,
stickiness, dryness, slipperiness, one place to touch into this is if running your tongue
across the back of your teeth, that's water element, that water element is often said
to be harder to see directly, it kind of shows up independence on the others, so running
your tongue across the surface of your teeth, you may notice that there's hardness of the
tooth as you move the tongue across it, and so there's the hardness, the earth element
there, there's the movement of the tongue, the air element there, revealing the slipperiness,
the water element.
So learning this language of the body, as I spoke about earlier, the beginning to distinguish
what the bodily experience is helps us to differentiate between what body experiences
and what mind experiences.
This elemental nature of experience helps us to recognize that the sensation level of
experience is different than our identification of parts of the body, different from ideas
and views that we have about our body, different from the experience of whether it's pleasant
or unpleasant actually, we'll talk more about that tomorrow.
So this begins to help us to tease apart the sensation level experience from the concept
and belief view about experience, and that's helpful because in the realm of concept, belief
view, relationship to experience, this is where suffering rises, and yet we kind of
mix them up, we blame the body for the pain as opposed to recognizing that it's the mind's
relationship to that pain where the real struggle is.
So we learn this language of the body, how the body communicates with us and provides
us with information.
This section of the body includes other areas that we won't go into so much right now, the
posture and daily activities, just a simple kind of recognition of knowing that you're
walking when you're walking, standing when you're standing, and daily activities.
The Sutta encourages us to be aware when we're talking, when we're silent, when we're coming
and going, when we're extending and bending our arms and legs, and they're just pointing
to some very simple aspects of our bodily movement to know it's happening while it's
happening.
There's a couple of others that we probably won't go into so much on this retreat.
They're more reflective practices, encouraging us to reflect that our body is composed of
various parts, head hairs, body hairs, skin, nails, teeth, envisioning.
One teacher taught me to envision like as if my hair were sitting on a platter in front
of me and then my teeth sitting on a platter in front of me, just to kind of deconstruct
our body in that way.
It's an imagination exercise, it's a kind of a reflective practice that helps us to
disidentify with our bodies.
It's not about having a negative experience of our body but kind of just noticing this
is what our body, this is what a body is.
And then the sixth exercise is contemplation around our death, remembering that we will
die, that our bodies will decay.
Again, this is a reflective practice, it's kind of a bringing the images or the possibility
reminding ourselves that this is true.
This is actually a powerful reflection to bring to mind each day and the Buddha encourages
us to reflect daily that we are of a nature, to age, to sicken, to die, the nature for
all things to be separated from us, essentially reflecting regularly on the impermanent nature
of our experience because it helps us to see that so much of our mode of living in the
world is trying to hold on to and cling to things that just are not reliable places for
lasting happiness, the impermanent nature of experience, it's not a reliable place to
land for happiness.
Then the last piece I'll offer before opening it up, if there's any questions, there won't
any submitted in advance, which is why I decided to talk for a little bit longer.
This is about continuity, maintaining a kind of a sense of the interest in our experience
and in this case in the bodily experience, moment after moment.
This is encouraged in many places, but the postures and the daily activities sections
are really pointing to this, it's not just about being aware when we're sitting silently
with our eyes closed, but being aware while we're walking, while we're standing, while
we're talking, remaining silent, while we're reaching for a vegetable, while we're closing
the drawer, while we're opening the refrigerator, simple, just awareness, it doesn't have to
be like pushing the mind into experience and trying to see things in detail, just being
with ourselves while we go about our day, be with ourselves while we brush our teeth
and make our beds and put on our clothes and be with ourselves while we take a walk.
This continuity supports a stability of the mindfulness, which is essentially what concentration
is and mindfulness stabilizes moment after moment.
This is a form of concentration, there's different forms of concentration, when we
focus that stabilizing of mindfulness on one particular experience like the breath, that
becomes what we usually call concentration, a very focused kind of attention.
But the stability of mindfulness just on experience, just on being with yourself while
you're opening the refrigerator and pulling out some food.
That continuity supports a stability of mindfulness, which is a form of concentration called moment
to moment concentration, concentration of experience one moment after another.
That moment to moment concentration creates the conditions for us to be less judgmental,
more non-reactive about what's happening, in part because it's like, well, this is
what's happening now, and instead of launching into some kind of argument with ourselves
about this thing that's happening or a frustration about that, it did happen or holding onto
it because we like it so much, the next moment something else is happening and we know that.
And then the next moment, there's something else, just this continual, oh, this is what's
happening now, no, there's vibration, coolness and relaxation, seeing, feeling of happiness
just moment after moment, being with yourself supports this mindfulness to become a powerful
factor of awakening, supporting us to wake up to what's actually happening moment to
moment in our experience, seeing the conditioned nature of experience, noticing how practice
unfolds, how experience unfolds, that certain experiences tend to have our minds get wrapped
up into struggle, and other modes, you know, when greed is arising in the mind and aversion
is arising in the mind, the mind tends to get wrapped up in that wanting to hold on
to something, and there's other experiences when curiosity, interest, kindness are arising
with mindfulness, whole different experience takes place, even if there's that pain in
the knee, it's just a different relationship to experience.
