The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Tightness or tension in the body that perhaps can be softened and relaxed.
Maybe the face can relax, the head, the neck, the shoulders, maybe they can soften and relax.
Maybe the chest, the upper back, the arms and hands can relax.
Sometimes it can be useful to scan in this way and see if there's tension that with very little effort can be softened.
Maybe the muscles across the stomach and the abdomen can soften. Sometimes we hold that area kind of subconsciously.
Maybe taking a deeper breath and letting that area kind of settle forward a little bit.
Maybe the middle and lower back, the hips can soften and relax, the legs and the feet.
How are you in the body having relaxed a little bit?
And how is the mind? Maybe there can be a little bit of a softening of tension in the mind to a little relaxing of worries or concerns.
And setting things to the side for a little while.
Giving yourself this gift of some time to just be with yourself without being concerned about the past or the future.
But just how are you in this moment and this moment and this moment?
While we're sitting here together, there's nowhere else you have to be. Very little to do.
Just connecting here with your body, here with your mind.
Exploring the possibility of receiving how you are, receiving sensations of body, receiving hearing.
Our bodies and minds together are like this very sensitive receiver.
Like an antenna that just takes in the vibrations, the feelings.
Our system is designed to receive sensations of body and mind. And we have to do very little work.
We don't actually make the receiving happen. But we can be available to be here with what is received.
Giving yourself that opportunity to be with yourself.
Perhaps as you connect with whatever feels most natural or easeful to connect with,
maybe you're aware of sensations in the body or the sensations of breathing.
We are aware of our body sensations. We are here in the present moment.
A really useful place to ground the attention. Here.
We don't need to choose something to attend to in the present moment.
We can simply settle back and receive whatever wants to show up.
Whatever is most obvious, whatever is easiest to know in this moment.
And that may change.
For a little while, it might be a particular sensation or sensations in the body.
And then it might be a breath, sensations of breathing.
It might be hearing for a little while.
And it also might be thoughts or moods, emotions that kind of bubble up.
Asking for attention, asking to be seen, asking to be held, to be witnessed in this here and now.
In a way, what we're doing here with this receiving of our experiences, really getting to know ourselves intimately.
The kind of intimacy of meeting ourselves.
This intimacy or connection with ourselves actually allows us to learn something about ourselves.
To learn something about what motivates us. To learn something about how we get caught or stuck,
liking things or not liking things, wanting to push things away.
And also learn what helps to support the mind.
Relaxing into the present moment. What supports the mind to let go of reactivity.
We don't have to figure all of this out. We can settle back and simply with this intention to get to know ourselves.
What is this human experience? Get to know the body and mind, how they affect each other.
So this simple being here with yourself. That's enough.
Just receiving. That's obvious.
For some of you it may be simpler, more easeful. To let the attention land perhaps with the sensations of breathing.
Sometimes that can support our ability to be here with ourselves in the present moment.
And yet helpful if you choose to let the attention land with a particular experience such as the sensations of breathing.
To not hold tightly to them, to those sensations. Because at times something else may arrive.
And that's fine. We don't have to try to push anything away when we are being with ourselves in the here and now.
Opening to be with whatever wants to show up.
