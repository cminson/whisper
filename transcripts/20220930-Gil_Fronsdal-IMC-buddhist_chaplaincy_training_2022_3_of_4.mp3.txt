 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Welcome, and usually the parking lot is available, the Pentecostal that didn't work this time. Hi, I'm also going to listen. So welcome, and so you probably know this, but it's being recorded, so you can catch up with the morning by listening, and yeah, maybe say names and go around just so that... So that... Yeah. Sage. Sage, and also she her. Conrad? Is it mandatory? Okay. He? AJ, she? Elisa, they them? Kay, she her? Latisha, she? Hi, AJ. I'm Sharon, she her. Asia, she her? Casey, she her? Clarence, he him? Sri, he him? Kristen, she her? Barbara, she her? Alan, he? Alan, he him? Jennifer, she her? Gil, he him? Paul, he him? So I'm going to start with... Did Jennifer say it was going to be boring now, after lunch? Yeah, so I'm going to start it off, and so I'm going to follow the list of the components of the program, and so hopefully you'll... Some of it you know, it's been presented elsewhere, but hopefully the repetition is useful here. And so the dates here are on Friday, once a month, except for February, where we meet for Friday and Saturday at the IMC's retreat center in Santa Cruz, and there'll be more information. It's overnight, stay there Friday night, and so there's more information about that as we get closer, but if you want to ask questions about it, you could ask me. I'm the one who knows that circumstance. And otherwise it's here. And in terms of parking here, I think that we have a request that if possible, don't park on Birch Street, because that's how we create the nicest relationship with our neighbors. And it's kind of okay for this number of people, which is sometimes we used to have 100 people come here at a time, but just in general I think just keep it... And there's lots of parking nearby, up and down Hopkins and other places, and so you can if you need to. And certainly if parking lots, the handicapped accessible parking should be available if you need it, and if there's other reasons why you need to be closer for sure, I mean you can park right in front then if there's a need, but the request is. And then as I said this morning, all of us should be thinking about caring for the building. The Sati Center is a guest here for IMC, so we want to be able to turn the building back at least as well as it was when we came. And all the ideas to audio record, all the sessions here, so if you miss a session or if you find it useful to re-listen to, which some people find it very helpful to go back and listen and hear what they didn't hear the first time. It's interesting to see the different things we pick up on. And how you'll, the most likely place way that you'll have access to them, eventually they'll make it onto the course website, and there'll be a link. They'll be stored on Audio Dharma, and it might also provide you with a code so you can go directly into the series for this program. And so that'll happen in due time. So, Jennifer. So that's why, but in some of the materials you'll see volunteer work so I know you're thinking about where or how you're going to do that, or a lot of you are. And so we have some leads for you. It's a bit of an adventure to figure it out, and you'll learn a lot just by thinking about different things and talking to different people. There's no paperwork required. It's on the honor system that you do 100 hours. The purpose is that you can apply what you're learning and what we're teaching to real life situations. It's one thing to have a Dharma discussion about the parmi of patience. It's quite another thing to be with somebody who's really obnoxious and you're on the other side of patience. Or like, I thought I could be okay with this kind of situation and I'm so distracted by my own memories, you know, and then you process that, you know. Maybe you go back the next time and not as much. But so just it's really where the rubber hits the road is the purpose. For people who are thinking about doing professional chaplaincy, we highly recommend that people do a volunteer position in a hospital where they can meet with a lot of people in a context that's accustomed to having spiritual care provided to people in crisis. On the other end of that, there's people who've been like, I'm taking sandwiches down under the bridge where some homeless people are living. I'm going every Saturday afternoon and I'm going to see what happens. I'm going to go to a protest march and write chaplain on my back and see what happens. I'm going to, within my sangha, start, you know, letting people know that I'm in this training and I want to support them in their practice and I'm going to set up Zoom office hours and see what happens. And you don't even have to be called a chaplain. You might be doing work where you just realize there's opportunities to have conversations that are kind of open, but maybe you don't go towards them quite as much because it feels like that's another role or I don't know how, you know, like, I'm a physician. How do I listen and actually ask people about where they find strength and meaning? And what if they answer that question and then what do I say next? You know, so this will hopefully help you, again, have meaningful conversations and companion people. And they're destined to be a direct correlation to the more service work people do, the more they learn. It's a mysterious golden rule ratio, whatever golden mean, whatever you want to call it, so I'll leave it at that. We do have some leads that are posted and if you're struggling with this, you can talk about it in a mentor interview. And you can also, if you know of something, like maybe you find something and there's three positions, you just post something on Slack for other people. But this is a very alive conversation for the first couple months of the training. Yeah, exactly. Tag your info, activities between class. Oh, sure, go ahead. Sorry. No, you can't because we're moving on to another topic. Oh, I'm about to knock off your hearing devices there. Sorry, sorry. Thank you. I'll leave it off because she's. It sounds like you're not required to have a mentor at your volunteer job. Correct. Okay, and if you... I guess, I don't want to make this sound like I want to be a professional chaplain, but if you wanted to be a professional chaplain, then should you volunteer at a place where you actually worked with a professional chaplain? It's likely in a healthcare setting there will be a chaplain in place for you to become a volunteer chaplain. Whether that person will actually mentor you or not is really unpredictable. I've seen people who had a mentor in that kind of setting and thrived on it. Other people had no mentor and thrived on that. So it's a little bit your own temperament. You just have to kind of figure it out. A way to insert yourself or whatever into these situations or people's lives. Yes. Okay, no, I just wanted to get that. And then there's a track record of Kaiser Hospital often has volunteer chaplains. So most Kaiser hospitals, it's a good door to knock on. Although who knows post-pandemic? Some places we had people placed here and then they stayed on for a few years. But then the pandemic kind of the first thing a lot of healthcare institutions did was shut down volunteers because they had to have more control over who was coming and going. You're up in Napa? Because you know Bill Hart is still working up there? I don't know. That's a good question. Well, I'll find out. We had a long term in the first 20 years ago, the first group here, that really closely touched with us for a few years. And he was working as a chaplain up there. And I'll email him and see if he knows for opportunities. And I think your question also was about getting a resume for CPE? No. I mean, just so okay. So, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now the never ending list of activities between classes. I hope you have nothing else on your schedule for the next year. Okay. So readings, each month, there will be a recommended book. And as best you can read them all. Now there's one on ethics. And that's a big book and it's a very dry book. So maybe we'll highlight the significant chapters that we'd be best to read. And of course, if you want to read the whole book, please do. There'll also be different articles that will be posted on the website. Usually they're about a specific issue of chaplaincy or a specific kind of chaplaincy. And they're very informative. And they're easy reads. And then for writing assignments. Can you mention the book, Mibery? Ah, thank you. The previous alumni of this course have offered us their books. And now the books are in the library, which you know where that is? It's on the other side of that wall. If you go out that door and through there, you'll see the library. And so you can borrow the books, keep them for the course, or just read them. And then that probably would be best if you just read the book and then returned it to the library. Yeah, there's two kinds of books. There's actually the ones in the library, which you have to check out. But you can check it out for... I think they have most of the books in the course. And then there's the ones that former students have given us to pass on to you. And they're now out on the counter out there. And so you can just help yourself to the ones that are there. There's all in a row. And then it's possible we can... We haven't requested last year's people if they want to send in to their books that they don't want anymore. So there might be more next month. Okay. Writing assignments. There'll be a monthly writing assignment. Each month you will receive a short Dharma story. And then you write a reflection on that. And that will be one page. And here's something someone told me last year. They said, soon after the class, they would read it and then they would either write themselves notes or they would write the response. And then they would set it aside for a week or two and then read their own comments. Read the story again. Read their own comments again. So the emphasis on reflection. It's not so much, you know, what does the story say and what does it mean. It's more how does this stimulate your own process around being a chaplain? What's the emphasis of this story? And then how do I personally experience that and relate to it? And those writing assignments, we encourage you to share your writing assignment with your body or your small group. And it's fascinating, you know, as someone who reads these stories, I'm often amazed at how many ways you can attend to them, you know, the different emphasis or different approach. So it's really enriching to share your story and to read other people's response to the reflection papers. Do we specify a volunteer hours? Well, you know what, I crossed the knot. I covered that already. Okay. But let's not skip past the assigned reader business that was part of the writing assignment. Oh, yeah. Yes, thank you. So you'll be assigned a reader and then we'll tell you who you're assigned reader is. Actually, there'll be a chart that will be posted and then you can look there who you're supposed to send your paper to. And then Gil and I like to have it in a word program so we can write comments and then return it. What's your preference, Jennifer? I host office hours where you can come and we'll talk about it. It could just be 15 minutes, but I just prefer to talk about it rather than just write something in that old-fashioned kind of scholastic way. Could you still read the document for me first? It should kind of be a slap, yeah. No, not. So when you say word, it could also be like a Google sheet. You have access to the link and you can make comments about it. That would work for me. Would that work for you, Gil? I imagine it could work. I imagine I could maybe make it work. There was a tentative yes, sir. Very tentative yes. I think what I'd prefer is to get it in Slack. I don't know exactly how Slack works, but if it's embedded with a Word document there, you post it there, that would be the easiest for me. It's easier for me to keep track of it. And I suppose if you did the Google sheets, you would send a link there. So I can just click on there and get to the link. And there's something about my process. The reason I was tentative is that I'm so accustomed to using Word that I'll actually download it and have it in a Word document and a computer separate from the computer. And that allows me to be more reflective and more engaged in the reading and the responding. So I might even cut and paste it out of Google sheets and put it in a Word document so I can do my process. That was the reason for the tentative list. Field trips. We will have a scheduled field trip during our two-day retreat in February. But we really encourage you to do personal field trips either by yourself or with other members of the group. They can be pretty basic. If you've never been to a synagogue, maybe you would like to go to a synagogue or you've never been to a mosque, you could do that. And often these things are very eye-opening. Okay. Want to add anything to that? Yeah. In the years past, we've had a field trip to St. Quentin. Once to Soledad Prison. And with the pandemic, we can't get in anymore. So I don't know if it'll change this year, but if I can, maybe in the springtime, I'll set up a field trip for those of you who can to go to St. Quentin. There's a very powerful program there that we've been going to for years. Some of the students in our class here say it's the most impactful part of the whole program is that chance to go to St. Quentin for the day, meet with the inmates. Most of them are lifers, people who are murderers. So it's pretty impressive to be sitting with them. But they're going through a year-long kind of chaplaincy program that then to see their transformation, see what their process is, how deep they go, and it's a life-changing thing to be with them. And so it's such a privilege to be able to be part of their process. And so if I'm hoping we can do it, but I'll let you know when we get closer. Yeah. And usually, pre-COVID, I would take a field trip down to St. Anthony's Diner, which is in the Tenderloin in San Francisco. And that's a multifaceted charity now. And that's also a very powerful thing. But again, that was cancelled during COVID. And we'll just explore these and we'll let you know at a later date. You want to pass? You have another topic? Sure. Go ahead. Mr. Chairman, you can use the other one. So every two months, you'll have a chance to have an hour-long meeting with one of the three of us to talk about chaplaincy training, talk about the volunteer work you're doing, talk about your own spiritual inner life that's related to what we're doing here. So it's up to you what you bring to us. And if you don't bring us something specific, then we'll take some initiative to ask you questions. So there will be a schedule that will be posted on the website where you see your schedule. You kind of have to take responsibility for contacting us for setting it up for the time that you're specified. And I think how it works is half of you are one month and the other half is next month, so it kind of rotates that way. And then in addition, I think maybe you know this, that Vanessa Abel, who's a wonderful chaplain, she's also available as a resource. So you could set up your own mentor interview with her if you'd like. And just get more support if you need it. And then we have buddy contact. So you'll be assigned as a list. Is it made yet? The buddy? Yeah. I think we do that more organically. Oh, so okay. So the idea is that each of you would all find a buddy, a partner here from the program, and maybe that can begin being done during a break today that you ask someone here. And then if it's not set up somehow between now and the next class, then let us know. And then the next class we can maybe figure out how to make it work. But this is the idea of peer support is a really important part of chaplaincy. And as someone becomes like a professional chaplain, they continue with peer support or other chaplains who they shake in with regularly and can be honest with and talk about what's going on, what's going on in the process, their learning, their exploration, all kinds of things. So this begins here with you all. So someone who would make a phone call once a month or a Zoom call or meet in person if you live close enough and just chat about how it's going. And then if there's some challenge that you have in class, some challenge you have with the volunteering, then you have a buddy you can call up and say, I'll be with you about it and have some chance to talk. So hopefully that will, it's a little bit awkward, I think, to tell you you don't know each other very well today and just to go walk up to somebody, you don't even say it means that hello to them, I realize it might be awkward. But somehow or other, between now and the next month, we hope that everyone will have a buddy. It will help next month, like I said, if indeed. And then you'll also be assigned to small groups. And the idea of the small groups is also part of this peer consultation and peer process of learning. And there, ideally, you would meet, the small group would meet once a month for an hour or two. And again, also be engaged in a process. Both the buddy and the small group could be a place you send your writings. So you maybe have some discussions and engagement around your writings with them. You might talk about some of the readings for the course. We don't focus too much here on the readings, so that's a good place to kind of augment the engagement for the reading and the small group meeting. And we think of the small group as also a very important component of the program. And so hopefully you'll kind of stretch to make it work, to take some stretching because it's one more thing, people have busy lives, and then to schedule a group of people. I mean, that's like advanced Buddhist practice. And so you have to kind of figure out, hopefully get schedules for that. So that's that section. Any questions about any of what Paul and I have said? Is the small group something you need to create? Sorry? Is the small group something you need to do? No, no, that you'll be assigned. And we tend to do it geographically. So there's some hope that you can be close enough together. And the in-person if you can. Yes, if you can. Yes? Is there preference, what if the buddy was not in this small group for diversity? Or is that like a mathematical impossibility? It's possible. There's some logic, and that's a better idea, more range of discussion. But also, I think there's also value in who you're meeting with too. So I wouldn't make it too important to separate those two out, but I like the idea. Yes? Would it be appropriate to say geographically? No, I can't. I may not turn up my hearing aid. Thank you. I kind of answered my own question. I was just wondering if you did this already, if it would be appropriate to raise hands like North Bay, East Bay, South Bay. North Bay, just quickly. Would that be appropriate? Appropriate to raise your hand. To just say like North Bay, who's in the North Bay? Oh, no, now. I think we have the record of who's who in places in terms of creating the groups more or less geographical. Yeah. And so for that purpose, I think that, you know, for making the groups, we have that information. But if you just want a general sense of that here now, we could do it quickly. Is that okay? North Bay? Sure, that'd be great. How many people are kind of from the North Bay? Great. East Bay, South Bay. No, Peninsula. Peninsula. I don't know what it's called. Thanks. I wouldn't say West Bay. And elsewhere? Elsewhere, yeah. Is there elsewhere? Santa Cruz can be part of the peninsula, if you don't mind. Thanks. Next category is tuition. Thank you for sending your tuition deposits in. The next payment is in January. If you would like a monthly payment plan, you need to work it up directly with Gil. Gil is the cashier. I'll go on to the next one. Academic credit. A couple of you are already enrolled or considering enrolling in the Buddhist, for lack of a better word, seminary in the East Bay. Gil is the preceptor for that, and that's a whole other stream of activity. So if you're doing that or considering that, you'll be in contact with Gil. You don't have to do anything or start anything today per se, but just to let you know that he's the preceptor and the cashier. It's the same hat, actually, I think. And then I'll pass to Paul. The next thing is diversity, inclusion, and effect or equality. As I mentioned this morning, it is our intention to uphold these standards, but please don't think you're experts in doing this. We will introduce over the period of the year. We will have some exercises on this, and certainly if any of you have expertise or support you do in your organization, please contact us. We will be happy and hearing what you experience and what you might suggest. We also have a series of groups of agreements that will lead next time. And then also before we have any open discussion, we will meet the group agreement. I took it during the forum on our minds as we have the discussion. Can you give an example of what some of those are? There's one thing, I don't remember the exact one, but it says either come forward or step back. If your tendency is to speak a lot, explore. If your tendency is to never speak, well then tell yourself to come forward. Another one is try it on. If someone says something that you know a different opinion to, well then try on this opinion, this perspective, there's probably something in the earth with the one. And it also creates a kind of fluidity that helps us all to move towards a consensus of any holding or arranging the public opinion and perception. Go ahead. I just want to share, I've seen this before, but the state Medicaid center has a very good two-page government on multicultural arguments. I don't know that part of my mind is made in the stupidest part. I think it's very close to an online book. The list we use, I think it has 10 points, and I think it actually may not come from the East Bay Area. Any other comments about that? If for whatever reason you need to withdraw from the program, some people withdraw. Probably most years at least one person drops out for all kinds of reasons. So just let us know. And also we ask that you let the class know. So you can use Slack to contact everyone and explain what's happening, whatever kind of specificity you feel comfortable with. But let them know, let everyone know and say goodbye. That would be nice. The whole idea of chaplaincy also is to learn how to make good goodbyes. The whole issue of how to be part of transitions is an important part of chaplaincy, but also part of your own heart and the heart of the people you're connected with. So if we request that you let everyone know in a nice way. And then for attendance, we have two kinds of ways. When you finish, we give you a certificate. And there's two possible certificates to receive. One is a certificate of completion and the other is a certificate of participation. So completion is if you complete the whole program. Participation is that you've missed enough of it that it doesn't really make sense to give you completion. So you're allowed to miss one of these classes, these Friday workshops. If you miss more than one, then you should contact us because if you miss two, for example, maybe we can figure out some kind of makeup that is kind of equivalent enough. And if you don't do the writing is important. So if you don't do the writing, then that becomes a participation rather than a completion. So I don't know what other elements there are, but those are the main ones about participation or completion. We had a meeting with Vanessa yesterday and she asked that I make some announcements on her behalf. She will not be here in person to my knowledge this year. She moved away last month. Please sign up for slack if you haven't already. We do not use email in this program, so that's really important. Vanessa will be hosting an optional writing workshop in a few weeks and she'll announce this on slack. So we found people often need a little like workshop to talk more about the writing and even do a little practice like we did this morning before the lunch break. And Vanessa is a writer, has a love for all things, words and poetry. So she's a great instructor for this. Oh, and upload your photo on slack if you can, because she doesn't know what you look like. And then Vanessa's role, so she manages our technology. She is working on a special project in our curriculum development and she's also your chaplain and a neutral person. She's like a Switzerland, you know, because Gil Paul and I, as sheepishly as we can, do carry some authority. Whereas Vanessa's somebody you might go to and say, this is not going so well. And she might say, well, go talk to them, or she might say to us, I've heard this from four people and I think we need to do something different. So that's a little bit her role. And she took this course a few years ago and just wouldn't leave basically is what happened, which we're really happy about. So I think that was it from Vanessa. I miss anything. She'd really love it if you wrote to her and said hello and introduce yourself. Actually, that's not on my list, but, you know, too much. Hey, Vanessa, sorry you weren't there. I want to say hi. I'll be darkening your doorstep soon. Also for writing assignments, I'll be communicating on slack when I hold office hours where you can come to the Zoom room and talk to me. Okay, for the people that are assigned to me. And we have one Zoom room that we use for lots of things and that's posted somewhere. Okay. Is that the end of the announcements and logistics? You've seen it in writing. You discussed it with me in the interview. We've gone over it today. Do you have any questions? Or complaints? Ideas. I have a recommendation. Do not delay with the writing. About halfway through the year, if you start sliding by May and June, writing all those papers is really hard. People say, you know what, I'm going to take my certificate of non-completion participation and I'm going to write the rest of these this summer. And then I'm like, okay, then you'll get a certificate of completion. Never ever happened. So write a short crummy paper instead of writing no paper at all. Write a list of here's my 10 thoughts, but I just can't compose this into a cogent, pretty essay. But here's 10 thoughts, you know, get get something on paper. Get her done is my this is based on 19 years of data and observation. Related question. Okay, great. So when we're giving commenting on feet on the reflections from other students, we're not commenting on their writing like in the traditional sense, right? Like writing like coherency and all that. It's about the thought. It's the spirit of the writing, not the accuracy of the writing. Okay. Yeah. And you know, we'll tiptoe towards what kind of feedback is and you'll discover like you might even say to your person like, well, what kind of feedback would you like? You know, would you like to know how this impacted me? Would you like I have a follow up question or something that occurred to me that you didn't write about? You know, so it's really to practice discussing your writing with other people. That's the purpose with us. With us, the feedback will be teaching you like it's so easy to just talk about what happened. You know, like, I had this incredible experience, you know, like, let's say that you talked about your ice, your bicycle accident, sure, you and your ICU experience and just say, you know, and the chaplain just did a really great job about making me feel better. And in the writing assignment, you would spend this much writing that happened and then write this much about what it meant to you, how it impacted you, where it led you. And then another this much on the Dharma, like what was in the Dharma? Is this about compassion? Is this about the Sangha? Is this about ethics? You know, like, so so it's really easy to get into details. And so our feedback often in the beginning is nudging you towards the reflective kind of stuff rather than the explaining it. Does that make sense? Yeah. Or now that you mentioned that this makes me think of that, you know, it won't be like, no, it's not that Bhama Vihara. It's the other Bhama Vihara. You know, it's not like it's not that. It's not that to my knowledge. At least I don't do that. And then my thing, too, that I put on all the papers at the beginning is like, it's so easy to say we have trouble being vulnerable in groups in general, in our society. And I do, too. It's very different to just write down, I have trouble being vulnerable in groups. So you always want to keep it in the first person. This is like really personal, you know, and down the road, like professional chaplains write 20 pages and send them to six strangers and then have like an oral discussion about their work in order to get a credential. I mean, it's like even if you're applying for a service position somewhere, somebody might say, well, send me a little letter about yourself and what you're looking for. So this is all part of some of the skill set, if you will, as a spiritual caregiver or chaplain. Does that make sense? Is that helpful? Yeah. Yeah. If your paper is late, let us know. You know, if you don't hear back from us, make sure we got it. If you're really worried about us getting it, then just hand it to us in class and send it electronically. If you're asking your buddy what kind of feedback they got from Gil and then you look at the feedback that I gave you, you're going to be disappointed if you start comparing because in case you haven't noticed. We are unique individual. We're each our own universe. So we bring all that who we are to what we read and process. You are welcome to give your paper to another person, though, but you have to ask first, like let's say I give you feedback and we're like, I really want to know what Paul would say about this. You can give him your paper in January, get his permission and then he'll get back to you by August of the following year. One of our challenges is keeping up with the papers like for us, you know, like a few years ago during the pandemic, we had too many students in ratio to the readers. So that got really hairy, like eight or nine people doing, you know, six to 10 papers within the course of 10 months. How do you track that? Let alone remember, I keep it like a little, you know, checklist and stuff like that. But so just bear with us of things kind of it doesn't hurt to check. But, you know, also like if Paul goes on retreat for three weeks in December or Gil does a three week retreat seems like every other month these days. Like, you know, I just don't like emails. So just bear with us. And then I would also say on the writing, our feedback is not that important, in my opinion, in my opinion. It's the writing and the giving it to somebody else. That's where the learning happens. You'll get back from us would be like, oh, well, the, you know, or like, okay, fine. But it's not like, oh, my gosh, you know, it's more like it's just this practice of exposing yourself of disclosure about seeing your own process in writing. That's the most valuable and it's teaching you that action reflection methodology of learning. You get that from the writing more so than you get from our feedback. That makes sense. That's my view. These guys are slightly different. They I think they enjoy giving the feedback a little bit more than I do. I like knowing your process. The most common thing that one of the most common things I do in reply to the writings is I asked you questions and it's common for people to immediately think, oh, I did it wrong. There's all these questions. I must have supposed to have done it that way. That's not usually I love the essays and go almost always. I appreciate them. And the questions are not meant to be corrective or anything's wrong. It's my job. I see is to encourage you to stretch it to stretch you further to get you reflect even more. So that's the spirit of the questions that I like if you get it from me. Given the nature of the essays that they're meant to be reflective, this might be a bit superfluous. But will you send us the format you wanted in like double space font size and all that? Like how you want to receive it. The essays. For me. Once someone sent one that was one word on every line going down straight down for Paul. And that was not the preferred way. There's the mantra in previous years is have you checked the website?
