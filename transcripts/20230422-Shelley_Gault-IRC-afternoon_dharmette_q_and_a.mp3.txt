So, now for a few more remarks about balance, meeting what comes with balance, and I hope
you're feeling it useful, finding it useful, feeling and finding it useful.
And look at the effect of balancing energy in your practice and in any daily activities
that you had to take care of today.
And I thought this afternoon, this afternoon in California anyway, I know it's quite a
lot later for some of you, I thought I would introduce a couple of their teachings that
point to the importance of developing balance in practice.
I hope I don't overwhelm you with different lists, but I just, I really want to emphasize
the balance aspect of all these lists.
You don't need to remember all the details unless you already know all the details about
them.
The first, the first I want to talk about is the five spiritual faculties, the Indria,
is there, non, in Pali, Indria, Indira, I, I, A, and some of you, I'm sure, probably
many of you are really familiar with this list.
Faith or confidence is the first.
Energy or effort, that's very mindfulness.
Right in the middle, concentration, or Samadhi.
And wisdom.
So they point to five qualities of mind that are really essential in our practice and that
are important to keep in balance.
Faith without wisdom, often they balance on the ends, the first and fifth balance and
the second and fourth balance and then the one in the middle is like the fulcrum, it's
mindfulness.
Faith without wisdom can lead to dilution or gullibility and wisdom without faith it can
be dry, kind of uncaring or just skeptical, really skeptical.
And energy without samadhi, energy without samadhi, it leads to restlessness in the mind.
And samadhi without the balance and energy can lead to what we call sinking mind.
Sometimes I was making this sort of sinking gesture with my hands to sleepiness, to dullness,
to vagueness.
And then as I said, right in the middle of this list is mindfulness and it's the fulcrum
and it's the one mental state that we often say you cannot have too much of it, it's not
possible to have too much mindfulness.
I've never experimented with that myself to see if it's true in my mind, but I trust
that that's the case.
It's inherently balancing mindfulness, mindfulness is a balanced state of mind, one that sees
clearly without falling into unwholesome desires or aversions that keeps us in that middle
way, not falling to one side or the other.
And the more mindfulness there is in our minds, the more clearly we're able to see
what we might need to cultivate in order to come back into balance.
So it's just, you know, it needs to be there, it's really necessary.
What did the Buddha say to Sona in that Sutta I read from the earlier in the morning?
We find a balance of the faculties and learn the pattern of the situation.
And then we tune our effort so that it matches what's needed, so that we're more able to
meet what comes, whatever that happens to be.
So the five faculties with mindfulness in the middle.
And then another teaching list where balance is important is in the seven factors of awakening,
the bojanga, seven mental states that when really strongly present and well balanced
in the mind can provide the conditions that make the mind ripe for deep insight and awakening.
And three of the seven are called aliving, energizing, uplifting factors.
The energizing factors are energy or effort, very the same as in the five faculties.
Dhamma vichaya, which is really being attentive, paying attention, wise attention to what's
actually true, what's going on in actuality.
And rapture or our joy, P.T., is the Pollywood P.I.T.I.
And so these three are the energizing factors.
And then on the other side of the full crume, you might say, are three calming factors.
Tranquility, Pasad is the Polly, tranquility or serenity sometimes is translated.
Concentration, samadhi, which is also in the five faculties list.
And equanimity, upeka, which is kind of the crown jewel of mental states.
And when our meditation practice is going really well and the mind is really absorbed,
teachers will often suggest looking to see whether these energizing and calming factors
are present, whether they're balanced and whether there's strong mindfulness, which
keeps them balanced and allows them to be seen in their clarity.
So mindfulness is the seventh of the seven factors of awakening.
It's listed at the very beginning because it's necessary.
But it also acts as that kind of balancing point.
It's what allows us to see what needs to change if it needs to change, perhaps nothing does.
So as with the spiritual faculties, if there's a lot more of the energetic than the tranquilizing
factors, restlessness can result.
And of course, the opposite is true also with tranquility is really strong.
We can lose focus.
We don't see this clearly.
We might enter a kind of a dreamy state that's really pleasant, but not so useful in terms
of being able to see clearly.
In this list of seven factors, it can be seen either in its aspect of balancing, as I just
kind of described very briefly, or as a progression, going from mindfulness through energy, to
the chaya investigation through PT, rapture or joy, through serenity and concentration,
and then to equanimity.
So equanimity is the culmination of this list, if you go through it as a progression.
In this last state, equanimity, that it is probably the most sublime form of balance
that we know of in Buddhism, and it's a beautiful balance of mind that is so peaceful that when
it's really fully developed, it's described as being very close to awakening to the relation.
So talking about equanimity is really talking about balance directly, pointing right to
it.
And there are two words for equanimity in the Buddhist texts representing two different
ways of being equanimous, of being really balanced.
And the one we often hear about the most, I think, is upekka, which points to a really
unshakeable evenness of mind, to sublime state.
And it's one of the Brahma-Viharas in one of the heaven and the boats, the heart qualities.
Etymologically, the word upekka is related to looking over something, having an overview.
So similes for that are used in the sutras that really point to this quality of having
an overview.
One of them is a person on a watchtower seeing what's far below, a watchtower on a castle
or something, seeing what's below and really having the view of it.
And another is out of a large bird, like an eagle, a soaring bird, a bird of prey, looking
down and seeing, having a view of the whole countryside.
So in these similes, there's an implication of some detachment, a little bit of detachment.
It's not cold, it's not indifferent, that's really not what it is.
But there is a sense of some distance, a kind of a wide view, not a close-up view with your
face right up against what you're seeing, it's a balanced view.
Seeing things as they are, seeing things as they are.
So that's one version of equanimity in brief.
And the other word for equanimity in Pali is tatra maja-tata, I love this word, tatra maja-tata.
And it's a compound word that means literally standing in the middle of all this, standing
in the middle of all this.
And often when we speak of these two ways of being equanimous, we think of upeka as
a state that arises in deep meditation practice or in Ramabihara practice, a boundless evenness
of mind and heart.
In daily life, I think this form of equanimity, this upeka form of equanimity is when it arises
in us in daily life and we're able to have it as we walk around and meet our responsibilities
and our challenges.
It's a sign that we're not taking ourselves too seriously, not really taking things personally,
not attached to particular outcomes in our life, even minded, having a broad view.
But I think of this tatra maja-tata standing in the middle of all this as the most common
way that we practice equanimity in our daily lives with all their ups and downs and surprises.
Both wonderful surprises like a granddaughter's birthday, which just occurred in my life just
a couple of weeks ago, or a new job that we're really excited about, or really distressing
times of surprises like illness, or some of the news that we read in the papers, or maybe
most of the news today recently that we read in the papers, or the death of someone we
love, death of a friend or family member, to something else that I experienced lately.
And this meaning standing in the middle of this, standing in the middle, once again it
points to the middle way, a point of balance, a point of steadiness, not being thrown to
either side by the worldly winds.
Sometimes our minds are so full of ideas and thoughts and emotions that it can seem like
there's a storm inside, and this tatra maja-tata, this equanimity in the form of steadiness
can really help us to stay in the middle of all of that.
So where upeka allows us to see with a balanced view, this tatra maja-tata allows us to stand
steadily, balanced in the middle of things, in our lives and in our practice.
The poem that I read this morning, which is, it's also, it's in the handouts on the retreat
page, if you'd like to save it, it's there, you can download it.
I think it points very much in the direction of this kind of equanimity, this tatra maja-tata
standing in the middle of all things, each line places us in the middle of what's going
on.
If there is cost I choose to pay, when calm I choose peace.
So being in a balanced relationship to what's present in our lives that begins with accepting
the current conditions are the current conditions.
It's like that accepting in rain, a wrath that I mentioned earlier, accepting that the
current conditions are the current conditions right now, it's like this, and only when we're
willing to be present to what's actually occurring in our lives can we be balanced in relationship
to it.
It doesn't mean we have to like it, we just accept that this is how it is right now.
I can see the time, it's actually time for us to quit, but I'm going to continue, I just
have a few more minutes to say, so please stick with me, I hope you will.
I've tried to offer some, you know, some, some kid bits that would be helpful to you
in your, in your daily practice and in your daily lives as well today and I, there was
a variety of teachings and I hope there wasn't too much variety, but all of them point to
cultivating a similar balance of energy, a balance of mental qualities or attitudes
in both the body and the mind, the balancing of effort like a sonar's lute, you know,
not too tight, not too loose, the four wise efforts, cultivating what's beneficial, letting
go of what's not and then why is the effort and it's kind of broader sense, gauging the
quality of our effort, either backing off or engaging more if we need to, in order to
make the effort balanced.
Balancing the energy, energizing and calming aspects of the five faculties or the awakening
factors when you can find that kind of balance in other lists as well, I'm sure.
And cultivating equanimity, you know, kind of really directly going for balance cultivating
equanimity, which is this equal mind is seeing, you know, Pekka and then the steady balance
in difficult times, talk to a logic talk to.
And each one of these teachings points to the, the importance of that, that quality
of balance, just finding, finding the sweet spot.
So you don't have to remember all the details of the Dharma teachings, of course, that I
referred to today.
The principle, I think, is enough to tune our attention to the situation and we adjust
our efforts so that it's in tune.
And if the mind strays too far into straining, over-efforting, restlessness, we use the tools
we've learned to make, to bring more ease, more relaxation.
And on the other hand, when the mind seems unfocused today, disengaged, we use tools
that bring more interest, more energy, more curiosity.
It's something we do from the very beginning of our practice to the very, very end.
And having the clarity of mind to see what's needed, it's based on mindfulness.
This is always necessary in our practice.
So I hope the day has been useful for you, both for your practice on the cushion and
off the cushion.
And it's, you know, it's been really a pleasure to be with you today.
It's, I'm sorry, I couldn't get to, you know, to speak with each one of you, it'd be nice
if we were in person, but he's online, sorry, my such a blessing.
And if you need, if you feel a need for a follow-up, you know, IMC offers both individual
and group practice discussions every week.
And I'm offering groups on Friday mornings currently, but Maria Stratman is another IMC
teacher, also offers groups, and there are quite a few others who offer individual meetings.
And the links to these, I think they're going to be on the retreat, but Rana's going to
make sure that you can see them on the retreat website.
They're also available, of course, on the IMC website.
And once again, I'd really like to thank Rana for all the effort that she put into making
this day happen.
Thank you so much.
Three jobs, and I think all of you, each of you individually, and all of you sincerely
for making up our song today for your practice and your attention and your dedication to
the Dharma, to becoming free of greed, hatred, and delusion.
And it will bear with me for one more minute.
I'd really like us to share the merit of this day, which is something we traditionally
do at the end of a period of practice.
So mainly share the goodness that's generated by our sincere investigation, our sincere
practice with everyone we come in contact with and may that spread to everyone they come
in contact with and outward in ever-widening circles so that all beings are touched by
the goodness that we generated today, including us.
May all beings everywhere known and unknown to us be saved and have peace in their lives.
May they have the strength to meet what comes.
May they have ease of mind and may all beings everywhere find the peace that comes from
liberation, may it be so.
