 The name Buddha, the word, is a title and it literally means someone who is awake, the awakened one. And that title then gives, can you hear, that title gives the name to what we call now the religion of Buddhism, the way or the teaching or the practice of the one who is awake, the practice of becoming awake. And I'm very fond of the word awake. Sometimes people will use the word enlightenment, the enlightened one. But that's a little confusing that word for many reasons. But the word awake to me is a lot simpler. And most of us have some experience of the delight of waking up, maybe even if it's after some wonderful nap. And there's a refreshment. If you wake up, you're really awake, you've been sleepy or dull or yawning or doing something and then you wake up and it feels really great, refreshing and bright. And we could understand the practice of Buddhism is a practice of waking up, of becoming awake. And you could put it off into the future as some kind of great awakening or you could see it as the attempt or the practice or the movement of being awake to what is happening right now, to waking up to what's happening now. What is this? Just being awake to it. And it has different connotations in saying being mindful or being focused on what's happening right now. Being mindful to some people can sound like work, to do something. But to be awake is more, there's a quality of effortlessness to it, even though you might have to do something to kind of ignite the wakefulness. Once you're awake, there's something effortless about it. And awake, the quality of being awake has some wonderful, awake has some wonderful qualities inherent in it. Maybe we don't often think about it. So maybe I'll just tell you something that I think are there and you can see in your experience whether you can't identify them in some experience you've had where you really felt it bright, awake, here, present. One is with being awake, there's often a feeling of really being clear and present. I'm here, reality is there, I can really see it, I'm here for it. There's a clarity of presence with our experience. Often the mind's not often wandering away in daydream, lost in obsessions when we're awake, but there's a kind of a clarity of presence with the experience. Sometimes that presence of wakefulness has qualities of precision where you can really see, the highlight can clearly see how things are. In a small way, when I was home this evening, I was washing the dishes and I had a little moment of wakefulness. And I was amazed how colorful our kitchen was. I'd never taken in how colorful. There's boxes of red and boxes of green and different colors and it all stood out kind of a highlight, the details of what was going on. So this kind of discerning or discriminating or clarifying aspect of seeing what's there. And then there can be a quality of energy. Sometimes the energy is almost invisible, but certainly the lack of energy is absent. The feeling of I'm so lethargic and tired and slugging through life, but there's a kind of energy, a brightness to the experience of being awake. And there's energy there. And then perhaps there's also the experience of some kind of joy in the experience of being awake. Maybe we don't think about it as joy, but a lightness, brightness, delight. Perhaps there's a feeling of balance or equanimity. When you really feel awake and bright, we're not so likely to be reactive to things that happen around us or to us. When we're lost or confused or tired or obsessed, it's a lot easier to be reactive to what goes on in our life. But in really being awake and present, there's a little space in our psyche, in our mind, we're not so quick to kind of just react to someone saying, I don't like people who have hair or people who don't have hair. Oh, okay. Well, that's interesting news that you go that way. But, you know, so it goes through. And so to be awake. So this is a task in Buddhism is to discover wakefulness, to be awake. And in teaching Buddhism, the so-called Buddhism, the Buddha didn't teach Buddhism. It was an ism. He didn't, he was saved that headache. The Buddha taught, didn't teach a teaching, like we would think of like, you know, tenets, like a belief in philosophy. What's the philosophy of Buddhism? He didn't have to read those all his books in college and philosophy of Buddhism. But what he said, he taught, there was special to what he had to teach was not what we call philosophy. But he taught certain practices and certain states of mind that a person can have that are conducive and supportive and expressive of awakening. And central to this teaching, and he said, there's a really core to what he's teaching was a list called the seven factors of awakening. Seven, I think of factors being like fractions, you know, if you divide up awakening in seven parts, you get these seven fractions of awakening, one seventh of awakening, each one, seven factors of awakening, seven aspects of awakening. And these are things that get awoken and get cultivated and recognized as people engage in the Buddhist path. And their qualities that some teachers will emphasize, we already know, its aspects of our psyche that we already have our being that we have, they're not something foreign, we have to import, but rather things that we have experienced in our lives, we know somehow the psyche knows. And so we can orient ourselves a little bit around something that's already familiar. Some people will talk about practices being a kind of homecoming, coming home to something that's already familiar, some place we feel at home and at rest. And so the factors of awakening are very similar to those qualities that I enumerated in relationship to being awake qualities always like to be awake. So the seven factors of awakening, the first one is mindfulness or real clear presence, kind of presence we can see what's going on right now. The second is in that what's called investigation or investigation of dharmas, some kind of sense of investigating or inquiring or discriminating or being discerning about what it is we're present for. Maybe a little curiosity. So it's one thing to be present for something. In other words, really look carefully and see what that is to be present for it. The third is effort or energy. The fourth is joy. The fifth factor of awakening is tranquility, calm, being relaxed. And the sixth factor of awakening is called samadhi, often translated into English as concentration, but it's a unification of our being, of our mind, a harmonizing of all the different aspects of who we are into kind of a oneness, into unity, into a kind of stability and steadiness. And then there's equanimity. And equanimity is considered the most sublime of these, the most kind of, and equanimity is a phenomenal balance of mind that is not a neutral balance of mind. It's not a dullness or a blankness, but it's really a kind of a peak state of the psyche, where it's so alert, so balanced, so awake, that it's not going to be for or against their experience. It's not going to be affected by our experience, but it's going to be very clear and present for whatever's going on. So the seven factors of awakening. Some teachers will emphasize that they're done progressively in the sense that we start with mindfulness. Mindfulness is what we do, the practice we do, we add to the situation. And then the other six follow in the wake of mindfulness, almost like a natural progression. You don't have to do anything really actively about the others, but if you do really diligent mindfulness, the others will follow. So the first then is mindfulness, which is what our main practice here. And perhaps we can use the word wakefulness rather than mindfulness to kind of change a little bit the habitual ways we have of thinking about it. Those who've done a lot of mindfulness practice. We'd practice being awake to what our experience is as it's happening. And the emphasis as it's happening. We could say the lived experience now, because often human beings don't live in the lived experience. Don't abide in thoughts, their ideas, their loss in the past, the future and obsessions and ideas and reactions. And so some people, they'd rather be anywhere but right here. Hopefully not right now. Hopefully not right now. But anywhere but right now, because it's uncomfortable, it's frightening, it's all kinds of things. Or we have such strong desires about something else that we want to get. So we want to try to get the grasses greener somewhere else. And so we can't rest here with this situation, this person we're talking to, because something else must be better. I'm afraid we're going to miss something or lose something. There's a phenomenal number of activities of the mind, which makes it difficult for human beings to actually be in the lived experience of the moment. Sometimes exceptional, or not so exceptional, but sometimes there are activities that kind of bring it on. I know some people will do dangerous sports, mountain climbing, for the way in which it really brings them into the present. There can't be anywhere else but right here. And it's really a peak experience to really be fully here and not have the mind be able to wave or one bit from the present moment, because you know if you do, it's a long way down. And so we do it a little bit safer when we do mindfulness practice. We don't have to climb mountains to learn how to be present. But in a sense, it's harder to do it when we practice this way, because the danger is not as high. And so we don't have that adrenaline going. But we're trying to learn to do it kind of in a more natural way, to understand the mind, to discover how the mind works, how to work with the mind in and of itself, and not use an external thing to help force the mind or bring the mind or inspire the mind into the present moment. So a lot of mindfulness practice is investigating, learning, discovering who we are, who are we in the lived present, what is our experience like, investigating, finding out. But that requires a certain level of mindfulness, of presence. And so we come back to the present moment. And what is this? And it said that mindfulness is actually very easy. What's hard is remembering to do it. Or what's hard is keeping it up, keeping it going. You can show up and be here for a moment, and then the mind goes off. So it's a training we do to learn how to be in the present moment, to be present, to come back. And it's also a training, learning what mindfulness is. And even though you might have heard a lot of different teachings about mindfulness, you think you might think you know what it is, I think that it's always a kind of refinement and rediscovery of what is actually mindfulness. What is it to be mindful? What are the qualities of mindfulness that we bring to bear in a situation? There's a wonderful simile that Buddha gave for mindfulness, describing the quality of mindfulness, of a goat herder who, during the growing season when the farms are all growing their crops, the goat herder has to watch really carefully over all the goats to make sure that they don't eat the crops. And it will maybe be kind of anxious, kind of on top of everything. But when the growing season is over and all the crops have been harvested, then the goat keeper can rest up against the back of a tree, is back against the back of a tree, and just be relaxed and just kind of stay alert and watch the goats in distance, make sure they don't run away too far or get stolen. But they can, he or she can just kind of be there kind of looking very relaxed without an anxiety because they know the goats are not going to get into trouble, they're not going to eat those plants. And so mindfulness is that latter kind of awareness. It's relaxed, it's at ease with how things are, it's not anxious about how things are, it's not leaning into the future, it's not concerned about the details of what's happening, but it's a very relaxed observation kind of from a distance. Everything's okay, watching, just being there with it. That's one aspect of mindfulness practice. It's a relaxed awareness. It's an unanxious awareness. It's an awareness of what's happening that has no agendas about what's happening. It's not trying to change what's happening, but rather to see what's happening, to be present for what's happening, to be what's happening, we could say. It's not to change what's happening, but to deepen what's happening. Not to change what's happening, but to deepen our experience with what's happening. So if we're trying to get rid of something or to change it, we're missing the opportunity to have a depth of experience with what's happening. It's kind of like someone who has a postcard of the coastal mountains here. And so they're always looking at that postcard. It's a beautiful postcard. You know, it's great. And they show their friends, look at this beautiful postcard. And then at some point they realize, well actually they can just put the postcard away and look up, you know, in the hills there. And it's beautiful there too. And actually it's a different kind of beauty. It's three-dimensional. And they realize they've been living in a two-dimensional world looking at the postcard. So many of us live in a two-dimensional world with our life. We have opinions and views and concepts and ideas about what we're experiencing. We interpret what we experience. And to a great extent, human beings live in the world of the concepts and interpretations of events and not in a kind of immediacy, a three-dimensional immediacy of what's actually being experienced. So part of what we're trying to do in mindfulness is to drop into a depth of experience with what's here. What does it mean to really have to drop deeply into this moment right now? And there's different dimensions of the present moment. There's the experience we're having, what we're seeing and hearing and tasting and feeling. And there's also that aspect of the psyche that is being aware, that's taking that in. What's the quality of that? Is it present in a relaxed way? Is it anxious? Is it jumping on top of experience? How is it that we're with? How are we with the experience we're having? So to explore the nature of what it is to be present, to be mindful, and to be mindful to wake up to what this experience is right now. And to look for the depth in it. As we kind of open to the experience, whatever it might be, it might be the breath we're having as we do breath meditation, it might be the body when we do body meditation, it might be the experience of having a conversation with someone. Really being present for that and see what's the depth of the experience here right now? In me, in the room, in the person listening, it requires a certain kind of presence to take in much more of what's going on than the concepts and ideas of what's going on in the conversation. So then there comes the next factor of awakening, which is investigation. Part of the going deep experience in depth of this moment is to investigate or be curious. Look into this experience, feel our way into the experience, sense it more deeply, discover what it is, look behind the concepts we have, the ideas we have of what it is, and what is it in its own right, in its directness itself. As the interest is there to investigate and find out what it actually is, if the interest is natural, the interest gets awakened because it's so interesting and we realize we don't know what reality is, perhaps, and we're kind of, what is it? We're curious. It tends to arouse energy. We want to do it. We want to engage in this sense of engagement, of curiosity, of energy. Oh yeah, this is really great. And you see that in almost any activity we're really interested in doing. If we have a hobby that we do and really interested in the hobby and we're engaged, you know, time can stop or seem to stop. We kind of lose ourselves in activity and the effort is there. The energy could be there and, you know, almost easily and naturally because we're really interested in that. So to have the interest factor aroused brings energy, brings effort, the natural kind of effort to the practice. Part of the function of effort, of energy, is to help us help the mindfulness become continuous so that it isn't just, you know, touching into a moment of mindfulness and then, you know, coming back five minutes later. But putting together moments of mindfulness, so it's continuous moment after moment. So the effort, the interest, the energy is there to keep it going in the present moment. What's this? What's this? In maintaining the mindfulness continuously, there's a variety of ways of doing that. One way, of course, is just to choose one object like the breath and just cultivate mindfulness on the breath. Like some people do that in meditation. Another way of doing it, kind of almost the opposite end of the spectrum, rather than choosing one thing to focus on, stay mindful of, is to do what's called choiceless awareness. To open awareness up and just be aware of whatever is being revealed in the present moment. Not choosing, not being what is there, giving up control of what is there, but then become very interested, very present for what arises. Now there's a sound, now there's a thought, now a feeling. Now a body pain stays for a while. And so just kind of open to the realm of experience in the way that it shows itself in the present moment. And this is a wonderful thing to do. It's very freeing because it's what's most common, very common for people, like everyone, probably most of you here, all of you here probably. The mind is reactive. It's quite quick to judge, to criticize, to want, to push away, to be afraid. It's very rare for the mind to leave the experience alone as it actually is. It wants to do something with it, what's in it for me, what does it say about me, my self-image, you know, all kinds of things go on. The mind's always kind of trying to figure out, manipulate and orient itself around what that experience is. When we start doing the continuous mindfulness, then what we try to do is be mindful of each thing that arises and to hold it with some spaciousness, some awakefulness, letting it be as it is. So we say, for example, we're staying with the breath, be mindful of the breathing. And then a thought occurs, it, whatever that's supposed to be, is not happening fast enough in my meditation. I'm not getting concentrated quickly enough, I'm mindful enough, I'm not awake yet. And so the mindfulness catches it, oh look at that. And you're mindful of a moment of being reactive, of judging. You're judging. You're judging. And then a moment later, there is impatience, oh there's impatience. The next moment perhaps there's a thought, I've been meditating for a long time, I shouldn't be impatient. So one option you have isn't to criticize yourself for having that thought. But what we try to do with mindfulness as being continuous is to get out of the, get out of this flow of the reactivity, get out of the flow of the thoughts and ideas, interpretation of the experience, and see it, be present or notice it. So the Buddhists talk about that there's two streams that we can be in. One stream is a stream of our reactions, our thoughts, our thinking, our judgments, our self-identity, our self-image, our self-definition, a stream of attachment, a stream of clinging, a stream of resistance. And we put, and normally we're going along in life, carried along in that stream of attachment. The second stream or current in the same river, for the current that goes up river, is that of mindfulness, of awareness. That the presence that doesn't buy into or doesn't invest into or doesn't get hooked into what's going down river. So you're in the water, you're swimming along, and this wonderful boat floats down. It's one of those, you know, it's great. It's one of those floating casinos. You know, and all this seductive stuff that's happening in that casino, it just looks so great. And the next thing you know, you're on the casino, flowing down the river, because you've gotten attached. To flow upstream, you have to let go of that attachment. You see the casino going down the river. Say, oh, look at that. It's a casino. It looks bright colors. Look at that. Oh, here comes my attachment. It rises. I'm attached. I want that. But you see it. As long as you keep in the seeing, keep looking, feeling present, you're not going to go on the casino. You might have all kinds of reactions, but you keep seeing them. This is what's happening. So what's happening now, as opposed to getting hooked on the reactions, believing them. So you're allowed to be exactly as you are, have the reactions you have. What you're asked to do is a step out of that current and then to watch it and see it. And in doing that, you begin floating upstream rather than downstream. So part of the effort aspect of practice is the effort to be continuous and keep it up so that we don't get swept up by the stuff that is appearing in the present moment. This is why I like the, I think the, one of the, I think there should be two bumper stickers for Bipassana students. One should say, I stopped for everything, which means whatever arises, I'm going to be there for it and really be present and be awake to it. The other side of the bumper should say, I don't stop for anything. And this, that doesn't stop for anything means that I'm going to be present for everything, but I'm not going to get into anything. I'm not going to get on that stream going downstream. I'm going to keep the flow of mindfulness going upstream. I'm going to keep noticing now what's happening now, now what's happening now. So the effort is there. Then as the effort is there to investigate the presence at some point, then what can arise is something that's called a wrapped interest. The interest is not just simply, you know, the interest begins taking the quality of being wrapped, rapturous, of being delighted. It's kind of like a natural joy that arises when the psyche is fully engaged and interested in present for what's actually going on now. Maybe in the way that someone feels some level of joy when they're completely involved in a hobby or completely involved in reading a book or completely involved in a conversation or there's complete interest in involvement in some activity. So the same thing in meditation, complete involvement in presence and engagement, the interest can give birth a certain kind of joy. Another thing that can bring joy is when we start flowing upstream rather than downstream, it means that we're no longer taking on the burden of our attachments, our clinging. We no longer have obstacles. We're no longer allowing things to be obstacles. We're no longer being way down by all the kind of reactions of the mind and the heart. And it's delightful not to have to carry all these burdens. Some people carry armor, tons and tons of heavy armor. And you know, they're really safe, aren't you? It's really good. You know, I have this image of these big shiny knights and shining, knights and shining armor, right? Heavy, strong armor and they're ready to fight anybody. And then some kid comes along and just pushes them over and they can't get up because it's so heavy. So we're really safe, right? So some people carry armor and put their protective. They're not going to open the hearts to anybody. They're just closed and that's thank you. That's the way it should be. Or we're so afraid and that's a heavy weight. We're so filled with ambition and desire. There are all kinds of ways in which we're way down by our experience. But to have the mindful start becoming continuous means we're no longer succumbing to that. We're beginning to lighten. The metaphor simulates used in the ancient text is that of a bird taking off in flight. At first, he takes effort for the bird to flap and flap and flap. At some point it gets enough velocity going. It can just let its wings kind of out and the updrafts kind of carry it. Effortless is light. I imagine if I was a bird, I'd be happy at that point. It'd make me joy to kind of be soaring like that. So joy is a factor of the path. It's important to realize that because sometimes Buddhist teachings sounds pretty like Buddhism is a party pooper. No attachments, no clinging, no self. If you don't have a self, how do you go to the parties? So this is really bad religion. It can sound that way a little bit, but there's actually a lot of joy, happiness and delight. Some wonderful things that come with practice. Beautiful qualities of heart get born. The best in human heart has a chance to come out if we stop being in the way of it. Some of these qualities are the factors of awakening. Then as we feel some joy, this is said to be a condition for relaxing, for becoming calm, becoming tranquil. To no longer be in conflict with ourselves is calming, is tranquil. To no longer be in conflict with the world is relaxing, is calming. For a lot of people in our lives, probably the most important aspects of mindfulness is not enlightenment, but rather is relaxation, stress reduction. It's very, very effective, very helpful. It's a very important part of the path. I think a lot of people need to understand in order to meditate well, need to learn to relax. To have the soothing or softening of the body, the settling of the body, the opening of the body, that is part of tranquility and calmness. Calmness in the body sets in. A calmness of the mind, where the mind is not tense, the mind is not exhausted, the mind is at ease, peaceful, tranquil. When the mind starts being relaxed and calm, when the body is calm and relaxed, then it's a lot easier to get concentrated. Some people try to get concentrated when they're still tense. It just doesn't work. But to have the mind relaxed, to have the mind lightened, delighted, having some joy and happiness in it, and then to have the mind relaxed or calm, it's really helpful for what's called samadhi. Samadhi is when the calmness is there enough and the focus is there enough. That the psyche and the body begins to reorganize itself in such a way that it's no longer fragmented and all the different forces in our psyche and body going in different directions, the way it can often be in our lives. And things begin to align themselves together. The word for one pointed, what's translated as one-pointedness in Buddhism, ekagata, probably is better translated as alignment. Things are becoming aligned. Our being becomes harmonizing, unifying of the being. We get composed right here. And then with a mind, which is a mind-body, which is composed, stable, steadied, with the being which is not fragmented in all kinds of ways, then we begin discovering that capacity to be non-reactive. It's very hard to live in a mind which is non-reactive. So it's very important not to set that up as a standard to measure ourselves against, to beat ourselves up because we're being reactive to our experience. Just keep coming back to the mindfulness. Oh, there is reactivity. Wow. So we just keep noticing this is what's going on without judgment, without aversion, just noticing. But as it builds momentum, this practice, at some point you come to a place where the mind is very developed, very strong. The effort there, the strength is there, the presence is there, the harmonizing of the being is there, since a well-being is there. That the mind is so balanced that no matter what happens, the mind is going to be a quantumist, balanced. Some people might say it's like the mind is so big, so huge, so strong, so powerful, perhaps, that it doesn't really matter what happens. All kinds of things can happen. It's like being a huge, big rhinoceros and a fly lands on your buttocks. Well, I say that because there was a little six-year-old girl in yoga class earlier, she comes regularly and she counts every time Terry, how many times Terry uses the word buttocks in her class? She thinks that's really cool. Today was only five times. Anyway, so this fly lands on the rhinoceros with buttocks. And fly doesn't mind, right? So they have the mind kind of strong or powerful, or some people prefer the word empty. Sometimes the mind feels empty, translucent, transparent. The fly just goes right through. It doesn't land anywhere. In different qualities, in ways that equanimity is experienced. But the essential aspect is this thing and not reacting for or against. The mind doesn't lose its balance. And when the mind is no longer reactive, when the mind is balanced, when the heart is balanced, has at ease, can rest in that place, then something extraordinary has a chance to happen. Something that cannot happen when we're always moving, always reacting, always in charge, always trying to manipulate or do something, always trying to figure out who we are, trying to make ourselves to be somebody. We'd be at peace, at ease, and equanimous with how things are, to lose our self-consciousness to net equanimity. It allows for something to happen. And perhaps a little story, maybe, will give some indication of this. It's a story about a Zen monastery, Zen monk, who had been a very diligent practitioner for many, many years, I don't know, 25, 30 years, a very diligent practice. He was an exemplary monk. He had developed his mind to a great way. He had great concentration, great mindfulness, great compassion. He had looked and resolved and dealt so much of his conceit. He was kind of humble and simple. He had tremendous firmness and strength of effort and energy. He was engaged, strong intent, involved with his experience. He was an exemplary monk. He had reached a pinnacle of many things, many forms, many aspects of his Zen practice. But he had still not awakened. People were kind of amazed. He's been here for so long. He's not awakened. How could this be? He's perfected, seemingly perfected as a practitioner in so many ways. So the abbot said to him, come with me. And he took him up into this room and the monastery. And this room had nothing in it. No window. Nothing in it. No window, just walls. And a very solid gate as a door. Solid like a jail. Big solid bars, complicated hinges, and built to last. You can't break through it. And it had a huge lock on that gate. And it was a complicated lock. Many different kind of ways, things you have to do to kind of open it up. And the abbot put the monk in that room, closed that door, that gate, and said to the monk, you have three days to figure out how to get out of this room. And in three days, if you're not out of this room, we're kicking you out of the monastery. That's it for you. So he went to work to try to figure out how to get out of that, how to open that door. There was no other way out to that door. And he had tremendous concentration, great mindfulness and presence. He didn't react. You could see how his mind worked. He focused very intently. He investigated that door. He was completely involved. At times he was really joyful, figuring out the story, looking at it, looking in the hinges, looking, measuring the lock, putting little things inside the little lock hole, and a combination, trying to figure out exactly how it's built and how it's done, and trying different things. A lot of focus. Also, the fruit of his practice was really there. He had a tremendous equanimity. He knew the consequences were dire for him, but he could keep his equanimity. All those different factors of awakening were there for him. And he tried for one day. He tried for two days. He didn't sleep. He tried for three days. It was getting right near the end. And he was looking, and he was sitting, and he was kind of looking around this way, that way, kind of trying to understand the door, trying different things, trying to figure out, you know, how do you open the door? He was getting near the end, and he couldn't figure anything out. Nothing made any sense to him. And so he just stood there. He stood there, still. His equanimity was still very powerful there. His balance, he realized, he was just there. He allowed himself just to be there. All the effort was still there. The strength in him was still there for all those hours of days of practice and working. He was still humming from his engagement, but nothing was working. So he just stood there. He stopped all his efforts. He just stood there. And as he stood there up against the door, the gate, he kind of very gently, his body swayed and leaned up a little bit, and pushed against the door. And it opened. It had never been locked. But he needed to be completely still, not trying to do anything. He had since given up everything. He had to come complete stillness in order to let the door open. May the gate over your heart be as easy to open. It is that easy. Because the deepest gate, the most fundamental gate, is not something you can open. But the seven factors of awakening have to be mature for you to have the equanimity, so you can absolutely do nothing. The kind of nothing that only can occur when the psyche, the heart, is so well developed, the equanimity is so powerful that only then will your door open. And then you'll walk out the door. And as you say in the Zen world, you'll walk out that door, walk out your gate, walk out your gate with gift bestowing hands. May your practice of mindfulness be a gift to the world. Thank you very much.
