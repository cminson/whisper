The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So again, a really warm welcome.
Even if the AC is on and it's kind of chilly, I have a warm welcome.
So tonight I thought I would talk a little bit about mindfulness and recognizing that this is foundational
and maybe even it seems kind of, I don't know, like kindergarten teachings or something like this.
But this is something I appreciate so much about the Dharma and the teachings is that
we get to hear things again and again and then often we discover something new.
And it's not like there are these secret teachings that are wildly different, you know, as we progress on the path.
To be sure, there are things that start to unfold and become known as we continue on this path
that aren't obvious or available at the beginning.
But how we practice with them and be with them, this really builds on this foundation of mindfulness,
which of course makes sense so much about what the practice is about is being present for what's happening, noticing what's happening.
And in some fundamental way, that's just what mindfulness is.
So I'd like to talk about this a little bit.
Also because mindfulness is one of the seven factors of awakening.
It's the first factor, it's kind of like the foundation that supports all these other factors.
And the Buddha pointed to these factors as really being supportive,
if not required in some form for awakening, for enlightenment.
So sometimes, as I said, we tend to think, well, you know, maybe mindfulness, you know, that's just some nice to have,
something to make our life better.
And to be sure it is that.
But it's also pointed to as an integral part of this path towards greater freedom,
towards greater ease, greater peace.
I'll be talking a little bit more about the seven factors of awakening and some subsequent talks,
but right now I'm just going to introduce the idea of it and just start with the first one, the foundation, mindfulness.
It really is quite something to think about, you know, like what is mindfulness?
And we might say that it's a unique capacity of humans, as far as I know,
to a unique capacity that humans have to direct our attention intentionally.
Of course other beings, other creatures, you know, have attention.
But as far as I know, humans are the ones that we can choose.
Okay, I'm going to pay attention to this particular thing and not pay attention to that particular thing.
So this is something that we can really use to support our lives,
to support the way we show up in the world, the way we show up for ourselves.
And so for me, and in the context of this talk,
I will use kind of like the words attention and mindfulness and awareness as synonyms.
Sometimes teachers tease them apart and have some other ways they want to separate
the different ways that the mind is aware, consciousness, something like this.
Some teachers do, some teachers don't.
I've given talks a little bit where I tease them apart,
but for here I'm not going to really tease them apart.
I'm going to say it's just like noticing, paying attention,
being aware of, being conscious of, being mindful.
Kind of put those all together.
And this idea of, you know, paying attention to something.
And for anybody who has ever tried mindfulness practice,
you know that one of the very first insights you have is like,
oh, wow, I had no idea that my mind was going everywhere except where I wanted it to go.
I had no idea that this actually was going to be, not be so easy,
even though it might seem simple, straight forward to place our attention on an anchor,
for example, often we choose the breath.
There can be the body, sounds, emotions, thoughts.
These are often the typical things that we place our attention on that we're mindful of.
But we have this insight like, oh, I had no idea my mind was like this until we started practice.
I think this is true for everybody.
Just the way that humans, or certainly humans in the modern west,
I don't know about other cultures, other societies,
but right we have a certain busyness or a certain,
maybe I'll even use the word certain little bit of agitation keeps our minds busy.
So with mindfulness, we just bring our attention back to the anchor, the breath, for example,
again, and again, and again, and it absolutely does not matter how many times you have to do that.
100, 1,000, 100,000 times.
It's just this practice of bringing attention back to the anchor again.
And we do this in a way that's, okay, this is what practice is,
so as best we can, we do it without a judgment, without this idea,
like I wish it were different, dang it, why am I doing that?
I'm never going to get it, everybody else is so quiet and I'm not,
or these thoughts that sometimes can arise in our minds.
That's extra.
And us can be a habit to do this too for the inner critic to arise or to be comparing ourselves to others.
That's just part of what it means to be human also.
And so as best we can, we just bring our attention back in a simple, gentle way,
letting the judgment, the inner critic and all those things,
letting them just soften and go to the side.
If we don't have to get rid of them, just let it be there on the side.
So in this way, mindfulness is really about being present for our life.
I talked about the breath being the anchor, but we can just in our daily life
have this intention of being present for what's actually happening.
It might be that we have this insight early, like, wow, I had no idea my mind was like this.
And then we might also have an insight regarding our daily life, this recognition,
oh, in some kind of way, I was sleepwalking or disconnected or not really engaged with my life.
But mindfulness, the practice of mindfulness in our daily life and whatever it is that we're doing
with the opportunity, the encouragement, the setting or the intention to actually be with our life,
engaged with our life, not so much that our ideas or our conceptions,
but the actual experience and bringing this sense of aliveness to the moment.
Whatever it is that's happening, whether it's pleasant or unpleasant, what we wanted, what we didn't want,
but just to have this aliveness, like, yes, this is my life.
This can be beautiful, just being present for what it is, even if it is unpleasant.
And not only, so it might be beautiful, it might not be beautiful too.
But one thing I want to highlight here is that I'm talking about bringing attention to things that help to bring some aliveness.
Notice how I'm not saying that mindfulness is getting rid of thoughts.
It's easy to fall into this trap of thinking like, okay, as long as there's thoughts, I'm not meditating,
I'm not mindful, and this whole meditation thing doesn't work, or I can't do it, or whatever it might be.
Because we might have this idea, like, either conscious or unconscious,
and to be sure Dharma teachers sometimes talk about, you know, in between the thoughts
or the space around the thoughts, or I don't know, no thoughts, sometimes they talk about this.
And that is available, but usually that's only on retreat for some time.
This isn't so accessible, certainly, if you just have a daily meditation practice
as opposed to being on retreats for long periods of time.
Instead, mindfulness is just knowing what's happening in the mind.
When we're lost in thought, we are lost in thought.
Okay, it's not a problem because we're lost in thought, so there's no problem, it's whatever's happening.
But then there's a waking up that happens, like, oh, I was just lost in thought.
At that moment, you're mindful.
There's nothing else you could have done while you were lost in thought.
But when that ends and you're mindful again, you just know, oh, now I'm mindful.
And I just wasn't a moment before.
As an aside, I'll say, well, what makes it more likely that these moments of a waking up, so to speak,
happens while you're lost in thought is a moment of mindfulness preceding it.
So it's just the more mindfulness we do, the easier it gets, the shorter the duration we're lost in thought.
Probably all of us have this experience, whether it's a daily practice or being on retreat or daylongs or something like this.
And maybe we'll say, rather than this idea that we have to get rid of thoughts or something like that,
you might think about it as keeping something in mind.
If we're on the cushion, we're keeping our anchor, the breath, the body, whatever it might be, in mind.
In daily life, it's just returning to whatever's compelling, whatever is easy to be mindful of, whatever is drawing our attention.
We don't necessarily have to put it on anything specific.
But why would we do this?
This is a legitimate question, like, well, okay, sounds nice, maybe.
But what are the advantages or the benefits? Like, why would we do this?
And maybe you'll recognize some of these in your own life.
I know for me, this first one had a big impact on me, this that we can understand things when we are aware of them.
I mean, it seems so obvious to say, but we start to understand ourselves.
We start to understand our lives, which isn't always pleasant, right?
We don't necessarily see only, you know, rainbows and hearts and that kind of stuff.
But I remember at the beginning of my meditation practice, this whole idea of like,
okay, I guess I'll try this mindfulness when I'm not formally meditating, let's see.
And of course, I so rarely remember to be mindful when I wasn't sitting on the cushion.
But I don't know why there's some reason why this one incident really stood out to me.
I was standing in line and now I don't remember where it was.
It was the grocery store or something like this.
And I noticed, oh, look at that posture I'm standing.
I had my hip out, had my hand on my hip.
It was like really impatient and had this little bit self-righteousness going on.
But I didn't even notice it until I noticed my posture.
The way I had my hand on my hip, my hip jetted out like, you better get going or something like this.
And that was so astounding to me.
Like if I hadn't noticed what was happening in my body, I wouldn't have really noticed
that I had this attitude or this stance.
This happens so much, right, that our body can inform us
and just being aware of what's happening in our body can help us be aware of sometimes what's more subtle.
For me, something that still happens today is that when I have a little bit of a feeling
like, oh, I'm not sure if I've got to do it, I wring my hands.
It's sometimes my wringing my hands.
I'm like, oh, okay, I guess I'm a little bit nervous.
I don't know what the next thing to do is here.
So these are just some broad examples, but I'm sure probably all of you have some examples as well
of how just bringing mindful of things, of your posture, for example,
helps you to understand yourself better.
Emotions, maybe feeling just generally out of sorts.
If we have this idea of keeping it in mind, like, well, okay, I'm feeling out of sorts.
And if we just stay with, okay, out of sorts, we might notice that maybe there's a heaviness.
Sometimes, like, the shoulders are drooping or the posture, whatever we're doing,
but there isn't an alertness or uprightness.
Okay, being with that, we might notice that there's a little collapsing around the chest,
around the heart or something, and then we might be like, oh, actually, I'm a little sad.
Yeah, there are these sad thoughts.
I hadn't really noticed it before.
I am sad.
So one of the reasons why we have this mindfulness or keeping things in mind
is just to help us learn about ourselves, learn about what's happening.
So we can just better understand, not so that we can beat ourselves up,
not so that we can insist that we be different,
just so that we can understand ourselves.
Also, being present for our experience is actually grounding, right,
to be kind of with the simplicity of the experience, the actuality, the reality of what's happening,
helps us to feel a bit more rooted and grounded,
a little bit less like being pushed around and like we can't find our way or something like this,
instead to feel connected, to feel connected to our bodies, connected to the experience.
Maybe mindfulness helps us with our social connections, people that we love, that we care about,
people that we work with.
Being present also helps us feel connected to our environment and nature.
So it helps us to feel grounded and this groundedness can help us provide some stability in our life,
which can be a tremendous support.
So being mindful, also related to grounding and keeping things in mind,
it's also calming.
We have all noticed this and this might even be part of the reason why
some people start a meditation practice is this recognition that it does have this calming of the mind and the body,
often when we're formally meditating, we're not moving around that much.
But there is this way that we often don't even notice how busy,
literally and figuratively, like how entangled or caught up with or thoughts or this never-ending to-do list
or whatever it might be.
It might just be caught up in it and feeling like there's a certain type of this kind of feeling of a rat race or something.
But if we can be mindful of that experience and just again and again,
maybe if we're feeling really agitated, we can choose an anchor, the breath, the body.
Just again and again bringing the mind there,
it just allows some of the busyness, the agitation to soften.
Not because we're forcing it, it just kind of runs out of steam
as we're again and again bringing the mind to the present moment, to whatever's happening.
So this is one of the things that's worth developing in our life.
It's something that can be developed and is worthwhile developing,
this capacity to just return again and again and again in a way that's calming, settling.
In a way that helps us to disentangle from those things that maybe aren't supporting us.
Don't disentangle from those things that maybe aren't in our best interest.
Another reason to practice mindfulness or something like this is
every time that we bring the attention back to whatever it is we're paying attention to,
as best we can in a simple, gentle way,
we're not feeding that habit of just jumping on judgmentalism and running with it.
I'm not going to say that the judgmentalism is going to just stop immediately,
but if we're not feeding it, then we start to see,
there's another way to be with my experience to just accept that this is what's the reality of the moment.
I'm not saying that we have to accept everything and never do anything and be completely passive.
I'm talking about that we have to allow the reality of the moment to show itself, for us to align with that reality.
So often we're kind of, maybe it's a little bit like the sleepwalking,
kind of not really connected to what's really happening.
There's a way that we are, but sometimes we're a little bit disconnected too.
So this mindfulness, this non-judgmentalism gets supported, gets developed,
this idea of like, oh, okay, this is what's happening.
That's it. We don't have to add extra busyness around it or something like this.
So some of these things are just to help us have an easier, more fulfilling, happier life.
But of course, mindfulness is part of the Buddhist tradition too.
And in this tradition, the most common way that the Buddha talked about mindfulness
was in the context of the freedom from suffering,
the context of wanting to find more ease, more peace, more well-being.
And this was in the context of the Eightfold Path or the Satipatana Sutta, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.
For those of you who are familiar with that, there's a relationship between them, of course,
but maybe I'll just say this, that the Eightfold Path is really, is a roadmap towards awakening.
The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are also a roadmap to awakening.
But to point out that mindfulness is just one part of the Buddhist practice,
has many different elements, including all aspects of our lives.
But mindfulness really supports all elements, whatever it is that we're doing.
So this freedom from suffering is finding greater ease.
But mindfulness also addresses this, maybe this drive or this hunger for truth and for understanding.
But we might have this real wish to know what's real.
For me, I'll say that this kind of wanting to investigate or to understand
or to really be with what's really happening has been really important.
I didn't even realize how important it was to me in my life in general.
Forever pursuing knowledge or something like this.
But I think it's more about just wanting to connect with some reality, some truth as best as I could.
I think this is not unique to me.
All the philosophers talk about this through the millennia, this idea of truth.
And so we can talk about personal truths.
I talked about understanding ourselves, understanding our psychology,
understanding how conditions in our lives get played out later in our life.
Of course they do, how could they not.
But also about some of these universal truths about how things are.
They don't last forever, things are in flux, they're changing.
They are impermanent, inconstant.
But there's nothing as a lasting source of happiness.
We haven't found that yet, doesn't exist.
Something that's going to make you happy once and for all, forever.
And this recognition that there actually isn't a separate, enduring, constant self that's at the center of the universe.
Often feels like that, seems like that.
But when we go to look for it, we can't find it.
So mindfulness helps us with this addressing maybe this drive, this hunger for the truths
about ourselves, about our experiences, about the world.
And as we practice, continue to practice, and maybe this is true for some of you,
maybe the motivations, the benefits, or the reasons why you practice starts, shifts the more we practice.
Maybe in the beginning it was just to alleviate some difficulties or find some ease or something like this.
But as we start to practice more and more, we discover that maybe it's not only freedom from suffering just for ourselves,
but for others, for all beings, this recognition that we don't want anybody to suffer.
We want everybody to have some well-being.
So maybe it starts with just trying to solve one problem, but then there's this opening that happens, this unfolding,
this expansion of our care, of our concern.
And maybe there's also a recognition of some love that we feel like we've glimpsed
or that we've had a little taste of, there's this maybe a recognition that our hearts are capable of this greater, bigger love.
I'll use this word love.
Maybe mindfulness is a support for that.
Or maybe that's the motivation for continuing practice, continuing our mindfulness practice, our meditation practice.
And we could say that one of the actually signs of somebody who has some deep practice is kindness, is care, is love.
Sometimes we don't think about that when we think about mindfulness.
Instead, we might think about there needs to be some precision about exactly what we're being mindful of and something like this.
There's also this tremendous softening and opening.
I spoke earlier about how part of mindfulness is this allowing, this acceptance, this non-judgmentalism about our experience.
Of course, we do this often enough with meditation practice.
In mind, the heart just adopts this habit of being non-judgmental, of being with the present moment in a way that has this openness to it.
And that openness is a type of warmth, a type of caring, a type of open-heartedness.
And so as we become less entangled, there's a little more space.
As we become less getting all knotted up with whatever is happening.
There's a little bit more space around or during our experiences.
And in that space is some well-being and some happiness.
That's often what is found there.
And this well-being and happiness kind of like nourishes and supports us.
So then we don't have to defend ourselves or try to get more instead.
There's this warmth-heartedness, this love that's there.
When we kind of are putting down this trying to get happy or trying to defend ourselves or trying to prove ourselves or something like that.
We don't have to do that because now there's this happiness.
We got this happiness because there's more space.
We got this more space because we were just being present for what was happening as best we could in a non-judgmental, simple way.
So mindfulness also has this quality of warm-heartedness.
And as we practice it has this...
I'm using this word love.
Maybe that's not the word that resonates with everybody.
Maybe there's some other word that feels more comfortable.
But this openness, this warmth, as well as this just general receptivity to what's happening
and allowing ourselves to be touched by the beauty, sometimes the difficulties too.
But by the awe and appreciation kind of like a rise, just noticing the simple things of our lives.
And yes, I'm not going to say it's all Pollyanna, beautiful, but there is a way in which we also have the capacity to hold it, hold the difficulties.
So they're still painful maybe, but the problem-ness kind of like drains out of the pain.
It's not as much as something that has to be fixed right now and with a sense of urgency and the world's going to end if this pain doesn't go away.
I wish I could say it would take away all the pain, but it doesn't.
It just allows us to be with it in a way that's without insisting that it be otherwise.
So this movement of mindfulness practice turning to some appreciation, simplicity, some warm-heartedness.
Some of these things that maybe weren't our initial intentions of why we started mindfulness practice.
But just this natural unfolding of practice leads this direction.
And then these qualities themselves support the lessening of suffering, the increase of freedom.
So as we move towards this completely nonviolent way of being,
we start to see how so many things open up for us.
That create the conditions for even more opening, for more letting go.
Letting go and shedding everything that's extra and unnecessary and that's getting in our way so that we can do the biggest letting go that leads to complete awakening.
So mindfulness, even though it's this, we might think of it as this ordinary, simple foundational practice.
It really is so powerful, amazingly powerful.
So with that, I'm wishing all of you the mindfulness that supports your path towards greater and greater freedom and peace.
Thank you.
