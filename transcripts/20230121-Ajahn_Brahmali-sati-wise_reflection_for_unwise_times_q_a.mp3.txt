 or comments about the meditation, how to, what we're supposed to do, what you're not supposed to do, etc. Everyone is really content and happy. You want to say something? Yeah, please. The idea of being a passive observer. That was more like for the beginning, right? Later on you kind of have to do something when undesirable things come up in the mind. Right, yeah. So there's much more to it, of course. It's just the starting point of meditation practice, really, what we're talking about now. But the idea of being passive actually goes through the whole meditation experience. So the idea is to take that passivity and basically making it more and more profound. And the more passive you are, the more profound the meditation is going to be here. But you're right. So sometimes you have problems. Sometimes something happens in the mind, maybe you think about something or you are fantasizing about the future of the past, or you maybe get a bit of, maybe upset about something. All kinds of things can obviously occur because you're dealing with your ordinary mind and the ordinary mind is going to be reflected in the meditation itself. And then what you have to do is you have to learn to, it's not so much about doing a lot, but it's more about nudging the mind in the right direction. Yeah, it's a kind of gentle nudging. Because if you do too much in your meditation, if you try to think too much or counteract the problems with too much willpower, very often you just disturb the whole experience. So you want to kind of be very gentle with yourself. So if you start thinking and then you have to do something to counteract the thinking, very often you will find the thinking is about, obviously about stuff in your life. Yeah, it's about your job or your family or things that you have to do or lunch afterwards or whatever it is about. And so then you just have to remind yourself that all of that stuff can wait. Yeah, or it is not that important. Actually what I'm doing now is more important. So why am I thinking about the unimportant stuff when I'm doing the important things already? And so you kind of give yourself a gentle hint in the right way and then your mind kind of comes back to the present again. So this is really what it is about. So you want to do things very, very gently in this way. And the idea is then to gradually increase the passivity. The more passive the mind is, the less involved it is with anything in the world, the more peaceful it's going to be. A lot of the activity is actually a burden. When you're thinking you find out that all the activity of the mind is really burdensome and you start to feel a sense of relief when the activity of the mind fades away and you are doing less and you are experiencing you being a human being rather than a human doing. This is kind of the idea here. Does that make sense? Yeah? Yeah? Okay, good. Anyone else want to say anything? Yeah, a couple of people over here. Yeah, thank you. Building on the same point, should you analyze and judge your meditation during or should it be at the end and then bring in more energy next time or just like how does that work? Usually at the end there is a better place to analyze the meditation. If you analyze too much during the meditation you end up not having much of a meditation at all. It tends to destroy the meditation. That's why I say at the end review your meditation at the end. See what happened, what worked, what didn't work. And it is the case that the reason why you feel peaceful is because your mind is inclined in the right way. There is something you are doing right. That's why you feel peaceful. And you will find sometimes your meditation is a complete mess, otherwise it may be quite nice. And there is a reason why it is sometimes a mess, sometimes it is nice. And you will start to, if you start to look into that, you start to become very skilled at meditation because you understand how to set up your mind in the right way. So do most of the analysis at the end. The idea is that we also tend to come into the meditation with a number of skillful means. So you enter the meditation, you know from past experience that if you think about certain things, well this is the remedy, this is how I get out of it. And so you apply that remedy in a very gentle way. As I was saying to this gentleman over here, you kind of nudge the mind in the right way. And as you do that little bit of nudging, the mind starts to fall into place again. Or especially what is very disturbing, if you get a bit of ill will or something in the meditation, thinking about something negative, you know how to deal with that very quickly. Because once it becomes strong, it is very difficult to get rid of. You want to kind of nip it in the bud, as I say, and kind of get it sorted out as soon as possible. But these skillful means you often develop outside of meditation. You know how to incline the mind. You know the idea of metta, of compassion. You know how to reflect on other people in a way where you can forgive them quickly and easily. So these things are often kind of precursors, if you like, or prerequisites that you bring with you. Yeah? Okay. Good. Excellent. Please. Yeah? So grateful for you all coming all this way to be here with us. Thank you so much. Great. So when meditating, what is the best way to let go completely of the face? For instance, the eyes, if they don't fully close, a tendency to pull them shut. And also the mouth, if there's previous dental pain and there's a habit of pulling the lip down to previously deal with that pain. How can one calm these down to completely let go of the face? Right. Basically the idea is that sometimes if you try too hard to let go or whatever, it becomes the opposite of letting go, right? It becomes like more kind of holding on because the letting go process itself becomes the process of holding on. So very often the best thing to do is just to let it be. And okay, so yes, there is some tension in the face. But if you are able to kind of stay with the present and just be with things and maybe go to the breath or do a bit of metta or whatever, sometimes it tends to resolve itself as you go along. Sometimes you just can't go any deeper with the relaxation and then you just have to allow the meditation to kind of deal with the problem over time. So the most important thing is just to be able to kind of relax to the max and then allow these things to kind of unwind themselves as you go along and see what happens. Good. Online, all right. Yeah. The question was, what are some examples of nudging my mind in a more calm direction? Okay, so examples of nudging the mind. So let's say that you are thinking about things. And when you are thinking about things, it is usually about three things happen. You are thinking about the future, what are you going to do, how are we going to solve problems, whatever. Past, maybe some kind of negativity about the past, someone said something or did something, which of course happens all the time, right? Or it can be just fantasizing because the mind kind of goes off. The mind doesn't want to be here and now, so it goes off. The way to nudge the mind is just to remind yourself what is important in life, what really matters. And one of the ways of thinking about that is to think that, well, my future is actually created by how, not so much by how I solve the problems of the world, because the problems of the world are endless. You solve one problem, another problem kind of comes up behind it. There is no end to the problems of the world. And because of that, it is not so interesting to resolve things in that way. The real way to resolve the future, the real way to create a good future is actually what you do now in your meditation practice. How you react now to the people around you, that is where you create the future. And once you understand that you are creating the future in the meditation, not by thinking about the world, then there is nothing more to think about. It becomes kind of uninteresting. It is that future. There is no future in a sense in that area of thinking about things. So you come back to the present, you come back to just enjoying the here and now. This is one way of nudging the mind. Another way would then be to do, you know, have to do with, let's say that you have some kind of upset, something happened in your life. And then you just think very gently, you just forgive that person for whatever they did because you know that people don't know what they are doing in this life. People do things because they are stressed out, people do things because they are having a bad day, people do things because they are blind, they are walking in darkness in the world. People do things for all kinds of reasons. But it is not usually to annoy you. That is not why they do things. It is not personal. And when you remember that these things are not personal, then that moment you can just let it go and you come back to your meditation again. So these are ideas that you build up. And then when you come to the meditation, you don't have to think all of these things. All you have to do is kind of gently remind yourself of those things. They are like ideas. It is like you have a shelf of ideas, a perception in your mind. You pull down the kind of appropriate perception, then when a counteracts a particular problem, then the problem kind of dissolves. That is kind of the idea there. So very simple things. You are just having compassion for someone, etc. We have time for one more, sure. Okay. Charles Lee, would you like to ask your question? Yes. There we go. Thank you for letting me on mute, Adhan. It is so wonderful to interact with you rather than through YouTube, which has been great, though. And thank you to the person who asked the question about the face. I found that very interesting and it led me to also think about the other part of the body that tends to be very overrepresented in the mind, or the brain, which is my hands. What do I do with my hands during meditation? I find at times getting very fidgety and trying different shapes and different placements. Sometimes it can get, I just realize a lot of restlessness there. Thanks. Obviously the restlessness really comes from the mind, that is where it arises from. It expresses itself through your hands, which is kind of interesting. Again, I would say that do not worry too much. If you try too hard to hold your hands still or you try too hard to do anything, using that willpower very often is often a bit counterproductive, because we are trying to do the meditation rather than actually just doing it. So instead of worrying too much about your hands, just allow your hands to be there, allow them to do their own thing and come back to the mind instead. You get the root causes of the problem. The root cause of the problem is again some degree of restlessness, some degree of desire or craving or whatever it is that is driving this process. Of course that is settled down by just enjoying the peace, allowing things to be and not pushing things at all. Over time my prediction is that your hands will start to settle down because you are moving, because your mind is becoming peaceful, your body will kind of follow along as you do that. But do things very gently. I think one of the big problems in meditation practice is that we are told to do mindfulness breathing. So people sit down and they start watching the breath straight away and very often that is a bad idea. It is not how the Buddha taught mindfulness breathing. You have to sit down and watch the breath straight away, because you are often not ready to watch the breath. The mind is too restless. The other hands want to do things and all of these kinds of things. So really what we should always do is to give rise to mindfulness first of all. That is the most important thing. Mindfulness is the basis for all meditation practice. So give yourself time. Learn to allow the mind just to be aware, just to enjoy the feeling of sitting down peacefully, to being in good company or whatever it might be. And as you learn that, as you learn the skill, because it is almost like an anti skill, you just learn to be natural in a sense, then the mindfulness starts to come. I am pretty sure that the problems you have with your hands will just fade away by itself and it won't actually be an issue. It feels like an issue right now, but actually getting this right in this way, I think you will just find it dissolves and one day you wonder why it was an issue in the first place. Thank you. Okay, good luck Charles. So is it time to break for lunch? Is that right there? Yeah. There is the boss coming. Okay, good.
