The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So good morning. Welcome to our meditation and one of the
areas we're navigating when we meditate is our interests, both intentional
interests but also unintentional. And I think a big part of the terrain of
mindfulness meditation is navigating the mind's interests when they're different
than our own. So if you're distracted about something that happened long ago,
your mind is interested in long ago. If it's planning the future, your mind is
interested in playing the future. And if it's in the present, maybe there's
something that troubles you. And so the mind is, even if you want to, excuse me
for a moment, even if you want to be interested in your breathing or in the
meditation, your mind keeps going into your troubles. And part of meditation is
to start becoming disinterested in some things and to value the process of
disinterestation, becoming disinterested. And to appreciate this
is part of it. It's almost like a natural process. So for example, as we get more
centered, focused, comfortable, delighted with being meditating, then then
naturally the interest will go towards this good, the goodness of meditation
and we become less interested in other things. If the meditation is difficult,
then it's a little bit more difficult to become disinterested with things, have
more interest for meditation. As we become wiser in meditation, wiser in
practice, the wisdom guides our interest and the wisdom has some sense of the
significant, the value of becoming a disinterested in some things. And so this
natural process of becoming more and more disinterested in things which don't
serve us, don't help us, become stronger. And we become more, the wisdom teaches us,
oh, even though it's difficult meditation, even though there's challenges, it's
really wise, it's really good to be interested, to be present with these
experiences. So this whole idea of, it's a one way of understanding all this is
navigating interest. So for this meditation, I'd like to suggest that
another distinction, we can have troubles in our lives or troubles with
ourselves, within ourselves, and then we can be troubled by it. So I can be
troubled by a car, one of my troubles might be I have a car, for example, that
it's not the case, but a car that needs to be repaired. And that's just a
trouble that they're the issue, a topic that has to be addressed. I can be
troubled by it, I can feel stressed by it, I can feel afraid, I can feel
preoccupied, I could feel angry, all kinds of ways in which I feel troubled by
it. One of the things to become disinterested in is how we feel troubled.
We might be troubled by what goes on inside of ourselves, our thoughts, our
feelings, our emotions, our judgments by ourselves. But the thoughts are one
thing, being troubled by it is something else. And to sit and meditate and lose
interest in how we feel troubled. We still can be aware of it, mindful of it, but
don't, not to invest energy, belief, authority, importance in this feeling of
feeling troubled. Because if we invest in it, it gets stronger, it persists. And
learning to become less and less interested in the feeling of being
troubled, and more interested in our experience as it is, in the simplicity
of what it is, is one of the ways in which this meditation can deepen. So,
assuming a meditation posture, and gently close your eyes, and maybe you're
troubled by what I said. So there's a lot of thoughts and feelings, reactions. So
you're welcome to those. I certainly don't want to take those away from you.
You know, without you choosing to do so for yourself. But if you recognize that
whatever troubles you at this moment, the subjective experience of feeling
troubled, maybe you can switch your interests, switch your orientation. So
that feeling doesn't influence how you bring attention now to your body
breathing. So your interest now goes into how your body is experiencing
breathing at this moment. Every day we breathe slightly differently.
Being interested in how you can relax your body, your mind, softening.
Letting go of any thinking that takes you away from the present moment, takes you
away from mindfully breathing. And if there's any gentle, quiet thinking that
guides you to staying with your breathing, staying in the present, let those
thoughts encourage a greater quieting, settling. You don't have to let go of
those thoughts.

You don't have to let go of those thoughts.
You don't have to let go of those thoughts.
And as we come to the end of this sitting, to turn your interest outwards to the world
around you, to the people who are nearest to you and wherever you're meditating, maybe
someone else meditating with you or someone else in the house or neighbor, and outward
beyond to the county, the province in which you're in, colleagues, coworkers, out across
the lands, to be interested but in a particular way, to be interested in their welfare and
their well-being, to be interested in with kindness and respect.
And is there something about having meditated for half an hour, being maybe a little more
calm or settled, that allows your respect for others, your kindness to others, be more
embodied, emotionally fuller, not a casual impulse of the moment, but something that's
maybe embodied within, and this interest in kindness and care and welfare, perhaps in
your own mind, silently, you can repeat these words as a way of giving voice to what's
within, giving voice so it spreads out across the lands.
May all beings be happy.
May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful.
May all beings be free.
And may my care and kindness for others stay with me as I go through the day.
May my care and kindness for others stay with me as I go through the day.
