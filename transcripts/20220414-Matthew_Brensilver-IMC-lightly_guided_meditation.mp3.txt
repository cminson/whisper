 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So good morning, good afternoon, evening to some of you. Okay, you know the deal here. So find your posture. Thank you. So breathing in such a way that you, that helps you land here now. Thank you. A kind of subtle ripple of relaxation of the exhalation and conscious effort to release tension. Thank you. Find whatever tension might remain, willingness to tolerate that. Thank you. Thank you. You're not responsible for experience. You're not responsible to manage and mold yourself. You're not responsible for awareness, which does itself. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're not responsible for generating insight, engineering, somebody, concentration, to the extent we're responsible for anything, we're responsible just for the seed of sincerity and willingness. The willingness to offer our heart up to the Dharma. And then trusting, having faith in the logic of the path. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We drop beneath the layers of meaning experience of what's here. Maybe the breath or the body more broadly. Maybe the realm of feeling, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. Maybe sound and silence. Maybe the darkness behind your closed eyes. We just give our attention to something and let that simplify, distill out more and more of the meanings, the sense-making, until there's less and less to say about the moment, but more and more urgency to know it deeply. You you you you you you you you you you you you Our compulsion to extract something from the moment compromises our intimacy with it. And so there's a kind of receptivity, willingness to be softened by the moment. You you accumulate anything. It just keeps surrendering in awareness with faith in Dharma. You you you you you you you you you you you you you you
