Hello and greetings again, dear Sangha. So lovely to practice together. So lovely.
Not taken for granted. I have this image of us in different places and so I so
appreciate the the words in chat coming through and the different places you are
in the world. So appreciate feeling your presence, all of us together.
Powerful, powerful. Thank you. So today I would like to speak about this teaching,
this concept, this practice that's often misunderstood in the West. Not perhaps
so much by Buddhists, but maybe by us too at times. But this word has been
co-opted, this teaching has been co-opted by the popular culture and
misrepresented, misunderstood. So this teaching I like to talk about today is
the beautiful, profound teaching of karma. So in the West it's often thought of as
an inheritance and it's often bad. Like, oh, what have I done or what has this
person done in their past life that they deserve this or they must have done
something terrible or I must have done something terrible and basically using
the teaching of karma as as flagellation, as a way to flagellate, either
self-flagellate or flagellate others. So it's not a helpful and it's not
actually, it's not a useful way to use this practice, to interpret this
practice, to understand this practice. So I want to speak a little bit about that
and actually to the profundity of what karma means here and now for us. And it's
not this magical thing, this idea that we don't quite understand and it's
weird and it's in some other dimension. So not to think of karma as
destiny or as fate, as it is often thought of, but it's, again, it's really a
distortion to think of it as fate. It's a distortion of the Buddhist teachings.
It's definitely a distortion. And I love the words of Andrew Olenski,
Olenski, saying their name properly, Olenski, who says that karma is, has
unparalleled, unparalleled profundity and significance. I love that unparalleled
profundity, the concept of karma in the teaching. So let's do away with, let's do
away with this magical, this weird thing that we don't even know, you know, fate
destiny. Let's do away with that understanding altogether. But instead,
consider, first of all, the word karma simply means action. And it's derived from
the verbal root vaker, which means to do, to make in Pali. To do, to make. You
already get the sense, right? To do, to make is different from something you
inherit, something magical and weird, right? So to do, to make. And there are
three distinct senses of the word here. There are three distinct senses of this
word here. And yet these three distinct senses, which I will describe in a
moment, are inseparable, inseparable aspects of the same process of karma.
Okay, so here are the three aspects. So the first one is the decision to do
something. It's the intention, is the decision to do something. Okay, that's
the, that's the leading edge. The second aspect is the action that actually carries,
carries the thing out, is the action. And the third aspect is what we make, what we
make thereby as the result of that action. So there are these three distinct
aspects. So let me repeat that. So the first is the decision or the intention to
do something. The second is the action that actually carries it out. And the
third is the result of the action, what we make. And karma is actually all three
of those. They're inseparable. They're distinct, but inseparable. Not just the
intention, not just the action itself, and not just the result. It's all three of
them, which is so beautiful and profound, right here, right now. So the Buddhist
understanding is that these three parts are the same whole. So the intention
being the leading edge of karma, which leads, which directs the activities of the
mind, speech, and the body. All of those are considered actions. Notice that the
mind thoughts are considered actions in Buddhism, actions of the mind. Speech is
considered action of speaking, of course, and the body is considered action. So all
those three. So again, intention is the leading edge of karma, of karma, which
directs the activities, which then, which then, on the trailing edge, it accumulates
the karmic formations, or the karmic dispositions, karmic dispositions. It's
our disposition. If we just drop the word karmic, it's our dispositions. It's how
we show up. It's how we, ourselves, are made up of those dispositions, which also
is the intention, the actions, and the dispositions. So, so in other words,
action is preceded. Every action, the mind of action, of the mind, speech, and body,
is action is already preceded by some doing, right? By some doing. And that
doing is where the decisions are made, is the intention, is the doing of the, oh,
intending, the volition, the aligning, or not aligning. It's that there's some doing
before the action. And then there is a result in the making, in the making of
our unique personality, of our dispositions. So, so the main idea behind
karma is the relationship between what we choose to do, and what we make of
ourselves, what we choose to do, and what we make of ourselves. Let me just
pause here. Wow. To me, this teaching is so profound. It's not about fade, oh poor
me, whatever I got. It's actually a powerful, empowering teaching of what we
choose to do, and what we make, make of ourselves. So powerful, so powerful. I love
this teaching, and every time I'll just share with you, as I come to this, and
many teachings over the years, over time, there are more nuances, there's more
beauty. Maybe when I was younger, my early years of practice, there was some
level of understanding. And the more I come to these teachings, there is a
newer level of appreciation for the beauty, for the profundity of these
practices. So I invite you to see them with their fresh eyes, even if you're
practiced, experienced practitioner, don't hear the word karma and go, yeah, yeah,
I know, I've studied this. Appreciate it as if with fresh eyes, in your
practice, in your heart and mind, in this moment. So one last thing I want to say,
and there's more I want to say tomorrow. So there is this expression in Pali,
sankharam api sankharito, sankharam apha sankharito, which are many ways that can
be translated to English, and again, according to Andrew Olinsky, could be
translated as one forms formations, or one constructs, constructions, or one
creates creations, one fabricates fabrications. So an action both involves
the activity, as well as building something as the product of it. And an
image that is used in the suttas often is the image of a potter on a pottery
wheel. A potter is engaged in the creative process of shaping, forming the
clay, and making something to his will with his intention, with his desire, with
his actions. So intention, actions is forming the clay, forming the clay. And
then when the pot is done, it's put in a kiln, and it's fired, it's put in a fire,
and then it's an enduring, it's an everlasting artifact, this pot. So think
of ourselves, our characters, our personalities, our very self, quote-unquote
self. As this, again, Olinsky puts it beautifully, ossified karmic relics,
ossified, or rather as a gallery of ossified karmic relics, the accumulated
residue of earlier dynamic processes of intention and action. I'll close by
reading that one more time. What we take to be our very self is viewed in Buddhist
thought as a gallery of ossified karmic relics, the accumulated residue of
earlier dynamic processes of intention and action. There's so much more here to
say, but just to end and say, think of karma as an empowerment, as an empowering
teaching, that one, we can change, we can change. Anyway, we're out of time, so much
more to say, but we have time together tomorrow. Well, maybe, life is so
impermanent and unpredictable, but if all, maybe we'll see each other tomorrow.
Take good care, looking forward to practicing together. Be well.
you
