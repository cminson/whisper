 Okay. So, hello and welcome everyone to our practice space together. So, for the theme of today's practice, I'd like to pick up in a similar vein where we're practicing on Wednesday with the theme of putting down or letting go and bring another nuance, another consideration into it. And this idea of letting go of what is not beneficial, what is not wholesome, what is not needed in this moment in order to make space for what is wholesome, to make space for peace, to make space for during our meditation, quiet, silence, as a way of also self-care, as an expression of love for ourselves, taking care of ourselves and taking care of others when we're more available, when there is more care, we care for ourselves with more stillness and love. And one quote that I like to bring in to inspire, to inspire, to be serve as an inspiration for our practice together is a quote by Thomas Merton, who was a mystic writer, priest, and yeah, beautiful being. So, here is the quote, the rush and pressure of modern life. And mind you, he wrote this, I think he passed away in the 40s. Am I right? Let me quickly check. He passed away, well, anyway, he passed away long before the age of the internet. He passed away in 1968. So, he definitely wrote this even before the age of the internet. So, whatever he's saying about the busyness of modern life, you can put it on steroids and imagine just how much more profound, of course, this applies to our situation. So, yes, he was a tapest monk, that's it. He was a tapest monk, theologian, mystic poet, social activist, and scholar. So, he says, the rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form of its innate violence, to allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything is to succumb to violence. The frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace. It destroys our own inner capacity for peace. It destroys the faith, the fruitfulness of our work, of our own work, because it kills the root of inner wisdom, which makes work fruitful. So, I'll reread a part of this again. The rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form of its innate violence, to allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything is to succumb to violence. So, powerful words, this busyness of our modern lives, to want to help everyone in everything to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, surrendering to too many demands, it kills the inner peace, it kills our inner peace, which really is the foundation for service, to care for ourselves and for others. So, with this as an inspiration, I'd like to lead us into a guided meditation, especially this Friday, and for some of you Saturday, or Mary Christina in Sydney, Australia, stillness in a way to let go, to let go, to put down, to put down all the multitudes, just to come back, just to come to our heart to this moment. So, I'd like to invite you to land in your meditation posture, whatever is supportive for you in this body, sitting, lying down, lying down, and can we let go? Can we let go in this moment? Our preoccupations, not necessary in this moment. Can we set our intention at the outset, set our intention with uprightness, with a sense of integrity and dignity? Can we set our hearts, our intention, to put down, to let go? What is not necessary right now? What is extra? Preoccupations, worries, as much as possible, as much as may be available. And having set our intention with wholesomeness, letting go, to putting down. Ah, can we release? Is it possible to invite the tension in the body to be softened, release the tightness, the holding? Can we bring our awareness, letting go of thoughts, of preoccupations, stories? Can we put down the stories right now? Release the stories, no stories right now, thank you stories, not needed in this moment. And gently invite our awareness to the body, to the experience of breathing, being breathed. Letting the breath fill, the abdomen, the chest, the whole body on its own, no work needed. With our end, just noticing that it's already happening. Simply being aware, simply being aware. No extra effort is needed, putting down the extra effort. Thank you. Can this putting down for what is not needed in this moment? Put this extra, be seen as care, as metta, as love for ourselves. This relinquishment is the foundation of inner peace, the foundation to make space for care and love for ourselves and others and the world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can we let go, release this inner violence of our times in the words of Thomas Merton? The inner preoccupation with all the demands we have taken up in this moment. Relinquish release, favor of peace, stability, space to be and not do, non-doing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can we see the equivalence of relinquishment and love? Relinquishing what's not needed, what's extra, what's burdensome, to release and to love and care for ourselves, stillness and spaciousness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We all beings be free, including us. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. So before we turn to practicing in small groups in Sangha and community, I'd like to invite you, if you'd like to share any reflections from your practice and the observations. You can type them in chat. If it's to everyone I would read your name, if it's just to me, it'll be private. I won't say your name out loud. I read the reflection. You can also raise your zoom hand, and especially if you haven't spoken for a while if you haven't shared, or if you're new, would love to hear your reflections your questions your comments your observations as a gift offered to the Sangha to yourself to be held witness and to others, always of benefit all reflections and questions. So, as I wait for any reflections that might bubble up from you, I'll share that for me. What I noticed about this practice was a lot of inner stillness a lot of inner care inner stillness as a, as a way of nourishment and care became more and more prevalent. And yes, putting things down preoccupations and thoughts over and over again with patience is part of this practice, just part of this practice when we've gone through the whole day or whole week with lots of demands, especially given our modern lives. It's natural to have to put down to gently incline the mind to put down to put down. And sometimes it's not possible. And that's okay. We set the intention. But we're gentle with letting go not being possible. Nicholas says the phrase sewing seeds of presence came up as a kind response. Whenever the mind got swept up. Well that's lovely. Thank you, Nicholas for sharing that. Sewing seeds of presence. Yeah, lovely. Sewing seeds of presence. What a gentle what a beautifully gentle and wholesome image. Love it. Sewing seeds of presence. Wonderful. Thank you for your appreciation. Person sent it to me. It's privately. Yeah. And another one another reflection. I love the little bird in the nest, just like our hearts. Yeah. And I see Nancy, please. I think you were saying something about extra extra. I have too many fans going to have heard you the entire context of what you were saying but in my meditation. I was trying to let go of all of this stuff that was extra. And so I heard those words and it was very helpful. I hope you actually said that I didn't misunderstand you. Yes, I did say that, Nancy you heard you heard it just right, given all the fans that's exactly right and the lights on me. Yeah, it's got you and and and it sounds like it was helpful and delighted to hear that. Thank you. Noticing what is extra. Great. Beautiful. Thanks, Nancy. And Casey, please. Hi, Nikki. Thank you so much for a beautiful guy that another beautiful guided meditation. There are a lot of phrases tonight that really resonated with me. And I had a visceral response I think it was the part where you said putting down as well as there's enough space for stillness and silence, and my body just kind of went like it went like it felt like relax and there was like this appreciation coming forward and it was interesting also when you talked about silence and how this past year and a half, I've been really hypersensitive to sound, and I'm not sure if it's because I haven't been able to sleep very well, but there's a lot of noise that's going to sound to me, but I crave violence. So I was wondering, I have such, because I'm so hypersensitive to sound I have like, like I've developed I feel like dog ears where I'm just like, I wish my hearing wasn't so good it's never been this good. But anyways, I'm wondering if you have any advice or guidance, because I have such a version to sound to a lot of different sounds, because my nervous system's out of balance. I really just want I really crave violence and I know that people have mentioned, you know, like, go in inner silence, but I haven't able to master that so any tips would be greatly appreciated. Yeah, thank you Casey Thank you for what you brought up. Sharing is not uncommon for the past year, everything that's happened coming hyper vigilant and then their sense of sound, you know, here I am I don't know if you can hear through the mic, the sound of this, the ambulance going yeah. So what you're describing the, the hypersensitivity to sound, and the wanting the craving for silence and really is coming through is being co created by what you mentioned, which is the, the aversion to sound, which is the version. So the version is what is making the dog ears the hypersensitivity if there wasn't the version there, the lens of a version, I don't want sound I want silence I want to know that like you see, you know, if, if I always and told you color, whatever red is terrible bad then all you would see in your environment is color red like oh my god danger danger I don't want color red oh my gosh he's wearing right now, right, it just you become hypersensitive to it right. So, so, basically, the clue that the way to work with it is through the version. Really, that is what hooking it in place. So, and that. So, notice the version, notice the version. Like I hate sound I hate sound. Why it's just sound. It's, there's not, it's not good it's not bad it's just in the environment. It's, there's it's this affiliation the association that's bringing all the, the suffering, the way that the mind is seeing it. So bring the attention with kindness with gentleness to the version like oh sweetie it's, it's just a version. It's just a version it's okay. Make friends with the version, then make friends with what's underneath the version which is the unpleasant feeling tone. Oh, my mind just perceives it as pleasant as unpleasant. Okay, it's just unpleasant. Big deal. And slowly it will lose its, its hold on you, and there can be a lot of sound without the reactivity. And then there can be the nourishing that in enjoying the inner silence, even though it could be a lot of noise around, but it's really I'm pointing to the version, which is on top of the reactivity to the unpleasantness to. So, when they're so when the reactivity to the unpleasantness is met with, it's just unpleasant. Okay, it's unpleasant big deal. It's not gonna kill me it's just something, then you're not giving it power, otherwise you're giving power it's unpleasant. You're here to, you know, have power over me like every, you see how it happens. You know pleasant so, so that's what I would like to offer you as a way to work with it and happen. Happy to reflect again later come back and you can share how it went. Okay, great. Thank you Casey. So dear ones the time has come for us to turn to into small practice groups or Sangha to practice together so I'll create a small groups and the invitation is to start with 15 seconds of silent meta for each other. And then take care of each other, take care of yourselves really important to be sensitive to each other sensitive to yourselves and let go of what is not needed. What is not needed, just saying only what's, what's needed, and maybe you'll spend time in silence. And if there's awkwardness in silence awkwardness is not needed, let the awkwardness go from your mind, see if you can be in community with just care and ease. So, it can be profound practice put down what is not needed. Put down what is not needed. Whether it's, I want to sound impressive, not needed. Oh, I don't have anything to say I'll value, not needed, just put it all down. See, explore, experiment. Alright, I'm opening the rooms. And here we go. We have about a minute for reflections. If you notice something, practice meetings, if you haven't shared, please would love to hear from you. Neil, please. So I was in a room with three and we all found this to be, you know, a very warm, warm and sweet experience. You know, each in a different sort of way. It was, you know, and I would tell you while you were talking I'm like, what is she doing this isn't meta but, you know, you know, it was lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Neil. Yeah, I appreciate the report back from the group. It's meta shows up in so many ways without phrases and making space for meta making space for care and love in this way is quite radical. It's actually quite radical, and I'd like to teach to share radical teachings. How's that. So, yes. Okay, so let's make this the last comment. So I forget this is your, your, your name says iPhone. Yeah, please. Whoops. Oh, wait, we're having. Okay, there you go one more time if you unmute yourself. There. Perfect. Here comes. So, um, just, just letting you know that I just want to really practice letting go of everything. And I feel like it's just letting go of whole series just like scares me off, like, like, losing my power over something that I want to accomplish. Just to keep like haunting my mind. Because, because not letting go. So I hope that I, you can just give me some advice or maybe I'll just practice more. Yeah, so, so the question you're asking is complicated enough and I need to ask you more questions about what it is you mean so what this is what I'll do tell you what this is what we'll formally close the, and then I'm happy to stay a few minutes extra afterwards and and and ask you a question then Jennifer says, Nikki as you responded to Casey's question I really appreciate your comment about how we co create our experience. I'm very different this is very important also year bond YouTube appreciated both. Also the question that Casey asked them the response. Yes, it's so much about co creation and maybe, maybe next time maybe on Monday else. We'll be more about how we create so much in our reality. It's so important. So dear ones, thank you so much for creating a beautiful reality of your practice and showing up to cultivate this for yourself and for all for all beings everywhere. Be well, may all beings be free. Thanks all. Take good care. Be well, let go of what's extra. See you next week. Yes, I'm going to stop the recording.
