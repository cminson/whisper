So, we'll begin by settling into the body. 
And allowing the body to be at ease, be comfortable, as comfortable as possible for yourself. 
It's really helpful for the body to be comfortable during metopractice. 
And allow your attention to begin to rest in the area of your heart. 
And just notice what's there. 
There's no right or wrong, just simply being with, opening to, allowing, accepting. 
However your heart is in this moment. 
And bringing an easy being into mind, your being that you have determined, that you've thought of, that makes you smile. 
Bringing this being into your heart. 
A good place to begin metopractice is by reflecting on qualities that you appreciate, enjoy, that you like, that you admire about this being. 
It is said that the proximate cause for meta is seeing the beautiful, seeing the good. 
So touching into those qualities that you appreciate. 
So noticing, how does it impact you to think about this? How does it feel? How does it make your heart feel? You can also reflect on things that this being has done to support you or help you. 
Kind actions. 
And holding this being in your heart in whatever way works for you. 
Either as an image or a felt sense, perhaps using the name. 
Beginning to express the wishes of kindness for this being. 
May you be happy with each phrase, connecting with the being, understanding the meaning. 
And checking in, how has it impacted you to make this wish? May you be healthy. 
May you be safe. 
May you live with ease. 
We continue with this expressing the wishes, saying these phrases in our minds. 
Connecting with the being, saying the phrase and understanding the meaning and touching in an embodied way. 
How does it feel to have made that wish? Again, no right or wrong in that feeling. 
Remember the metamagnet. 
May you be happy. 
May you be healthy. 
May you be safe. 
May you live with ease. 
May you be happy. 
May you be healthy. 
May you be safe. 
May you live with ease, continuing in silence to wish this being well. 
May you be happy. 
May you live with ease. 
May you live with ease. 
May you live with ease. 
May you live with ease. 
May you live with ease. 
May you live with ease. 
May you live with ease. 
May you live with ease. 
If your mind wanders out into thought, just come back and begin again bringing the easy being to mind, saying the phrase, understanding the meaning and checking in with each phrase. 
How does it make the heart feel to have made that wish? How does it make the heart feel to have made that wish? How does it make the heart feel to have made that wish? How does it make the heart feel to have made that wish? Now I'd like to suggest that you bring yourself into your mind, reflecting on qualities that you like about yourself, qualities that you appreciate about yourself. 
Kind things that you've done. 
And if this is a struggle for you, I'll offer you one that you can appreciate about yourself, that you're here wanting to cultivate and learn about your mind, your heart and how to open it, how to meet it, how to accept your heart and transform it. 
This is a rare and beautiful quality. 
Connecting with yourself. 
You could use an image of yourself, the feeling of yourself sitting here and beginning to wish yourself the phrases of kindness. 
May I be happy. 
May I be healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I live with ease. 
And with each phrase connecting with the sense of yourself, understanding the meaning of the phrase, noticing the impact that this has on your experience. 
Some of you might find it helpful to actually put your hand on your heart. 
Let's see if this helps you connect with this area. 
May I be happy. 
May I be healthy. 
May I be safe. 
May I live with ease. 
Continuing in silence for a few minutes, wishing kindness to yourself. 
Thinking thoughts of goodwill about yourself. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
May I be happy. 
I'm bringing your benefactor, your easy being back to mind. 
And sending the wishes of goodwill to your easy being. 
And then as if your easy being were standing or sitting right in front of you, envisioning this being, sending you the wishes of kindness. 
May you be happy. 
May you be healthy. 
May you be safe. 
May you live with ease. 
And noticing the impact of how it feels to receive this wish. 
Continuing in silence for another minute, receiving the wishes of goodwill.
