 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hello again and greetings everyone. It's lovely to be with you in this moment in time and just having finished our meditation together I asked if you would put some words to capture what's arising in this moment. And so many beautiful words are in the container. I'd love to just read them, a few of them. They're so beautiful. Just make my heart so happy this morning. Gratitude, calm, lightness, songbirds, grateful, ease, softness, spaciousness. Peaceful, light, a smile. Who would I serve today? Joy, increased, lightness, ease, calm, presence, planting seeds, appreciation, enlivened. So many beautiful, yeah, presence, the whole catastrophe, karuna, smile, buoyancy, curiosity. The delight of beginner's mind, appreciation, expansion, calm, secure, the tickle of childlike curiosity, happiness, gratitude, calm, friendship, love and acceptance. So many beautiful words and they keep coming. They keep coming. Thank you all. Thank you. They're so beautiful. The last one I see right now, wonder, it's possible, surrender, relief. Ah, my day just feels more open and light. So beautiful. So beautiful. Thank you all. Thank you. Infinite possibilities of delight. Seeing God as infinite possibilities of delight. Beautiful. Thank you all. I feel in this space of practice with you really engaged, so engaged. So, in many ways, I think the theme for this week has been introduced through this guided meditation and the way that all of you have engaged with it. It's just so beautiful just to feel the engagement in any way that was accessible and possible. So, the theme for this week, let me introduce it in this way. So, delight, gladness, happiness, so many gifts, so many gifts that the practice gives us, but also when we support these beautiful qualities in our life, in our practice, the practice deepens, our life finds other dimensions of beauty, service, goodness. So, as the opposite of this grim duty, I should, should, you know, I have to sit, I have to practice, I have to become a weekend, I have to serve, all of these are so heavy. And in fact, they get in the way, this tightness gets in the way. Whereas when we have curiosity, interest, all delight, this interest, this zest, this zest, this childlike zest, which we've all had at some point, of course we've all had it, every child has it. We know this, we know this curiosity, interest, lightness, zest. And that is the theme of this week, this week in ways of bringing this sense of play, the sense of play, the sense of freshness, the sense of practice and life as a divine play, as a divine game that we're engaged with. And this week for the teachings, for what I'm finding inspiration in is actually, you know, as it said, sometimes art imitates life or artistic endeavors support life and vice versa, is the artistic endeavor of improv. So, improv for those of you who may not familiar with this term, it's some people consider it a comedy performance, but it's not so much a performance actually in turn. Well, it is a performance from externally, that's how it's viewed. But internally, there is quite an art of the way of being an improviser, an improviser in the art of improv comedy, which actually tie in so beautifully into practice, tie beautifully into practice. And in fact, we're all improvisers. If I just said the word improv and you froze up, I can't do improv. Guess what? You've been improvising your whole life. We're all improvisers. We don't know the next thing that's going to come out of our mouths or the next thing we're going to do necessarily or interactions or life. Life is an improvisation. Life is an improvisation. All of us are improvisers. We don't have a script. Things happen and then we improvise responses, we improvise our thoughts, our everything is improvised. So can we actually take the art, be a little more skilled in the art of improvising our lives and improvising in the moments of our practice with more lightness, with more interest, curiosity? And also for some of you might know, I've studied and performed improv for many years and actually I've taught workshops on improv and mindfulness and how the two can support each other. Actually, well, how improv can support mindfulness really as an art, as a way of being lighter in the world and deepening our practice. And it can actually be very, very deep insight. It can bring so many deep insights this way of approaching. So I'd like to introduce some of these concepts this week to support our practice and bring some lightness, bring some delight, some freshness, some interest, curiosity, childlike curiosity. So that is the frame for this week. So the perspective, so the whole frame is a frame of, as I mentioned during the guided meditation, a frame of what's called an infinite game versus a finite game. So a finite game is a game where there are winners and losers and there are rules that are set ahead of time. So for example, chess, backgammon, or any sports, they're finite games. Infinite game, dancing is an infinite game. So infinite games are games are played for the delight of the game itself. There are no winners and losers and the rules keep shifting and changing and they're made during the game. So dancing, when it's done for its own sake, for the delight of dancing, that's an infinite game. There are no winners and losers. Improv is an infinite game. It's just where the delight and the rules get shifted and changed. And in fact, the ultimate game, the ultimate infinite game is said to be life. There are no winners and losers per se. We all are born, we all die. And it's so important to have the sense, the freshness of this life or the sake of itself or the sake of its, it's the, you know, it's not a winning that we do, but the sense of our curiosity, exploring, which actually this brings emptiness and it's a marriage of emptiness and fullness because in the dharmic sense, emptiness, nothing exists independent of anything else. It's an inherent emptiness to everything, to everything that is so, so that emptiness brings so many possibilities. So it's things are not fixed in a, in a particular way. And then in that emptiness, there is the fullness of possibility because things are not fixed in a particular way. So, so life as an infinite game, life as an infinite game really is an expression of emptiness, of acknowledging emptiness of all things and fullness, this marriage of emptiness and fullness. So just trying to set a bit of the frame this week, there is a lot more that I'll bring in this week, but just something also to leave us with is I often think and have thought of, of improv as kindergarten for adults. There's a way of playing. There's this bringing the sense of curiosity, play, freshness, possibility to each moment of life. And similarly, what if we saw our lives, our lives as this kindergarten, we're here, we're here to learn, we're here to explore, we're here to, to express our fullness in the midst of this, the emptiness, the possibilities, this freshness as if spring sunrise. So thank you all for your practice for exploring this bringing more delight, curiosity, interest, this to engage in this infinite game from this perspective of emptiness and fullness with delight. I'm excited to practice with you to share these insights, these teachings with you in this week. Thank you so much. Be well and be light today. Oh yeah, I forgot that actually. Maybe I'll say one more thing. The invitation for the rest of the day, if you can still have this attitude of lightness, this childlike curiosity through your life, perhaps the things that are even routine, can you approach them with new curiosity, with new freshness? Make a different choice. Shift things a little bit. Just bring this freshness of this infinite game, infinite play, the interplay of emptiness and fullness with delight. All right. Thank you so much. Take good care. See you tomorrow.
