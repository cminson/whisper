Shoulders, backwards, and forwards.
And as you're making these small movements begin to find your breathing, connect with your breathing.
You might pull your shoulders up to your ears and squeeze them and drop them.
Make fists with your hands and squeeze real tight, tensing your arms and chest and relax it.
And the same with your legs and feet.
Put pressure on your feet and tense your legs, tense your thighs, and let it go.
And find your breath at the place that is most prominent for you.
The tip of your nostrils where you can feel just the slight coolness of the inhale and warmth of the exhale.
The rising and falling of your chest or the expansion and contraction of your abdomen.
No place is better than another.
The distinction to be aware of is which is easier for you, which comes more clearly.
As you settle into your body and find your breathing, begin with a very gentle, silent note.
Inhale and exhale.
Or rising and falling.
Whatever words work for you.
And you'll notice that there are sounds in the room. There's a sound in my voice, there's a sound of people still coming in and settling.
There will be the sound of your neighbor breathing or moving slightly.
Mindfulness is not about finding a perfectly quiet, hermetically sealed environment.
Mindfulness is being present to whatever is arising.
So when a sound comes, note hearing.
And in no time at all, our monkey minds will wander.
They will leave our breath and go to some story that's happening in our life right now.
Maybe go home, maybe go to the office or where we work.
We might even find ourselves in the middle of a conversation with someone.
And when we realize that our mind has wandered, that realization is the most important aspect of training our mind with mindfulness.
Gently note thinking and simply return to the breath without criticism.
Without commentary of, oh, I can't do this. This is so hard. I'll never be a meditator.
Gently note thinking and very gently return to the breath.
The beginning of vipassana or mindfulness meditation is developing our concentration.
And the breath is an object to focus the mind to develop concentration.
Other objects are appropriate as well.
If there's a persistent sound, we can focus on that sound.
Rather than resisting it, we can allow it and focus on it.
If there's a persistent thought or sensation in our body, especially a painful sensation in the body,
focusing on that sensation and noting heat or tightness or aching, whatever the sensation is.
Mindfulness is a detached, accepting awareness of whatever is arising.
And over time, as our concentration improves and the steadiness of our focus improves,
insights or vipassana insights will arise.
For example, we might see that sounds come to us. We don't reach out for them.
Thoughts arise. We don't think them.
Sensations arise in the body.
We begin to have deeper and deeper insights into the origin of our suffering,
our unskillful behavior and patterns.
