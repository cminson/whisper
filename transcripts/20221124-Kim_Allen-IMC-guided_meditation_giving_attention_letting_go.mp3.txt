 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hey, it's nice to see everyone coming on. I appreciate the way you often write hello and where you're from. Kind of gives that feeling of us all being together. And I'm always delighted with how widespread this Sangha is. So thank you for that. Let's settle in for our meditation together. Finding a posture where you can be upright and also relaxed. And allowing yourself to settle in, feeling the seat where you're sitting or whatever you're lying on. Really feeling that contact and connection so that you can let go. And allow it to simply support you. Closing the eyes if that's comfortable for you. Bringing the attention inward. Senting the body in the posture that it's in. Kind of an overall way to help orient the mind. So we could say, give your attention to the posture. And notice how it is that you're giving that attention. When you turn to the posture at the beginning of the sit, are you controlling it from the top down? Making it relax and align in certain ways? Or are you not quite giving your full attention because you're just coming into the usual habitual posture that you always do? So I'm just drawing attention to this word, give your attention to the posture. And wondering how would it be if the attention is really a gift that we're giving? So maybe offer your attention to the posture of this body. And does that change how the relationship feels? Maybe in light of it being a gift, the body feels empowered to orient itself. To straighten up appropriately, to relax into a form that feels supportive for meditation. It's nice to receive a gift. So letting the body receive the gift of your attention. And broadening, broadening that attention, giving or offering attention to all of the bodily sensations as they are right now. Just letting them be as they are and letting them be known as they are. And now broadening the awareness to include the emotions that are present. Any thoughts, better in the mind? Maybe various intentions or aspirations. Just holding all of experience in a spacious awareness that we are giving as a gift to our experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we practice with this giving attention as a gift, we may notice how giving attention relates to letting go. We can't fully offer our awareness unless we let each thing be as it is, be known as it is and have its life of arising and persisting and passing away. To be fully aware, we have to let things be. Let them go. So just letting experience flow. And we'll sit in silence for a while. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. With great generosity. Letting go of our stories. Letting go of our. Ideas. Our complaints, our judgments. Our wanting. Our wanting. Letting go of entanglement with all of those things that. Grab at our attention. Letting them calm be as they are and go. Without hooking on to them. Actually settles the mind. Slowly brings the heart into alignment. And from practicing this way, we may get a. Glimpse or a hint. Of how we might be that way with others also. With the right balance and under the right conditions, we may get a sense of the ability to be in the right position. Let there be other viewpoints. Let there be. Other ways of being. Without leaping in and entangling ourselves. Somehow that attitude can sometimes allow things to settle. That spaciousness. Just with the gift of our full, much better, love for us. to peace.
