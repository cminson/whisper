 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So I just want to wish a warm welcome, a really warm welcome to everybody. What a delight it is for the four of us, David, Kim, Ying and I, to share this with other people. We used to meet on Zoom meetings years ago. We would start and we just started talking about the soup dozen. We just loved it so much. It was so meaningful for us. We just eventually said we should share this with other people. And here we are. And here we are. So those of you don't know me, I'm Diana Clark. And maybe I'll pass it on to one of my co-teachers here. Yeah, I'll say a few words. I'm just really happy to see so many of you being enthusiastic about this, like Diana is saying, that we had a passion for this collection. And I think one of the things that I was reflecting is also how much this text has been part of our life in many different ways, Dharma life. We do hope that this can become a stream of life in you as well. So enjoy. I guess I'll follow. And just again, echo, echo, Yang and Diana's welcome. And maybe sort of add a little something to what Ying said, which is the general frame we've created for this sharing that Diana mentioned is this idea of study and practice. We found that our study was such a rich support for practice and such an inspiration for practice that we wanted to share that. And we're going to try to maintain that even in this kind of different presentation about the polycan and looking for ways that help all of us find inspiration and support for our practices in knowing something more about the way all these texts are held together, cobbled together over a couple thousand years. So, welcome, looking forward to it. Okay, great. So, I don't have much to add to the passion and the study and practice comments I share all of those. I guess I would maybe just say to enter with the idea that you might find something over the next two sessions, something surprising or interesting that you didn't know about the texts, and maybe to have the intention in the background. In the background of discovering a new angle on that maybe you hadn't seen before, whatever that may be. I'm also asked to give a sort of a summary since we have so many of us here we can't all introduce ourselves but we do read your registration forms, and it was a delight to see all of your interest and inspiration and comments. So I just wanted to say that we have people registered from seven countries and 21 US states. So that's quite amazing. A wide range of suit of background from. I've heard of these things but haven't really don't really know where they come from or what they are, all the way up to, you know, I've studied these for years and their foundation of my practice but I always want to learn more so I think that'll make the breakout groups very rich. This wide range. And then as far as what people are inspired by or comments that they wrote in those sort of free questions we have at the end. Some people find the suit as a little bit challenging or intimidating, and they want to learn how to approach them. And some people love the suit us, but want a more solid foundation. We also learned that many people have heard a lot about the text or heard them quoted in Dharma talks and have now gotten interested in going back to the sources themselves, which is a wonderful wish to have in practice. And then, what else did we find some people are wanting to learn more how to incorporate study into practice. Some people just enjoy engaging with the Buddhist teachings and particularly with other people. So this will also provide in this class a chance to talk about these texts with others and you may not have a situation where you live where you can easily get together with others and discuss these texts your friends may think you're a little weird that you're interested in them so here are some other weird people that we can join with on that. And, you know, some folks are just curious so whatever it is that's bringing you here. It was the right thing. I always trust that everybody who shows up exactly the right set of people. And so let's, let's go forward. So, yeah. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Kim. For that summary and just what was my heart to know that there are so many of us have maybe some line in our heart for this. So as we began this course, I wanted to point out that today is a full moon observation day, and, well, you know, between 23rd of July, and 24th somewhere in between. There's a full moon here in the terrible Buddhist tradition, the full moon day is called a day almost a practitioners, whether they're monastics or lay, would dedicate themselves to the Dharma practice and often they people in the Buddhist countries, may people might go to the monasteries to make offering and practice together alongside with the monastics. And this is the ancient tradition. It's been back several thousand years. And this is a tradition that is still held, even today in lots of Buddhist countries, and some parts of the Western world and I'm aware that, for example, a by Gary monastery, one of the terrible monasteries today would have a session observation day. And so in some ways, as we're gathering together, we're honoring this tradition by learning and practicing Dharma together. And so this is a real blessing, quite a precious for us to do that. And I say a few words about this particular July for Monday, and that is called. I can't pronounce it properly, but the A And this is sometimes called A, which commemorates and the Buddha's first sermon, the first teaching to his first five disciples and through this teaching, one of the five disciples was said to have opened to have opened his Dharma eyes by seeing the Dharma for himself. This may seem like a too much information for now, but it's relevant to this course, and entering the world of the public canon without the Buddha's teachings and his disciples teachings without the Buddha beginning his teaching in this way, that would not be this body canon. And so I feel just this heartfelt gratitude that we're able to gather together on this quite auspicious day doesn't mean that tomorrow is not special, but it does have some significance in this. And so this leads me to what I'm about to share with you, which is an overview of what we will be offering in this next two classes and today and next Saturday. And one way to relate to this teaching and that the four of us will be offering is that this is can be considered as a gift that this teacher wish to pass along to you. And this gifts have ancient roots from the times of the Buddha and his disciples. And the gifts were transmitted, passed down from warm hearts to warm hearts. In many different forms, recitation and text on palm leaves, which you will see some of this. And the translations and many different forms of translations. And so this is what we call the world of the party cannon. I wanted to share a story that I heard a bunch of Jato shared this when he was here in Inside Meditation Center a few years ago. And he shared about how he translated on public and and text into English is one of the prominent translators of the public and and text in the modern days and you probably get a little exposure in this course. And he said that for a few years, he stayed all by himself on an island of Taiwan, and they have missed and mis memorize the location, but he stayed all by himself in this in his little kooty for a few years with just homes for homes for ropes and the laptop for sure. And he had a few basic possessions. And he just poured his heart out with this basic possessions, basic living condition and did the bulk of the translation. And I'm very touched by this story. And often when I read the translations are such essential. I have this image of him sitting in his tiny kooty doing the translation. And that I'm reading right now. So I feel the presence of a warm hearts and many warm hearts. Before our times. And so those beings, open the door for us to be able to access and this miraculous world. As we enter into this world, you may begin to realize some of you already mentioned in your comment that this world seemed very rich and sometimes complex and archaic and can be quite daunting disorienting to navigate. So in this course, we hope that we can offer some historical context. We'll share some maps and structures for everyone to navigate some of this collections. And we'll also share some tools that you can use to look up teachings like the Buddha's first sermon. Where is it located in the ocean of suttas? And how do I find that sutta? And then we'll also offer some resources that may be helpful for your own navigation. And so that's one aspect of what we would like to share in this next two sessions. And then the other thing that we hope to convey is as you begin to dive into this words, we're hoping that you can to find your own ways in relating to this text. Maybe in ways that are quite humbling and human. And you can find ourselves in the text somehow. And for me reading this text often has a timeless quality in them. So the path of combining study and practice is quite rich in this course. We'll also share some perspectives on how text can become part of one's practice and how they can flow into or guide or inform, or maybe nourishing and nourish our Dharma practice and Dharma life. And I wanted to maybe end by sharing a few words that Vikubodi shared in his interview with inquiry in mind back in 2006. And so he spoke about this relationship between studying and practicing. And so he said this. Knowledge without practical application is barren. And as meditation practice without the guiding light of a clear conceptual understanding is fertile without knowledge of the text and fear within a couple of generations, a practice tradition will easily become diluted to that and digested by the surah. Especially when the culture is a theistic or a materialistic one. I was very touched by this statement and that a venerable Vikubodi shared. This may land in different ways in your heart, in your mind. But for me, what he books is that maybe this endeavor of studying and practicing with the poly cannon is not only for the benefit of our own Dharma practice and Dharma life. But it's also for the benefit of many practitioners and maybe even many practitioners in the future generations. So make this course very much peace, happiness and to everyone and to the whole world. So thank you. I'll pass it on to David. Thank you, Yang. Yeah. So we'd like to begin by going into some small breakout groups and just meeting ourselves. One aspect of this practice and you see it throughout the canon is that this is practice that we do in community. And even when we do it alone, it's enriched by the community of practice that supports it. We'd like you to explore two questions in any order. These are questions. They don't have to be treated in order. But if each one of the three or four of you that encounter one another in a breakout room could say something about what's your inspiration for taking this class. And a second question. Do you have some burning question about the poly cannon that brought you to the class? Maybe just one of the two of these is relevant. But either one of these, and I'll paste them into the chat. Either one of these questions or both of them will, I think, give away for you to get to know one another, find that find that supportive community and maybe hear other people's intentions as a way of sharing, opening the heart, unburdening the heart of practice. So this is a largely a listening exercise. You might just sort of share a little bit about an inspiration, hear what others say, see how that informs your, your sense of your own inspiration or orientation. And we'll have 15 minutes for this. So, you know, you might go around in circles, share a few things and, you know, share it equally among you, get to know one another, some other people who can use maybe an unfortunate word and describing us, I don't know, I wouldn't say we're weird. I would say we're odd. No, I wouldn't say we're odd or weird. I would say, you know, there's certain inspiration and maybe some burning questions that bring us together today and next week. And these questions will help unpack those a little bit for one another. So anyway, enjoy, enjoy each other's company and enjoy sort of beginning the class with touching in with our inspiration for practice. Diana. Okay, great. Here we go. So welcome back. And I hope you enjoyed that as much as we did. We find this connection to one another in our practice to be so rich, and just be in the spirit of that it would be lovely if a few people, not necessarily spokespersons for the various breakout rooms but just anybody who feels so moved would share a little bit of what came up by way of inspiration or burning questions. We'd love to share in the inspiration. And if there are any burning questions we would love to get a sense of what those are, if there are any. And go ahead and raise your zoom hand I think most people here know how to do that. We are. There are many of us so we may not see a hand waved on the fourth screen. So be great if you could use your, your zoom hand to indicate you'd like to add something into our mix. Who would like to share some inspiration or and or a burning question that came up in your group be offered by yourself or by one of your one of your companions. Waiting for a brave soul to raise their hand. There's somebody and by the way, just while waiting for others. You know, there are various ways to raise your hand and zoom. You can click in the three dots to the right of your picture, you can go to reactions down in the lower right of the control panel, which comes into view when you move the cursor around. And you can also do it from the participants area. And there may be other ways, it depends on which version of zoom etc. Okay, but we've got a couple brave souls who've raised their hands. We'll start with Will unmute if you would Will. Thank you. Yeah, one thing that came up is we were struck by yings comment about the ocean. And so figuring out where to begin in the ocean right now getting a kind of an idea of what the ocean looks like. But then where's a good place to begin. One of the kind of personal question that I have is how to use the poly to English dictionary. Somebody sent me one. I, I enter the word you know like Dukka, but it doesn't give me a definition of Dukka, you know, great. So I don't know anyway. Yeah, that's a tool I would personally would be interested in knowing how to use the four of us may comment as you share inspiration and I said, I use the phrase brave soul. I didn't know that will have been trying to find Dukka in a poly English dictionary. And hey, brave to even attend, we can help. We can't solve the problem of the poly English dictionaries that are out there but we can we can help. And yeah, that's it's lovely metaphor that you provided of an ocean, and you know sort of knowing two things, you know, which ocean do I want to be in and you know how to swim in this ocean I think again, there we can. We can provide some some guidance. Thank you will. Thank you, Sandy. Two of the four people in my group, including me are members of Kim's weekly student study class and so we spent some time discussing that and talking about what we've gotten out of it, and the value of having a really knowledgeable teacher to lead you in in the field of study because there are a lot of depths of meaning and I think some teachers, perhaps by might not have as much background as others in terms of understanding, both the original poly and the context. So, for those of us who had that kind of study in Tim's class we study things that are very kind of careful granular level. And I think they're almost everyone here probably is looking for extra insight in terms of the overall structure the high level. You think, right. Very useful, useful for us useful for others appreciate it. Thanks, Sandy. Shani. Hi, this is a personal question. I'm super new to all of this so so bear that in mind. And I guess I'm really wondering about like who wrote these things and how is it affected by patriarchy over over time and how do we hold that. Yeah. But I appreciate it. Appreciate it. I was a little worried when you said personal question because I was thinking how much do I want to reveal here. But yeah, those are those are great questions and we will touch upon some of those things and will also in this class and also in all our classes we're really trying to I think it's important for all of us to bring forward voices in the in the suit does and elsewhere in the canon that are quiet, that we don't hear as much. And learn from them. You know something deeper and richer about the social context in the political context and cultural context that produce these, these teachings in the form of these texts. Thank you. Any other inspirational. Oh, good. Carlota. Oh, please unmute. So my question is, this is a collection in the school, are there more collections that maybe has the same name or similar name like Polly, like Polly, and in other traditions. So, that's a good question, we will we will address some of that indeed, there are there are there are several cannons, and there are cannons that we only have hints of an historical record and we assume there are cannons of which we know nothing. So, we'll get to that very good question. Appreciate it. I never know which order hands have come up in I'm going to just touch on them all Winnie. So, my question is, how is the panic cannon related to other sutures like the dining suture or the Lotus sutra, or any other sutures that I've read through my practice which is then Buddhism. Good. Great question Winnie appreciate it. We'll touch upon that probably very lightly we focus here on the poly cannon and you know the Tara Vodden tradition that it, that it, you know that it's most closely associated with, but indeed, we'll we'll talk, at least mention sort of some of the origins of those later, more literary sutures. Bill. To reiterate a little bit that has been said already. I'm interested in historical background. When were the suit is written, how do we know how old the material is. I've read a few books on historiography of Christianity find it completely fascinating. So, I like that kind of study. I know it'll be a kind of a tension or with the actual teachings of the poly cannon. So I don't want to take away from that, but that's an interest of mine. Yeah. No, and I think for me that question dub tells very nicely bill with the question asked just a moment ago by Shawnee that is, you know, these as we study the origins of these texts and the teachings occurrence of the teachings in them. We can't help but remind it how human their creation and their transmission and their protection and sharing is and those are rich aspects of, of, of, exploring it so thank you for that. And we'll definitely we'll be touching on that for sure. And then possibly final question from Henry. And then we'll and then we'll get into some of these questions. I have a question, but my question would be, how okay is it to interpret the text? Like what is the range? I have a tendency to be like really interpretive with the text. So how much wiggle room is there? Yeah, that's great. I find that both a question, something about inspiration in there and a question, kind of a burning question. And I think within, we'll talk quite a bit about translation and in a sense, we all do our own translations. We work it into our own individual language of practice, which is part of making these practices, making this practice our own. So we'll touch on that in several different ways. We'll compare a couple of translations and we'll talk about some of that, sort of how free can we be in finding these, finding this path of freedom. So I'm gonna suggest that we move on. I asked anybody else who had questions to just hold on to them. We'll have time. I wanna make this transition about these questions. Think of these, if you have a burning question, keep them close during the class and sort of make sure that you get an answer or that you keep engaging with that question. We're happy to keep returning to these. And likewise, your inspiration, hold it close as we continue. Keep the inspiration as sort of a, what do I wanna say, a leitmotif, a reminder of your passion for the practice as we engage with the poly cannon. Kim, over to you.
