Okay, welcome everyone. Shall we sit and meditate for a few minutes while the other folks arrive? Good.
So relax.
So relax and allow your body to draw you in.
And allow your breath to draw you in.
Pull you into the ground like a magnet pulling in iron filings to the body, to the earth.
And relax and open your heart.
Feel your goodness.
Feel your kindness.
Your meta.
Imagining your loved ones in front of you.
Your friends in front of you.
Knowing how you want them to be happy.
It's natural.
It's our natural love.
If you have a pet or have had pets, include them.
You don't want these dear ones to suffer.
It's natural compassion that we feel.
And we feel it for ourselves as well. We want to be happy. It's not a sin. It's just who we are. We want to be peaceful, contented, safe, comfortable.
And we don't want to suffer.
So you can open your eyes and look around.
Well, the squares here are all the members of our senior sangha.
And extend this meta to them.
Maybe just pick out a square.
I wish that you are happy.
I wish that you're contented today. I wish that you feel safe today, at ease today.
I wish that you don't suffer, particularly from imagined concepts that are unnecessary.
And wishing that for yourself too.
Have a happy day. An easeful day.
That I, through my practice of meditation and wisdom, awareness, that I extend this ease, that I extend my own well-being, my own confidence, and just being.
To my loved ones, to everyone I meet, may I be of benefit, may my practice be of benefit.
To all beings everywhere, may my good vibes ripple out and benefit all beings everywhere.
Okay, thank you.
So welcome, everyone.
Especially newcomers.
And a special welcome to Maria Stratman. Robert can't make it today, so we are blessed to have my good old friend and wise Dharma teacher, Maria Stratman, joining us today.
I knew Maria when she was a hospice chaplain. I was a hospice chaplain about, oh gosh, many years ago.
She's been teaching at IMC for probably 20 years.
And of course, our dear friend and wise teacher Fiona will be teaching here today as well.
So we hope to have a good day.
So I want to begin with a two-part meditation.
So for the first part, if you could resume your meditation posture again
and relax your body again.
And that's it. Don't do anything else.
Just be natural. All you need to do is not be fake.
Just be yourself and sit here. Don't meditate.
Just sitting here without wanting to change anything or trying to do anything or be anything.
Just effortless just being here, being yourself.
Okay, first part is done.
That's the second part too.
The first part is the second part.
Just a simple wakefulness.
I would have thunk, this is it.
But you're already awake. You're awake, aren't you? You're conscious, aren't you, right now?
Just a simple wakefulness.
No special state that we contrive that can't last.
If it can't last, it's not worth much.
Right? You're going to have this amazing experience of calm and brilliance and everything is so vivid.
But that can't last. It's not you. It's a state.
A created state by your effort. But this can last.
This simple awareness is who you are. You're not a rock.
You're not a corpse.
So just be aware without trying to be aware of anything in particular.
The Buddha described eight kinds of consciousnesses that we are aware of.
Naturally aware of the sense perceptions, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and blah, blah, blah, thinking.
We're just naturally aware of them.
Right now you might be aware of my voice, hearing, or sensations in your body.
Or you might notice some light or shadows behind your eyelids, or some thoughts might happen.
Aware of these appearances.
And the seventh consciousness is very interesting.
I forget the way it was described in the sutra, but it's the me.
Me consciousness. Me myself. It might be me. It's me. It's me.
They insulted me, or they praised me, or my success, or my failure, or my material stuff.
All these me's. And I love this because it's in the same equal category to all the others.
So a me appears.
And if we're just relaxed and we just stay right here, comfortable being ourselves.
The rest of the sky, of this simple wakefulness.
An anxiety appears in all kinds of thoughts that accompany that anxiety, like a thought storm.
In these skies.
It doesn't need an antidote. Just a recognition. This is a storm cloud.
This awakeness is still here. This knowing of the storm cloud is still here.
Bigger. The sky is bigger than the storm.
And the storms always pass.
This awareness doesn't prefer.
It's very kind in that way. It doesn't judge.
It's open, vivid, clear.
Like the sky. Like space.
It accommodates whatever is happening.
It's accommodated by awareness just like space.
It accommodates everything is welcome into space.
In a way, this is maybe a teutonic shift, at least in my practice.
A reorientation.
Instead of gaining something.
Attaining something.
Becoming something.
Becoming enlightened.
Becoming Buddha.
Recognizing I already am.
All those things.
I already have this precious, sacred awareness.
All I have to do is be myself.
The funny thing is, if you look for this awareness, if you try to find it, where is it?
Is it to the right? Is it to the left? Is it above? Below?
Is it in your body?
Behind you?
You can't find it.
And we can just rest in that not finding and trust, that emptiness
that is full, completely full of presence.
How nice.
Just to be.
And we can get distracted.
Habitual patterns.
It's okay. We always come back.
No big deal.
What is this awareness?
This empty presence.
Like a light.
It knows. It shines a light. It illuminates sight, sound, smells, tastes, touches, thoughts, afflictions.
All appearances.
Like a movie projector. If you look back at it in your theater, you look back at the movie projector.
You see this light coming out of it. Just a light.
But if you look on the screen, colors, shapes, forms, stories, story after story.
Just rest.
And be the light.
You already are.
Just don't be fake.
And the rest takes care of itself.
And if you get lost in some dream,
just relax. We always come back.
Trust is a big factor here.
Just trust.
Trust yourself.
Okay.
Thank you.
So shall we break up into some small groups?
And I have some suggestions for discussion in your small group.
But the prevailing suggestion is just, I think it would be great for people to hear and for you to share what you know about your own awareness.
What you experience this fundamental quality.
What you know about it, what you recognize about it.
What kind of, what are the qualities that you, how could you describe this to each other?
And how does it help you?
Does this practice of just being aware or recognizing,
does it help you in some way? Does it benefit you?
And does it benefit others?
Does your practice of being awareness benefit others?
Is that pretty much, Joe, what I, what my prompts were?
Maybe you could say them.
I'll put them in the chat.
All right.
How long do you want the breakouts to be?
Take 20 minutes.
Oh, so the prompts are in the chat.
Good. See you.
See you in a little while.
Have a great, great discussion about the sacred awareness.
I welcome you all back.
And I hope you had a good discussion.
And I know I would love to hear, you can hear your discussion.
We just heard our own discussion.
And I know that I would love to hear something about your discussion.
And I'm sure everyone else would.
So if you would be so kind, a few of you, share what, what was,
what you talked about.
I'll go. Hello.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Oh, okay. Great. Great.
Yeah.
It's just nice to sit with everyone, not the resting part that you did, David.
And then the meditation.
You started with the, you know, awareness being the space that accommodates.
So we were talking about that, you know, in the group about what is awareness.
And then our common thread among the four of us was that the story that comes up.
So I just brought that out to the, you know, the teachings that they have,
the form and formless.
So the story, I mean, the awareness is the formless.
But I, you know, I hate to admit how rare it is that, you know, I am like that.
And then there is no agency here that, you know, chooses that.
But it just happens.
Hopefully, you know, I become more accident prone.
The more I sit, the more I can see it.
So just like the story of, you know, seeing a bird, you know, then the awareness comes
in and then probably, you know, the story kicks in that if I probably shouldn't be going
that way, maybe the bird will poop or something or many other things.
So it's always like that.
It's hard to, you know, stay with the awareness.
Always the form comes in as a story.
So I mean, in some going into the esoteric term in there, it's just like the formless
or the space or awareness, you can describe it as a God and then, but, you know,
I'm in the human realm and it shows up itself sometimes.
Hopefully, you know, it shows up more by practicing.
But it's just flowing between the form and formless.
And then there is no agency here.
Somebody was mentioning that, you know, it's fork in the road, but I don't think I can choose
that fork in the road and to stay with this road.
It just does it based on the causes and conditions.
Anyway, I said, I said, thank you.
That's wonderful.
Thank you.
I'll try this on this idea anyhow.
Yeah, yeah, please.
So there's a, you see a rose and you accept you see the rose.
When you say try this on, I'm sorry.
I mean, is it like me that I need to try this on?
There is no, I hear that control.
Go ahead.
Sorry, go ahead.
All right.
Thank you.
So there's a rose.
Yes.
Then there's a thought about the rose.
Yes.
Let it be that will change into something else.
Maybe a sound and then a thought about a sound and then maybe a story will come up about
what my brother-in-law said to me yesterday and then let that be.
That's the idea. It's not creating some special state.
That's what the clinging, the grasping, when the grasping comes in to a special state to
make something or to get rid of something, that's when it gets problematic.
So, but, you know, when the grasping or the fear or anything like that comes in, that
space is gone.
You know, the fear comes in, that's it takes up the whole space.
If you don't have a definition of the space, if it narrows into anger, that's it.
That's all there is.
It's all there is.
You aren't gone if you're still awake.
You're not gone if you get lost in the story.
Yes.
That's what happens usually.
I mean, you know, the meditation, sitting and practicing is great to, you know, realize
those moments of awareness and just like I think you were sharing about the, you know,
the dog, you can just throw the bone to me in the middle of the way I run to catch the
bone.
But maybe, you know, after a few half the way I can realize, oh darn, I don't need to
go after that.
Okay.
Yeah, that's helpful.
Yeah.
Thank you.
But I mean, yeah, thank you.
Someone else, please.
One of the things that has come up for me as I have reflected on awareness is that I
think that at least for me, using the term awareness suggests a certain mental state
or mental formation, if you will.
And I find it more helpful to use the term aware in to suggest that it is a dynamic process
that is not something, that it is not something, that it is a process.
Beautiful.
Thank you.
Someone else?
Yeah.
So, Andrea Fela teaches a technique involving, I call it awareness of awareness, and she
described like, how do I know, how do I know I'm aware?
And she gave an analogy of being in a dark room, and all of a sudden the light comes
on.
And you can see things.
And you turn around and you try to find where the light is coming from, but in this room
you can't figure out where it's coming from, but you can see things.
And so, if you can see things, then the light is on.
That's how you know the light is on, because you can see things.
And so, the idea being that if I know something, then I'm aware.
Even if I'm in a bad mental state, if I know I'm in a bad mental state, then I'm aware.
Anyway, that's what I took from it anyway.
Great.
Thank you.
That's wonderful.
We are self-illuminated.
The Buddha's, the final words is he was dying.
It wasn't get rid of this and get that.
It was be the light.
Just be the light.
And we are the light.
If the light comes from nowhere, it just is, but it illuminates everything.
These are beautiful comments.
Anyone else?
Someone else, please?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Our group was pondering a little the image of the projector and the screen.
And we had some various thoughts and our explanations of it for ourselves.
So, I was going to ask if you'd say more about that.
But then I thought of the example and as well, the example one member of the group gave that
thought was so powerful was feeling so swept away by so much misery from world conditions
to immediate conditions of her friends and family and aging and anyway, lots.
We don't need elaborations of all the forms that we see in our life.
But this person was saying she came, she realized by giving that label of grieving to her experience
that it changed something in a good way and powerful way.
Can you make a connection between the projector and the screen?
Well, let's see.
So, the experience is, say, anger or grieving or anxiety or, you know, and the light sees
the anxiety.
There's anxiety here.
It's without, you know, and without conceptualizing it or conceptualizing it.
It doesn't matter.
And just being with that, being with the light and being with whatever is being
shown and having some sense that it's just this simple awakeness.
And that's what this life is.
It's just this simple waitfulness and it keeps changing.
The story on the screen keeps changing and it might stay in a battle for a long time,
but eventually the battle will change.
But the trust, not that it's going to change for the better, you know, just the trust.
The trust in being with, as Fred said, a wearing, being with a wearing.
But that's the vital point.
The vital point is not the grief.
The vital point is not the anger.
The vital point is not, but everything is included.
The vital point is the awareness.
Does that make sense?
That's a response, yeah.
Yan Kuei-Chuan.
Hello there, everybody.
This is my first time in the Sangha and thank you for the prompts in advance.
I wanted to, it's quite intriguing the part that points to is awareness in your body or outside the body.
And oftentimes I experience awareness through the six sense stores very much coming from within this body mind.
But then the question prompted me to have the possibility, experience the possibility of awareness outside or external,
there, not just coming from within, through this.
Then it got me thinking about self, not the selfing that happens of my, this awareness being here and I own this awareness.
And so I was just curious if you could speak a little bit more to that sense of awareness outside the body.
And then I start to envision outside, here is the window, outside the space, is the space sentient or alive, the trees, the sky,
what is this awareness about now?
And you were just talking about the object being known, whether it's sadness, anxiety, whatever.
And there's the, that which knows, and also being contemplating the relationship between the two.
Yeah, but it's not true.
It's not true. Yeah. And then it becomes just like being.
When there is a, when there's that which knows, then it becomes a getting or the.
So I was like, wait, and so it starts to shift. Yeah.
So it's just, it's just being, it's just knowing, it's just a wearing, and it is boundless.
It's not in the body or outside the body. It has no, it has no edges.
Yeah.
You can't find it. It's just is, you can't grasp it. It's ungraspable.
It's whatever is, it's, it's whatever is on the screen at the time.
Yet it's empty. So the screen can flow, can just keep flowing.
But yeah, it's boundless to the right, boundless to the left, boundless above you, boundless below you, boundless in front of you, boundless behind you there.
It's like the sky.
And then whatever clouds or the moon or whatever comes into the sky.
And then passes through the sky.
I'm not sure I'm answering your question.
Yeah, maybe the question more is, I hear what you're saying and sometimes this sometimes that can be experienced.
I want to say most of the times, the awareness is quite bounded awareness is the eye.
So, you know, it doesn't matter.
Just know that that's what's happening.
It doesn't matter.
I was talking to a small group the other day about how I'm on this board of directors.
And, and I'm kind of responsible for this situation, this board and, and somebody I talked to somebody about some, some real significant issues that might be arising.
And with this situation.
And then so I started, I sat, I was sitting later, much much later, I was sitting in it, and it started to come to me and like, you know, the future and what how can I fix this and what can be done and anxiety and
all those things and then I realized I had to.
I don't have to do anything.
Just how wonderful this is all so wonderful. All this is happening.
I just let it be all this is happening.
All this wondering about the future and worrying and all.
How wonderful.
How alive.
There's one great master's there's a patrol Rinpoche, I think seventh or eighth century century.
And he, he talked about how strong emotions are such a support for awareness, because they enliven us they energize us.
So we can welcome them we can welcome everything.
I felt so alive with all that anxiety.
And of course, you know, when you are open to it and accept it and appreciate it and trust, trust this simple beingness.
Because the being itself is so peaceful and so equanimous and so sublime.
So, so content one of the questions I asked him the prompt was,
is this simple awareness enough through all of the permutations of our experience this awareness that is always here through every through all of the ups and down to all of the waves all of the storms, all of the simplicity.
Is this simple enough?
We trust that.
I would like to insert something here and that is that Sadau Utangenea has a book entitled awareness alone is not enough.
And I, I haven't had a chance to read it yet but the title intrigues me.
He is suggesting that there is something beyond awareness.
And I think it is what he refers to as wisdom.
Great.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Okay, anyone else one more maybe.
Is there one more.
Okay.
Well, this has been a wonderful discussion.
And maybe we'll take a 10 minute break and then we'll hear from
Maria Scratman my dear friend and wonderful Dharma teacher when we come back.
So, well, hello friends that's really delightful to be here.
I mean that delightful.
I'm aware of delight.
This is, this is, this is an important thing that I want to talk about.
So, so I'm going to put an emphasis on awareness as knowing.
I want us to think of the knowing part of awareness.
Now, it's a, it's a specific kind of registering the experience.
You know, but I know I'm sitting on this chair and we all know that we're sitting
or standing wherever we are.
But until we put our awareness there, we don't actually know it.
You know, it's, it's sort of given.
Of course, I know that I'm sitting, but until we put our awareness there,
oh yeah, oh yeah, now, and then I start noticing things about the sitting.
So, so it's a knowing that's just a raw knowing.
Awareness is not attached to what it means or what it says or what the name is.
It's just a knowing that is independent of what we think it means.
It's independent of what we think about it.
It's just, oh yeah, check, something, something is here.
Now, there are lots of qualities that we can be aware of,
but it is this quality of knowing, registering.
Now, what we know about it, but just the fact that we, ah, this, right,
I noticed delight.
I noticed my hands waving in the air.
I don't have to put meaning to what those hands waving in the air is,
but I noticed the movement, the coolness.
Okay, so, so it is not directed.
It is just, what am I noting?
What am I noting?
So I'm going to read you a quote.
The quote is from Andrew Alinsky's book.
I'll put it in the chat just in case you're interested in that.
So, oh, I'm not able to do that.
If I send it to Joe, can I send it to Joe?
Yeah.
I'm not quite sure.
Maybe later.
We can send it out later too.
Okay.
All right.
So I've sent it to you, David.
Okay.
So it's called untangling self is the name of the book.
And if you're so inclined, it's a wonderful book.
So this is a quote.
Every moment of mindfulness is also a moment of equanimity.
It is not a disengagement from the object of awareness,
but rather the full and complete engagement with it.
It is engaging with the breath or with a feeling tone
or with a thought without also either wanting it to stay
or wanting it to be different than it is.
Engagement, total engagement with whatever we're aware of
without wanting it to be other than it is.
Now, in our real world, that seems quite difficult,
but it is, in fact, the practice.
So if we think this kind of put this knowing in the context
of the five aggregates, which are common to every experience.
So there's the materiality of the experience.
You know, there's a thing here.
Whoops.
And now I can experience coffee on my keyboard,
which I will quickly wrap up.
So there is the thing, the materiality, the touch, taste, sound.
There is the feeling tone, pleasant or unpleasant.
There is the perception, which has a conceptual note to it,
where I look at this and now I say it's a cup,
which is attached with an idea.
And then there's mental formations.
What I think about the cup, the cup is warm, the cup is cold,
the cup is pretty, the cup is obsolete.
Whatever I think about it, then is mental formations.
And then there is awareness.
Now, sometimes we think of awareness as being consciousness
or, and we apply all sorts of noun words to awareness.
But I really liked what Fred said about awareness.
I think of awareness as more of a verb,
like seeing awareness is, is a process.
And it is, it's what's happening in the moment.
And it is not tied to perception and mental formations
or the materiality of it, but it involves those.
Okay.
So all of those aspects of experience are possible or are present.
And what's true of humans is that we tend to put a lot of emphasis
on the, what we think about something.
We establish meaning for what we notice, right?
If I, if I notice my hands waving, it must mean that something about me,
something about my hands, something about my intentions,
but really it's just the hands are waving.
And so as close as we can get to the raw experience,
the raw experience and not what we think about that experience,
the closer we are to what we mean by awareness.
It's just that it's not more than that.
So when we look at awareness as a series of mind moments,
because it's not tied to a story or a meaning
or what we think about it, but it's just this, just this, just this.
If we think of awareness as just a series of mind moments,
then we're closer to what we mean by awareness.
It's the transient moments of knowing, transient moments.
It's a total embracing of the concept of impermanence.
It comes and it's goes.
Awareness also comes and goes.
And what we are aware of comes and goes.
An object is known or felt or responded to emotionally.
And then the event is over.
Whatever just happened happened and it's over.
And whatever is happening now just happened.
It's a series of rapidly changing mind moments that is awareness.
It's only our desire to attach meaning to things
that makes us think of awareness as continuous.
It was convenient to think of awareness as continuously
because we sort of equate it with consciousness.
This means I'm alive.
And like a rapidly changing movie, the quicker it moves,
the less aware we are of the individual frames of that movie,
thinking in the film sense and not the digital sense here.
And yet every moment is just this moment.
Every awareness is just this.
So I'm going to list some qualities of awareness
that might make this more sensible.
First of all, awareness is entirely contingent.
I can't be aware of yesterday and I can't be aware of tomorrow
to be extreme.
Now, I can be aware of and that's an important part of some of awareness.
Awareness is always aware of.
It's not independent of what we're aware of.
That's kind of an important fact.
It's not like awareness is sitting over in the corner
or in some segment of my brain or some segment of my consciousness.
I'm aware of something.
I'm aware of my attitude.
I'm aware of the temperature.
I'm aware of what I'm thinking.
I'm aware of where my feet are, but it's all of something.
So then if I say a wearing of something is entirely contingent,
it means that what I'm aware of is dependent on what the conditions are now.
The conditions in this moment.
Now, I can be aware of many things within this moment, many views,
many conditions in this moment, but I can't be aware of all of them.
The conditions of this moment, I can place my attention somewhere
like I'm sitting in the chair and I may know that I have things behind me,
but unless I look at them, I have some sensory awareness.
I don't know that they're there.
I just kind of remember them.
I have them tucked away as data in my brain.
But as soon as I look at them, then I say, ah, and then I name them, right?
Oh, this is a hand.
Now, I could have said this is skin,
but I've chosen a larger piece and said it's a hand.
I could have said this is a body.
So that the awareness is kind of chosen.
Whether I choose to look small or large, it's a choosing of what I'm aware of.
That makes awareness not only a condition of the experience,
but also something over which I can exercise some effect.
Let's think about what that might mean.
The third thing I want to say about awareness is that an object,
the awareness of an object is always influenced by some sort of attitude
or emotional response.
Now, I'm going to think about that.
The awareness of an object is influenced.
The most common influence is what's my mind state.
What I notice is going to be somewhat dependent on my energy is jagged.
So I'm not going to land on anything.
So my awareness is also going to have this quality of jaggedness.
If I'm sitting in quiet meditation and I'm becoming more and more and more still,
there's going to be a quality of stillness in the attitude of my mind.
And my awareness is able to land more softly.
It's able to notice things maybe that are more subtle as opposed to the jagged energy,
which requires me to move quickly around my consciousness.
Does this make sense to you?
The quality of awareness is conditioned by our mind state,
by the conditions that we find around us,
and in turn, our awareness conditions the next moment.
So if I am aware of my attitude of mind, which may be open or closed,
but I also know that if my attitude is open, I'm able to take in more.
And if it's closed, my mind is running down a rut.
So if I can notice that, what I call running down a rut might also be high focus.
Oh, so there's an attitude here that's influencing whether my awareness is focused or in a rut.
All of these ways of describing conditions are mental formations.
It's a place we're really comfortable thinking about things.
I'm comfortable thinking about my experience.
It's a habit with me.
I'm very used to that.
Stepping back and putting more emphasis on the aggregate of awareness has attended me to pull me out of what I think about the experience
and move me closer to just the raw experience of awareness.
Just this.
Not what I think about it.
Perception, naming, naming my attitude, naming my cup, naming moisture on my keyboard,
naming sets up a condition that alters my awareness and what I'm next aware of.
Perception interprets.
This is good.
This is bad.
I like this.
I don't like this.
This is unpleasant.
But the raw experience, the just direct knowing can be unpleasant, pleasant.
Whatever tends to take me out of forming meaning and relationships and into the story is something that I am now cultivating to help me get closer to this is actually what's happening.
It moves me away from the mind habits, the tendencies of my mind to look at things a certain way.
It allows me to just say, this is what's happening.
It leads me to a place of clear seeing when I use the awareness with a kind of open comb and not a fine tooth comb.
Does that make sense?
There's a fluidity here that we can actually not control so much as be aware of so that we don't become locked in.
This is how I experience my experience.
Rather we can say, this is the person who is experiencing what I'm experiencing and it shifts the attention from it should be this way to this is how it is.
This is how it is.
And in this is how it is, is found freedom.
I'm not trying to lock it into a pattern, I'm not allowing it to lock into a pattern.
I'm saying, okay, pattern, I see pattern.
It's what David called just being, just being.
When I'm aware of my mind state.
I can say, oh, this is what's happening now, and I can like it or not like it, it can be pleasant or unpleasant.
So for example, if I say, I notice that ill will is present.
This was something that actually happened to me a week ago that I've given a great deal of thought to so I apologize if anybody's already heard the story but in, I was talking to my husband and I was aware of just this my asthma of ill will.
I could just feel the girl feeling the energy was just really negative.
And I have a series of Dharma tools I use so the first thing was to remind myself that first I noticed it right so the awareness of the negativity and the ill will.
And I reminded myself this is not about him, this is this is just the awareness of your bad mood.
Notice that the aversion to it.
The struggle to not be aversive to aversion.
I feel the struggle.
Now this is all happening while we're trying to have a conversation.
So, not a lot of thinking just a lot of noticing. And then as I did that I said so one of my other Dharma tools is to think what's my intention in this moment and I recall my intention to be kind to my husband.
And there was a voice that came up and said, Oh, yeah, well, okay, that's not actually effective right now.
And I realized that that the only way to deal with aversion to aversion was to just let it be there.
Not to so much welcome as a say unpleasant unpleasant I reverted to unpleasant. And you know the Buddha had a series of instructions on how to deal with it well and it goes through all the, it's the similar step you know you take these little Dharma tricks, and then when all else fails, you just say,
you bite down, you bite your tongue, right. So that's what I did. I realized that despite my intention.
Anything I did was going to be tainted by this mind state, this ill will that was present, and the struggle against it was making it stronger. And so I literally bit my tongue and sat there.
And nothing, I will do nothing in this moment, which is, you know, the absence of something is also something but it was the best I could do in that moment it was the only skillful thing I could find to do to just bite my tongue, and, and stop the story,
the struggle, just stop a literal stopping. It isn't stopping an action so much as it is adopting the place of mental stability.
Okay, just saying, I'm going to settle for just this moment can't go on forever I'm in a conversation, but for just this moment I'm going to settle. And at that moment, at that very moment I was looking I looked out the window, and some cedar
wax wings came in there. One of my favorite birds are beautiful they have painted faces. And once a year for two or three days, a flock of cedar wax wings comes in and cleans out the pirate camp that pushes below my window.
Those cedar wax wings chose that moment to show up. And I experienced a moment of delight in the midst of this my asthma of ill will, there was a moment of delight.
And I said, Oh, the cedar wax wings are here.
My husband heard me say the cedar wax wings are here, and he rushed over to the window also. And, and the spell was broken. It's not that I did anything, it was actually doing nothing.
But embracing the wisdom of impermanence that it comes and goes. It's very hard to remember that when you're in the midst of a toxic attitude of grieving attitude.
No matter what you name that attitude, as long as you're aware of some quality that allows you to be present.
And so it is just here, just here.
And then I can shift my awareness to what else can I be aware of.
It's that shifting. What else can I see here.
Just stop pointedly looking in some place and using the quality of awareness to just be just be.
We only have one shot at this moment.
We should use it wisely.
So those are my thoughts.
We would I'd like to do is it give you an opportunity to sort of explore these ideas within a group.
And so what I suggest, let me see what can I
What I suggest is that you look at the difference between perception and awareness and see what can unfold there for you. What is the difference between perception and awareness.
These are words that have meaning for everybody that are a little different.
So maybe exploring them will help arrive at this place of how, how, how is awareness allowing me to just be in this moment and see clearly. What does that mean in terms of just thisness, just the experience of here's what's present.
I am what present. So, so why don't you just explore that for a bit. What's the difference between perception and awareness. And how can I use that. How do I see that awareness as a piece that leads to wisdom.
Okay.
Joe, can you break aside.
David, you're muted.
Thank you, Freda.
So,
it's always so wonderful to hear Fiona's voice.
So, please.
Fiona, you're muted.
Thank you. Thank you.
Without Freda.
So,
maybe you just settle a little bit. There's been a lot of sharing and beautiful words, but maybe just have a moment.
We can be quiet.
Sort of re regroup.
Just
feel we're back in our seat.
We're gathering in quiet.
We had spoken about this experience of, you know, the whirlwind of being caught up in strong emotion.
This was anger, how it affects
everything. You know, if we just see that, if we just, if we don't even recognize we're caught.
And to recognize, oh, this is, this is what's happening. And it's big.
But having, being able to name and see it,
recognize, and then opening up to actually being open to recognizing what else is here
as well.
And I had just shared in our small group,
someone earlier had talked about grief,
also very strong emotion.
I had shared that that had been a familiar visitor in my life these last few years.
Changing over time, but very strong in the early years.
Being a widow.
And
I remember one day in the early months after losing my husband,
I, I caught myself whistling.
And I was whistling a happy tune.
And I thought, wow.
This is amazing. This too.
It didn't spell my overall journey through grief, but I could hold this too.
I could feel delight as well as loss.
And I think this awareness, our sense of being able to acknowledge and open up and relax.
What else?
What else is here?
What can I be present for and hold?
Just, I wanted to read, our senior saga has been reading a book for aging.
And as a counterbalance to the grace in aging, I had also been reading a book by Susan Moon,
who's a lay Zen Dharma teacher and author.
And her book, This is Getting Old.
And it's a delightful collection of essays.
A fair amount of humor and self-deprecation and honesty.
You know, the stage of life.
Look at this.
But the last chapter really touched me and I,
I hope it's okay if I can share and read this.
Thankful to Susan Moon.
And I used to read stories to my husband in bed.
I love to read stories to my son.
And then we got into a period of time where before bed,
my husband wanted me to read out loud.
So maybe this is sort of a midday bedtime story.
This is in her last chapter called This Vast Life.
And in the beginning, she talks about the experience of being with her two-year-old grandson,
who's just aware and present.
Every moment is fresh and she can just slow down and be with him.
And then visiting an elder friend in his 80s, a Dominican, I mean a Benedictine monk,
who also studied Zen and meditated.
His life was very simple and spent much of his time just really wanting to rest in awareness.
As he would sit in his small apartment with his casket there in his apartment.
Just present with his final home in that, the body's final home in his casket.
So here's the last couple of paragraphs of her book and this chapter, The Vast Life.
In between the toddler and that old man is a span of over 80 years and most of us in those intervening decades
tangle ourselves up in knots over the things we don't have that we want
and the things we have that we don't want.
We run around trying to fix things in our personal lives and in the life of the planet.
It's a good thing we do because it's actually our responsibility to fix things.
We need to fix the plumbing, for example.
The toddler and the old monk aren't fixing the plumbing.
They need us to take care of them, but we need them too.
To remind us that everything is already taken care of.
I like to think about how we are completely held by the atmosphere in a literal way.
The air that surrounds each of our bodies that flows in and out of our lungs is not nothing.
It's thick with molecules and it fills up all the gaps and cracks between us
and the other bodies and objects around us.
The furniture, the walls of the room, the trees outside, the buildings.
There's no empty space.
The air is fluid making room for us so that each of us inhabits a nook that is exactly our size and shape.
The air kindly moves with us when we move.
It's like those soft rocks you can find on the beaches of Northern California
that have tiny mollusks living inside them in the holes they made for themselves.
We're all connected, molecule to molecule.
I'm held by everything that's not to me.
She goes on to talk about her retreat by the ocean and listening to the ocean waves.
The constancy, the coming and going.
And then the constancy of our breath, coming and going.
This constant presence of the breath in this body, in this life.
She says, the sound of the ocean is the sound of time passing.
The sound of one moment giving way to the next.
Each wave, each moment is a gate that I pass through into the next moment.
And even if I'm not sitting by the ocean, one wave of my life is still followed immediately by the next.
With no completely quiet place in between.
I love the vow.
Dharma gates are boundless. I vow to enter them.
I keep giving myself away to the next moment and the next moment receives me.
I just have to step through.
I love the vow.
Dharma gates are boundless.
I vow to enter them.
I keep giving myself away to the next moment and the next moment receives me.
I just have to step through.
So, think this gift of time in our life now.
Just, we have this moment, this time, to open to this life.
To open and relax and really see or acknowledge that we are held, that we are held in awareness and that we are connected.
Every molecule holds us, we are connected.
And we are entering tomorrow Earth Day, this sense of honoring that bird at the window, that breeze, this earth, this planet, this nature, that we are so intrinsically part of.
We can relax and open and feel blessed and share this blessing with all beings, known and unknown.
So, thank you all for this time together and our sharing and this sangha. May you all be blessed.
If you'd like to unmute and say goodbye, please do.
Thank you so much. It's been good. What is the name of the book?
Yeah, the name of the book, Fiona. This is getting old.
Thank you.
Thank all of you. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
Bye.
Thank you, Joe, again.
Yes, we are so appreciate you, Joe, you make our lives so easy. It's such a luxury.
Thank you. See you next time.
And thank you, Maria. Thank you so much.
Great to have you.
You're muted. Maria, you're muted.
Thank you for having me. It was wonderful to see you and to see everyone and to be part of the song. God, thank you.
Be well.
