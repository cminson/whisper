The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Delighted to be with all of you tonight.
My name is Dawn Neal. A lot of you already know me.
I substitute semi-regularly for a happy hour.
And tonight I'm just going to offer a brief reflection.
It's kind of based on, loosely based on a kind of Buddhist text
that we don't hear a lot about in the Western Buddhist scene.
It's one that's used a lot in Asian countries.
It's called the paritta text.
And the book of paritta is a book of protection.
And it's kind of more in the sort of folk understanding of Buddhism in some of the Asian cultures.
And in that book of protective chants, metta is one of them.
And it's supposed to offer protection both physically and relationally.
And I'm not going to go into it any more than that, except to say that at a certain point in my own journey of practicing and teaching meditation,
I got interested to see how much the protective and healing capacities of metta lined up scientifically with what the text said.
So this is a brief reflection on the contemporary healing power of loving kindness of metta.
So there is some evidence for that. I'm sure you've heard Nikki talk about this at certain points.
And my kind of first personal interface with this was when I was working at chronic pain clinics as a meditation teacher for many years, I taught metta meditation, loving kindness meditation.
And I also taught mindfulness meditation to people suffering from chronic pain.
And I had a wonderful boss, Greg, and he taught me how pain is actually a multi-layered phenomenon.
Some of you probably know this, but there's the physical experience of the pain and the nervous system, and that is definitely real.
And there's also the affective emotional relationship we have to the pain.
And as all of you know, most of the time, almost all of us don't like it.
There's a lot of aversion to it. There's often anxiety, as well as aversion. So there's resistance and aversion.
And as it turns out, it is measurable that aversion, particularly anxiety and resistance, make the felt sense of pain worse.
And people can actually get stuck in this feedback loop. I'm averse to it, it makes it worse, and I get more diverse to it, I'm scared of it, makes it worse, and it cycles and cycles and cycles.
And one of the reasons that he hired me is that shifting the anxiety and shifting from an attitude of resistance to an attitude of kind regard can actually be a really powerful medicine for the felt sense of the pain itself.
It doesn't change the underlying biomechanisms like an impinged nerve, for example, but it changes the person's felt experience of it, which is pretty profound, right?
And I actually saw this happen when I was working at this clinic.
So that's one anecdote. And then another anecdote has to do with the interpersonal capacity for the healing power of Metta.
And this is another, again, sort of more an indirect physical relationship.
So around 2012, 2013 or so, I ended up doing a lot of sort of field of literature review of the science of loving kindness at the time, and I was particularly interested in its capacity to protect against burnout and empathy fatigue.
I'm a chaplain, I knew at that point that I was studying to become a chaplain, so I had a very personal interest in this.
And what I discovered in the process of the research was some unrelated stuff to that, the tangentially related, but deeply related to the question of the healing power of Metta.
One is that some studies showed that physicians, when they expressed and felt kindness towards a patient who was experiencing isolation and discomfort, not only did the patient report feeling less anxiety and less discomfort, the physician reported it too.
So this is a profound thing to think about, right, like, not only does the recipient of expressed kindness feel better, but the person offering the kindness feels better.
Another bit around those studies was this kind of kind presence on the back part of a physician.
Let's say two minutes in a patient-position interaction was actually correlated with better patient outcomes.
And that is interesting, right, and they hypothesized, and I don't think there was proof of this, but they hypothesized there were two mechanisms this worked by.
One is that the patient felt more comfortable naming all of their symptoms to the doctor, so there was a possibility of a more accurate diagnosis.
And the second was that the patients became more compliant, and this was documented.
In other words, they followed the medical protocol more faithfully, which is a big deal in medicine. Like, most of us know what we're supposed to do. Not all of us actually do it, right?
And there was something about the warmth and connection and trust of the doctor-patient relationship when kindness and presence came in that improved the patient's motivation and stick-to-itiveness to actually do this.
So, as a neurobiologist, I looked into recently said, this is Dr. Feldman Barrett, who we prefer seeing as Lisa.
The best thing for a human nervous system is another human, right? If that positive kind regard is there. It's really quite beautiful.
So this is also true of our own kind regard for ourselves.
We can treat ourselves better, and I know this has been personally true for me. When I was younger, I used to think, oh, I've got to ratchet down and make myself do this.
And there was sort of this internal little bit of tightness, even harshness, that I felt like if I didn't have that, it wouldn't motivate me to do what I needed to do.
Well, some studies have shown, and certainly has been true in my own experience, that actually being kind, truly kind to the present and future self has been a much better motivator than that harshness.
And that's particularly true around cultivating healthy habits, personally and interpersonally, wholesome habits in Buddhist language.
And the last thing I'll say about this is, some studies even suggest, and this is where I'm careful about the science, because it takes a lot of science to prove anything, right?
But some studies have suggested improved body function, such as inflammation and immune system function, through actual saliva samples.
And that is after a number of weeks of consistent loving kindness meditation.
And in particular, inflammation, if inflammation was correlated with difficult early childhood or even adolescent experiences, that's one of the things that would go down.
So, as it's often said, the benefits of offering method touch the giver of metaphors, regardless of where we're offering it.
And these little anecdotes, I'm not offering them as a proof or as an argument, but just as possibilities to tap into the healing potential that meta appears to have.
It's certainly had it in my life.
And as all of those words said, the invitation now is to invite yourselves to sit back, turn it off any beeping, buzzing, blurting, or otherwise annoying interrupting technology alerts.
And settle back into meditation.
My apologies, I made you not, you can unmute yourself, Marianne, if you'd like to.
You had a question your hand was up.
Maybe that was an accident.
Can everyone hear me okay just give a thumbs up. Yes, okay, great.
So I am removing the capacity. Oh, Marianne, yes.
I just wanted to say it seems like the video is also turned off so we can't turn our videos back on.
That's the message I'm getting just fix that I don't remember clicking that setting but maybe.
Okay, hello, welcome to turn your video on.
Thank you so much.
And.
Oh, it's so nice to see more people see that slow.
Zoom tips are welcome zoom.
Like, yeah, I can do it but I'm not an expert. Let's just say that.
So,
I am taking off the ability for people to unmute themselves just to keep the silence in case people come in by accident, unmuted.
I will turn all that back on when the meditation is over. It's just to keep our container very.
Quiet and safe.
We need to settle back, soften your eyes.
Maybe soften your tongue.
And if it's helpful to close your eyes and or turn away from the screen for now.
The invitation is also to do that to take care of yourself.
It can be helpful to start by taking one or two intentional breaths.
A little bit longer and slower on the exhale.
Inviting this body to relax.
His heart to relax.
Inviting your mind to relax.
And then allowing the breathing to return to normal natural whatever it wants to be.
The inviting awareness mindfulness.
Infuse this body and mind.
Inviting the intention of a sense of kindness to infuse the awareness, the heart, body and mind.
Allowing yourself to settle just as you are.
Perhaps settling with the breath.
That's a good meditation focus for you.
Let the sensations of the body.
Even with the sound.
Really setting the abhikana, the resolve to cultivate the intention of kind regard.
Perhaps even a kind gaze, inner gaze.
Being with the felt experience of the body.
With kindness.
That's a good meditation focus.
And then turning to the changes, sensation, breath.
In the moment.
Then collecting the attention.
The core of your body perhaps, the center of the chest.
Or more broadly, all of the viscera.
Noticing the feeling in the heart.
Calling to mind.
Particularly endearing being.
A puppy dog, a kitten.
A young child.
Someone or something easy to feel kindness.
Love, tenderness or friendliness towards.
An image of this being.
A felt sense of them as if they're in the room with you.
Or even just the concept, the idea of them.
That brings an internal smile to your lips.
And to your heart.
And then imagining.
Making a gesture of offering out of your heart to them.
Smiling at them.
Showing kindness through your eyes.
Or even saying a word of kindness or to me.
Allowing the kindness.
The intention of metta.
To move outwards on your out breath perhaps.
Perhaps imagining them receiving this with a smile, a sparkle in the eye, a felt sense of resonance.
And feeling in to how that feels.
Allowing the heart to open.
It can be helpful if you wish to place a hand on your heart.
Or perhaps bring a small smile to your lips.
And perhaps whatever these words work for you, letting go of whatever these words don't.
Radiating a sense of kindness that includes them.
And also includes you.
Starting from the heart center.
Breathing out.
Read eating kindness.
The out breath.
Breathing in receiving.
Letting go of this image and focusing now.
When radiating kindness from the heart.
Perhaps luminous light.
Through all the muscles and flesh and bone of this body.
Perhaps a sense of sensation before the relaxation.
Through all of the matter of this body.
Radiating.
Even an intention, movement of intention.
Through all the cells.
All the way out to the skin, including the skin.
Sense of suffusing and fusing.
If it's helpful.
Perhaps dropping in words in your own language.
Perhaps on the out breath or in your own rhythm or not at all.
There are some that I use.
Be happy.
Healthy.
Safe.
Be peaceful.
Useful.
Breathing.
Allowing words if you wish to use them to focus.
Strengthen.
The intention of metta.
Kindness.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
Allowing the metta, the kind intentions to radiate out.
Out from beyond.
Out to beyond the body.
Could be humble.
Just a little bit of metta beyond the skin.
Radiating like heat.
Metta feels strong and radiant like a star.
Moving outwards.
Luminous in all directions.
Boundless in any case.
No boundary.
Radiating.
Suffusing.
Metta.
Kindness.
In all directions.
Thoughts arise.
Including them.
Narrating kindness.
Sensations arise.
Including them.
There's a fusion of kindness.
There's a fusion of kindness and kindness.
There's a fusion of kindness and kindness.
Be happy.
Be peaceful.
Be peaceful.
Be free.
Be peaceful.
Be peaceful.
Be peaceful.
If it feels right to you, including other beings with bodies.
In this field of metta.
Allowing it to spread outwards.
Outwards and unbounded.
It's near or far.
It wants to go this meditation.
From time to time, noticing the effect of cultivating this beautiful intention.
In the body.
Noticing the essence of relaxation.
Rippling, tingling.
Rhythm, breath.
Noticing any sense of sweetness.
Flavor of metta.
Or even imagining the scent of a beautiful flower pervading.
Infusing all of experience.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
If the mind moves elsewhere.
Welcoming attention back with kindness.
This too is cultivating metta.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Noticing any loving, kind, happy feelings or thoughts.
And appreciating the intention beneath them.
Noticing any difficult, distracted or dry thoughts.
And offering kindness as the intention beneath them.
Ripping all thoughts all together.
And simply radiating.
And resting in kindness.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
Rippling, tingling.
And tuning into, attuning to the boundless quality of the mind and heart.
However near or far the Mehta is spread, allowing recognizing awareness and Mehta are fused together and intertwined.
Mehta is vast, allowing vastness of awareness.
Mehta is close, steeped in the body or mind, allowing that.
It's diffuse, allowing that.
But letting go of the intention of generating anything.
And resting in the field of awareness.
And allowing with kind regard, anything that comes and goes.
As well as the stomachs.
As well as the stomachs.
And while you're resting in this kind regard.
Now turning the attention to this moment.
This body and contemplating the moment.
How to express this kindness.
How to allow this kindness to suffuse.
In body, heart, speech, mind.
And not sitting in meditation, still inviting possibility one way, no big way, just one way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Before we break silence friends, the invitation is if your video is off and you feel comfortable turning it on to turn it on.
And to take a moment and gaze at your fellow practitioners, your Sangha.
Maybe even scrolling through gallery view if it's easy and just offer a silent moment of Mehta.
To each of your practitioner friends, colleagues, Sangha here.
Seeing or unseen.
Just to the names or the tiles if there's no video and sign.
Each of your offering is kind, friendly wishes to your Sangha mates.
Knowing, receiving.
Each person on this call, each person in this Zoom room is offering the same thing to you.
Thank you for your practice.
Seeing your tile.
Maybe you should log off and log on again.
So anyone who wants to share about the meditation, please either you can put it in the chat if you like, or raise your zoom hand.
Eric is right to you.
Jerry, go ahead please.
So thank you and thank you for a great meditation and it's helpful to, it's very helpful to sort of, it actually relaxes you.
I agree with the neuroscience that you were talking about, I'm familiar with that.
And I agree with the scientific ratus and such you mentioned in terms of the anti-inflammatory effects as that continues to be worked out.
But my question relates to what I was surprised about was, like the person I'm running in an election, some people may know coming up in three weeks.
And I think of my opponent and it helped me yesterday to think of him as, why is he doing this?
Sort of outside the norm.
But then I thought, well, he's trying to fulfill his needs.
And then today, and that made me less annoyed with this situation.
But today when I was thinking of him in this meditation, it actually made the beneficiary was me because I felt more relaxed thinking about him.
And I thought, oh, I can just be in the flow when I get up to give my five minute speech.
There's my friend.
It's not like you nasty whatever for precipitating this election, which is normally by formation.
But rather I see him as a person who has needs and who knows his own background.
He said to me, we're friends and some friends of his also a lawyer said, well, some friend like that.
I don't want friends like that.
But so in any case, it was interesting tonight.
But then my mind and I don't want to take too much time here.
My mind went to Hitler.
Not that this person's a Hitler, but I thought, well, how do I then wish learning gets harder?
Like this was not hard.
It was a shift that I already started yesterday and then it made it actually thought, oh my, I'm more relaxed.
But if I thought about, you know, Putin or Hitler or some of these other individuals in the world, how do you deal with that in terms of loving kindness?
I'll shut up.
Okay, the Hitler question.
It comes up regularly with this practice.
Because that's where a lot of us go if we take it to the enemy level in the commentary.
But first, I want to just say, Jerry, how powerful what you said prior to that was.
This ability to hold another person in compassion or kindness, because no matter how unskillful, no matter how twisted or distorted, their actions are trying to meet their needs.
And there's underneath the root of all of that is the wish to be happy and free of suffering.
So there's a way of holding that it doesn't mean we allow them to continue to perpetuate harm. If in fact, that's what we're doing, they're doing.
But we can still respond to them from a place of compassion from a place of kindness.
And that is such a more powerful place to be able to respond whether you're on a debate stage or off of it.
So that was to you for this, bringing your practice into the political realm.
And then, as far as Hitler goes, or let's just use him as the stand in for anyone causing catastrophic amounts of harm, because there are other beings in the history of this world that have done that.
And I find most helpful there for myself is the phrase, may you be free from harm and causing harm.
And this is a very deep wish of loving kindness. It is also acknowledging in the Buddhist paradigm that causing that level of harm, any level of harm, but especially against another human, let alone thousands of other humans, is actually catastrophically terrible for your own karma.
And catastrophically awful for one's own possibility as a human. So there's an acknowledgement of the suffering underneath.
There is acknowledgement of the harm of doing harm and then from a more practical standpoint, I find it easier to wish that people who are causing harm sees.
So it's also a wish for everyone around them. So it's a little bit more of a frame of conditionality and karma on loving kindness. And I did first hear this phrase or something close to it from Sharon Salzberg, I just want to give credit there.
Thank you for the question Claire, I want to move on to you before we're out of time.
You are muted. Let me see if I can get there you go.
Thanks so much. I wanted to tell you also how much I enjoyed the meditation.
But in a way, I also wanted to bear witness to the two of the primary points you were making with respect to giving, I'm paraphrasing what you said, but trying to bring joy to others. I've been involved for many years in a spiritual program in which I mentor other people.
And my purpose is to bring joy into their lives. And it has brought me so much personal joy. It's the high point of my day, week, whatever is to work with other women and help their lives improve.
And then with respect to pain, I don't know how you're going to process this, but I could be a candidate for one of your studies. I happen to have one of the highest tolerances to pain you probably have ever encountered.
And when you were talking about the relationship to affect your emotion, I was thinking about my own experience. I thought, yeah, I'm sort of emotionally neutral when I go into a painful situation. And it just rolls off me and I can go for, I was in the hospital.
This is the best, I have a couple of really clear examples, but the easiest one is when I went to the hospital for delivery of my daughter, I was there for 20 minutes, including the paperwork.
And I remember the doctor who handled it was the head of the department, and he was putting his coat on as he was racing after my stretcher. He didn't know what to do, because he wasn't expecting it at all.
Wonderful. Thank you. Thank you.
That was very funny.
Thank you, Claire. I'm going to move on now to give Jeannie a chance before we go into breakout rooms. So, but thank you for sharing that.
Hello, everyone.
Oh, first of all, Don, that was so lovely. I hope it's, I hope it's recorded.
As far as doing metaphor, those that I saw on some level just really dislike and just don't like what they're doing or whatever.
It's easy to do metaphor them because I know if they're happy, it's going to make me happier, make the world happier, right? So it's easy to wish them happiness and whatever and healing and so forth.
Beautiful. I love that you bring in the enlightened self-interest piece.
That's also true, right? Most people who are causing suffering and others have some suffering of their own.
Of course, yeah.
It's just intentional harm.
Thank you very much for each of you for your wisdom, your suggestions, your feedback.
I'm going to set us up in breakout rooms and before you drop off the call, if you're not a breakout room person, know that they are optional.
You can stay in silence on your own out in this room if you like.
I'm not going for the closing, but I do. I want to encourage you to do it because it really is a beautiful way of just actionable, like actionable practice, right?
And it is one of the most powerful ways of developing Mehta is to practice it in speech and mind.
So we are going to open now. Enjoy.
Welcome back, everyone. Welcome back.
That was a little bit short. My apologies for that, but I hope you had a chance to connect with each other.
And we're right at the top of the hour, so we're going to close out, but please feel free to put something in the chat if you have just like a one word response or how that was for you to share together or anything else about the evening.
It's really a delight to be with each of you.
You'll write lovely.
Parts, we have gratitude.
So right before we close friends, I'm just going to put something in the chat. I'm teaching this again on Thursday, or Wednesday, I'm sorry, Nikki's out on Wednesday.
And, oh, beautiful, easily connected to my generosity, natural feeling of ease, lovely.
And put my teaching schedule in the chat if anyone wants to pick it up, because there's like four or five other things that I'll be teaching this month.
No obligation, of course. I'm always delighted to see you and I'm happy this many people are loving the practice or at least feeling the value of this practice of Mehta.
So thank you all. We'll just dedicate the merit very briefly.
May all beings everywhere be happy, healthy, and peaceful.
May all beings everywhere be safe, at ease, and free.
May our practice help in that freedom.
Thank you for your kind attention, everyone.
Thank you, Don.
