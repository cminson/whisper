The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Membership is a matter of wanting to belong.
So anyone who wants to be part of the Sangha, you are part of the Sangha.
Just so you know.
So I want to talk about effort today, the practice of effort.
Just notice if you can, what quality of response do you have in your being as I bring up the word effort?
Is that when I say that word, do you feel a sense of like connecting to having to work hard?
Or a sense of I don't want to think about effort.
Just I think this word is what it points to is incredibly important.
But our relationship to the idea of it may not be as useful as it could be.
Effort is actually the most common quality that is listed by the Buddha for awakening.
Effort is woven into everything we do.
It's the stuff of energy.
And it seems to me that it takes on the resonance or the tone of whatever is guiding, inspiring, or directing it.
In particular, the qualities of the heart and the presence or absence of wisdom can really be noted in our efforts.
And to me, recognizing the visible, experiential results of making effort is something that's always possible.
We can really tune in to the kind of effort we're making by noticing the results of what we're doing.
And I'm going to talk a lot more about that.
And I guess I'll say this other thing, which is that we always have choice in whether that's conscious or unconscious choice, habitual choice.
There's always some choice happening.
And with the teachings of the Buddha and the science of neuroscience, neuroplasticity,
I think it's particularly useful to use effort to cultivate mind states that are beneficial to ourselves, others, and both.
And if we aren't kind of consciously tuning in to the kind of effort we're making or what we're doing,
the results of what we're doing are going to be determined by our past karmic efforts, our past behaviors, our habits and patterns.
This will shape the mind. This will shape what happens in our next moment.
So I'm going to kind of go through a long list of things that I want to cover because I actually don't know how much of this I will cover.
So I'm going to kind of give bullet points of all the different things that I've been sort of reflecting on around this quality of our life, our experience.
So there's a beautiful sutta called, it's about Sona, who's a monk who's practicing.
And the Buddha comes to talk to him when Sona is about ready to give up his practice and return to lay life.
And the Buddha shows up and really essentially the teaching is, and hopefully I'll come back to the sutta,
that our mind is like an instrument and the way that we play it is like we play an instrument.
He was a musician, Sona was.
And so when we play music, we can notice the tone, right?
And we can notice how hard we're strumming or the effort we're putting into playing.
So the Buddha essentially is teaching Sona, you can work with your mind the same way you play an instrument.
So we are our own instruments, our mind, our body, our hearts are our own instruments.
Everything we do requires some amount of effort or energy regardless of our consciousness choice of these things.
We can learn a lot from the effort we're making, sort of a window into,
what we're doing internally becomes visible in our experience and our actions, the results of our actions.
And there's different types of effort needed at different times.
In general, there's effort that requires activity in a way, and there's effort that requires receptivity,
opening up, allowing, receiving.
And it's a dynamic thing, what is needed is always going to change.
Something that we need to tune into, like an instrument, when we travel, when we do various things,
set it down, temperature affects the tone and the quality of the music.
Another question for me around effort and noticing is, where aren't we applying effort?
Where aren't we putting effort into our lives, into our practice?
And where aren't we noticing the effort?
I, in high school, I volunteered in the classroom where people who were neurodiverse or learning diverse,
and I was profoundly impacted by one of the preparation exercises I did that was given to me by the teacher who runs that classroom.
And what she said is to go home and sit down and write out instructions for tying your shoe.
I was shocked as I started to try and articulate step by step with words.
What it took to tie a shoe.
Try it.
Another important thing to know in the Buddha's teachings on wise effort, the function of effort,
is to increase the wholesome and decrease the unwholesome.
The Buddha teaches that there are four types of wise effort.
Lots and lots of types of effort, but the four types of wise effort are efforts that can be summarized in this very simple way.
If it's not bad, don't make it worse.
If it's bad, stop.
So these are kind of moving toward acts of renunciation, letting go or stopping.
And if it's not good, make it good, wholesome, supportive.
And if it's already good, sustain or maintain the goodness, the wholesomeness.
So those are the four types of wise effort.
And to know what kind of efforts needed, we really again need to bring our awareness back to what we're trying to do and how its impact is.
And then one of my final points, not that it will be the last thing I talk about, but effort is very, I feel like it's very much impacted by the stirring of the heart.
Resonance of the heart energy.
And there's this, when the heart lifts up, when the heart is bright, you know, inspired, maybe you can just think about a moment of that and what happens?
There's a natural just following of energy and has a certain vitality or quality to it.
That can really support the capacity to receive, to open up, which is a form of efforting, right?
But to be receptive instead of active, a lot of what we think about, I think, in my mind anyway, when we connect with effort is the energy we need to exert.
So a very simple analogy might be a scooter.
I have a scooter.
And when we start to ride the scooter, we need to take the foot, pump, pump, pump, right?
But then at some point, it's very skillful to stop putting the foot down and just glide, right?
That's actually Gil's simile, I have my own later, but it's a good one, right?
So let me talk a little bit about Sona.
The venerable Sona was meditating and seclusion.
He was off, you know, in the woods and after doing walking meditation, which he did until the skin of his soles of his feet were split.
And bleeding.
And so after he's like, oh, this, this thought rose in his mind, which is of the blessed ones, disciples who have aroused their persistence.
So effort here, right?
I am one, but my mind is not released from the effluence through lack of clinging, sustenance.
So then he thinks, so now my family has enough wealth.
It would be possible to enjoy that wealth and make merit.
So what if I were to disavow training to return to the lower life, enjoy wealth and make merit?
And in the beautiful little story, somehow the Buddha hears, he's nowhere near, but somehow the Buddha hears.
And then magically appears right in front of Sona, right after he has this thought.
And then the Buddha says, hmm, did you just have this thought? And he repeats the thought. And Sona says, yes, Lord.
So the Buddha says, now, what do you think, Sona?
Before, when you were a house dweller, were you skilled at playing the vina?
Yes, Lord.
It's a string instrument.
And what do you think when the strings of your vina were too taught, was your vina in tune and playable?
No, Lord.
And when you think what do you think when the strings of your vina were too loose, was your vina in tune and playable?
No, Lord.
And the Buddha says, And what do you think when the strings of your Vinna were neither
too taut nor too loose, but tuned, established to be on the right pitch, was your Vinna in
tune and playable?
Yes, Lord.
And so the Buddha says, In the same way, Sona, over aroused persistence, over over efforting,
leads to restlessness, over slack persistence, leads to laziness.
Thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence, a tune, you know, and
use yourself as an instrument, right?
Thus words were mine.
So maybe just take a moment to think about how this might be relevant for you in your
practice.
Where might you notice that it's almost like becoming brittle when we over effort when
we're striving, right?
There's too much pushing, there's a tightness contracting for me in the mind and body.
And when there's not enough, you know, we might fall asleep or we drift, we dream, right?
We don't hold our posture.
So just this is our instrument.
This is sort of the visible results of our effort can be seen in just this simple away.
So I mentioned, you know, how critical effort is in the Buddhist teachings, right?
So I'll just read a couple of sutra quotes.
This one's from the Dhammapada, actually, just to give you a sense of how much value
the Buddha placed on it.
Better than 100 years, 100 years lived lazy and lacking in vigor.
There's the effort in vigor is one day lived with vigor and exertion.
And then the other, this is from the Visuddhimaga, when initiated properly, it meaning effort
should be seen as the root of all attainments, the root of all attainments.
So there's a list of the 37 factors of enlightenment, and it's a comprised of a bunch of lists,
including four foundations of mindfulness.
Oh, no, that one's not listed.
Four supreme efforts, four means to accomplishment, four, five strengths, no beliefful path,
seven factors of enlightenment.
And there are five frequently found qualities in those lists.
Those five qualities are faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.
So of these qualities, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom, what do you think
is the most common one if, you know, what would you think?
Well, the one that's listed the most is energy, effort, nine times.
Faith is listed twice, mindfulness eight times, so right up there.
Concentration four times, wisdom five times.
So I mentioned the value of learning from the effort that we make.
The effort we make will have different results in our lives.
Let's see.
One of the, the Buddha's emphatic invitations was to come and see for yourself.
Don't just believe what I teach, right?
Try it for yourself.
The Dharma is very incomplete if it's only something we believe or think about.
The Dharma is to be engaged with, to be practiced, and we need to make an effort to do that.
And if we aren't attuning to the quality of our effort, we might sit down, close our
eyes, sit up straight, try and stop the thoughts, get really serious about meditating, and have
a horrible experience meditating, and decide at the end, I suck, I can't do this.
I tried really hard, and I'm not going to do it again.
Forget it.
I can't do it.
That's a gross exaggeration for a purpose, right?
Just to really kind of step back and say, when we have a practice session or experience
and interaction in our lives, something we're working on, when it doesn't go well, there's
a lot to tune into, not just, you know, just really, there's so much subtlety in this area.
There's so much subtlety.
And there's that heart quality I mentioned, right?
What, what, where's the heart in relationship to what we're doing?
Based on what I was describing about, you know, sitting down and making all this effort
to meditate properly, where was the heart in that?
For me, and the way I was describing it, there wasn't really heart in that.
It was more of a striving to do something perfect, to become a meditator, to be a good
meditator, to have a certain kind of experience.
A heart quality, when we sit down to meditate, would be much more like, you know, while I
care about what I see in my mind, I care about how I'm staying in my body and my heart.
May I have a sense of kindness to myself and to what arises?
You know, these, this is a kind of a setting the tone of a practice.
So just in summary with that section of what I'm talking about, right, which is we can
learn from the effort we make by noticing the results of what we're doing and not assuming
that we can't change the results if we don't change our approach, change the quality of
the heart, what's guiding us, and what kind of effort we're putting in.
So the next kind of point I wanted to make was different types of effort are needed at
different times, obviously.
Because, yeah, no, I definitely hear this from people, they're trying to figure out
what the right amount of effort is to put into a practice.
One of the things I love to teach is loving kindness practice, and I remember this person
was, I was talking about the effort we bring, I really paying attention to the effort we
bring to that practice, and one of the yogis was really trying to think about, okay, how
do I find that perfect amount of effort?
And feeling a little frustrated because he couldn't get the same results in his practice
every time.
And it's, it's because, you know, like everything, our mind is never the same twice, right?
What's happening in our life and our hearts and our bodies changes all the time.
The presence or absence of pain, presence or absence of conflict, presence or absence
of a concentrated mind or a distracted mind, these things, our minds are constantly changing.
So the effort needed for a distracted mind is going to be very different than the effort
needed for kind of a mind that's grounded, settled, whole.
So it's our habit, because of how we are designed, genetically, biologically speaking, to kind
of have these shortcuts for everything we do, like tying our shoes.
And if we aren't tuning in to that, we might end up bringing effort that is not wise effort
to whatever interaction, meditation, whatever it is we're doing.
And I, I've been a swimmer on and off throughout my life, you know, various times I have a
membership to a pool and I swim a lot and then there's periods of time in my life where
that wasn't happening so much.
The last and the most recent return to swimming, I was just so happy to be back in the pool.
And I am someone who I just, I don't like to swim inside.
I like to swim outside, right?
And that's because of, for me, my mind is very much impacted by the open sky, the sense
of openness.
And of course, when it's blessed enough to be sunny, that feeling of the warmth, but
also the smell in a enclosed pool, the smell of the chlorine is quite strong.
So there's all these things about swimming outside that I particularly love.
And so when I first got back in the pool, I was all about just enjoying being outside
and the sky and the sun.
And I was just very much like, you know, working on my form, just taking my time, remembering
the form, getting the body back into kind of and look up, looking at YouTube's about
current swim techniques, but in this very, you know, just joyful, relaxed way.
And I started to call my swimming a source of Sukha joy, right?
And I would just have so much joy.
And you know, I don't know, for the first couple of years, maybe I'd be swimming a lot
in the summer and then when it would get cold in the winter, I just would be like, oh, my
own body would tense up and it was just like, I can't, I can't do it.
I couldn't deal with the Vedana, right, the unpleasant Vedana and the coldness.
And you know, and then I'm sort of realizing over time, oh, then I have to kind of start
over again every spring or summer and, you know, sort of, and I'm missing out on the,
you know, what I, if I continued my practice of swimming, which I consider a mindfulness
practice, how that would be beneficial despite the cold.
So I started to turn in, tune into what effort I needed to make to, to bring to my swimming,
to keep me going.
And I remember one day I was, it was really, really raining.
It was intensely raining and I'm walking out, you know, I just wear my suit from the locker
room out.
I'm not covered up.
I'm just going out.
And so I'm walking and I can feel my body wanting to duck, I don't know the best word
for that, but to, to, to try and avoid the drops of rain.
And it was so absurd to see it.
I just, it just was very freeing.
Actually, it was like, oh, okay, look at this, just turn toward the Vedana, the unpleasant,
stop reacting, stop trying to get away from it.
And, you know, so that was an effort, bringing some effort, right, noticing my response, right.
And so my effort maybe would have been to just get out to the pool as fast as I can,
right.
It was sort of like putting a lot of energy, noticing, oh, when I'm doing that, that just
is kind of fueling the sense of reactivity or negativity, right, is unpleasantness.
And so then the effort needed to shift, to receiving, to being okay, to staying with
and not trying to get away from the coldness or the raindrops, which is impossible anyway.
And just then over time learning to swim through the winter, right, swim through the winter.
Another really significant thing I noticed about making effort with swimming was when
I decided it was time to pick up my pace, you know, I needed to start to swim a little
bit faster.
I wanted to.
I was conditioned enough, I was swimming, you know, no problem distances and amount
of time, no struggle at all.
So it was just time to kind of try and pick it up.
And so what I started to notice was that when I get out of the pool after making this extra
physical effort was I wasn't feeling that sense of joy.
I wasn't feeling that sense of uplift from my swimming.
So I started to watch what was happening in the mind as I was swimming.
And it was like when I was pushing, efforting to go faster.
And you know, this might be just fine because it might be the kind of effort I needed at
that time, right, maybe to kind of increase my conditioning.
But what I noticed was that it was almost like pulling a hood up and over my body, my
head.
It was like my senses, everything kind of honed into the smaller point.
I stopped seeing the light in the water, right, sort of having these blinders on.
And it was like just contracted, there was this contracting.
And so then I started to work on trying to have effort with the swimming while opening
up, while working with the mind to be open and receptive.
And trying to find this balance, right, this right-tunement to how tight the streams were.
When we're on retreat, and if you go on residential retreats, yeah, well, one of the great things
about going on retreat is, you know, everything becomes sort of under a microscope, right,
because you start to get more and more kind of simplified and everything's more clear.
And for me, I could so much see the, how much effort needed to change all the time.
Sometimes if I had a really concentrated sit, I needed to go out and do fast-paced walking,
right, I needed to balance out what was happening.
Sometimes we need to walk slow, sometimes we need to walk fast, sometimes moderately attuning
to the body.
Sometimes during the course of a retreat, you'll see it's better to sit longer sits.
And sometimes we have to consider what's happening in our bodies, and maybe we don't
go to the hall for the sits because we need to sit less time, right.
So other things that sort of really helped, you know, that were examples of taking effort
would be to reflect on the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, the three jewels, right, could
would be a way of sort of brightening the heart, and that would affect the energy I brought
to my practice, or one of my favorite things is to go out and look up, look up at the sky.
It's like something about it from my mind is just like, oh yeah, I remember how to be
open, I remember that, taking in the light and that sense of broadness.
Sometimes I think about effort as having the quality of a temperature or consistency to
it, right, like, and I'm offering this because we all, all of our minds and hearts have tuned
differently.
We might notice different things, so I was just going to offer a couple other thoughts
about how to be paying attention to your own, you know, the results of your own effort.
So there's effort that can feel cold and hard and brittle, right, that's often thought of
as striving, and there's effort that can feel like it's hot and saggy, right?
And then there's the not too hot, not too cold, right, middle way.
Sometimes I think about, I can feel in my body and I have this image of an ostrich,
and it's like, is my effort right now like an ostrich with its head in the sand, like
I'm not really looking, I'm not really doing anything, I'm just kind of shutting down?
Or is it like an ostrich running, right?
And I think about an ostrich running, it's like they're running that way and thinking
about what they're running away from or something, you know, it's just not this taking in.
And then there's like being more upright, right, the, here's another Dharma quote.
The Dharma is for those who are industrious, not those who are lazy.
That's from the Angutra.
So I guess I'm inviting by sharing all of this.
This is kind of industrious, creative ways of thinking about and seeing effort.
And I think we do need to be really receptive and sensitive and tuned in and creative in
how we work with our own effort and bring the heart and the wisdom to it.
So where aren't we putting an effort or where aren't we paying attention to our effort in
our lives?
This is a question for me too.
You know, the practice can be everywhere in our lives, right, not just on the cushion.
And you know, one thing is, there is effort needed to even orient toward the wholesome
because our, the negativity bias in the mind, right, Rick Hudson calls it the negative sticks
like velcro and the positive is like an egg in a Teflon pan.
And this is sort of the hard wiring or the soft wiring of the brain is to orient us toward
that which is more of a threat than that which is a gift.
And but we can counterbalance that tendency by consciously resting our awareness and being
receptive to the good by savoring or appreciating, being grateful.
This is an effort too.
Another area that I think there might be certain amounts of places where there's maybe and
not noticing a sense of, you know, delusion maybe even or taking kind of things for granted
in our lives.
There's often in those areas pockets of not bringing appropriate effort to things.
And I think some of that is around identity, like who we think we are, right, we sort of
just kind of can get going in a groove and just sort of assume we're a certain way, right.
And if you think about that, what I was talking about, we're constantly changing, our minds
are changing, our hearts are changing.
But if we think, oh, I'm a patient person, right, because we have this idea about ourselves,
we're not maybe going to notice when we're being impatient so much, right, at least not
in the beginning.
There's also things like that we can bring more awareness and more effort in our lives
that can make a big difference.
And those might be things like, where do we have areas of assumptions in general about
others?
Where do we make effort?
Some people are really good at learning people's names, and some people aren't, and some of
that might be just the way our minds are, but some of it is, how much effort are we bringing
to learning people's names or how they pronounce their names?
Is that important to us?
Does our heart see the value of that?
So, here's a little quote from Wynton Higgins, we can live ethically without caring about
ourselves, or we can't, I'm sorry, we can't live ethically without caring about ourselves
as well as others.
And we can't be mindful without caring about what is happening here and now.
Care underpins the radical attention the Dharma practice accentuates.
So to tie that piece together with caring can help us bring more awareness and effort
to the areas where we maybe aren't tuning in and could tune in more.
So I'm going to try and just say a few more things and wrap up and allow time for reflections
or questions.
Just a reminder, the function of effort is to arouse and maintain wholesome states.
So let's see.
And actually in the description of effort in the Visiting Maga, it says, vigour is the
state of virya energy.
Its characteristic is exertion.
Its function is to support or consolidate related mental qualities.
Its manifest as non-collapse.
And stirred, one strives wisely.
So stirring of the heart, right?
It's that stirring of the heart that helps bring wisdom to our efforts.
So again, I just think it's super poignant space for practice.
It's so much immediate feedback, right?
Right here and now, if we notice and play with the kind of effort and the kind of heart
quality we bring, it's very tied to wise intention and wise view, right?
All of these path factors are, and last night, of course, I was thinking about this talk
and I had this dream, and in my dream I had this image of granite and how all the different
minerals and colors weave together.
And I think this is the Dharma, right?
Any place you enter, you can pretty much find everything else in the Dharma.
So for me, I'm just sort of offering effort as one of those ways in, ways through in the
window of kind of learning and seeing in our practice, getting more intimate with us.
So the four right efforts, if it's not yet arisen, if it's not making it worse, don't
make it worse.
If things, whatever's happening is making it worse, stop.
If what we're doing isn't making it better, start.
If what we're doing is making it better, keep it up.
Abandoning what is unskillful is letting go.
Abandoning what is skillful is cultivation, this important balance even here between the
cultivation and the letting go.
So we need to sort of be ardently tuned into the results because life is dynamic.
It's always changing.
I've seen with people that, maybe even with myself, but I'm a therapist so I do a lot
of work with others.
And I've seen where they're trying to abandon something that's unskillful, something that's
making something worse, they're trying to stop it.
And what actually happens is the reverse.
Things get worse.
Anybody ever experience that?
No?
Well, sometimes if we're having a thought, maybe I'll make it a little more sort of specific.
If we're having a thought we don't want to have because it's hurtful or we think it's
harmful, what happens when you try and stop that thought?
Does anybody ever notice that it gets a little louder, sticks around a little longer?
Yeah.
So sometimes instead of trying to make something stop, actually, what we need to do is not
be trying to make anything happen to it, to let it be, and maybe turn our heart, our energy
towards something that feels supportive, like being kind to ourselves with this thought.
And sometimes when we're trying to cultivate a sense of wholesomeness in ourselves.
So this was an example of trying to get rid of something that's not wholesome, not helpful,
and we get the opposite.
And sometimes when we're trying to cultivate something that feels wholesome, like loving
kindness, we actually start to find our mind becoming more prickly, more irritated, more
critical.
So even though we're doing loving kindness practice and that's supposed to make us happy
and warm and kind, we need to maybe stop doing that loving kindness practice, right?
And just sort of recognize that that in itself at this moment is resulting in unwholesome
states.
So in a way, we feel like it's just really one other thing, I guess.
Sometimes we're doing all four at the same time, essentially.
They're not always so independent from each other.
Okay, all right.
So I think I did it, I got through all the points.
So I'll just kind of go through them very, you know, to summarize.
For our own instrument, the Sona Sutta, effort is extremely important in the role of awakening
and freedom.
Everything we do requires effort or energy to some extent or not, whether it's exertion
or receptivity.
We can learn so much by watching the effort we're making and then the results of that
effort.
It's always going to change.
Staying attuned, so reflecting before, during and after is always important.
Where aren't we applying effort?
Or where aren't we noticing the effort we're putting into things?
The function of effort and wise effort is to increase the wholesome and decrease the
unwholesome.
The heart, the stirring of the heart is extremely supportive for the effort we make.
Finding some quality that has some warmth or tenderness to it, to varying degrees, right,
can help us, you know, play our own selves with care.
All right, I think that's it.
Thank you for your kind attention.
And I think we're supposed to end right now, is that right, 10.45?
