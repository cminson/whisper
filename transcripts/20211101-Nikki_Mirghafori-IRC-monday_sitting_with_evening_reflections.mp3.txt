 It is such a gift, it is such a gift to be able to sit. It is such a gift to be able to sit, sit in silence, delicious, beautiful. Grace of silence with whatever is arising, which is very, very easy. Ah, to hold with this is an expression of care, expression of care. I care, I care, I care for this being who is me. I care for others, therefore I sit. Before I open my heart and listen, listen, stabilize, listen with my heart, listen with my body. As if my heart, my body is an organ of perception. I am listening, listening, caring, grounded. As the heavenly messengers twirl around, twirl around me within me. It's a part of being human, it's like this and it's okay, it's okay. This mysterious passing show, this mystery, this profound mystery of being human, being aware. Sit and listen in awe. And moment by moment, listening, holding witness with the body, with the heart, stably, calmly, making more space in our heart for all that is here. All that is here, all that has been and will be, without trying to solve, fix, but perhaps just to sit with in this moment after a long day of practice. So many moments, so much has happened today, so many moments. We've traveled a million miles and yet we haven't really left. We haven't moved an inch, yet we've traveled a million miles. This mystery of being human experience, and here we are in this moment, it's like this. Can it be just as it is? This moment, opening, opening to the mystery of this moment has never been and will never be. Can we possibly appreciate ourselves, our own goodness for having shown up? Having shown up as much as we've been able to, as well as we've been able to. Not judging, not grading, appreciating. Thank you. Thank you, this person who's named you. I care for you. Thank you. Appreciating. Having shown up. And can we have care, appreciation, embodiment for the rest of the evening as we put this dear being, who is me, this dear being, whom I am, the guardian of. How can I care for this being best? Putting them to bed, appreciating them, thanking them. As if this being who is me is the young child. We are the guardian of. So with appreciation for ourselves, appreciation for each other. Considering the goodness that has been created, co-created, letting go of any judgment, things that could have been no need, no need. Bowing to ourselves and each other and bringing this evening to a close. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. May you rest well with appreciation and care for this being who is you. Take care of them. Good night.
