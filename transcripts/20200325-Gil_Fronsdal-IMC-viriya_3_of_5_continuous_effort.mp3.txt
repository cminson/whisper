Viriya  (3 of 5) : Continuous Effort  
  
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

This only the second week that I am figuring out how 
this way of broadcasting via YouTube works. Our little 
exchanges around the mikes and the volume at the 
beginning were actually quite nice for me. It began to 
dissolve the idea that this medium is a little impersonal. 
Seeing your responses and feel ing your support in 
figuring this out , in this  interactive this way – I felt even 
more delight , warmth , and happiness to share this with 
all of you. So thank you.  
 
I will continue this five -part series on effort in practice, 
especially in meditation practice. The first day was 
initiating effo rt, and then it was being able to discern the 
appropriate places to put effort  – right endeavor. We put 
our life energy into things that are supportive, helpful, 
freeing, skillful . And we avoid putting our effort  into what 
is not skillful or not helpful.  
 
As w e do this more , we get a sense of how to navigate 
where and how we place our focus and effort . This is 
part of meditation , of engag ing with the present 
moment. It’s certainly to get busy , trying to adjust everything all the time . But if we r eally take this to heart 
and understand th e discernment toward what is helpful  
and supportive , at some point we realize that working 
too hard, straining, or being busy is actually  
counterproductive. In trying to do meditation perfectly, 
we only end up doin g it imperfectly.  
 
I think  that to have  a meditation practice that is 60% 
good is actually better than trying to be 90% or 100% 
good. We want to give ourselves leeway , to be relaxed 
about how things are, and not to be troubled by how 
things are – so that there can be a greater settling, 
letting go, and discovery of ease with what is.  
 
Of course there are difficulties as we meditate. Then the 
effort can be how to not be troubled by the difficulty  – 
how to not get rea ctive, constricted , tight, or self -critical 
around the difficulties. The effort is to find how to be in a 
way that is more at ease, less stress ed. Right endeavor 
is not a problem ; it’s actually  settling and freeing.  
 
As we go along with this practice, and build up 
continuity of effort, of being engaged in meditation, we 
find that it is nourishing to be engaged . It’s settling , and 
it feels as if doors are opening to greater calm , peace , 
or equanimity. It’s like we are connected to what is 
authentic  and real – as opposed to fixing , manipulating , 
or changing what is going on.  
 The third kind of effort that I want to focus on today 
could be called “continuous effort .” That might sound 
like a l ot of work. Another way to describe it may be as 
being “persistently relaxed ,” or as “relaxed persistence ” 
– continuity of effort that is at ease , relaxed , and is built 
into how we are aware . Then we settle in, and let that 
become  more continuous.  This builds naturally on its 
own.  
 
As the mind wanders off and then settle s back, settle s 
back , the momentum of being lost in thought begins to 
quiet down. Every time we start over again , we are 
decreasing the amount of fuel that keeps our thinking 
active . The amount of fuel that  we decrease might be 
imperceptible , but if we do it a hundred time s in a 
session of meditation, it makes a difference. We come 
back to the present moment , and we just have gentle 
dedication: “Let’s just stay here, hang out here . Let’s be 
upright, have some strength, and just be here with 
experience  – not straining , demanding, or even 
expecting to be successful. ” Just dedication , or maybe 
devotion.  
 
Over time the idea is to cultivate and find continuity . A 
lot of the deeper benefits of meditation come when the 
effort to be present or the ability to be present has 
continuity through time. This is not just in formal 
meditation , but also in everyday life. If we can atten d to 
being aware as we go through the day, our continuity of awareness is like a magnet for beneficial states, for 
better self -understanding. It gives us greater capacity to 
not continue fuel ing unhelpful states  – states caught up 
in greed, hate, and delusion  – or collaps ing into fear.  
 
This continuity of attention provides breathing room for 
our life, greater space, greater connection to what’s 
going on. The direction is towards continuous effort. At 
the beginning it takes a little work, remembering it, and 
valuing it . This is supported by feeling the goodness of 
it. If we keep thinking that it’s work , or we are being self -
critical, it isn’t a very pleasant or inviting state for the 
mind to stay present  with.  
 
On the other hand,  we can hold our practice with 
generosity, kindness, compassion, ease, not trying too 
hard, not having too high a standard, not berating 
ourselves . Instead , we delight in our capacity to be 
aware, a nd appreciat e the value of being real . Now we 
can be more careful. And  it feels inviting and satisfying 
to be connected and present.   
 
Now the effort starts to be more continuous. You want 
to do this. It may be a little like playing  a sport or a 
musical instrument . If you really enjoy what you are 
doing , the effort to do the activity isn’t like work , but 
more like delight in the chance to be able to do it.  
 
It is possible to have that kind of approach with meditation. It takes a while to build it up . In order to 
build it up , there must be some joy , delight , or 
appreciation  – however small it might be. Some 
appreciation of, “ It’s good to be here.” This doesn’t 
come quickly in meditation practice. Sometimes it takes 
months, maybe years , to really get the deep 
apprec iation that this is home. Continuity of effort brings 
us toward that place.  
 
One way to practice th is effort might be held under the 
umbrella of the phrase “relaxed persistence. ” 
Persistence by itself might lend itself to striving or 
straining. Being r elaxed by itself  might lead to 
sleepiness , dullness , or complacency. But the two 
together – relaxed persistence  – support each other.  
Making effort , but staying calm while making the  effort.  
 
We make the initial effort to keep showing up. That is 
something experienced meditators are still doing , 
because the mind is changeable. So sometimes the 
effort is to just keep showing up, again and again.  
 
Then, as we connect to what is happeni ng, there can be 
right endeavor. We find our bearings. We understand 
how to meditate, how to be present in a way that is 
supportive. We make adjustments that are helpful. At 
some point , we don’t want to make too many 
adjustments because then we just keep a gitating  the 
effort . We want to make adjustments that lead to greater calm and settle dness.  
 
Then, as we settle in, we have some dedication to 
staying here : “Let me  stay open, receptive, connected . 
Let me  stay tethered to the moment , or to the breath in 
a nice way. ”  
 
Many years ago I used a wonderful image for my 
practice to help me with the continuity of attention to my 
breathing. It provided something like the right tautness 
in the balance between persistence and relaxation. I 
would imagine t hat I was flying a kite . My understanding 
of flying a kite is that if there is a strong wind, you 
loosen the string and let it go a little bit, so that there 
isn’t too much tension on it. But if there is less wind, you 
want to pull the string  in, so that t here is air pressure 
against the kite  to hold it up.  That was how I saw effort 
in meditation . As I was breathing, I wanted to keep just 
the right tautness between the attention and the 
breathing  – keeping the string of attention right there. 
Sometimes I wo uld let it out a little more , and let the 
breathing be more free as I was aware of it. Other times 
I would bring it closer and feel it. I was with the 
oscillation of breathing in and breathing out , and  I was 
keeping attention there  with this idea of the st ring, 
moving with it back and forth.  Over time, t his was one of 
many ways that I cultivated continuity of awareness.  
 
As you go about your life today, you might see what joy and delight there is in staying aware, receptive, and 
attentive in a more continu ous way. Maybe start with 
just thirty seconds at a time. Then m aybe you can 
increase it to one or two minutes. Don’t set too high a 
standard. Just see what benefits come  from that .  
 
Thank you very much. I look forward to coming here to 
IMC, sitting here a lone with all of you. Until tomorrow, 
be well.
