The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay, so if you're ready, it's time for experimenting with the second meditation.
So relax yourself into a comfortable posture.
Raise your hand if you're having trouble hearing me.
And close your eyes.
I'm going to give just a little bit of pre-instruction before we go into the proper meditation here.
So the earliest writings about metapractice describe cultivating this attitude or sense of it that we were talking about.
And they don't so much emphasize the word-based formal practice that comes later.
So for this meditation, we're going to start out with the attitude and the gesture of metta.
One of the terms for compassion or loving kindness is a movement of the heart.
And this kind of more energetic meditation is like a stretching or a warm-up before working out.
Like swinging the club for a golf swing before you have a ball.
Or moistening the sand and starting with a basic lump of sand for a sandcastle before adding the details later.
So with that in mind, breathing in.
And again, letting go of the out-breath.
Imagining almost that the out-breath is an offering to the trees and grasses, to the biosphere.
Breathing in, sipping, a sense of tender appreciation for your life's breath.
The oxygen that's vital to your well-being.
Allowing the oxygen and the breath to soothe and saturate any tension, any worries.
Filling and relaxing your heart.
Draw your attention out as well through your body to the surface of your body, sensing your skin.
Imagine a skin like a sheet enclosing your personhood with integrity.
Sense into the vitality in life, pulsing in and beneath your skin.
Sense into the space just around your skin, if you like.
You might imagine it as a warm, soft blanket around you.
Or a field of radiant warmth or coolness of your life energy.
A field of vitality, presence.
The each out-breath might imagine allowing the breath to radiate through your whole body, out through the skin.
Extending this field of vitality as an offering, an offering of your presence, your aliveness, your goodwill.
The each in-breath could imagine drawing in nourishment from all around you, goodwill from all around you.
Letting oxygen, nourishment fill and purify every muscle, every tissue, every cell, appreciating your life's breath.
Letting oxygen, nourishment fill and purify every cell, every tissue, every cell, appreciating your life's breath.
Letting oxygen, nourishment fill and purify every cell, every tissue, every cell.
Breathing in and appreciating, breathing out, letting go, offering.
Allow the sense of offering, the energy of the exhale to expand out from you gently, as far or as near as it wants to go.
Allow the sense of offering to expand out from you gently, as far or as near as it wants to go.
Letting oxygen, nourishment fill and purify every cell, every tissue, every cell.
The each in-breath appreciating or savoring life out, letting go, offering.
Every now and then taking a break from this rhythm of breathing in and appreciation, offering the out-breath to settle back and allow whatever is present just to be.
Savoring the aliveness of the body and the breath in this moment.
How the wish for happiness, safety, health, ease connects us just as the breath does to all living beings.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can you hear me now?
I hope that you were able to hear me for at least part of the meditation. Were people able to hear?
I think the mic might have been off too, unfortunately. Sorry about that.
To take this practice home with you, there are handouts at the end of the stage. The more were made on the last break.
I ask you to stick with a simple practice like the one we just did of breathing out and offering or letting go.
Breathing in a sense of appreciating or just noticing your life's breath, your connection with life.
It's almost like a gesture or a picture might loosen up his arm or her arm before throwing a pitch.
This kind of movement of the heart is the foundation of how to bring more energy and precision and concentration to the rest of the practice.
So it's really the base that we're working from.
The third step, breathing in and appreciating. The second, letting go or offering on the out breath.
The third step is just to settle back and save or notice whatever is happening.
And just be with it.
So for those of you who already have a meditation practice, suggest that you take about two-thirds of your meditation time for this practice
and then just let go into your normal mindfulness practice at the end, whatever that amount of time is for you.
And for those of you who are new, you would be really supportive of learning this if you can dedicate 20 minutes a day to this practice.
In addition to the time, the formal practice, each week I'm going to introduce what I call micro practices.
So these are things you can do throughout your day.
I often like to use waiting time, you know, if you're waiting for an elevator or a bus or in a line, that kind of thing.
But this one may not be suited to that because here's what it is.
It's to simply notice or to take some time to recollect to remember the presence of kindness or kind act you've done
or a feeling of kindness in yourself or when you've experienced it from others.
So see if you can notice it while it happens or remember a time when it's happened.
And we're talking about little acts here, like letting someone go ahead of you in line, that kind of thing.
It can include the bigger stuff too, opening doors, the little things we do for each other, right?
The advanced level of this micro practice is to notice when people are being kind to each other and you're not involved.
Let's see how that feels.
So I'm hoping this little taste of metapractice has inspired some of you to take this on
and to come back and talk about your questions, your comments, what you've noticed over the week when we meet again next week.
We have about five minutes if anyone has questions or comments in this last part of the class.
Good. Please wait for the microphone. That way it gets recorded.
Can you say a little more what you mean by appreciation and maybe some of us phased out during the meditation
or didn't hear, let's say. Can you say what you mean by appreciation and offering a little bit more so what practice we should be trying this week?
So by appreciation, what I mean is appreciating the fact that you are alive, bringing in your life's breath.
So appreciating the breath for what it means in terms of our lives and just appreciating how it feels,
any comfort you feel in it, any warmth, any positive feelings that physically happen with it.
Appreciation is defined in the dictionary as recognition plus enjoyment or a complex understanding of something.
So you can apply either one of those kinds of definitions to it. Does that help a little bit?
And then the offering is more of a sense of just letting go. You can imagine it being an offering to plant since they breathe what we breathe out, they breathe in.
Or you can just imagine the letting go if that's easier.
Hello. Can we split the 20 minutes into two 10-minute sessions?
You can. I do recommend that you do one 20-minute session if possible.
It does have a cumulative effect, but if two 10 minutes is what you can work in, then sure.
There's one behind you as well.
You seem to focus on cultivating intentions, and I just wanted to clarify, do you mean positive thoughts or does it mean something else?
That's a great question.
Yeah, I will repeat it.
She said, I seem to focus on cultivating intentions, and she said, is that positive thoughts or is it something else?
So in this case, the intention might to be to cultivate positive thoughts, but the intention itself is a wish, an aspiration.
So I might wish to feel more gentleness for myself, even if I don't actually feel it yet.
So I'm not making myself feel gentle, but I'm acknowledging and appreciating the wish to feel gentle.
That's the intention. It's like this.
Going there.
Does that help?
Yes.
So I'm still thinking about the ghost story that you told.
I just maybe wonder partially because of something that happened during my meditation, what's the connection between fear or I guess lack of fear and kindness?
That's a great question.
Can I ask a little bit more about what came up in your meditation so I can answer in a useful way for you?
Okay, so yeah, I'll say this because I don't think it's, sorry.
Anyway, so while I was thinking about being connected to everyone, I had this image of spiders, and for the record, as I think a lot of people do, spiders terrify me.
But for some reason, during the course of the meditation, I wasn't scared the thought of spiders was comforting, which was a very weird sensation for me.
So that was just, it was just interesting.
No, thank you very much for sharing it.
So perhaps you've hit on something that many people find to be true, which is it's difficult to experience fear and sort of an open curiosity or kindness at the same time.
You might experience one right after the other, but it's rare that they will happen simultaneously.
And I wish I knew why that was true, but I have noticed it to be true and other people have noticed it to be true.
So I would experiment with it and just see, you don't have to necessarily call up things that scare you to test it out.
But you might notice that there's a person that provokes anxiety, for example.
If I cultivate kindness towards that person, I'm much more likely to not be quite as anxious around them.
So just see for yourself and experiment.
We have time for no more.
Actually, I just looked at the clock.
So thank you.
I appreciate that all of you came.
It's great to see you here.
And happy to answer questions offline.
