 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, so welcome, folks. Yeah, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is the landing in your posture. Thank you. It's supported by all the practice you've done, but not using all the practice you've done to predict exactly what happens today. Thank you. So if you're feeling a certain kind of pressure to think particular thoughts, just think them hard for this first minute. Thank you. And then recognize that thought offers no refuge. Thank you. Directing, directing the spotlight of attention. There's some anchor, some object that acts as a kind of feedback that's reminding you to stay here. Maybe the breath, maybe something else. The spotlight operator can be relaxed, their arms on that spotlight, relaxed. We're not trying to make anything else disappear. The rest of the stage cast the characters, but we're just spotlighting. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The effortful quality of attention, attention training supports the seemingly effortless quality of awareness. I told you to stop being aware that you couldn't do it. Whatever can't be stopped, it's possible to rest there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There is space for all experiences to arise. But who can say where our life is? Where our life is? We keep relaxing back. No effortful attempt to control the spotlight of attention. As we become less mesmerized, the attention becomes less glued to discursive thinking, auditory thinking. The awareness tastes less and less like me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As the teacher pandan says, let your face fall off. The element of relaxation, of course. The non-identification, you or not, your face. Just another part of your body. Take a foot or a knee, taking its place in the openness of awareness. Take a foot or a knee, taking its place in the openness of awareness. you you you
