 While we're waiting for a few more people to come in, we can take a few minutes if any of you have any questions or want to report a little bit how it's going. This is the fourth week of our five-week introductory course. We've talked about meditating on the breath, and we've talked about mindfulness of the body. Last week we talked about mindfulness of emotions. Are there any questions about any of that or anything that seems... Would you like to take the opportunity to discuss? Yes. I have another thing. I've been trying to do as fast as I can to write checks. I was like three steps ahead from it. I started writing each check. It was a very pensive, uncomfortable process. Now what I'm doing is I've got a really beautiful pen. I'm doing a very neat check. I'm just writing them slowly, putting them in a very neat stack, and putting them up on it. It's just completely changed the whole process. So it's just kind of noting that in a different little thing. So noticing that you can have the difference between being present for something in a clear way versus rushing through it and being ahead of yourself. Yeah. Just being there instead of being in the next step with every step. Beautiful. How many of you have you noticed that? It's a big difference between the two ways of being. I hope you've noticed that. One of the things it points to is that on one hand there's the practice or the effort made just to slow down or to be really present rather than be ahead of yourself. But that also requires the motivation to want to do that. One of the things, the practice itself can be seen as being very simple and easy, but sometimes it's the motivation that lags behind or the motivation isn't so easy to come by. This is something that you really want. Many people are not so sure. They want it kind of in the abstract. Sure, it's a good idea to be present, but then to really want it enough so it takes some priority in one's life. It's possible to have something like mindfulness or presence, have a primary priority for a person's life so that it takes precedence over everything else. Where everything else you do somehow has to fit within the context of that. So it doesn't mean you deny anything else. It doesn't mean you stop doing all kinds of other things, but it means that you have some real preference that whatever else you do is going to happen within the field of being present and mindful for it. The risk is if we don't, is we lose ourselves in the process. Yes? I was noticing the opposite, which is being aware of how well after the fact that we spent an event and caught in the fog, we were told it was emotional. The teller's gone, or the post-recorded one, or the traffic incident's gone, but I'm still arguing in the room. Fascinating. Fascinating. That's very valuable also. They talk sometimes in Buddhism about leaving a residue or leaving traces, and it's possible to live in such a way that we don't leave so many traces or residues of that type. We're still holding on to some past event and repeating it and reviewing it and holding on to the feelings. Two things that are helpful to not leave any of those traces is one is to really present when something's happening, because we're not really present while it's happening. That's when we tend to latch on, and our drivenness, our preoccupations, our attachments, and our fears latch on and develop a certain amount of momentum that carries on into the future. If we're present, we're really present for what's going on, we're less likely to do that. We probably still will, but we're less likely to have the same kind of unconscious force. The other thing is that if you're mindful enough, then there are opportunities that you can be a clearer channel for your feelings. For example, you might be a clearer channel for your anger, if anger was what's going on. Not necessarily that you express the anger to the person you're angry with, but that you're not bottling it up and freezing it, but you really acknowledge it and let it flow within you. In the context of letting it flow, have a more honest and realistic completion of what's happening in the moment. What you notice is great, it's very important what you noticed. That residue is left behind. What do you attribute that to? Just taking the time to sit and notice how things are and to see what happens when I notice myself sitting like this, notice myself thinking like that, just being more present to what's going on. The idea of freedom, which is a very important one in Buddhism, is based on the notion that there's choice, some kind of choice, that we can choose how we respond to a situation. The less mindful we are, the less choice we have, the less we see the various options, including not responding at all. The more mindful we are, I think the more freedom there can be because we see the places of choice. One of the remarkable things will happen as mindfulness practice and mindfulness meditation gets deeper and stronger for a person, increasingly subtle and deep places of choice reveal themselves. There's a tremendous amount of subtle but very powerful decisions we make in our life constantly. They're often outside of our conscious awareness because we're either going too fast or racing ahead of ourselves or whatever. As we start paying more careful attention to the present moment, it opens up and you see a hugely increasing range of ways to choose what to do. When I came back from living three years in his end monastery, where in a sense a lot of the life was formalized. You ate a certain way, you sat a certain way, you followed a schedule, and everything was kind of set. So your mindfulness practice developed within this set way of doing things. When I came back to San Francisco to live there, I was highly aware of the number of choices I had to make that had been made for me in the monastery. For example, the choice of how I sit in a chair became a big deal. Before I went to the monastery, I never thought about it. I just slept there and kind of slumped or whatever I did. But we choose the way we choose to sit in a chair. Most of us are living so fast and not paying enough attention to our body and what's going on that we don't necessarily see the choice that's involved in the way we sit down to a chair. How many of you thought consciously about the decision you made, how you sat in a chair today, those of you in a chair, coming here now? Some of you, great. I'm glad. So maybe one more question before we start formally. There's no beginnings. Yes, Michelle. One of the great choices we have is not to do anything. And actually that's a powerful thing, not to do anything in a passive way. But what we can do, the choice we have is not to do anything but bring mindfulness to the situation, bring awareness to the situation. So the choice, that's something which is often not, I think for many people, not considered to be a valid choice because many of us tend to focus so much on doing and decision making. And paying attention seems rather passive in not doing. But it's actually very, very powerful. And so there's indecision. One of the things you can do is do nothing but bring careful mindfulness to the situation. And with time maybe something will reveal itself. But indecisiveness is an interesting one because it can come out of a kind of a natural not knowing what to do, and different options is not clear what to do, what to choose. Or it can be a kind of a natural not knowing or it can be a kind of holding back, a kind of fear. And so then it becomes interesting to explore the sense of holding back. What's holding you back? Is there fear? And what is that fear about? And kind of go underneath the below the decisiveness or the emotion behind the decisiveness can be a key to understanding what is a deeper issue in the situation. And you can feel one of the interesting things about mindfulness practice is we try often to turn the experience back into the body. How is it for the body? And indecisiveness can sometimes be very clearly felt in the body as a kind of holding back. And then to hang out with that, feel that in the body very concretely for a while and then see what happens as you do that. The other interesting opportunity that exists with mindfulness meditation is if you have to make an important decision to sit down and meditate for half an hour or an hour or whatever and don't think about your issue, that says come up. By the end of your meditation period, as you kind of come out of it, kind of ask the question or just kind of raise the issue and see if in the kind of little bit more silent mind than you usually have some other answer arises within you. Many of us have been kind of spinning constantly on our normal thought patterns. There's only a kind of a certain range of solutions. But if the mind has a chance to calm down a little bit, sometimes a deeper solution will come. And this is a common phenomenon. Some people will go jogging or running and they find that it's a time for creative unintentional decision making. Okay, last one. I just saw an accident on the way down and it's like I can't just get back to being out of my mind. It's like I'm in a dream time with you. Yeah. Maybe you're not supposed to get it out of your mind quickly. Yeah. So one of the things we do then, when there's something strong experienced like that, that becomes a place that you bring your presence. And if something so powerful as that, I think it's natural not to listen to a speaker so carefully unless I do something really dramatic to override it. And so you need to honor, really be mindful of the situation and maybe the tension you feel between trying to listen to me and the pull of the image you have. And you might decide that the place it's important for you to attend to is the feelings and image that's inside of you concerning this accident. And just tune me out for a while and just be with that fully. And if that makes sense, and just process it, let your inner life process it by bringing your presence to it. If you continue to struggle and don't really want to be there and you don't want to listen to me, eventually it will kind of pass from your consciousness, but it might not be fully processed. But if you kind of bring your full attention just to bear on that and be with your feelings and your sensations, then maybe in a deeper way you can process it. Also you might begin to develop some understanding of what goes on. Some of the power of a situation like that, some of it might exist in the nature of the situation itself. There's empathy there, feeling for someone in distress or hurt or maybe perhaps, you don't know. And there's kind of empathy, concern perhaps. But there can be a lot of other things that get added onto it. I can imagine some people would have a tremendous aversion to any kind of suffering in the world. And so to see some concrete act of situation of suffering out there, there's more than just empathy. There's just recoiling one's own heart because of this fear about any contact with the world's suffering. And it's that recoiling that fear that carries the momentum through time. And so by bringing careful mindfulness, non-judgmental mindfulness to how you actually are in the moment, you might be able to start distinguishing between what is the nature of the situation, the event, the feelings you have from it, and what is the extra stuff that gets added on because we identify with it and we recoil from it or we judge it or something. That makes sense? And what's beautiful about mindfulness practice is that the intention always is to be non-judgmental about what you notice. There's nothing that mindfulness reveals that needs to be judged negatively. Just sitting there, just being present for yourself and not deciding to do anything, just kind of being there for what arises within you. You can allow all aspects of yourself to be there without any necessity to judge it negatively or positively. Tremendous feelings of rage and murderous rage, you want to kind of strangle someone, arises as you sit. Great. You just let it come in the context of sitting quietly like this. You really feel it. There's no need to judge it. The point is to feel it. Great experiences of ecstasy arise and there's no need to hold onto it or justify it or just allow it to come in the non-judgmental field of awareness. I hope that addressed your concern. You might have tuned me out appropriately. I said that early on and then I went on and on. This reminds me of a story, a Zen story. These two were Zen monks traveling through China. They came to a somewhat shallow river that there was no bridge. There was a young woman there who couldn't get across. One of the monks picked up the woman and carried her across the other side and put her down. Then the two monks continued on their travels. It happens that traditionally in Buddhism there's fairly strict rules about monks not having any physical contact with women. He had broken one of the serious rules of a monk. These two monks continued their journey. When they came to a monastery to spend the night there later in the day, just before they got to the gate to the monastery, the one monk turned to the other and said, how could you have picked up that woman at the river? You're a monk and you're taking these vows of commitment to not do such things. How could you have broken those rules? How could you? How could you? I don't understand. How could you? The second monk said to the first, I put down that woman at the river. Why are you still carrying her? How do we carry things in our mind, in our feelings, in our body? We carry things along with time. Today the instructions is going to be about thoughts, about how to include thinking as part of mindfulness practice. I think it's important to wait four weeks before we talk about it because many of us in our culture, in our life here are excessively thoughtful. It's caught up in our thoughts. Most of us live, the center of gravity of our life is our thoughts and our thinking. We live preoccupied, swimming around in it. The Tibetan teacher, Chungyum Trungpa, once said, the epitome of the human condition is one big traffic jam of discursive thought. Many of us are lost in our thoughts. It's where we center gravity of our life is. For many of us we end up being imbalanced because of it. If we talk about thoughts in the first week, then it just lends itself to more thinking. Of course by the fourth week now you're all ready to hear that, without getting too discursive about it. I'll start the instructions on thought by telling you the story I often say that was very helpful for me. Some years ago I was watching football with some friends. Actually they were Vipassana teachers, meditation teachers. One of them had their remote control and his power. As sensible people do, I believe, when the commercials came on he would turn off the sound and then we'd have a conversation. What was odd was at some point, now you seemingly, most sensible people when the game comes on again you turn the sound on, right? My friend didn't do that. We all knew the game was on. We stopped talking and started watching. There was no sound. Since he was a meditation teacher I thought, well, he's supposed to be very mindful. I thought this is rather interesting. Rather than screaming at him or saying, hey you, let's just see what's going on here. Let's just be present for this situation. I sat there for a while just watching the football game without any sound. Eventually he turned the sound on. What struck me was the great difference between watching the game with the sound and without the sound. Without the sound there was no commentary. There was no commentator, sports commentator, telling you kind of what was going on blow by blow. I could kind of more or less follow the game. I kind of know what happened. These guys get up, they stand facing each other, they crash into each other. One of the people maybe has the ball and he runs a few yards down the field and it's kind of great. Sometimes someone catches the ball and they go a bit further. You can kind of watch them. They go to make it to the 50 yard line and the 40 yard line. You realize he might make it all the way in 30 yard line. You see this guy coming kind of after him and he catches up to him and he looks like he's not going to make it and he tackles him in the 10 yard line and it's fine. Now when you turn on the sound and the same situation goes on, there's this guy telling you, oh my God, he's on the 50 yard line. He's going to 40. Oh my God, he's going to make, oh there's this guy coming out of the left field and he's going to, and I'm on my edge of my chair and it's all exciting and I'm out of breath and finally I'm just, he gets caught and I'm just drained. Wow. It's rather traumatic. There's a difference between the experience of watching a football game with the sports commentator and without. And the job of the sports commentator in a sense, his job in a sense is to get you into the game and involved even emotionally. And the game is a lot calmer without it. I'm not saying that you should not have a commentator. It's kind of fun, those emotions. But what happens to many of us is that we don't see the difference between the actual game and what the commentator is doing. And the commentator is actually very little to do with the game itself. It's somewhat external to the game, making comments about it. But often because of the way we kind of receive it all, we integrate it into one. And so the emotion that we're picking up from the commentator becomes for us the experience of the game itself. Something like that. Now this is what happens to us all the time in our own minds. We have our own sports commentator, news commentator, talk host in our own minds that's constantly commentating about what's going on around us or within us. And often our commentary of what's going on within us and around us is somewhat removed from actually what's going on in the same way that the game is different from the sports commentator. But we don't see that, the difference. And so these two things get entangled. And so we end up living in the, we tend to live our life through the commentary rather than experiencing it directly. So for example, what's a good example? Well, meditation example would be you're sitting here and you have an itch on your big toe. And the commentator says, Oh my God, I wonder if it's skin cancer. And then, oh my God, you know, it happened. I remember this person and this person had some kind of great infection on their big toe and it was awful. And maybe it's, I have the same infection and maybe I'm contagious and hopefully no one notices and this is really embarrassing and what should, maybe I should take off my socks and look, but then I'm in a meditation group and I shouldn't, you know, there's all this commentating going on, right? And we get lost in that world and we don't see that that's that, that the world of commentary is very different from the experience of itch itself, which might, it might be nothing at all. It might just be an itch, nothing more than that, but we got lost in this world of other things. One of the great things that's very helpful in meditation practice is just learn to distinguish between when we are seeing the world or living the world through or in the commentary and when we can experience it more directly. And it isn't that one is better than the other exactly, but it's very useful to see the difference. And if we can see the difference, then we can have the choice to rest or bring our presence more fully into our direct experience as it's lived rather than being lost in the commentary and ideas and judgments that we might have. So you're sitting here and you're following your breath and the breath feels a certain way. It feels just a tightness in the chest as you breathe in and as you breathe out, you don't feel you can really breathe out fully. And you feel this over and over, you feel this rhythm and then your mind wanders away and it's kind of uncomfortable to be there. So you don't want to, often when things aren't comfortable, we kind of try to run away from it. So we don't really there and we come back and it's hard to be there, but you know, it's kind of like it keeps coming back and we feel it, the breath. And that's kind of how it is. The commentary says, Oh my God, I'm a terrible meditator. I'm not doing this right. My mind keeps wandering away. There's all this constriction in my chest. How can I have done this myself? How can I have lived my life so I was always so stressed out and so worried and so uptight? That must be really uptight. And so it goes and it goes on and on, the commentary. And the commentary is our judgment evaluation about something which doesn't have to be judged. It just, Oh, there's tightness in the chest and the out breath doesn't go fully and the mind wanders away, but you bring it back. You can leave it that simply in the realm of presence, of direct experience. Does that make sense? So as we're going to start sitting, we're all sitting now, but as we sit, one of the things you might pay a little bit of attention to is when you tend to drift off into the commentary and rest there versus when you can rest more with your breath itself or in your physical experience. And it isn't that you have to stop having the commentary, but choose if you can to stay with simplicity of the direct experience. Put most of your sense of gravity, but most of the weight of your presence there and let the thoughts kind of be in the background if you can. So taking a comfortable but alert posture, sitting with a little bit of energy or aliveness in the spine, if you can, and then gently close your eyes. And then in the beginning of sitting, it's often nice to take two or three deep breaths, connecting to the inside of the body as you breathe in, relaxing into yourself as you breathe out. And then letting your breath breathe itself whatever way it wants. You might take a few moments also to look through the body and see if there's any place, obvious muscles that can be relaxed or softened a little. You might soften the forehead and the eyes. Sometimes the eyes can be a little bit more restful. If you let your eyes in a sense look inward and then let them relax. Sometimes it's useful to soften the jaws. Sometimes it's possible to relax the shoulders a little. And then finally it's quite useful to relax the stomach. Let the stomach hang out, soften the stomach. And then let your attention, your awareness, become open or become aware of your breathing. And the way to be aware of your breathing is to feel it as sensation. Not to think about the breath, but to experience it the way the body experiences its breathing. The expansion perhaps as you breathe in, the movement, the pressure, the release as you breathe out, the warmth and the coldness of the air perhaps. Feeling the breath at the sensory level. In a sense it's a sensory awareness exercise. Sensing the breath. And you might find it helpful to very, very softly whisper in the mind, label or name the breath as you breathe. There's a way of guaranteeing that you stay present for it. So you can label the in breath in, the out breath out. Or if mostly you're feeling the arising and falling of the chest or the abdomen, you can do the in breath as rising, the out breath as falling. Whenever your mind wanders off into thought or gets caught up in the commentary. Simply in a very simple way notice that that's happened and then without any judgment, wake up again to the sensations of breathing. Letting yourself be awake with the full experience of breathing in, the full experience of breathing out. Thank you. Whenever you can remember coming back to the simplicity of breathing and the ideas that you have of something you're going to accomplish or something that's supposed to happen or something you want to change or any judgment about how it's going, all that is commentary and it's unnecessary. It's possible just to be present with the way things are. No need for anything to change. Just this particular breath. And then the next one. And then the next one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As you feel your breathing, as you feel the in breath and feel the out breath, notice which one is clearest to your awareness. It's the in breath clearest or the out breath clearest. The phase of the breath which is least clear, that's the place where you're most likely to wander away from. If you're not aware of the out breath, the end of the out breath is not so clear. The lack of strong sensation means that the mind is less likely to stay put there and is more likely to wander off into thought. So if you notice this phenomena, that part of your breath cycle is less clear than any other, just softly remind yourself to stay present, to get through that particular part of the cycle until stronger sensations become evident again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. When you find yourself caught up in thoughts, you can perhaps become aware of the power of compulsion. Perhaps you become aware of the power or the energy of wanting to think or the tremendous pull we have sometimes to get involved in certain ideas. Sometimes we just softly float into thinking about something and sometimes we're grabbed or pulled or we reach out for it. In the non-discursive field of awareness, you might also note the impulse, the feeling of that impulse to be involved in thoughts, allowing it to be there in the spaciousness of mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you begin being with how things really are for you in a deeper way, the undercurrents of your life. And as you do that, you find out more what runs your life in a conscious way and also you begin to allow yourself to process that or to release it and to find a more balanced, caffeine-free life. But it takes a while and it might mean facing actually some very difficult things for a while. Some people, a tremendous fear might arise. And so hopefully my telling you this might happen gives you enough reassurance that's useful to go through it. So let's sit again.
