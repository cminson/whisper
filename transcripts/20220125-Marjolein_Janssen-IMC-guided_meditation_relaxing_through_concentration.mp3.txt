So first of all, I'd like to acknowledge that the great Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh has passed away a few days ago. 
And I heard that the Thich Nhat Hanh community is remembering him by creating a field of loving kindness, by sending loving kindness to Thay as he was sometimes called by his students. 
So maybe we can, in the spirit of that kindness, dedicate the practice of today to him if it feels right to you. 
It doesn't have to be like this, of course. 
We can hold him in our hearts, with kindness today, maybe, and the sangha, the people that he touched. 
And I'd like to share a quote by Thich Nhat Hanh that resonates with the theme of today. 
It's reading in, I call body and mind. 
Reading out, I smile. 
Dwelling in the present moment, I know this is the only moment. 
So, yeah, we'll be talking about concentration today. 
Andrea started that topic. 
And so the meditation that we're going to do is also going to be a concentration meditation. 
And concentration can be a very useful way to relax, to release tension, to cultivate calmness and ease. 
So today in a meditation, you might get a little bit of a taste of that. 
And there's different concentration objects possible. 
And today I'll guide by using the breath. 
But if the breath's not working for you, if it isn't like at least a neutral object, then please pick something else, maybe the body, where the body contacts the surface, like the feet, the buttocks, the hands. 
You can circle between those contact points, for example, and if you already have another object that works for you, and then you can use that to us, of course. 
But the guidance will be with the breath, but know that you can replace that if you need to. 
So there's a little bit of an introduction to the meditation. 
And then settle into the meditation posture and now guide for a first little bit and then we'll sit in silence. 
Whenever you're ready, you can close your eyes if it feels right to you. 
I can start with bringing attention to the body. 
I'm being present for this moment in the body. 
Feel the feet on the floor or the surface. 
I'm curious about the sensations in the feet. 
Could be hardness or softness. 
Warm coolness. 
Roughness, smoothness. 
Or it is, could just be present for it. 
It can be present for the sensations in the buttocks, touching the chair, cushion, couch. 
And maybe touching each other, touching the legs, arm rests. 
That's a way to settle in a little bit into this meditation. 
There's one way of cultivating concentration as well. 
You can use during this meditation if you need to circle through these three contact points. 
You can make contact with the breath. 
Feel the breath coming into the nostrils, down the suffcase, into the chest, belly. 
Feel every little sensation caused by the breath. 
For now you can let go of everything else in your life, the hustle and bustle of every day, thoughts, feelings, emotions that might arise. 
You can just say, not right now, now I'm going to focus on the breath. 
You can become aware of just this in-breath. 
You're really curious what it feels like to breathe in. 
What does it feel like in the nose, in the throat, in the chest, in the belly? Do you feel pressure, relaxation, coolness and warmth? You necessarily have to give any labels or names to what you're experiencing, just a direct experience of the in-breath and then also the out-breath. 
Just really present only for this out-breath. 
Don't have to do anything else right now. 
Nothing else is important right now. 
You don't have to go anywhere. 
You don't have to be anything. 
Just only this in-breath. 
Just only this out-breath. 
Any thoughts, emotions, arise? You can thank them for being here. 
And then with kindness go back to the breath. 
Breathe in, breathe out. 
If nothing else exists, only this breath. 
Breathe in, breathe out. 
And try to be aware of the breath from a gentle kindness. 
And what can help is to just receive the breath, not go out, look for it, but to lean back and receive it. 
And be still really present for it, but in a relaxed, receiving way. 
Breathe in, breathe out. 
For the remainder of the meditation, you can continue this practice of focusing on the breath. 
Or you can open up to other experiences as well. 
You can do more of an open awareness practice, or do the practice that you're used to. 
And we'll sit in silence. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Breathing in my calm body and mind. 
Breathing out my smile. 
Veling in the present moment. 
I know this is the only moment. 
Tick not on. 
If you haven't opened up to other objects yet, then you're still with the breath. 
You need to slowly incorporate some other objects in your meditation. 
Start with coming aware of sounds. 
Breath. 
Being aware of breath and sounds. 
Whatever is most obvious. 
And also allow other body sensations to arise in awareness. 
Breathing in. 
Maybe warmth or coolness. 
Pressure. 
Let me come aware of what's happening in the mind. 
Thinking. 
Ealing. 
Emotions. 
Whatever arises. 
Emotions. 
And this meditation by sharing the merits. 
Every time we meditate, we generate wholesome and beneficial and beautiful energies. 
Even if we are going through something difficult in our meditation, still our intention generates this wholesomeness. 
Our intention to meditate. 
And we can share this. 
We can share it with tick not on where every is. 
Or we can share this with everyone who has been touched by tick not on. 
Or with all beings everywhere. 
So may everyone who is touched by tick not on and may all beings everywhere. 
Benefit from our wholesome energies in generated during this meditation. 
Be free from suffering. 
Be free.
