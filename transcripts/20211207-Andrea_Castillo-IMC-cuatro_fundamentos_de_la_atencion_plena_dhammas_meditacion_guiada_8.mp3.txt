Close your eyes.
Just take notes of how they are in a very general way.
And now, consciously, we are going to bring attention to breathing.
Remembering that it is a very soft attention.
We want to note to begin the sensations of breathing.
This movement that we feel in the body, the inhaler and the exhaler.
Remembering that we are only witnesses of this breathing.
Remembering that this body breathes naturally.
We are also going to note the difference between putting attention to the sensations of breathing.
Not feeling when the air enters and when it comes out. And putting attention to breathing.
Putting attention to breathing would be to be aware of the length of each inhalation and exhalation.
We take a moment to note if in general our inhalations are long or short and the same with exhalation.
And especially at the beginning of the meditation, we want to establish a very clear intention of telling the mind.
We are going to be aware of the instructions of the meditation.
Every time we go slowly, we are going to return to the present moment.
Now we are going to include the whole body in our contemplation and at the same time we are going to put attention to breathing.
We start by being aware of the inhalation and exhalation.
Now we bring the attention to the different parts of the body that we are going to do a complete scan of the body.
We bring the attention to the head and the neck.
Letting go. Letting go. Any tension that we are ready to release in this area of the head and neck.
By mentioning these parts of the body, we visualize them, we feel them and at the same time we keep this attention to breathing.
That is, a double attention to the parts of the body and the inhalation and exhalation.
The third part is to release these parts, head, neck, letting go.
Ombres, arms, hands, letting go.
Inhalation and exhalation.
Ombres, chest and abdomen.
Letting go. Ombres, chest and abdomen.
Letting go.
Inhalation, exhalation. Ombres, back, hips.
Letting go.
Letting go.
Conscious of the inhalation and exhalation.
Chest, arms, knees.
Letting go.
Conscious of the inhalation and exhalation.
knees, hips and feet.
Letting go.
Letting go of the attention to any part of the body that needs a little more attention.
Feeling the breath in that part of the body and letting go.
Some moments in silence connecting with our whole body and breathing.
The body guide.
Having cultivated stability in the body and mind.
Let's move on now from the first foundation of the body to the last foundation.
Tams or factors of the experience.
Let's start by contemplating the presence or absence of the five obstacles.
In a very simple way. Notifying if at this moment in the mind there is a desire, a sensual desire.
Notifying if at this moment there is a desire, a sensual desire.
At this moment there is no sensual desire, we can be happy to be free from this obstacle.
And if there is a desire, we do not remember the temporality that these desires go and change constantly.
We do not look at these desires with perspective.
This contemplation of the five obstacles is like being born clean in our inner world.
Now we investigate the presence or absence of the evil will, something that we do not think about when there is aversion.
We can notice how the body feels when there is a bad will.
And we can work on the antidote, which would be the benevolent desires.
In the absence of the evil will, we are not happy. It is like removing a weight from above.
The important thing is to really investigate with curiosity if these states are present.
And now we investigate if there is a presence of aversion or aversion.
This nightmare in the body or the nightmare in the mind.
If they are present, we can sit very straight, inhale deeply and remember our mortality.
How long do we have to be healthy and be able to practice? We do not know.
And if at the moment we are free from fatigue and delay, we can be happy.
Moving on to the fourth obstacle, we notice if there is agitation or worry, agitation in the body, worry in the mind.
It can be at a lower or higher degree. In any way, we cultivate the antidote, which would be to unify the mind,
concentrating it, focusing on breathing. Very simple, inhalation, exhalation.
And if we are free from agitation and worry, we sit this lightness in the body, in the mind, we can be happy.
And if we are free from agitation, we can be happy.
And the last obstacle, the doubt. We notice if there is a doubt in the mind at this moment.
If this is the case, we remember that this practice has supported us.
And if we are free from doubt, we can notice how pleasant it is when the mind can focus on the practice with conviction and enthusiasm.
And if we are free from agitation, we can be happy.
That's it, we finished the first list that we have in this fourth foundation.
These five states that stop us in the progress of our path.
And now we move on to the list of the seven factors of awakening.
In this list of contrast, it supports us to progress on the path.
There are seven very beautiful qualities that we can cultivate in the mind.
The first is sati or full attention.
We are going to establish sati with greater force, but with a soft force, with greater intention.
Sati, we will be present with this soft, flexible, receptive, inclusive attention.
Sati.
Naturally, we want to investigate our experience at the moment.
The second factor, the investigation.
Notating how our body is now.
How is the mind?
Investigating how the body feels when sati is present or when it is absent.
We will note that if sati, the full attention, is present and we have investigated the present moment,
naturally the energy arises, so pleasant to feel the energy in the body, in the mind,
that is involved with energy in this inner world.
This sum of sati, investigation and energy naturally leads us to joy.
Pity.
This joy now goes through a more refined state of tranquility.
It is also very pleasant, but more subtle.
In the tranquility, naturally the mind unifies or concentrates.
Sati.
This unified mind now goes through the equanimity or balance.
A more subtle state and there we rest.
The equanimity is the last factor to awaken.
Not having traveled the seven factors of awakening,
we leave now that the mind and the body are still.
We keep silence for a few moments.
We keep silence for a few moments.
To conclude the meditation, we take three slow and deep breaths.
We take three slow and deep breaths.
We take three slow and deep breaths.
We take three slow and deep breaths.
We take three slow and deep breaths.
