 where she practiced meditation with two highly esteemed disciples of Ajahn Chah, Ajahn Anand and Ajahn Gama. So welcome. Thank you. Could everybody hear me? Um, I have a request. Can we make it a little bit more intimate? Feel free to bring the chairs up, and if you want to move up. Just a nicer feeling of the Sangha. And how long do you want me to talk? We need to go in by night. Okay. Okay, okay. Oh, that's nice. Much better. Much better. Yeah. It's a very sweet feeling to be here in such a great space. I'm really happy for you. Not only do you have a great teacher, Gil, but you also have a great space. So this evening I'd like to share with you some of the experiences I had living in a monastery, two different monasteries, while I was practicing in Asia this past year. Actually, I think the last time I spoke here I was just on my way. So I just got back. So it's very nice to do full circle. I think it's important to talk about monastic life and what that's like, because that is the roots of our tradition that we practice here. And although we've made many adaptations in the West to what meditation looks like, it's really important to remember that where our tradition comes from is how it's traditionally practiced. So when we make the adaptations, at least we understand what the foundations are, or I should say, what I understand them to be. I wasn't ordained when I was in Asia. There are nuns who are on eight or ten precepts, but I practiced as a layperson in the monastery for that time. So I just give you an idea of what that living was like and what it was like to be with two great meditation masters and some of the insights that I had in terms of how it helped my practice and some of the customs and traditions that I learned that were very helpful to me and that I'll share with you and that could possibly be helpful to you as well. I was lucky enough to be invited to spend the Rains Retreat with Tan Ajahn Anand who was one of Ajahn Chah's most esteemed disciples. He's very well known in Thailand for his power of metta and for his mystical powers, his ability to read minds, pass lives, and understand people through his insights into your colors, your auras, the way you walk, the way you eat, kind of one of these amazing minds that some days you're happy he understands and can see through you and the other days it's like, ah, does he have to know everything that's going on? So I was invited to spend the Rains Retreat. The Rains Retreat is the traditional time in Asia when the monks make a commitment to stay in one monastery for three months under the guidance and direction of one teacher and it's always held during the monsoon season. And the reason why the Buddha did that was because during the monsoon season there's so many bugs and insects that emerge because of the rains that the Buddha wanted to be sure the monks were able to limit the harm or damage they did on the earth during that time. So the reasoning was if you stayed in one place and practiced through stillness, through sitting meditation or just on your walking path, that you would limit the harm that you did and you would also increase your meditation practice. So that custom has been alive and well for the past 2550 or 60 years and all over Asia monks and nuns make a commitment to stay in one place during that time and it runs from the full moon of July to the full moon of October. And it's celebrated in Thailand, in Southeast Asia by great feasts at the monastery and in the evening special chanting in a Vientiane, which is a circumambulation around the temple with incense, candles and flowers chanting the qualities of the Buddha and the Dharma and the Sangha. Very, very powerful, beautiful under the full moon and many people from the village come and follow the monks in the circumambulation around the temple and do chanting as a way of kind of opening up the rains retreat. And the community comes and brings an enormous amount of supplies, everything from light bulbs to flashlights to grass mats to chocolate and cheese, the allowables, medicines, Coca-Cola, vast amounts of supplies for the monastery so you don't have to worry about the necessities or the requisites coming because you know the monastery is kind of like stacked up and then at the end of the rains retreat, the full moon of October, the same thing happens, the village comes and offers an enormous amount of supplies to replenish what's been used, again, soap, Q-tips, washing up liquid, the storeroom of the monastery kind of looks like Costco. It's amazing, just enormous amounts of toilet paper and sponges and just everything that you'd need to keep a monastery and the monks and nuns going for that time. So I was invited by Ajahn Anand to go to one of his small branch monasteries, which only had seven of us, I was the only woman and there were six monks and we were expected to follow a fairly rigorous program during that three months of getting up about three-thirty, between three and three-thirty in the morning, going to the morning chanting and meditation till about five or five-thirty and then around six when the dawn came up, the monks would go on Bindabhat, which is the alms gathering and I would stay behind and they'd come back, the alms food would be sorted out on different trays, there was a vegetarian tray, there's a tray for curries, there's a tray for noodles, there's a tray for desserts, there's a tray for beverages and then about seven-thirty or eight, the food that comes back as I said is organized and then I as the woman or as the lay person would re-offer it to the monks. The monks sit on, according to seniority, there's a Buddha image and then Ajahn Anand the abbot of the branch monastery and then the monks according to seniority and then me, I didn't sit in the line, women are very separated and then the monks would eat their food, the food would get passed along on a kind of trolley and then I would bring it out to the kitchen and I would eat my meal in silence, sometimes there'd be lay people who would come and we'd all eat together but primarily I would eat alone and then wash up afterward and the day basically from maybe nine or nine-thirty in the morning till three was spent in my kuti which is a meditation hut that I had at the edge of the forest and would be spent alternating, sitting and walking until about three o'clock and then there was a work period from about three to four or four-thirty, gardening, cleaning up the kitchen, cleaning out the refrigerator. By the way, the kitchen was basically a cement floor with a sink on the ground, kind of an indent. It's like if this was the cement floor and then there was an indentation, this would be the sink and there was a spigot. But there was a refrigerator and there was electricity and there was a table for chopping things. Sometimes apples came in or things came in to be cooked like eggs, I would use a small gas stove. The rule the Buddha set down is that the monks have to go and bend about every day by the way and no food is allowed to be kept overnight so whatever wasn't eaten, people in the village would come and take it and they would distribute to the hospital, they'd distribute it to workers at the monastery or to schools and then it starts all over again every day. The rule the Buddha set down was so that the monks wouldn't isolate themselves and just hang out in the forest that they had to every day go and bend about as a reminder of the natural interdependence that we have with each other. That the monks inspire us from a spiritual point of view but the monks also depend on us for the requisites, food, lodging, robes and medicine. During the work period, getting back to that, the monks would sweep and there's always chores to do around a monastery, cleaning up. The monks are allowed to sweep but they're not allowed to garden because again in gardening you might harm bugs and their Vinaya, their code of ethics, it's so strict that they're not allowed to do that. I did, I did a lot of gardening. And then at about 4-30 the monks would have tea together but sometimes I was invited, most of the time I wasn't, I waited for tea alone. And then we'd gather again about 7 or 7.30 for evening meditation and chanting. So it's a very rigorous, very physically demanding schedule from as I said 3 or 3.30 until maybe 10 or 11 in the evening. And following the drama of the day, you know, getting up before sunrise and then seeing the sunrise, seeing the monks kind of go off into the forest with their arms, bowls, barefoot and then having them come back, you know, with their food, organizing it, offering it, eating, cleaning up, meditating, sitting, walking, sitting, walking, chores, tea, chanting. You know, a really gorgeous rhythm is established not just in your practice but in your body because your body begins to feel the rhythm of the day and the drama of nature as the sun comes up and as it goes down. And I really began to feel in a very visceral way why the Buddha said it was so important to practice in a forest, you know, that the, because the forest is a mirror of nature, of the cycles of life and death, of, you know, rising and passing away. And of, you know, the suffering, you know, that you see in the little animals and the, and just people, insects and how all beings kind of fighting for their lives, their small little lives. And the, the, the sealer, the virtue of non-interference with nature. There was a pond in the back of the monastery in the, in the abbot used to feed the fish at the end of the day, some of the fruit, fruit or some old bread and out of his metta for the fish, you know, wanting the fish to be a lot, you know, to be fed and well looked after. And there was such a sweetness to being around these virtuous people who lived this life of non-interference and who respected the rhythms of nature. And, you know, I, for myself, I really hadn't lived that closely to nature. I hadn't really had that opportunity, you know, briefly camping and going to Yosemite and hiking and things like that, but never have I ever had that opportunity to really put myself, by making a commitment to the precepts, to put myself in such a harmonious view with the nature that was around me. I followed eight precepts. The first, you know, that we all take and follow are the commitment not to hurt or harm any living, living being. And believe me, there's lots of living beings. During the rainy season, I saw, you know, a snake lived in, there was a, I had this kuti and around the kuti is like a little moat. So the bugs, for the ants, which there are millions of in Asia, don't get in and up, which they do anyway. And then a snake lived in it and an owl lived in my tree. So you don't hurt or harm any living being, you don't take what's not given. You avoid any kind of sexual misconduct, which in a monastery means no sexual activity at all, and no touching. You can't, women can touch each other, but you don't touch any men, or I mean specifically monks for sure. But men, even if a man comes, you don't shake hands or anything like that. No touching. And you don't use any kind of false or harmful speech and take any kind of drinks and drugs, which cloud the mind. The sixth, seventh and eighth precepts is you don't need any solid food afternoon. So you eat one meal a day. As I said, that was about any time between 730 and 830 in the morning. And you don't do any adornment. So you can't wear makeup, you're not supposed to wear jewelry. I wore my watch and my ring, but wedding band. But you really, I probably shouldn't have, but I did. But when it got so hot, when it got to be about 100, I had to take my rings and my watch off because my body swelled so much, it was very painful. So no mirrors in the monastery. And then you also make a commitment to sleep on the floor and not sleep on any high or luxurious bedding. So the outer life of the monastery is pretty austere. So there's no real comfort. There's no couch to snuggle up on with a good book and there's no bed you can look forward to getting into at the end of a hard day looking at your mind. There's no chairs really to sit on. There's one or two plastic chairs around, but they weren't very comfortable. So the message is you've really got to find comfort inside yourself. That the external comfort chest is not there. So it's physically a mirror of the fact that you have to constantly be looking within for any kind of softness because the outer world is pretty darn hard edged. But I was lucky because I was around Thanajan Anand who was really such an incredible living example of a pure mind, Bori Soot of Mehta. His practice is so advanced and his heart is so pure that when you're around him, he just emanates the heart of loving kindness. And I've never had that opportunity before to be around a living example of what the Buddha taught and what the Buddha asked us to aspire to, which is to uproot greed, hatred and delusion in our minds. And so when you meet somebody who's actually done that and is a living example of the fruits of the practice, I can only tell you it just changed me in a very deep and visceral way because I just hadn't been exposed or in connection to a being who had such loving kindness and such compassion without any sentimentality at all. His whole being was met, his whole being was karuna and wisdom, but not sentimental because he was basically rooted in wisdom. It lives the life of understanding that life is characterized by unsatisfactoriness and permanence and emptiness. So his stainless being just inspired me to ground myself as often as I could remember in this very moment, that he's done everything that we have to do in order to liberate our hearts and minds. He didn't skip over any steps, he's just a living example of somebody who's very advanced on the path. And so when I saw him every day, or when I thought of him and when I still do, my heart glows and sings because I just am so inspired that a being could walk on the earth so lightly and so virtually and so wisely and so kindly by the very practice that you and I do every day and that his advancement has changed lives because what these monasteries are, they make a commitment to help people who make the commitment to them, is that they lead these monasteries, beings like Tanajan Anand and Ajam Ganha, the second master I studied with, they open monasteries and people come and ordain with them and make commitments to them and that's what they do. They lead people, they become their guiding teacher to help liberate other beings and to think that as we sit here in Redwood City, Ajahn Chah has 300 monasteries in Thailand, mostly in Thailand but all over the world, where beings are committed to liberation and Ajahn Chah's disciples have strong enough minds and hearts to attract monks and nuns, mostly Asian, some Americans, some Westerners, who make a full time job, that's their job, is to purify their heart and mind and then to go out and teach other people the Buddha's way and to inspire them. And they do because in Asia it's important for you to know and for us to remember here that all the teachings are given 100% freely. When you go to a monastery you cannot buy anything, there's nothing to buy. You are given everything. The only way you can give anything is if it's a donation, if you need clothes, if you need books, if you need tapes, if you need q-tips through your ears, if you need anything is given and everything is given. So there's nothing you can buy at a monastery, the only thing you can do is let go and give. And I was so inspired by that, I was so inspired by the power of goodness and generosity, you know, that the practice is so revered in Asia. It's so highly regarded as a beautiful way, beautiful and meritorious way to spend a life that there are thousands of monasteries in Asia, Ajahn Chai has about 300 of them, thousands, where you can just go and walk in and that's it. That's it, you just go and they show you a kutti and they tell you where the teacher is and what time the meal is and that's it. You know, whatever you need you just say and you get it. And when you leave, if you want to give a donation you do and for whatever reason you don't or you can't, you don't. And the system just goes on the goodness and generosity of people believing in the teacher and believing in the Buddhist teachings and the path. So I just cracked my heart open, you know, that this was given to me and seeing the system in operation where sometimes I would go out and offer alms food and the monks walk in meditation, walking meditation, their eyes are down, kind of they're cast down. There's no eye to eye contact and the people in the village line up every morning at dawn, you know, there's probably about half a million monks in Asia, they're all fed on generosity and they walk through in a line and people bow to the monks and, you know, without making eye contact, spoon into the bowl. And when the bowl is full, it's dumped out into a truck usually or an assistant kind of takes because they're given so much food, truckloads of food sometimes because it's considered a merit to offer food to monks and nuns or holy people. And there's no eye contact, there's no exchange, there's respect for the monks that are meditating and it's good enough that you make the offering to the Sangha without anything in return. Sometimes monks offer a blessing, it depends on the custom of the monaster, sometimes you're offered a blessing, sometimes the monk just, after you've given it, they'll just walk away. So, you know, the opportunity to practice in a Buddhist country, you know, was so, besides the schedule and fitting into the rhythms of the monastic life, to feel the support, you mentioned Redwood City getting up in the morning and lining up to give food to the holy people as a way of starting the day. You know, I think of the way I started my day for half my life, more than half my life, is what am I going to wear, what's the weather, is it going to be traffic, you know, all the hassles of the day, they wake up and think, you know, got to put the rice on, the monks are coming. You know, it's a whole different orientation and you see these little babies, you know, six months old and they grab a fistful of rice and they let go and everybody claps, you know, and it's from the babies to the grandmothers, you know, these hunched back, then people feeding the monks all their, you know, their whole life, every day and it's a whole community thing, you know, and one of the places I practice, you know, they'd say, Prabh matuṁ, that means the monks are coming and everybody gets, you know, crouches down and so it's a whole feeling in the towns and the villages. This is what you do, you know, they, the monks lift us up and provide spiritual guidance and spiritual inspiration and then the, you know, we offer them the physical requisites that they need in order to work on liberating their hearts of greed, hatred and delusion. So one of the other things that it's really important to communicate about monastic life that I had no idea until I lived in one for almost a year is that the meditation teacher is like, you know, what we consider, you know, the local, the local therapist of the life, you know, the local priest, you know, we don't, in the West, and I'm speaking as a psychologist, you know, we have a whole cult around confidentiality and privacy and you go to a doctor these days and they give you like 18 pages of your, you know, your privacy and, you know, laws and rights and go to a therapist and you're, you know, you're, as a psychologist, you know, you're bound by confidentiality unless someone's going to murder somebody or threaten to kill themselves, you cannot, you know, to tell anybody what's going on in that relationship. You know, I can go to jail, so could probably many of you in the room. So we're talking privacy, you know, is a very Western notion and it really stokes the sense of self that we have. Because in Asia, what happens is the teacher would sit here and there'd be a group of people this big or 70 or 100 people or maybe there'd be a handful, but this, this would be a common crowd. And you come and you just say to the teacher, you know, CONTROLLER my husband has a lover or my son is a gambler or, you know, I just lost my job or, you know, I'm having trouble, you know, and, you know, with my health, whatever it is, it's just, it's just out there. And there's no confidentiality. And I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm you are going to be able to feel something like that and it feels it, that it feels it. The doors aren't pointing to you. You're just saying the big things that we feel. The longs have to be just going to keep moving away. So there's this button. So this is the button, you know, this button who lives on the other by itself. There's nowrong thing going on that can't take the.", you can do what it Panda, you can go do this Throwback took, it took her just a more comprehensive about how long the Bro. So he didn't give you his decision. hundred and twenty dollars for the therapist and it's you know you have your your confidential therapy session that's kept a secret unless you know unless you're a danger to anybody and you go to jail if you break it and nothing like that it's just out there and you know when you are around this enough and you just hear the cycle of Dukkha you know the illness the grief the you know relationship problems the you know the the angst of human the human condition it changes your it changes your relationship to it because you realize you know it's just all the one unhappy family of Dukkha that's what it is you know it's just a different it's just different mouths saying it but you know the person who's talking about illness and death and grief you know it's just a matter of time when that's on our lips right just a matter of time it's not like we're gonna escape it and the person that's discussing you know family problems or betrayals or gossip or you know whatever the hurts of the heart are again it's just you know who hasn't who hasn't felt that who hasn't experienced it and if it's not your specific story it's good enough as a story of hurt you know or anger or disappointment or you know fill in the blank so it was tremendous learning for me that you know there isn't that all the ways that I've been trained to protect you know my own self and the self of others who trusted me you know it's caused a lot of pain and it's only kind of stoked the illusion that I'm somehow special or different and these problems have to be isolated from the community at large in this you know in this one-on-one situation where I learned so much just by sitting there and listening to people's dukkah you know and then listening to the master and what what he would say to them in response and being able to be in his presence when people would talk about the pain of grief the pain of loss the pain of disappointment the pain of life and their response of listening carefully and taking it in and giving their wisdom whatever that was to help these people who would bow to them and make offerings and then they would leave sometimes you'd see them again sometimes you wouldn't and it was really a way it was such a practice in and of itself and by the way it wasn't any hours on the door and no appointments just all day long people would come basically these masters have no private life they're basically you know they're the village supports them or the towns they live in and and that's their that's their responsibility back so someone dies they do the funeral you know there's a problem they go to the hospital that's what they do it's quote their job their job is to liberate help liberate the monks and nuns of people who come and study under their guide practice under their guidance and it's also their responsibility to help the people who who offer them the requisites every day so I'm here to tell you that when seeing the system in operation you know it was really a life-changing opportunity for me to understand the machinery of the practice and how the machine really works and then the the outcome you know the fruits of the of how it happens and the the the rhythm of of monastic life and and how it impacts you know it's it's quite a gorgeous way to live you know so virtuously under the guidance of a wise being but it's also I could just I was practicing as a laywoman you know it was the hardest thing I've ever done physically as I explained you know there was just no comfort no comfort at all and mentally you know all the demons come out they actually the masters actually laugh and they call it that the Watt monastery is actually a hospital wrong paya bond is it's a hospital for your defilements your key laces and that's what happens you know you go there and you know you have to look at your mind all these many hours with virtually no distractions you know the sense world is not available to you in terms of radio TV simple conversations etc because you're on your own nothing we could you could talk but you're not supposed to you know chat it up you know so to be thrown on your own mind in a forest where there's no comfort you know is a very difficult thing to do so as I said to both of my teachers when I came and paid respects and bowed to them when I first came I felt very different when I came and paid respects and said goodbye because you really you really understand you know how hard and demanding it is to really change the mind to change the heart you know it's it's it's a formidable thing to do so when you're sitting at the feet of someone who's done it and you bow to them and you make offerings to them you know you really the bow takes on a whole different meaning because you're really bowing to that to the their purification what they've done with their hearts and minds so it was real honor to be able to pay respects to both ajana na na na jangana because you see the life that they leave is so virtuous and how they're dedicated to helping people and how they do it you know completely from their goodness without any you know the only economy they have is goodness and kindness and tenderness that's all they have they can't offer you know what they offer you the priceless Dharma there was one time when a elderly woman from the village came and she puttered up on her motorcycle everybody rides a motorcycle in Thailand it's absolutely hair amazingly frightening because people drive tonic and get down the middle of the road and out they just nobody looks and they go about 90 miles an hour and people are getting killed all the time and anyway this woman puttered up and she told I did a nun how her son basically taken her life savings he was a crook he'd kind of gambled it away unwind woman and song and she had nothing left and she didn't know what to do and you have to see I did a nun's response you know just taking in that that dukkah with that truth of her life you know an old woman his son ripped her off you know it's awful story right and he listened and he said you know that she said should I see him should I you know how should I handle it and he said yes you should see him and basically he said nothing more to lose he'd taken everything and then he asked her you know did she have enough food and she said yes and you know could she stay where she lived and he said yes well you know if you are hungry you come here and if you need medicine and you don't have it I'll give it to you you know if you're lonely you come here you know so that was her refuge you know she's probably been feeding him he's been at that monastery for 20 years she's probably I don't know but my guess is she's probably fed him for 20 years in support of the monastery and you know he with his great heart of loving kindness listening to this story which was so sad you know and just making sure that he she knew that she could always come to the monastery and that he would help her if she needed it and when I switched by the way I was the only woman for most of six months there was another woman who came for about a month and then I switched monasteries to ajangunha who is another esteemed disciple of ajangcha and there was he actually has a separate under the auspices of his main monastery there's also a women's section where he had nine nine nuns and I was so happy to be with other women no one spoke English but didn't want to quibble my tie is pretty lousy but I was able to get by considering I was silent most of the time but you know again being with ajangunha and being with these nuns who one nun who lived to the left of me has been a nun since she was 15 she's about 33 and then the nun to the right of me is 50 around my age and she's been a nun since she's 20 and you know the rate of a collective radiance of these nine nuns was just you know just blow my mind you know they're just you know after being with these monks and monks and monks are given so much respect and women are kind of you know there to serve them but then to be in the monastery with this group of nuns who you know we would bow down to and treat very similarly in terms of the respect they were afforded and certainly deserved it was such a honor and pleasure and that they really knew nothing of the world you know that their whole life had been just dedicated to the Dharma you know the monk the monks kind of come and go and sometimes the monks will just ordained for a rains retreat you know invite in Thailand is so respectful of monasticism that by law an employer has to let you off and give you your job back kind of like a maternity leave law you can't fire somebody for going taking maternity leave you can't fire somebody for ordaining for the rains retreat so monks come and go but this group of women was just amazing to practice with these people who most of them are dedicated their whole life the head nun have been a nun for 40 years under Ajahn Chahd her radiance just like yeah pull me away so one of the rituals that I just wanted to share with you is that when you dedicate merit and every day you know would dedicate merit to either the people who would help feed us or to family and friends to the teacher to the community of monks and nuns to you know and to all general basically to all beings everywhere that they wish that all beings are ultimately affected by the fruits of our practice as pathetic as I felt mine was sometimes it's still if I had anything to offer you know be my guest take it there's another category that I learned about that I just fell in love with which is called jai jao kum nai win which is a category of beings that anybody you have a karmic debt with from an aunt you know an aunt that you may have stepped on inadvertently to somebody in any kind of past life that you may have wronged jao kum nai win that you also hope that your dedication of your merit goes to just purifying that karmic debt to any being that you may have cut off in a parking space you know that you may have cheated or harmed in any life you know and any this life today or you know hundreds of lives ago so that was one of the rituals I used to love including in my practice and I encourage you to jao kum nai win to anybody to any being any sentient being in any of your lifetimes that you've heard or harmed in any way may the dedication of the merit you know purify that that karmic debt so you may ultimately free yourself from that bondage and as you work on a prudent greed hatred and delusion in your life so I hope that I could go on and on but it's I want to leave some time for questions I hope that gives you a little bit of a glimpse into life in the monastery every monastery is different but they're all the same in the sense that your intention and going there is to make a dedicated effort to practice under the guidance of the teacher to do what he or she says in terms of what is expected in terms of your practice to report what's going on in your practice and and follow the guidance that's offered and to you know help in the ways that you can to to run the monastery and to fulfill the virtues of the at the Buddha laid down for harmonious life in the Sangha and that I hope that any merit that I have gained from that could be shared with you and to all beings and to jao kum nai win you know all over the planet because wouldn't that be wonderfully nice if that every day everybody asked not only to share their merit which apparently has incomparable merit just to give up the selfish mind for that one second to offer it on behalf of anybody but to offer it on behalf of you know anybody we've heard or harm for you know through the ages of our being you know so I on behalf of all of our jao kum nai win I hope that this has been helpful thank you very much so are there any questions I feel very humble in terms of the task it is to train train the mind and the heart and I feel that humility has changed the judgments I've had towards myself and towards other people for being anything other than what they are that there were you know we're all in this mess called samsara you know and we're all deluded by the you know the illness of self-view and when you get a real whiff of that living in a monastery just looking at you know that sick mind you know I think it it's changed me and that I feel more patient and more you know this is the way it is and there's no rest to it unless we have rooted you know so I get less aggravated it's more like you know business as usual right you carry that with you for hopefully a long time then you have the same forces I see how hard it is to do I understand why these monasteries you know I have more I think it's what we're trying to do in the West is infinitely more difficult infinitely because we don't have the supports we don't have the daily reminders and we don't have the renunciation that's required that you know we have so many our senses are always leak leaking you know because we're always you know when you can only eat one meal a day and you know there's no car you're constantly you can't look at a mirror you're you know you you have to wear you know you wear a black skirt and a white shirt you know you're not doing things to and you're taking cold showers you know there's you know there's something to renounce that the strength of renunciation that that inspires your practice and here you just feel you feel it leaking out more you know because you can always get distracted so it's much you know what we're trying to do in the West is just much harder takes much longer to get the same practice so my both my teachers said at least five hours a day is what they would recommend which is very humbling because we're certainly not instructed to do that you know it's like 20 minutes in the morning 20 minutes at night you know maybe an hour you know but they're very this is very unsentimental if you want to achieve stability of mind as a householder you should practice five hours a day so it's you know I could feel getting sucked back in I could feel the you know the the power the force of the seduction I hope to go back maybe not quite that long but two months or that that's yeah by the way another thing I wanted to share with you is that you know for them because they make you know they've made lifetimes of commitments to liberate themselves it's like you know being there for almost years like what's your hurry you know they think it's weird that America if you say we go on 10-day retreats or two months retreats but that doesn't even compute to them I mean that it sounds weird because their life is a retreat and it's you know it's a it's a monastic setting so when you say well you go and you go on a retreat for 10 or 20 or 30 days it's like well that's nice but like when do you met it's yeah it's like when how else do you live your life and it's so it's they don't quite get the the Western system you know because we don't have a monastic it's not a monastic practice it's a late practice so you know they kind of feel sorry for us because it's gonna take you much longer you know it's very practical their their their view of it you know this is what the Buddha said you need to do to get liberated so if you don't do it his way it's gonna just take you a lot longer and of course we don't have the liberated beings here to do that too you know because we have more late teachers so it's it's harder for them to understand the way we do it so when you say if I go back for two months and I will you know I'll take what I can get you know I will also feel from them not just the reality of you know this is kind of sad you know that this is all you can do because they think that nothing's more important that this is what you should do if you're lucky enough to hear the Buddha's teachings then why would you do anything else do you know I mean that that's their point of view they understand you know making the living and families and stuff but if you don't have a family they tell you don't start one you know that they're not into you know they don't think you know monks and marriage that that doesn't compute you know they don't monks don't get well you can be married and ordained but if you're not married they'll tell you not to get married they'll tell you to liberate your your mind instead so it's not that you know they don't grieve if you get married but it's it's a missed opportunity I mean they're very it's very as I said it's it's very ununadorned unsentimental you know that if you can you should practice in this lifetime to liberate yourself from great hatred and delusion that's what you should do if you don't that's okay I mean there's other things you can do like make offerings and be generous to the monks and nuns and visit the temple and you know and dedicate merit and and practice for you know and ask for to purify your karma this in to uphold the precepts there's things you can do but if you really want to get out of the system you know why would you be a householder you know if you really want to beat the system so yeah I will go but you know I could it's a little unnerving to go because they thought they thought my my time there which I thought was massive and you know you know just you know what you do for you hmm ten months you know enormous they think it's like what's your hurry so it's a different whole different journey it's a whole whole different thing yeah just as much much harder because you don't have the can you can do it I mean anything's possible but it's much harder if you don't have the container to do it in a monastic setting under the guidance of a teacher you know living a renunciate life because renunciation is a big part of it it's hard to do is so on the moon days on the full moon the quarter moons the three-quarter moon in the new moon so once a week people come to the monastery and practice and eat one meal a day and they stay and they you know we'll put on black and white which is a lay person's statement that you're on a precepts and they will do that once a week and that's what the Buddha encouraged no sexual relations on that day stay very quiet and inner so there is that support for lay people for sure but it's not the fast track right so only one meal a day that's all you get sir in the monastery just one meal a day eight eight thirty in the morning or so that's it and then the afternoon you can have tea usually there's some allowables like you're allowed to have prunes and dark chocolate which is kind of hot hard in Thailand because it's about a thousand degrees everything melts and cheese you're allowed but it's not a dairy country so you get this kind of like belvita cheese that would survive a nuclear war so you get in some hard candies but no meal no salad food night afternoon but the meals usually at eight or eight thirty yeah yeah yes hi nice to see you yeah I'm interested as a woman what your experience was like there and you said some things about being separate and being at the end of the line how could you determine whether you were being treated that way because you were Western oh I wasn't at the end of I wasn't part of a line because you know that it's the monks and then then you're a lay person you even you eat after them oh it's ended like yeah well it's it's a whole talk really it's a very complicated question because the Buddha said some pretty aggravating things like you know a nun an ordained nun for a hundred years right that's a long time hundred years it's lower than a monk who's been ordained for one day you know so you know and that was the way it ajang gunha's monastery you know it was you can have a ten-year-old monk a salmon era and you know he would still be higher than this nun that was practiced for 40 years so there was a lot of aggravating things but when I was with ajang gunha I could tell you this you know the women the women were the nuns were afforded tremendous respect that he trained the nuns in a really magnificent way he certainly gave me you know utmost support and encouragement in terms of telling me that there was no difference in an enlightened mind was an enlightened mind and so and I you know I saw that in practice you know the way his monk his nuns were so that limited some of the aggravation but you know it's aggravating that the the respect afforded the monastic community is very different than the respect afforded the nuns community that's the way it is as I said it's a very long conversation very long conversation but no I got very ongoing instruction and guidance from my teachers who I'm so grateful to and who I love very much and who I feel very indebted to because they were so kind you know they were so kind that no matter what my mind was doing and what mess of the state it was in you know it was just okay and there's a expression in tight the tama da normal you know tama da so you know the key laces the defilements the greed hatred delusion kind of pumping out of me you know just and the boredom and the loneliness and the you know the irritations of you know being a tropical country and the discomfort and you know the endless complaining mind you know just tama da just you know complaining you know it's just they there's no judgment you know just how do you rest in it so I just felt totally loved by them and not personal love you know just totally loved the understanding that the dukkha of just having a mind and a body you know so it was very very encouraging and that that they they gave me lots of directions in my walking practice and my sitting practice and really thinking about just the skeleton and thinking about different mantras and they really encouraged me to a lot of chanting as a way of calming the mind and stabilizing the mind so you know I felt very held and you know when because they weren't judgmental towards me you know it relaxed my own judgmental mess towards myself and that credit the inner critic which is you know so brutal and they were just that that's what minds do and I kind of torture you see it so it was very very helpful very helpful even though I could tell you it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and but I you know I understand of course it's the hardest thing you're trying to you're trying to get out of bondage you know that's what it is you're in you know that's what we're enslaved and that's why it's called since our you know the endless you know imprisonment of living in the sensory world and so we're trying to do a very very very very very difficult thing so as I lost my romance about how you know somehow I make a lot of progress or you know whatever just that's gone as I say I feel very humble and very grateful you know I feel very grateful to Gill as my teacher to ajana naan to ajanganha you know to all to any being you know who's really made a dent and who's not only made a dent but it's you know gotten out of out of this system some sorry I've gotten out of it you know it's just wow so I feel very grateful and feel very appreciative of the efforts and you know they in any moment of mindfulness is a moment of freedom so you begin to have very low expectations you know okay just this one breath this one bite this one what you know lifting moving place thing and that's you know okay that was a moment of freedom and some days just you know you get through the day it's about as good as you can say but you did it with as much mindfulness as you could with much virtue as you could you know you're given the mess that we're all in and it is a mess you know if you stop to look at the mind it's it's pretty brutal so I have a great great respect and deep appreciation as I said for the Sangha you know when you when you bow to the Buddha you bow to the Dharma you bow to the Sangha you know you're bowing to people who who are making the effort to to practice the monastic Sangha the lay Sangha you know when you bow it's if you've looked at your mind for five minutes you realize there's something to bow to because not many people are doing it if you look on the whole planet so you know every day when I practice and I don't bring up the images of my teachers I do it to inspire myself that there are beings on the planet that have done it and because of their teachers and all the way back to the Buddha you know and that any you know if there's there's big enlightenment there's you know this enlightenment you never forget it you know you're out of the system where there's little enlightenment which is just this breath and knowing that so yeah well it's pretty you know that's a good question I don't really have an occupation right now I am kind of looking for a new life I'm not sure what it's gonna be but I don't want to see I don't want to be a psychologist cuz I'm not an expert you know I mean I don't want to hold myself I don't want to do that to myself or anybody else actually well I've done I've done many different things as a psychologist last thing I did was I had a management consulting company but I don't feel very authoritative or anything these days I'd probably do something more rank and file you know I you know I used to laugh with that in Ghana to debate is the Thai word for a psychologist so I would call him to debate yai which is a big psychologist I'd be just a paid lek you know he somebody who's really understands great hatred and delusion and has beat it there they're the psychologist not me with my little thinking PhD you know I mean which is from the mind there's in the heart so I have completely different view of psychology and who I think is the psychologist do you know I mean they're the real thing so I don't I mean I'm not putting down my PhD but the book knowledge I have doesn't you know it's not what we're why we're sitting here looking at our in breath and our breath you know I mean that's a whole different thing what am I I don't know I just got back I don't know I it's very likely I'll go back again it's very likely I won't I don't know yeah I maybe I can I don't know yet yeah maybe I don't know I have it I have to I pray every day that something valuable that I can help people but I don't think I'll do it in the traditional way if you know what I mean I don't want to be set up as a doctor just doesn't feel right I mean if I have to be I will but that's not what I'm looking at looking for so I don't know if you have any ideas please email me I don't know I you know I don't know as I said I've just it's still I'm fresh off the boat as they say from and I probably will go back and for another six months or so before I start looking although I'm trying to plant seeds now what I want to do but um maybe you know that maybe I'll do the same thing I doubt it but maybe I will I just don't know and I and I kind of like not knowing because I'm open to something unusual if you know what I mean any other questions yeah well I'm very lucky because the year before I was teaching at a university in Thailand and my husband came with me he's retired retired professor and the university job didn't work out but we made some very good friends so he actually was in Thailand most of the time working on a book staying with some friends and I got to speak to him almost every day and I saw him a couple times about three times during that ten months so he wants to go back as well not not to the monastery though although he knows both my teachers and he's very supportive and he's also a student of gills but the monastic life is a little too hard for him which I totally appreciate so I feel I feel very lucky if you ever have a opportunity to go to Asia and to meet these people which there are many in Asia I hope that really my deepest wish for you is that you can do that because you know just to be around these people is and to feel their metta you know to feel like was like to be in the presence of someone with a purified mind is really a beautiful opportunity in life so I hope my deep wish for you is that you can feel that and have that with you because it never never really leaves you know when you get a whiff of that only having one very difficult physically to adjust to that, did you find that to be the case? there were so many more difficult things in my mind you know that first of all it's hot so you don't really need a lot of food and too much food just you see that the cause and effect the karma because it makes you very you know kind of languish and you want to sleep more and so you know you can have like tea or hot chocolate and you know if you're hungry or you know it's it that wasn't the hardest part wasn't the hardest part for me I slept if I was really miserable I slept you know I used sleep as a kind of comfort even though it's on the floor but you're not encouraged to do that but I would if I needed to you know because I didn't I couldn't overeat couldn't use my standard defenses so you kind of make do with what you can you know you figure it out but it's this I brought my cushion I did but there's no mats I mean there's a mat that's not a cushion it's just a grass mat I brought my own mat but there's no mat that I mean there's no cushions in the monastery they just sit on a grass mat not me I did bring my that one creature comfort it got cold at night and like just January and February but mostly I left it was about 110 I left at the end of April and it doesn't get cold no I mean they think when it gets 75 it's cold everyone walks on green now mark now mark and it's so funny because it's 70 you can barely you can finally breathe you know I think it's freezing in the winter you do January and February definitely you need blankets but during the rainy season and during you know the rest of the time we just have a sheet like a cotton sheet no blanket believe me no blanket you know everything sticks to you because it's all moist it's tropical the food by the way was interesting because I you know I made a whole career I was a psychologist for Weight Watters I've written a book on it you know God only knows I have a million food obsessions but there's something that actually very liberating about just one meal a day because you see how much you see how it's conditioned you know the boredom condition it's not hunger most of the time and if you're hungry you had a glass of hot chocolate or if there was cheese or chocolate around you know it's in it's bearable if you're hungry you're hungry well you know in a forest you're kind of schlepping around you know yeah and it's hot so you don't it's not aerobic but walking I did a lot of walking meditation but in terms of like pumping no not like that yeah sure yeah sure it's very hard because um you know that's our that's the the mind that's filled with aversion you know you just want to get rid of anything they could it is it is it is it is and that's why the the impeccable CELA the the morality that that you're asked to uphold in the monastery you know it's so important because you know it asks you to be very very conscious and to really see those desires when they come up you just want to like annihilate it you know and and you don't or you can't or whatever whatever the motivation is you know you begin to have compassion for you know if the Jews don't like the Muslims and the Muslims don't like the Christians you see the same kind of you see the same energies you don't like the bug you know you just see how it's all interconnected and that this practice that the small practices of not eliminating what's uncomfortable or ugly or or you know undesirable helps purify the mind of when you see it on a much larger level and when you can't act on your greed you can't eat or you can't you know do the things to distract you you see what that you know this the strong how you know that thought the grip that it has on your heart how painful it is had everything you know yeah I never got sick but you know it's there was a lot of unhide unhide genic things is it they were immaculate monasteries by the way immaculate and to the you know you but you know you're getting almsfood you don't know how you don't know how clean or dirty it is you drink bottled water and there's the bug situation I mean it's just you know it's it just blew my mind you know the things I saw you know the colors the sizes that swarms they you know the the the army I mean it was just incredible you know and a lot of it was inconvenient and you know that that impulse to get it out of my way or whatever it was very strong. When you say arms it was the people giving the food to the monks and that's what you ate. Yeah that's what everybody eats. Can you give us an idea of what was given? A tremendous amount of rice because rice is considered a very virtuous thing to give and then they give little bags of food like if you take a baggy they'd fill it with curry or noodles or vegetables and stir fry stir-fry things and desserts like they eat a lot of like jellied things like fruits that's like in a square jelly thing they make yogurt drinks donuts this is a rice noodles things like that I just would fill my bowl fill it with yeah I yeah well the months don't because it gets kind of rolled by them and you just take you fill your bowl for me I had all the left over and I had everything there so I could do what I wanted but you know yeah you know I ate a lot but I you know a lot of time I just it's hard to describe that I just sometimes like food just made me sick you know what I mean it's just I wasn't hungry really you know I was just dealing with some emotional upheaval and you just really understand what the Buddha meant that you you don't eat it's not really and the eating is pleasurable he doesn't say not to feel that and enjoy it but it really is to sustain the holy light that's what he said that that's the focus of your attention you know so it's not because it's your favorite food or you don't it's not you're not involved in like die do I like it or don't like it or there's always enough there's always plenty that wasn't the problem of worrying about it would be enough it was more needing to do it to fuel yourself for the day so I didn't have a lot of hunger I just want to make I just wanted to calm mind that was my hunger I didn't eat I didn't eat just rice there's always curries vegetables I didn't need any meat I didn't I didn't I had a vegetarian diet the whole time was it nutritious you know I survived it I felt bad but I don't I wouldn't say it was in my diet you know there's tons of tofu tons of tofu and tons of fish and tons of me I didn't need any of that but yeah you know you realize that you know and I know from just being in the food of being in the food industry you know made a whole profession out of it you know we mix such a big deal out of you know balance this and nutritious thing you know it's they're not they that's not the way it is it's like you appreciate food on a very different level there's always enough there's always vegetables there's always protein and anything something sweet usually the we need it's not it's not so narcissistic as we make it you know it's such a my diet my food and my you know needs and my you know unique forget it forget it it just don't it's just it's not a part of their thinking the poorest people gave food and the poorest you know everybody gives to the monks it's just a very beautiful thing you know the people will give their portion of their food to monks first they'll give the best to the monks before they'll eat for themselves Lewis I'm sorry that we're okay so again I want to thank you for inviting me and I also want to particularly thank all my teachers including Gil for helping me along and us along I wish you all well thank you very much
