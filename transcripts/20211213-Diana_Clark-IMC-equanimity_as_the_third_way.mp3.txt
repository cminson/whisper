Good evening and a really warm welcome. It's nice to see you all. Thank you for
sharing this practice. It's quite something that we come together. I'm
beginning to sit silently. I don't know, I feel touched by it in some way, that
there's people who are committed to quieting the heart and mind so that we
can show up in the world, show up for our own lives in such a way that they
might unfold differently than if we were busy, busy, busy, busy with goes on in
our hearts and minds. Maybe you've noticed that the mind and the heart, they
get into these moods. And part of mindfulness practice is just part of
noticing this, what's going on inside. And if we pay attention throughout the day,
we notice that sometimes we're thinking about the past, sometimes we're
thinking about the future. We're not so much in the present. But we might
recognize that our minds are in these grips of these moods sometimes, and
these moods can be like clouds, that they are sometimes they're dark and heavy,
or sometimes they're light and fluffy, sometimes they're really slow moving,
and sometimes they're fast moving if there's a really strong breeze. But clouds
cover up the deep blue immensity of the sky. They obscure the radiance of the
sun. They might cast shadows on the ground. They often bring rain, sleet, and
snow, such as today when it's raining. For us, it's all such good news. But we
might recognize that these clouds, these moods of the mind, they arise from this,
maybe we might say a dwelling place. And that is, you know, what the mind is
dwelling on, and in the case of if it's, we find ourselves thinking about the
past. We might have this focus on the pleasures when we think about the past
and this focus on, it's where we plane the enjoyment or the nostalgia of all
these pleasant or good things that happened in the past, or maybe we're
doing the opposite, right, where there's this focusing on the failures and the
mistakes and the missed opportunities, whichever way it might be. It affects the
mood, and then of course the mood of the mind affects the way that we're
perceiving our experiences. But whether it's about the pleasures or the
disappointments, in either way, we're a little bit off-balance, not steady, not
kind of centered. We've not seen things that's clearly maybe obscured by the
clouds. And sometimes we cling on to what we're trying to hold on to and get
pulled, and one direction is we try to hold on to it and it's slippery, and then
we hold on even tighter, and then we're getting a little bit more off-balance as
we're holding tighter and tighter. And of course the same thing happens when we
think about the future. We might be filled with hopes or high expectations, and
there's this uplift. And then we have this desire for success, a way of thinking
of all these great things that are going to happen, and then of course we
might be overcome by negative thoughts and have disappointments, or this fear
of disappointment, or a worry about failure, anxiety about losing things. It's
quite something, right? Just reflect on all the things that our minds and do
during the course of a day. And in all these scenarios, it seems like the kind
of the mind goes here and then it goes there, and there isn't a sense of mastery
that we can just choose the mind to go here, or nor is there a sense of balance.
We're just here steady. Instead there's a feeling of maybe a leaning one way or
the other. I like Abhika Bodhi very much. He said that the mind is like a drunken
driver. He's trying to go down the center but careening and going off one
way and then maybe almost hit something and then going off another way.
And drunken drivers, of course, cause a lot of damage, and in the same way our
thoughts can do this too. So I'm not saying anything you don't already know,
but these expressions of craving or attachment, so what happens when we're
often when we're thinking about the past or we're thinking about the future, this
longing for the vanished past or vanished past or having this high hopes for the
future, are both manifestations of not being really present for what's happening
here in a balanced way. So what does it mean to be balanced, to be here? We could
say that equanimity is this quality that enables the mind to hold this centered
position. One poly word that gets translated as equanimity is
patramajatata, means it's like three words squished together into one long
word and standing in the middle. So we can think of as equanimity as the middle
way, between craving and aversion, between attachment and pushing away. But
often when we use this expression middle, sometimes it might feel like a
compromise, like, okay well we don't get the extremes, okay we'll be satisfied in
the middle or there's something, a middle way can be inspiring, but it also can
also feel not so inspiring. And I heard this from Gil quite some time ago, I
don't remember when, but what if we think about instead of the middle way, if we
think of it as the third way. So instead of leaning this direction or the other
direction to a third way, something different. So it's not so much that it's
we have this stalwartness that can, even though there's these gill force winds
that doesn't move, even though it might have that quality, but that also can have
the quality of really stiffness and the sense of stuckness. But if equanimity is
not leaning or careening, but it's a third way to show up, that is with some
uprightness, some steadiness, some balance. And another word that gets
translated as equanimity is upaka, which we can translate this as seeing or seeing
the bigger picture. So not being so lost in our that experience at that moment, but
instead to be able to put things into a bigger perspective. I told this story just
recently, but you know, it had such a big impact on me when I was a teenager and
having my share of teenage angst, right, those are over. I don't know if it's easy
years for anybody, but you know, I had my share of difficulties. And as it happened,
with my father's work, that we had an opportunity to go to Europe and we visited,
you know, did touristy things, but there was something about visiting these
Roman walls that had been there for so long. Over a thousand years, I don't know
how long now, but it just all of a sudden made my pimples, the drama happening
with my friends, such a different perspective to think about, wow, how many
people have seen these walls, how many people have, you know, benefited from
them or, you know, at that time and then the tourists and even after I'm gone,
they'll still be there. So just really that different perspective really caused
a shift in my understanding and things that seemed insurmountable and
catastrophic in my teenage mind. All of a sudden, it didn't seem so bad. So part of
equanimity is being able to take that different perspective and maybe stand in
a different place, a third place, rather than over here where there's this
grasping, over here where there's this pushing away, but to be able to stand in
the middle, which might be a third place, the third way, this unshakability, this
steadiness. And so part of this equanimity allows for this even-minded
acceptance of oneself and others. I'm not talking about passivity, I'm talking
about recognizing and allowing ourselves and others to really be who they are,
with respect and care. So instead of, you know, secretly wishing they were
different so that, I don't know, for whatever reasons we might have, we don't
have any end to the reasons we have why we want things to be different or people
to be different, but this even-minded acceptance that grows out of respect,
respect for ourselves, respect for others, this even-minded acceptance that
comes from this perspective of seeing a bigger picture, instead of this idea
that we can grin and bear it or endure it or if we dig in hard enough or strong
enough that things will eventually blow over, so to speak. But equanimity points
to a third way, which is instead of sometimes when we have craving or
attachment, there's this, we're holding on, we either holding on to wanting to
things to be different or holding on to wanting more of the same. But equanimity,
this third way, is more this openness of heart, openness of mind that allows us to
see things differently and allows us to have this warmth that all of us naturally
have inside of us, but to have that, to be able to motivate us or inspire us or
direct us, make space for this beautiful heart that we all have. So when we are
present without aversion or attachment, we don't, we don't take sides, we aren't
blaming, we aren't filled with doubt or we aren't trying to get busy with
propping ourselves up or defending ourselves or you're trying to make sure
that we look good to ourselves and to others. Instead with equanimity, we have
this access to this openness, this spaciousness, this even-minded acceptance
that doesn't hold on to an opinion like, yes this is right, like there's no, that's
the opposite movement of this openness and spaciousness. So it allows all the
rejecting, the claiming, the panic, the defense, the worry, and the doubt, allows
all that to empty out in some kind of way, to drain away in some kind of way.
So equanimity, it's the tenth parami. Parami is this word that we often
translate as perfection. These are ten qualities that we can cultivate in our
daily life and on the cushion. It's also the seventh factor awakening in the fourth
brahma vahara, but what I want to point to you is that it's the tenth and this,
you know, the string of ten and often I would say actually always when these
lists, we have these lists, the Brutus Loveless, I'm a big fan of the list
myself, I know not everybody is, that's so perfectly fine of course, but the tenth
and this long list means that I'm describing this, but right, it's not so
easy. It's part of this practice and all these other qualities that other nine
that come before equanimity is a way that to help support, help create the
conditions to give rise to equanimity. I'll just name these other nine, I'm not
gonna go through them here, but so all the paramis are generosity, ethical
behavior, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truth, resolve, loving kindness,
and equanimity. So you can see that the number nine is loving kindness is this
heart to quality, maybe this part of opening or allowing this warmth of our
hearts to get expressed and to show up in this particular way. And there's a
verse that I'd like to share that's from the Teragata and that is the verse of
the monastics. There was a tradition of when they had this awakening
experience to have a verse and you might have heard of the Terigata in which
there's the nuns and this is the Teragata which are the monks, so there's
these two collections and this is the very first verse in the collection from
the monks and the monks name who says this is Subuti, so here is Subuti's
awakening poem. My little hut is roofed and pleasant, sheltered from the wind, so
rain, sky, if you wish. My mind is serene and freed, I practice wholeheartedly, so
rain, sky, if you wish. There's something very, I find very tender than the
simplicity of this. My little hut is roofed and pleasant. We can take this
literally, maybe he has a nice place to stay, but often we see that the one's body
or one's self is like a like a hut is a place in which there's an abiding, maybe
we'll say that. So the parames are ways in which we can build shelters for
ourselves, these other qualities, and this list of ten is not mindfulness, but
of course mindfulness is one too, and in a moment I'll talk about some other ways
in which we might develop these, but this idea that to be, have this feeling to be
sheltered from the wind like or rain, sky, if you wish, that whatever happens, it'll
be okay to have this sense of confidence, to have this sense of steadiness, which
comes from this sense of openness, this even-mindedness. So rain, sky, as you
please, or maybe we could, I'm putting the emphasis on sky, but maybe we could
also read the poem as so rain, sky, as you please, like whatever the rain has to
bring, whatever the sky has to bring, clouds, like I was talking about earlier
or not. The sense that it's okay, because my mind is serene and freed, I practice
wholeheartedly. Wholeheartedly. What does it like to give oneself over to the
practice instead of, okay, this is something that I'll do to fix or help me
through this rough spot, but then I'll put it aside while I go to my job, or I'm
with my family members, or working with some difficulties, but what is it like to
bring our practice in some form to everything we do? So there are many
avenues to nourish and support equanimity, and maybe I'll mention a few that
are, once I say them, you'll recognize, oh yeah, of course, but these aren't on the
traditional lists, some things that might already be part of your life. Here's
one, just showing up repeatedly, right? We all have this experience that we, if
for example, if we come to IMC regularly or we're come watch on YouTube, like
maybe sometimes it's fantastic and you feel inspired and like, oh, that just made
such a difference where it felt like they were speaking to just what I was
working with, or sometimes it feels like a dud, feels like, well, well, you know,
maybe the teacher wasn't quite right, maybe you just weren't in that space or
whatever, and then a third time you come and it's a third way, or maybe then a
fourth time you fell asleep and then again, it's exciting and like, oh yeah,
that was so great, but the more times you come, the more, the different experiences
you have, then you start to realize, oh yeah, Dermatox at IMC are not inherently
any one particular way, they're just lots of different ways, of course they are,
then we start to notice, oh yeah, is anything inherently one particular way?
Sometimes I feel this way, sometimes I feel that way, so just this idea of just
recognize what we already do is that we don't have the same exact experience,
even though we may be repeating the environment we're in or the conditions
we're setting up or something like this, so always a little bit different, and so
this helps kind of cultivate equanimity, like, oh yeah, one time it was terrible,
but one time it was great, so I'm just gonna go, because this is my practice,
and this idea that it can be a support to let go of it having to be a
particular way, and maybe like this seeing the bigger picture, stepping back and
seeing, oh yeah, sometimes it's okay, and sometimes it's not okay, and that's okay,
not insisting that it be one particular way, so whatever that might be, whether
it's, of course, right, coming to IMC or YouTube or whatever, you know, whatever
we're doing, so this is one, just to maybe reflect on these things that we do
repeatedly. I was gonna say, is brushing our teeth exactly the same every time?
No, maybe sometimes a little more toothpaste, or sometimes we're day
dreaming, or you know, it's a little, you know, right, even these things that we do
so regularly, but it's, we just loosen the grip of thinking that it's one way, as we
pay attention to our lives, or realize, nothing's really just one way.
Something else that can really be a support for equanimity is, not necessarily
on the meditation cushion, maybe, but not necessarily, is to remind ourselves of
what we already know. Things change. It's not a secret, we all know this, but
sometimes we get lost into thinking that it's gonna be like this forever, and
maybe things don't change in precisely the way we want them to change, or at the
schedule we want them to change, but this idea of inconstancy can be a
tremendous support for when we're having some difficulty, but also just to
remain even-minded, just to remain balanced, to have this third way is to not
get so completely tangled up in what's happening, and said to recognize, okay,
this is how it's showing up now, and to not deaden ourselves to it, or not
disengage, but to still be really connected, like what's happening here, but in an
open-handed way, in an open-hearted way, that allows us to see the changing
nature of rising and passing away, and feel the changing nature, and just to
notice that's its nature to change. So to just remind ourselves about the
inconstancy and changing nature of things can help with equanimity, and also I
give this little story about going to seeing these Roman ruins, which really
did, you know, all these years later, it's been a while since I've been a
teenager, right, that I still remember that, sometimes bring it to mind. So to
bring some vastness to my idea of physical space, I can think about the
universe, the stars, you know, it's a little bit mind-blowing to think about
how big the universe is, or to think in terms of time, you know, how long humans
have been here, or even for ourselves, like if we to put our mind moments into
just in our lives so far, how many different mind moments have we had, how
many different experiences have we had. So to just touch into kind of like the
vastness of whether it's space, or time, or a number of experiences that we've had
is another way that can shift our perspective and allow us maybe to
occupy this third way of equanimity. I've seen the big picture having some
steadfastness and steadiness, but with again maybe I should say without this
aloofness, this is an open-heartedness, so it's not a disconnection, it's a
staying connected, but an open-handed, open-hearted way.
Something else that can really support equanimity is the building of happiness
inside. What are the things that make us feel happy to have a experiences or
inside that don't depend on the outside conditions being just right? The example
is just being kind. We usually feel good when we're kind to other people, or even
bringing to mind memories we have when we have been kind, being generous, whether
you know there's so many different ways we can be generous, so whether it's with
resources, or giving people the benefit of the doubt, or however else that might
show up, or loving kindness, extending meta, radiating meta, or wishing the best,
wishing good will for others. There's another way in which we might cultivate
equanimity. So these are things that chances are we're doing already, but to
think about, to put them as a support for equanimity, to help us to like occupy
this third way, this middle way, tetramaja, tetah, standing in the middle. But to
consider these things that we're already doing, like, okay, yeah, this is a support
for equanimity. This is, I'm cultivating this equanimity, this steadfastness, the
steadiness, this balance that's open-hearted, open-handed, to consider
that it's cultivating it, or developing it, or strengthening it. Actually, that
itself helps cultivate and strengthen it, as opposed to, okay, I'm just doing this
because this is what I'm doing. But part of the Parame practice is just to
recognize that these things that we might already be doing, they can be a
turn to support for greater freedom for ourselves, and the way that we show up in
the world. So as part of this aspiration, or this movement towards greater and
greater freedom, or these Paramis, so to have equanimity be part of this movement
towards greater freedom, and these simple acts of kindness that we do, they're
fantastic. And maybe just note, oh yeah, this can, this, notice how we feel a little
bit more balanced when we do that, and just to make that little note, can link
it also to the freedom, which makes it a Parami, one of these perfections. So
equanimity, that word in English sounds kind of clunky, and to be sure,
Tatramaja Tata, I just like to say that word, but it's kind of clunky too. But
it's, it's a beautiful quality, and I'd like to say it's a heart quality, not
only a head quality, in which we can show up maybe in the third way, without
grabbing, clinging, attachment, and without aversion or pushing away. But
in the middle, steady, balanced.
May we all find our way with some steadiness and balance, and the way that
we are, may it be a support for others who are around us, so that our practice
can be for the benefit of all beings, everywhere. Thank you. I think, I think I'll
end there, and if you'd like to come up and ask me a question, you're welcome to
do that, or otherwise I wish you all a wonderful, rainy evening. I'm so happy
it's raining. So, thank you.
