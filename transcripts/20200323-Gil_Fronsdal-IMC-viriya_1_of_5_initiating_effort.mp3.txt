Viriya  (1 of 5): Initiating Effort  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil 
Fronsdal on March 23, 2020  
 
 
Good morning again to those who are sitting , and good 
morning for the first time to those who may be joining us 
now. Last week, next week, and for the next three 
weeks, the theme is the Five Faculties , or the Five 
Indriya s. Last week I talked about the first : faith. This 
week I will talk about the secon d: effort.  
 
I want to say something about th e word , indriya , 
‘faculties. ’ Sometimes in English they are called the Five 
Spiritual Faculties. Occasionally , I have seen it 
translated as the Five Controlling Faculties. The name 
for these five qualities comes from the name of the 
Indian god , Indra. Indriya  means something like , “of the 
god, Indra. ”  
 
In the time of the Buddha , Indra was the ruler of the 
gods. He was considered to be a friend  of human 
beings, a friend of the Buddha. To some degree , this 
ruler of the gods had dominion over them, controlled 
them and the celestial world. To associat e these five 
faculties  – qualities, capacities, abilities – with the great 
god, Indra, ruler of the  gods, gives them a high regard.  
 It may be appropriate to translate them in English as the 
Five Divine  Faculties. What I like about this language of 
divine faculties is the great respect it offers to something 
that is found within each of us. Our human abilit y to 
engage in and be present for these qualities is  
somehow special, celebrated, and valued. We find 
these faculties within ourselves as treasures , which  are 
considered to be divine. These divine abilities , which we 
already have , can be our friend for almost anything we 
do. They have a supportive quality  of helping things to 
unfold  and supporting our activities .  
 
Our Five Divine Faculties are:  
1. to have faith and confidence in what we do  
2. to make effort  
3. to be attentive or mindful in our activity  
4. to be focused , steady and concentrated as we do 
something  
5. to be wise or discerning.  
 
The faculty for this week is effort, viriya. Effort is a very 
important quality of practice. One way to understand the 
course of Buddhist practice is that it is a process of 
continual ly finding right effort. What is the right effort? 
How we make right effort changes from day to day, hour 
to hour, and sometimes minute to minute. Being attuned 
to that , and knowing how to flow and move in and out of 
the effort needed is part of the art of p ractice.  
 Some people hear the word ‘effort ,’ and are immediately 
reactive  – as if it is a burden. Effort has associations 
with hard work, needing to prove oneself, or to do or be 
something different  than being who  we are . But 
hopefully , as people develop  in the practice, the idea of  
effort becomes a delight  – second nature, easy, 
something we are well attuned to and understand. And 
we appreciate it as something divine, something we 
have , which is valuable . 
 
How effort manifests changes in the course of ti me and 
practice . During this week , I will talk about five different 
qualities of effort . For today, the first form of effort is 
initiating effort  – the effort it takes to initiate and begin 
doing Buddhist practice, to begin doing meditation. 
Without some effort, we won’t sit down to meditate. 
Without some effort, we won’t go on a retreat. Without 
some effort, we won’t bring up the mindfulness to pa y 
attention to what’s going on. There must be some 
initiating effort.  
 
Sometimes initiating effort is easy. We have 
tremendous inspiration , and are really excited about the 
opportunities to sit and meditate. We have energy  for 
this, and are engaged and wholeheartedly involved. We 
feel lucky that we can do this. Other times , it is really 
hard. There can be a lot of inertia, resistance, fear, 
laziness  – a momentum to do anything but sit quietly 
and meditate.   
Sometimes it takes a lot of effort  – maybe like manual 
labor  – just to sit down , do nothing , and be quiet. To do 
it regularly takes effort. To get up in the morning and 
decide to sit, to b e mindful throughout the day , when so 
much else is compelling and wanting attention , takes 
effort. But to initiate effort  – to say, “This is what I am 
going to do ; I am going to try this and engage in it” is 
something  we do  over and over again.  
 
We see this clearly in meditation, especially when 
people are relatively new to it , or the mind is agitated 
from a busy day . A lot of mediation is just starting over  – 
initiating  effort  again , and again , and again. The mind 
wanders off ; we come back. The mind wan ders off , and 
we start again.  
 
I like the language of starting again because every time 
we start is its own wonderful thing.  If we have the idea 
that we are trying to maintain  continuity , and then feel 
discouraged when the mind goes off, that becomes a 
burden for meditation. But whenever we notice that the 
mind has wandered off in thought and we are no longer 
mindful, we can  have a very open, generous idea that 
we are going to sit now as if it’s the very first time. We 
don’t have to carry with us the burden  of what has just 
happened. We are allowed to start afresh , as if this is 
the newest thing we are doing.  
 In a session of meditation, it might be that starting again 
is done a hundred times. That’s not wrong. It’s not a 
mistake. A tremendous amount of goo d comes from all 
those little moments of starting over, of initiating the 
effort to show up and be present again. Every moment 
of doing that is redirecting, reconditioning, a nd retraining 
the mind. It is letting go and weakening the forces of 
distraction and preoccupation  that have been 
strengthened over a lifetime of uncontrolled 
engagement in them.  
 
It’s actually a powerful thing to stop or step away from 
the habitual, compul sive way the mind operates  – to just 
be present. To be here with the present moment , with 
what’s going on, with what is obvious. Just that is great. 
If you can sustain that over time, great. But don’t 
underestimate the power of this initiating effort.  
 
Sometimes, it feels like meditation is just manual labor. 
When I am sleepy , or the mind is busy and distractible,  
it’s hard to be present. I have to keep coming back, 
keep coming back, start again, and start again. 
Depending on the circumstances in our life, it might be a 
lot of effort to start again, to keep showing up, to keep 
letting go.  
 
Initiating effort, the effort it takes to get to the cushion  or 
to go on a retreat requires a lot of organizing. Get 
tickets, go on a bus  – whatever it takes to get there . Some of that effort  to get to the cushion  is part of the 
practice itself , especially if you give care  and attention 
to how you sit down to meditate.  
 
Hopefully , you don’t do it as a burden . Maybe you make 
your meditation something beautiful. In the few minutes 
before you meditate, you don’t rush to finish everything 
you possibly can so that you meditate from being out of 
breath. Perhaps the meditation can begin five minutes 
before you sit down . Just as you begin to settle things 
around your home, be a little calmer in your activity so 
that when you come to sit, th e effort to slow down and 
be calm and present makes it easier to sit. And t he 
effort to sit is more harmonious.  
 
A lot of effort is i n initiating effort. Eventually , we don’t 
have to initiate so much. Eventually , we start being in 
the flow of effort , and we’re able to sustain it. We are 
able to stay awake more continuously in our experience. 
As we begin to stay more fully in our experie nce, and 
can maintain that to some  degree, then effort begins to 
take a different shape. Different kinds  of effort s are 
needed.  
 
Then we can ask ourselves a question. The first 
question I asked my first Zen teacher  was: “What is right 
effort? ” Finding our way to right effort when we are able 
to engage and stay engaged is a really wise question. 
That question will be  the topic for tomorrow.   
For now , I want to tell you a story about that first 
question I asked. I had just been introduced to Zen and 
to Zen meditation. I was attracted to it. The teacher had 
just given a Dharma talk and had left the Dharma hall. I 
walked up to him. I was twenty years old. This was 
forty-five years ago. I asked him, “What’s the right effort 
for doing Zen meditation?”  I don’t remember much 
about why I was asking this question. He gave me what , 
for some people,  would be a wonderful answer . But it 
wasn’t wonderful for me , because I was so new that I 
didn’t know how to understand or make sense of it. I 
probably just inter nally shrugged my shoulders and just 
let it be. It made no impression on me. Still , it was a 
wonderful answer. I asked, “What’s the right effort  for 
doing meditation ?” He looked me and said, “Who’s 
making the effort ?” That is all he said.  
 
As we go throug h this week looking at effort, we will 
look at its different aspects  and the nature of right effort. 
Perhaps there is a way in which the question of who is 
making the effort can free your effort so that it doesn’t 
carry the burden of self.  May you enjoy your effort this 
week.  Thank you .
