Okay, so welcome to this evening's Sati Center program on the exploration of the
Mangala Sutta. The Sati Center invited me to offer this session and I'm very
happy to do so. I really enjoy sharing the richness of the Buddha's teachings
with others and I also like trying to convey how these ancient texts can
inform our practice and life in today's world. So we'll be looking at the
Mangala Sutta which is Sutta 2.4 in a text called the Sutta Nipata and we're
going to look at it in a variety of ways and from a variety of angles. So I
encourage you to just follow along and allow the class to kind of paint a
picture that might have a little more detail than you might have
gotten just reading the text on your own and just for to understand the time
we're going to be going for an hour and 15 minutes until 8.45 Pacific time. So we
will begin and also end with the touching into the oral tradition that's
behind this text. The teachings of the Pali Canon were originally preserved as
oral teachings and only were written down much later and even when they were
written down the oral tradition continued and in fact continues to this day
and so for that reason it's actually important to hear the Sutta's spoken.
So that's how we're going to begin. Let me put the words of this Sutta up onto
the screen for you. So just settle back and it's a fairly short Sutta and I
will read it. If you're looking at the screen the first paragraph in blue is
the kind of the setting and then there's a question asked in purple and then the
Buddha responds to that in 11 verses that are in black on the screen. This is
what I have heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Savati in the
Jetta Grove, a Natta Pindaka's monastery. On that occasion as the night was
coming to an end a certain god of great beauty approached the Blessed One
while illuminating the whole Jetta Grove. After bowing to the Blessed One they
stood to one side and spoke averse. Many gods and humans desiring well-being are
seekers of good fortune. Please tell me the greatest good fortune. Not to
associate with fools but to associate with the wise and to honor those worthy
of honor. This is the greatest good blessing, good fortune. To live in a
suitable place having previously done good karma and to apply oneself in the
right way this is the greatest good fortune. To be educated and to have a
vocation, to be well trained in one's chosen field and to speak words that are
well spoken this is the greatest good fortune. To support one's mother and
father, to cherish one's partner and children and to have a job without
stress this is the greatest good fortune. Generosity and an upright life,
kindness toward one's relatives and the doing of blameless deeds this is the
greatest good fortune. To refrain from what is unwholesome, to abstain from all
intoxicants and to be steadfast in good qualities this is the greatest good
fortune. Respect and humility, contentment and gratitude and the timely
hearing of Dharma this is the greatest good fortune. Being patient and easy to
correct, the seeing of monks and nuns and timely discussion on Dharma this is
the greatest good fortune. Asceticism and the spiritual life, insight into the
noble truths and the seeing for oneself of nirvana this is the greatest good
fortune. A mind that remains unshaken by the ups and downs of the world,
sorrowless, stainless and safe, this is the greatest good fortune. Having
performed these things nowhere can they be conquered, they are secure wherever
they go, this is their greatest good fortune. So let's talk now about what's
going on in this Sutta, kind of talk through how the Sutta unfolds. So the
setting is that a deva, you know, comes to the Grove where the Buddha is
meditating and says that both devas and human beings are seekers of good
fortune. So it's essentially, you know, people want a good life, we want a good
life, we want things to go well in our lives and so then they ask the Buddha
what is the greatest good fortune or some translations of that word is what is
the highest blessing. So this is that word is Mongola, the Mongola Sutta and so
it means something auspicious, something that is that both arises out of goodness
and portends goodness in the future. That's what a Mongola is and many of the
teachings, remember I said this was part of a collection of texts called the
Sutta-Nipata, many of the teachings in that collection are considered by
scholars to be fairly old, fairly close to the original and these earlier
suttas seem to come from a time when the teachings weren't quite as
systematized as they were later. There weren't so many lists of eight this and
six that and so forth. So we don't see a specific list or an analytical way of
approaching the teachings here and yet the Sutta does have a structure and a
logic to it that I want to talk a little bit about. So in particular we will see
that all the components of the Eightfold Path are there. So let's have a look. At
the beginning it talks about basic choices about who we associate with. Are
we going to associate with the wise or with fools? And so it says that we
should associate with the wise and we should honor those worthy of honor so
we would have a sense for ourselves of what is worthy in the world and then it
says that we would direct ourselves rightly. So there's a sense of my life
is about doing something good, doing something worthy, something meaningful,
something valuable. So we have here the seeds of wisdom. So the first part is
about associating with the right people, his right view. Many texts talk about
the foundational value of spiritual friends on the path, associating with
the wise, having Kalyanamita and then we have directing ourselves rightly or it
says to apply oneself the right way in this translation and this is right
intention. So we have these initial forms of wisdom that launch us onto the path
essentially and then the text goes on and it names various wholesome actions. So
it names speaking words that are well-spoken. So there's wise speech. It
names having a vocation and to be talented at what one does. So there's
right livelihood. We have various actions that are beneficial, supporting one's
family, having a job without stress. That's kind of nice. Generosity and an
upright life. So that refers to upholding the precepts, right? Action. So we have
speech, action and livelihood, a sense of contributing to the community, having
a place for oneself within family and community. Responsibility, honesty and
ethical framework for one's life. So essentially we have the idea of
understanding oneself as part of a larger picture and these represent the
see-less steps on the path, ethical conduct. All three of them are there if you look. Just
not spelled out as a list. And then we get to the paragraph that says being
steadfast in good qualities. That's in the middle of one of the upcoming of the
paragraph that starts to refrain from what is unwholesome, to abstain from
intoxicants and to be steadfast in good qualities. So we start to see a switch
toward qualities. Not so much actions in the world, but qualities of oneself or
one's mind. So this development of respect, of humility, these are all
internal qualities. So we have a shift of material life now in order. We switch
over to the spiritual direction in life that kind of unfold naturally out of
having good ethics and having a sound material life. So we're moving more
deeply into the samadhi steps of the path, effort, mindfulness, concentration. We
see in there also discussing the dharma. So in hearing the dharma, that's
actually an important shift. So it's good to have a good life and to have a
good job and to support one's family. But if we never hear the dharma and
particularly never hear the noble truths about the potential end of
unsatisfactoriness in our lives, we may not get inspired to do the cultivation
necessary for awakening. So it is important that we hear the dharma at
some point, hearing the teachings about the end of suffering. And then it moves
even more deeply into the development of the mind. After that, patience, being
easy to correct. So we're into some kind of path at this point. Discussing
the dharma, making the path our own, the beginning of real panya, real wisdom is
to be able to talk about the dharma, to engage in it, to have a path that we feel
that we are on and to have to talk about that with others, either with teachers
or with spiritual friends. And then we get to asceticism and the spiritual life,
insight into the noble truths, seeing for oneself of nirvana. So we're lay people,
of course, we have not ordained as monastics, but I think for us as lay
people this could point toward, for example, attending a meditation retreat,
where temporarily we take on a very simplified life and a life that's
dedicated really just to practice, because everything else is taken care of
for us. And so then we have the wisdom of seeing truth. So now it's completely
about spiritual development. We've transitioned from material life to
kind of mental development and creation of good karma, and then into spiritual
development and the cultivation of deeper wisdom. And then the next stanza that
says, a mind that remains unshaken by the ups and downs of the world, sorrowless,
stainless and safe, that is a description of the mind of the arhant. These are common
words that are used to describe people that are completely free. It's also
interesting to note that in that paragraph, the language shifts to being
only about the mind, a mind that remains unshaken. It doesn't say a person anymore.
So it has shifted only to the mind. This is normal for the arhant. And then maybe
what's really interesting is that it doesn't end there. So apparently seeing
nirvana is not the last step of the path. Next we have after awakening, we go back
to the world of people. It's not just the loftiness of a mind achieving nirvana,
but there's going around in the world secure and in well-being. And so my
interpretation is that we come down from the mountain and and then there is just
living. There's living freely and being in our community and being an example of
freedom in the world. So we can see that the Mangala Sutta includes every step
of the Eightfold Path, begins with an initial amount of wisdom from which we
get ourselves into a good worldly situation, which we could call Sela,
getting ourselves into a good life in some sense. And then it talks about
developing the mind, which is the general meaning of the term samadhi,
cultivation of the mind. And then it culminates with the emergence of
liberating wisdom into awakening. So it shows how the components build on and
reinforce each other to create a very fortunate life, a life that is a blessing,
not just for that person, but for the people around them too, all the people in
their lives. So we could say that maybe the Eightfold Path is the greatest good
fortune in the world, the greatest thing that exists in the world. So that is, you
know, maybe just a brief exposition of the Dharma structure of the Sutta. So I
just wanted us to get all on the same page of what it is broadly saying in
terms of Dharma. But let's dive a little bit deeper now into what's going on
here. So what is really meant by this word mangala? I mean, the translations, as I
said, are blessing or good fortune. And at a surface level, that sounds like
things that we might want to be grateful for. It could also sound like
things that we are mysteriously granted by forces beyond or maybe by luck, good
luck, good fortune, right? But if we remember that it was a God who asked the
Buddha about this, we know that the gods, at least in the Indian system, the gods
are learners of the Dharma just like humans. They're not granting us things
from their Godhood. And also we know from Dharma teachings that the path is less
about luck than it is about creating certain conditions. So the things named
in the Sutta are indeed things to be grateful for when they appear in our
lives. But probably a more refined idea is to consider that they're things that
support and foster the path to freedom. So they're not just things to be enjoyed
and grateful for, but they're things to be developed. The things that we would
take some responsibility for. And as a side note, we can say that society might
not really be encouraging us in all the directions that are stated in this Sutta,
right? Mainstream society does not always encourage us to be honest or to do our
work patiently and carefully. People are regularly rewarded for cutting the
corners, sometimes even for lying. Certainly for self-aggrandizement can be
very rewarding in our society. So this Sutta also suggests that real wealth, real
blessings, come from ethics and mental development, which is not a broadly
popular idea necessarily. And yet, you know, when we are engaged with the
Eightfold Path, as I know many of you are, many of us are, it's easy to understand
what this Sutta is saying. It's easy to understand the message of this Sutta. The
path is nourishing and onward leading in ways that seeking wealth or power or
just pleasure in and of themselves are not not really that rewarding. So it's
reinforcing and encouraging us to have faith and confidence in something deeper,
maybe, than what society would necessarily reward. Okay, so then, how about us here in
the 21st century? How can we engage in this Sutta to help our life? Is it still
relevant? So we can maybe go yet a little bit deeper. I'd like to suggest that
this Sutta could be used as kind of a contemplative guide for a lay life
that's aimed toward awakening, you know, how to have a life of Dharma in a
contemporary context. If we just take the Sutta literally, it might sound a
little bit like a quaint set of ideas from an agrarian society during some
idealistic time when there wasn't war or famine or plague, right, you know, living
doing well at one's career and supporting one's family and so forth. But I think
with just a little bit of mental flexibility, we can, you know, we can
really see it as very relevant even in even in modern life right now. So in
particular, we could notice how different steps can deepen over time. It's not
that we have to take them just at their face value. It might be that we understand
them a certain way now and then we understand them a different, a certain
step, a different way a few years from now. And then after we've been practicing
for 25, 30 years, we see yet a different meaning in the very same text, this very
same part of the text. So, you know, we could start with a literal idea of
supporting one's family. You know, this text support says that we should support
our family. So we could consider that quite literally, you know, we may have
children that we are literally supporting. We may have elderly parents that are in
need of some literal support. But as we practice on the path, we begin to realize,
you know, actually, even beyond the literal material support of various ways
that I supply to people, my mindfulness practice is also somehow supporting other
people. There's a wonderful other Sutta that talks about two acrobats who are
performing together on a pole. And they eat, they notice that if they are each,
if they're trying to be mindful of the other one, you know, you be mindful of
me and all be mindful of you and that way we'll be safe. The Buddha says, no,
that isn't actually such a good idea. If each of you is mindful of your own
welfare, you will automatically be protecting the other person, you know,
if you're balancing on this pole. And our life is a lot like that. We're
balancing our life is like balancing on a pole sometimes with all of the
different relationships and jobs and things we have to take care of. And the
the two Suttas are clear that mindfulness for ourselves automatically is
protective of other people because we're not as reactive. We're more
equanimous about what's going on. And so we have more mental space to be able to
be compassionate and caring for others. So we start to see, oh, now going back to
the Mongala Sutta, support for one's parents and relatives and children is
included when I'm doing my practice. You know, when I get up and I sit every
morning before I take care of my family, that is also part of the support for
them. And then, you know, maybe we also begin to see that the word family doesn't
have to be literal. You know, of course, we have our relatives and always will by
genetics. But what about our Sangha? You know, maybe that's our chosen family as
we go through life. We have other people on the path, dear Dharma friends that are
just as close to us as family. They're our family in the world of the Dharma or
the family as heirs in the Buddhist teachings, something like that. So we
start broadening what we mean by family. Maybe we eventually mean the human family
or the family of all living beings if our heart gets very, very wide. So we can
see that the same words in the text can deepen and change over time as we
develop. And we can also loop back. It's not that this text is linear. So it's not
like we start with associating with the why is and not associating with fools.
And then we go check. I got that one. Now I'm on to stanza number two. And when I
got that one done, I can go on. It's actually, you know, we see that these
mutually reinforce and they really all develop together. For example, like
after we've developed some patience and heard the Dharma, which is, you know,
later on in the text, we may have a deeper or a different relationship with
our work and community life, which came earlier on in the Sutta. So it's not
really linear. And we don't have to sit there and read the Sutta and say, okay,
where am I at? How far have I penetrated into all these things? It's that they all
evolve together. Even the part about seeing freedom near the end, we've all
had glimpses of something that is a free like a free moment where we weren't
caught up. You know, we had that moment where 50 times before this, we would have
gotten angry at this moment and we didn't one time. And we say, wow. And then the
next moment we're back. But still, we had that moment of freedom. So even there,
we've, you know, we've already done that. And then we can move back and
continue with the other ones. So this is an advantage of these less
systematized early teachings, is that we get a more flexible idea of how Dharma
practice shapes a person's life, maybe at the cost of having to look at it a
little bit more carefully to discern, oh, that's right, the steps of the April
Path are all in there. So for a lay contemplative, let's say we're lay
contemplatives, we would explore how to be in the world, but not fully of it, if
you will. You know, how can we include renunciation and Buddhist wisdom like
Anicha, Dukha, Anata, while still participating in society. I think this
is something that we have to do each for ourselves, but suttas like this can
point us to sort of key things that we would want to look for, we would want to
pay attention to. So in a sense, this sutta is about an alignment of our body
and our speech and our mind. It's also about an alignment of our body and our
heart and our mind. It's an about an alignment of Sela, Samadhi and Panya.
There's a lot in there. So we could, we could ask, you know, which of these
dimensions named in this sutta are already robust in my life, and which ones
might be a bit neglected or things that I haven't quite focused on yet. Would
there be ways to kind of shore up the parts that aren't so well developed yet
in order that the path is more complete and more holistic? So that's something
that I offer as a possible way of reflecting on this sutta going forward,
if it, if it's of interest. So let me pause here for a moment and ask if you
have any questions at this point. And I can't see everybody on the screen. We
have quite a few people. So if you could raise your zoom hand, if you wanted to
ask a question, that would be great. That's found on the reactions tab. There's
a bar that says raise hand and you just click on on that. Does anyone have any
questions? Yeah, Shawna, please feel free to unmute. Well, I was just thinking about
my foolish family members. And, you know, I still need to be well caring of them,
even if they're foolish. And so I'm just, I'm just thinking about that. You know,
kind of like, I have to think about that more, but I was just thinking that, you
know, some of, I'm sure I'm not the only one who has foolish family members. And
what foolish, foolish means, actually, it maybe it could mean, you know, something
more toxic than the word foolish. Foolish sounds kind of almost, it sounds kind of
friendly, friendly, you know, idiosyncrasies that maybe some people have.
But I think that that here it might mean something deeper. So yeah, so the word
foolish there, Bala, is it typically means it's the opposite of wisdom. So it
means someone who is not conducting their life wisely or who does not
understand their life in a wise way. And it does have a, I think it's meant to have
a somewhat gentle sound to it, although I've heard, I've also had people react to
the word foolish and say, why is it say that? But it does, it does mean that the
person is headed for dukkha, you know, that there's some misunderstanding there.
And so that can provide a clue that one of the ways to support such people is to
have compassion. You know, we know that the way that they're acting or thinking
or speaking will eventually bring about some kind of dukkha. And if there may
not be anything we can do about that, you know, we don't need to be their dharma
teacher or always point out the right way. That doesn't always work as we know.
So we have to be more creative in our lives and finding ways to support these
people. And, you know, sometimes the best support is to internally have a lot, a lot
of clarity that we have compassion or that we have equanimity about being with
them. And that at least doesn't stir up anything more. And we can still look also
for opportunities to plant seeds of wisdom in their lives. But it can be
challenging. Sometimes the fools are our greatest teachers, though, aren't they?
Yeah. Yeah. And I think we can maybe one thing, other thing I'll say about the
fools and the wise people is that, you know, we don't understand somebody to be,
to be a fool. That person is always a fool or even that person is always wise.
These are qualities of actions or qualities of mind state that they have.
And we ourselves have our moments of foolishness and our moments of wisdom. So
we can remember that it refers really to the action and not to the, to a person
as always being forever unchangeably that way. Now, does that help? Yeah.
Okay.
Laurie, please go ahead and unmute. Hi, thank you. I'm kind of fascinated by the
the Davis and humans being together in this at the beginning. Can you say a
little bit more about what are they hanging out the same way that humans
are? Or are they, does this make them sort of equal to them in any way or cool?
Well, yeah, the David in this suit is playing the role of asking the question
of the Buddha. Yeah. And there's, you know, there's a little bit of the
cosmology and mythology of the Buddhist world being shown here. But the
understanding is that of all the different planes of being, and maybe we
don't have time to go through what they all are. But Davis and humans occupy the
planes where it's possible to learn the Dharma and practice the Dharma. And
Davis, although they're called gods, you know, that that just means they're in
the heaven, the heavenly realms, which are not permanent anymore than the human
realm is in this Buddhist understanding. And a lot of the gods there or the
Davis there are not awake. You know, you're not necessarily wise to get up
there. You go there through good karma. So people who have done good actions, have
done great acts of generosity, who have been kept the precepts in their lives
as humans, or who have cultivated various stages of concentration, can be
reborn in the Dever realms. But without insight, without penetrating wisdom into
the Four Noble Truths, the person is still not awake, and they'll have to live
out their life there and then and move on. So that's at least the kind of
literal interpretation in terms of Buddhist cosmology. We could also think
of them as states of states of mind, psychological states. You know, this is
our higher self that wonders, the part of us that wonders, how can I have a
good life? Look at this world. It's amazing. It's wonderful. It's beautiful.
It's terrible. It's tragic. Where is the path through all of this? And that's
actually quite an elevated question to ask. And so it's put in the mouth of a
Dever in this case. But certainly not all the Davis are awake. Some of them
are not all. And some of them have the ability to come into the human realm. So
without going into a lot of detail, some of the Davis do have bodies and can
can appear. Does that get it? That's a general answer.
Sort of. I mean, it's kind of lovely in a way. I mean, just to think of that. But
yeah, it's sort of working on the same in the same realms that the humans are.
What's a little extra? I don't know. They live a lot longer and their lives are
more pleasant. They have an easier time of it. In terms of the five senses, they
don't have as much physical duke as we do. But actually, here's the real kicker
is that the human realm is considered better for practice than the Dever
realm, precisely because it's a little harder. So we have just the right
combination of pleasure and pain that we are motivated to practice because we
have the course lives that are involved a lot of bodily duke and whereas the
Davis have a little bit more refined, easier time of it. And so they're not as
motivated. Things are pretty pleasant. And so it's a little harder for them to
understand impermanence and duke. Humans have an easier time with them. So it's
actually considered the most auspicious birth to be born as a human. So good
for us. The other thing I really liked and I'll just leave it is they is the
second to last line. They are secure wherever they go, I think. So people who
agree have found the real safety. Actually, I'm glad you pointed that out
because it's an echo back. This translation that I read conceals it
a little bit. But when the David comes and asks the Buddha, it says many gods and
humans desiring well being are seekers of good fortune. Other translations have a
little more nuance on that where they point out that what Davis and humans
seek is security or safety in their lives. I think the words in it, the words
that are translated do have that nuance. And so when we get to the very last
stanza where it says they are secure wherever they go, that's saying that the
highest security is to be free. It's not actually any blessing that you can get
through creating a good life. It's the insight into the Four Noble Truths and
eventually full awakening. That is really the only way in this changing world to be
completely safe. So thank you for pointing that out. Okay, Jerry, and then this will
be the last one. Thank you. So maybe I missed it. I was I was looking for and
wondering about the lack of reference to meditation and mindfulness. Maybe it was
implied somewhere or is it just not considered one of the factors of
blessings? Yeah, I think I think you're right. It's not named specifically, but
we could put it in something like the hearing of Dharma, the discussion of
Dharma. Those are not meditative. But then we have asceticism and the spiritual
life. So that word for asceticism is it's not the best translation. The word is
tapo, which literally means burning, but it also has to do with the process of
purification that one would go through, partially through doing meditation
practices is to really purify the mind at a deeper level than we can purify
through bodily action and good karma. So it's you're right, these they aren't
mindfulness and concentration like Jhana or such are not literally named, but
I'm inserting them into those later steps where the mind eventually realizes
the Four Noble Truths, and that's usually done through meditative practice.
Thank you. Okay, thank you. Good, so let's see. At this point, why don't we settle
in and do a short meditation together as yet another way to connect with these
teachings. So finding a posture where you'll be able to sit, it's just a
relatively short sitting, but if you need to move or shift slightly, it's fine to do
that. And if it's comfortable to do so, you can close your eyes. Connect in with
your body, feeling the body in the sitting posture or if you're lying down in
the lying down posture, perhaps feeling in particularly to the heart area and the
belly area, helping to lower our tension down into the body in case it's up in the
head, softening the shoulders, letting them drop away from the ears, softening
down through the belly, releasing any bracing in the arms or the legs, and
also feeling the straightness of the spine. So we have a straight core of the
body and then softening around it upright and also relaxed. In this sitting, we'll
do a recollection of some of the blessings in our life. This is not quite
the same as gratitude. Recollection of blessings means bringing to mind these
qualities, maybe even feeling them in the body, and then knowing them as good,
meaning onward leading for the path, so we bring in wisdom. So this evening, we've
all gotten to hear the dharma. Know for yourself the goodness of that. Every one
of us is at this moment healthy enough to sit for this teaching and hear it. That's
a great blessing to have that level of health.
Everyone here has enough material resources to have access to this
computer, to have the mental ability to use it. Know the goodness of that, that
it's an onward-leading part of the path.
And every one of us has done some degree, quite a bit actually, of ethical
conduct in her life. It hasn't been perfect, but it's been quite good. Just
knowing the goodness of our heart, goodness of our intentions. We all have
the ability to meditate quite rare in this world. Maybe just breathing through
the body, feeling the energy of whatever goodness you can recollect about your
life, about your path. Breathing it through every cell in the body.
Truly, we have an abundance of material and mental and spiritual blessings.
We have an abundance of material and mental and spiritual blessings.
So it feels good to do that kind of recollection. And we can note also that
other suttas say that this kind of reflection is wholesome. It's not at
all selfish. And doing a recollection like this from time to time helps us have
what's called delight in the Dharma. And it also is said to be one of the factors
that leads to samadhi, to concentration. So it's perfectly fine to be fully aware
of the goodness in our life. So I thought it would be nice if there was an
opportunity for you to discuss a little bit with each other about this sutta,
yet another way to approach it. And just so you know the timing, we'll be coming
back into the main room around 8.30, a half hour. So it's just a short breakout
group. But the question, I want to read the question first, and then I'm going to,
well then you can click on the link that's in the chat because you're
going to be looking at the sutta. So the question for you is which of these
stanzas, which of the, you know, there's the 11 stanzas of the Buddha's answer,
which one just stands out to you as relevant to your life right now? You can
kind of glance through them. You don't have to read them all in detail and think
about it in great detail. Just scan through, see what catches your eye. Does a
word, a particular word or phrase catch your eye? And if you, if you have any
thoughts about how you might engage with this path factor or aspect of your lay
life, and so you'll be in a little group and it would be nice if you could go
around, just go around twice and each person would say which stanza they've
chosen or which word or which phrase, and then go around again and say kind of
one thing on how you might engage with it. And if you get to go around a second
time, that's good too. But just find something in there that's meaningful to
you personally and share that and how you might engage with it. Good to see you
again. So then I'm curious, does anyone have anything they'd like to share in
this wider group? I'm certainly curious, what was the most interesting part of
the Suta for you or which words or phrases stood out? Does anyone have any
comments at this point? Now I see a chat that someone enjoyed the breakout room,
that's great.
Well, I'd like the next to the last answer, which is a mind that remains
unshaken, because I think so many of the things that we would like to practice is
predicated on having a mind that is not constantly moving. That's for sure, that's
for sure, and we're so much more beneficial to other people also when
we're not shaking all the time. Yeah, and then we don't end up saying the wrong
things, you know, to someone and so forth, and creating bad comments. Yeah, a lot of
wisdom in what you're saying, thank you.
Other comments? Or if there are any questions at this point, OADT, yeah. No, I
just wanted to say that it was really good to be in the breakout, because when
you're just like, you know, listening, you don't really engage, but here I was
forced to see what I really like, which one and which one I want to work on, so
thank you for that. Okay, great. And Ron.
Oh, you're still muted. You're muted, I'm mute.
Often when I become unmuted, it doesn't add anything, but like to thank you. In our
group, there was some discussion on the very last stand about security and
perhaps where security comes from, and I was wondering if you could somehow
connect that or see if there is a connection between that, and the Buddha's
teaching on dependent origination, and how self-reliance and personal
dependence comes out of a deeper understanding of dependent origination.
Hmm. So, certainly the deepest security is not to be fooled by any anything
that arises, right? So we can't be drawn in, we can't be shaken by things that
are enticing, we don't fall into wanting them, things that are difficult or
ugly or disturbing, we don't push them away and hate them. So I think that's the,
and we don't, and we see everything clearly, which, and that's the part that
would include understanding dependent origination, so non-delusion essentially.
So when we see everything clearly, including how things are interrelated
and the patterns that we know lead to dukkha and the patterns that we know
don't lead to dukkha, that lead to non-dukkha, then the mind is safe from
getting caught into the cycle that is dependent origination, right? That
describes how the mind reacting from a place of ignorance, starting from a
place of ignorance, grasps on to sense experience, creates a self, and then
suffers. So the ultimate security is not to bite the bait and not to fall into
that trap. Does that land?
Yes, that's helpful. I was also wondering if this idea of dependent
origination, this idea of cause and effect, would part of that be the fact
that, well, we are active agents, we make choices, we can create conditions.
So is that consistent with, we can create the conditions in our own
life that will generate security?
I think we could say that the earlier parts of the Mongala Sutta are
pointing exactly to that, is that we're, as I said about the Mongala, we don't
see it as something that just sort of falls from heaven to us as a blessing
or is good fortune like, oh, it was just lucky, but that we're putting
conditions in place. And a lot of the earlier part of the Sutta where it
talks about supporting one's family, having a good vocation, acting
honestly in one's work, all of these things are putting conditions in
place. And we do have some choice about that in the sense that when we can
discern which is the right way and the wrong way, we can take action, put
energy into the things that are going to further the path.
I can't quite completely endorse that language, because eventually we see
that it wasn't exactly us doing that. But that's a fine way to see it at the
beginning, is that if we act as if we're the ones making these choices, what
will unfold will be an understanding that goes beyond, that goes beyond the
need to be an actor, to be an agent. So it will it will create itself, that
that fuller picture will create itself.
Thank you very much. It's very helpful. I appreciate it.
Great. And then on the phone, is that Michael?
Hi. Yes, it's Michael. I am really grateful you put us in this in the
breakout group, because it was very sweet watered my happiness seeds and got
me thinking about the writing and action plans. And it was interesting, very
interesting and helpful. So deep bow.
Great. Thank you. It's good to hear that.
Eileen, and then, and that'll be the last one for now.
Thank you very much for this session, Kim. I'm so grateful that you pointed
out the connection with the noble eightfold path. I just saw Reddit and
saw it as a bunch of ideas, but I did not see any of the pattern, like you
were pointing out the different parts of the eightfold path. So I appreciate
highlighting that and bringing it up. I'd say the part that I related to, the
parts I related to had to do with, you know, wanting a stable mind, but not
having it. And the importance of having insight into things myself, because
I'm experiencing things that I know Dharma teachers have told me, you know,
pleasure and happiness are not the same thing and so on. But seeing it myself
has been, you know, sometimes a rude awakening. It's like, Oh, if I go for the
chocolate candy, it doesn't make me happy. But, you know, applying it day to
day and seeing that my mind is always wanting, wanting, wanting happiness.
That's what it wants. But it's doing all the wrong things to get it. So I had
to see that myself. And so having the insight yourself, it was in one of the
lines in the stands out there. Seeing it for yourself is obviously, but I'm
saying the obvious, but really had very important. Thank you.
Beautiful. It's the Dharma is so simple, but it's not easy. And, you know, making
it specific to our lives, I think is very much the point of the path. And your
question is exactly what the data asks, you know, we want to be happy. How do we
do it? And we can see in our own lives that we don't always pursue happiness in
the way that it can actually come about. And so this text says, if you actually
want happiness, these are the steps and it will work out. Great. Well, I'm
delighted to hear that it's starting to land. So there's actually, oh, let me
just do one thing first, which is that in order that we can, you know, we can
land and a little bit more smoothly. I would like to post now the Donna link
for this session. And what I'm posting is a special Donna link such that they
will know it's for this particular session. The Sati center of people will
know it's for this particular session. So then we won't have to do that at the
end. So I want to end with just one more dimension of this Suta. I said earlier
that we would both begin and end with the oral tradition. And the Mongala Suta is
a classic Suta that's used today in modern day Theravada Buddhism as in a
form of suiting cults, a form of chanting called Purita chanting. And these are
special protective blessings that are done on auspicious occasions or when
protection or healing is needed. And there's a whole bunch of them. The
Mongala Suta is one, the Meta Suta is one, you may have heard of that. Also the
Ratana Suta from the same collection and a number of other ones. So Purita chanting
is very common in Theravada countries in Asia. And if you visited a Theravada
monastery here in the West, you may have heard it also. A group of monks will
chant a series of chants. Some of them suttas like the Mongala Suta in a
particular style where the sound is nearly continuous. And it's done that
way and they can't breathe. But there's enough of them that when one drops out to
take a breath, everybody else is continuing and then they come back in
and somebody else can take a breath later. At least that's a common way to do
it. And so the listeners of these, for these chants, these Purita chants enter
into a protective field that's created by the sound and it invokes both
protection and healing and it often includes inviting deities or other
forces to come and then depart at the end. And then, you know, functionally
Purita chanting unifies a community and creates a safe emotional space that
acknowledges sometimes the troublesome or difficult aspects of life. So it has
some religious purpose also. I'm telling you all this so that because I'm going
to play the chant and you'll be able to hear and enter this field. I want to
give a little quote from Sarah Shaw who has done some work in this area. She
says, in Purita texts, guarding, blessing and the transformation of energies in a
clear and awake field of being are felt to affect the restoration of
psychological and spiritual help for the individual who needs this help and
also for the participants. So I better get to it because you only have a
couple minutes and the chant takes three minutes. So I hope you'll stay for it.
Let me get that up.
I'm going to put the text on the screen also because the chant is in Pali. See
if this works.

So you can feel the field that gets created there.
So we're at the end of our time.
I hope you've enjoyed this different angles of exploring this sutta and maybe if I hope
all of them landed, but if not, then maybe at least some of them did.
There's many different ways to engage with it.
And I hope it might be, you know, meaningful as it goes on and the world needs contemplatives
to be reflecting about their lives and how to bring about these kinds of blessings and
how to create a better world for all of us.
So just ending with a quick sharing of merit may what we've done this evening be of good
fortune and auspicious for us and for everyone that we come in contact with.
May all of you find the deep blessings of the spiritual life all the way from material
life to mental development to full awakening.
May all beings be happy, peaceful and free.
Thank you.
