Something I really appreciate about our practice is that whatever is happening can be met with mindfulness. 
We don't have to fear challenges. 
We can celebrate, we can delight in when what is arising is beautiful and wholesome. 
And we don't have to be afraid when it's some kind of reactivity. 
This practice really does allow us to open fully and asks us actually to open fully to what's in there. 
And it can be humbling. 
It can be difficult. 
And it can take courage sometimes to allow that opening, to allow the heart to stretch, to really acknowledge, yes, that too is in here. 
That experience too is part of this being. 
And that it doesn't have to be when it's some kind of a reactivity or some kind of a challenge. 
The understanding that the teachings offer us, coming back to that really foundational understanding that it's conditioned, that it grew out of the conditions of our lives, and that it's not inherently me. 
It is something that is arising right now, and it can be met and transformed. 
That's the other great thing about the practice that the way the mindfulness, allowing, meeting what's here, creates the conditions for transformation. 
Celebrate that. 
It's amazing that this simple thing that the Buddha pointed to, this simple tool of being aware of what's here in this moment, with the curiosity about what is this experience in this moment, and that's all that it is really. 
That's what mindfulness, that this wise mindfulness is, is a curiosity about what's here in this moment. 
What is the experience of being a human being feeling this thing right now, experiencing this thing right now? What is this human experience that that itself is transformative? Last week, somebody brought up, after the class, somebody brought up kind of a surprising experience. 
They said it was just, they felt blown away by a level of anger that came up in a situation connected to work. 
And just kind of the surprise at the level of reactivity that was happening. 
They made a comment that it kind of feels like there's this range of tolerance that's narrowing that they had less capacity somehow. 
Over the last nine months, I've heard a lot of this kind of thing from people, a lot of people expressing this kind of thing. 
And this is conditions. 
Understanding, in hearing this, you know, hearing from quite a few people, and experiencing myself a lessening of balance of mind at times in these last nine months. 
And the conditions of the isolation of being secluded, separated from families and friends. 
The events over the summer of the horrific racial violence against George Floyd. 
And now we're in the holidays and still again, maybe not even still, but again with restrictions in this country, at least with very strong restrictions in many places. 
The virus is raging. 
These are conditions that we can be affected by, that we are affected by. 
Old and deep patterns may be resurfacing with some people in our families. 
I found this to the kind of like patterns that I hadn't experienced in a long time, sometimes feeling like they're coming back. 
It's like, wow, I haven't seen that in a while. 
And my understanding is that it's really connected in some ways to the way I understand it kind of is when things get challenging, our mind tends to revert to its most conditioned habits. 
And so those old and deep patterns might come back. 
Our capacity to be balanced, to meet, to receive what's happening is itself conditioned. 
Some of it is conditioned based on our practice, based on our cultivation of that quality. 
And sometimes there's less capacity to have that balance of mind. 
Sometimes I think too that our capacity to be balanced is cultivated. 
It's like where we learn how to be balanced is when we hit the challenges. 
We hit those challenges and we learn how to, with our practice, we learn how to open to those challenges. 
And so it's kind of like our capacity to be balanced is cultivated to the level of the suffering that we've met. 
And so when we are in a situation where the level of suffering is maybe stronger or happening more frequently, or there's this background of kind of background struggle that's just kind of steady state, all of these things may be levels of challenge that we haven't quite met before, or that we're not quite practiced with. 
So there's that in terms of why we might be more reactive right now, that there's kind of this background level and sometimes not background just in your face kind of, here it is the holidays and I'm not able to see my family, my 87-year-old parents I haven't seen in a year, and I don't know if I'll get to see them again. 
So that's in my mind, that kind of poignancy and that tenderness. 
Also, another thing that might make or might create the experience of reactivity being strong or suddenly kind of rearing its head and being felt so fully is that when we are mindful of reactivity, we feel the suffering of it more deeply. 
And so when we do have conditions where we're a little bit less balanced, but we've cultivated mindfulness, we may be feeling the suffering more deeply. 
So I feel like it's helpful to understand some of these conditions that can lead to seems to be sudden and surprising reactivity, that it's conditions. 
This arising of that sudden and strong reactivity in particular situations is conditioned. 
And to me, remembering that, even just reminding myself of that, right, this is conditioned and maybe reflecting on some of the conditions that are present right now. 
Been alone for nine months with not having so many of my kind of resources that support me externally. 
Those are some conditions that can make it more challenging. 
So just reminding myself of that is helpful, reminding myself of that conditioned nature of what's happening. 
It's interesting at times, you know, I think it's useful when we have sudden and strong reactivity, especially if this is in relationship to what somebody else is doing. 
The person who brought it up was talking about it in connection with something that happened at work. 
And a feeling of a lack of safety, it was around COVID and, you know, a feeling of the work environment not creating a safety, a container of safety. 
So it can be useful, I think, to have some tools or some things to remember to work with, especially in daily life when reactivity happens quickly and strongly. 
Just some kind of basic things to ground in. 
You know, just recognizing being aware how, you know, wow, this is reactivity. 
This feels this and remembering this feels like suffering. 
This is suffering, grounding in the experience of that. 
What's most obvious in experience? Not what's most obvious in the external situation, what that person is doing or what they're saying, but, you know, how is this experience, what is this feeling? That this is just the basic awareness practice with reactivity. 
And then to ground yourself when reactivity is sudden and strong like that particularly, to really ground yourself in non-harming, in Sela, you know, to not act out of that reactivity in a way that would create harm, harmful speech, harmful action, not especially with speech to take care that speech is not harsh or divisive. 
Because those acting out of that energy just tends to reinforce the feeling internally, to reinforce that mind state as, you know, when that mind state motivates action, it's actually reinforcing that mind state, that reactive mind state. 
And not only that, it tends to put that out into the world and will reinforce it externally as well. 
So it's just, you know, if possible, you know, sometimes it's really challenging when things happen and flare so quickly, something's out of our mouth before we know it. 
And so another thing I like to suggest people get, explore is, you know, get really good at cleaning up the mess. 
If you've said something or done something, you know, recognize, you know, so often when we do something that's unskillful, our mind will go into these machinations of, well, that person deserved it anyway, or maybe they didn't notice, or, oh, it wasn't that big a deal, or, you know, something, we contort ourselves so that we don't have to face that that wasn't a skillful thing to do. 
So getting honest with yourself about that, you know, that that wasn't helpful. 
And owning that, really acknowledging that is a great step, actually, to ease and peace in our own hearts. 
It's amazing to me how much, you know, activity in the mind can happen around trying to avoid just the simple acknowledgement, yeah, I did something that wasn't skillful and this is how it is, that this is what it's like. 
And then when we do actually settle into that, yeah, that wasn't helpful. 
At least when I've really done that with mindfulness, there's a kind of a, oh, right, that's why it's so painful right now. 
And there can be some space around the experience to then begin to reflect. 
I think often too, when something happens really quickly like that, when there's a sudden arising of anger, you know, we do the best we can in the situation. 
We, you know, that's, our response will be conditioned based on our history, based on what's happening right now. 
It's, and it may not be pretty. 
And so, you know, do, do hopefully, at some point, acknowledge that and clean up, look at cleaning up the mess. 
But it can also be really useful to, especially if it's a situation that happens suddenly that feels like, wow, I don't understand what happened there. 
You know, that there's a kind of confusion around it. 
It can be really useful to take some time later, later in the day maybe, to reflect on what happened. 
This is bringing thoughts in to our practice, consciously bringing thought into a meditative space. 
There's a kind of a form, we call it reflective practice. 
I learned it from Ajahn Amaro, where he suggested if we wanted to review something or think about something or reflect on something, this tool is actually so useful. 
I found so many different ways it can be applied. 
But basically, he encouraged just, you know, letting the mind settle and get quiet and then dropping in something you want to think about and feeling how the system responds to that. 
So that it uses mindfulness around a particular thought or a particular scenario or theme even. 
I've used it in terms of exploring Dharma themes. 
I've used it in exploring decisions to make. 
I've used it in exploring things that have happened. 
And so, you know, just dropping in that, well, this is what happened. 
Remembering, so in a situation where there's like this sudden and strong reactivity. 
Later in the day where you have some space, where you have some quiet time, let yourself settle in a little bit of quiet for five, seven minutes. 
And then let yourself remember, consciously bring in the memory of what happened. 
Not to indulge in it, but to be curious about what happens. 
Because when you think about it, very similar experiences will happen. 
So you may be in to feel the kind of the arising of that reactivity again. 
It may not happen quite as dramatically because it's not happening in the moment. 
And so you may get to see some of what's going on. 
You might get to learn something about yourself, about the situation. 
Something that can be interesting or useful to explore in that place is, what actually is the mind reacting to? Is it what the person did or said, or is it connected to some history? Maybe both, you know. 
It's sometimes I've seen that, you know, sometimes I've seen it's definitely connected to what's going on. 
But at other times it's more like, wow, it just was more like it was a resonance of something really old. 
And that that was what was triggered. 
And that can be useful to recognize that, to know that. 
Often I think when reactivity is strong like that, it's touching into some fundamental, some core things. 
Things that are common, things that are human. 
Safety. 
Wanting to be safe and feeling like somebody else is in control of my safety, this is not okay. 
And that that itself maybe points back to the feeling of the lack of control, uncontrollability. 
The recognition that sometimes these fast and sudden reactivities are actually recognitions that point to a deep truth that life is impermanent, unreliable and uncontrollable. 
And when we actually can acknowledge that or recognize, you know, sometimes that our reactivity is coming from that, that sense of uncontrollability, that sense of insecurity. 
Those are touching into some really deep threads of wanting to be happy and healthy and safe. 
And, you know, kind of the acknowledgement of the truth that even in that wish of wanting to be happy and healthy and safe, we can't guarantee that for ourselves. 
And that that is a poignant truth. 
It is, but it's not a mistake. 
It's not a fault. 
It's not a failing. 
It's not your fault that things are uncontrollable, that things are unreliable. 
I think sometimes some of our reactivity comes back to that, the feeling like, if I were doing things right, I wouldn't be feeling this. 
And, you know, I will say the last piece I'll bring in is that as we do this kind of exploration looking at what's here, what is the reactivity actually to? What are we actually reacting to? There are times that we can see or recognize that we are reacting to something that is unskillful on somebody else's part. 
And that it may be that there is out of wisdom and compassion a skillful action that needs to be taken. 
So I always need to remind all of us of this because so much the teachings often point to looking here, you know, looking internally for how am I contributing to what's happening. 
And that's crucial to be able to respond rather than react. 
But in seeing what's happening, what's, you know, what's happening here, we also might recognize that out of compassion, out of wisdom, you know, there needs something needs to change. 
That there is something that needs to happen. 
And that's, that's not that doesn't have to be motivated that action doesn't have to be motivated out of reactivity. 
It can be motivated out of compassion, out of wisdom. 
So it feels like there's a lot that can be followed or threads that could be followed out of many pieces of this. 
Those are just some of the thoughts I had to share this evening. 
I'm curious what's on your mind, any reflections or comments or questions about anything I've shared. 
Carol, did you want to say something? You're muted still. 
There you go. 
Well, I was just kind of reflecting today that this practice really has made a big difference for me. 
I used to this time of year is always kind of problematic for me because I don't have family and all that. 
But and I realize that what I used to do is I would just try to escape. 
I'd like to, you know, if I could go to sleep and wake up, say January 2nd, I would do that. 
But I realize that that, you know, that doesn't help. 
I mean, it really is that staying open to whatever. 
And it's not it's not wholly painful. 
You know, that's another another thing that, you know, we get these ideas. 
You know, this time, you know, these days, this week, this is a miserable week. 
But if you actually look at your experience, some of its loneliness, some of its joy and delight. 
And so, you know, if you if you go to sleep for the whole week, you'll miss out on all of it. 
The good and the bad. 
Yeah. 
And that's, you know, what I was pointing to earlier is like we can delight in the joy and we can hold and not have to be afraid of the challenges. 
I almost feel, I don't know if it's, I don't feel so identified with the painful things anymore. 
And I have this sense of more spaciousness or kind of holding it in, I don't know, holding it in a way. 
That's mindfulness. 
I'm not okay. 
That's mindfulness, holding it. 
Yes. 
Exactly. 
It's like it's a container. 
It's that it's that heart that can let it be there. 
Yeah. 
And it we don't have to be afraid of it anymore. 
It's just, oh, that's there too. 
And, and, you know, when we're not holding on to it or fearing it or pushing it away, you know, it's like, it comes and it goes. 
Yeah. 
And that's mindfulness. 
That's what you describe that space or, you know, that kind of sense of, of that space with it. 
That's mindfulness. 
I love the poem or whatever it was you were quoting the Japanese. 
Yeah, there's left a word out. 
It might be, let's see. 
Let's see if I can find it, but. 
But that idea that you make room for everything. 
I think it's beautiful. 
Watching the moon at midnight, solitary mid-sky, I knew myself completely no part left out. 
Beautiful. 
Beautiful. 
Thank you, Carol. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, Christy. 
I want to thank you very, very much. 
That was very helpful. 
And yeah, yeah, very, very helpful. 
So thank you. 
You're welcome. 
So we should stop. 
Oh, Charles Lee, go ahead. 
Yeah. 
Oh, maybe, maybe just quickly. 
I've got, I'm just very appreciative of. 
It's one of this for me, one of the silver linings of social distancing and. 
Having a different experience during this time because I too. 
Would often, you know, I did that, that resonates the rip van Winkle treatment of. 
I just love to go to sleep and wake up later. 
And. 
But I've realized that this time without the. 
Social pressures of attending, you know, work events or neighborhood events or things like that. 
You know, I haven't had to spend energy. 
Kind of, I guess, you know, as, as, as having a mind that is often afflicted with social anxiety. 
Having that having a break from that during, during this important season and really. 
You know, being able to look inward. 
Without having to explain myself to many people has really been beautiful for me and. 
Has allowed me to look at some, some inherent patterns and hopefully prepare for. 
You know, for when the external world is maybe a bit more challenging for me sometime in the future. 
Yeah, that's a beautiful reflection. 
You know, I think it's true that. 
For many of us, it is a stressful time, partly because there's so many expectations and. 
You know, to, to have it be a little simpler can be lovely. 
Yeah, can be, can be supportive, especially for this kind of going inward. 
As you say, you know, looking at what's here and what these patterns are. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you.
