So we'll offer some reflections.
I'm going to start with the poem.
And the first time I read it, I think I'll make a few
comments as I go. And then I'll reread it and just let it land in you however it lands in you.
And this is called In Blackwater Woods by Mary Oliver.
Look, the trees are turning their own bodies into pillars of light
and giving off the rich fragrance of cinnamon and fulfillment.
But this image to me is an image of loving kindness being radiated out, right?
The long tapers of captails are bursting and floating away over the blue shoulders
of the ponds. Again, nature, this giving, this pre-giving, right?
The blue shoulders of the ponds and every pond, no matter what its name is,
and this again is the radiating to all beings, all beings, and the interconnection of all beings,
no matter what its name is, is nameless now.
Every year, everything I have ever learned in my lifetime leads back to this,
this, the fires and the black river of loss whose other side is salvation,
whose meaning none of us will ever know. To live in this world, you must be able to do three things,
to love what is moral. So this again is the loving kindness, to love what is mortal
and to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it,
and when the time comes to let it go, to let it go.

So one more short little poem for anyone
who feels they haven't done enough, can't do enough,
didn't get enough drips of meta into their buckets.
It's called Enough by David Wint.
Enough, these few words are enough.
If not these words, this breath.
If not this breath, this sitting here,
this opening to the life we have refused again and again until now, until now.
Enough, enough.
Thank you for your practice.
I'll ring the bell here. I'll do it three times tonight.
Take care of yourselves tonight.
May you rest in the field of meta in this nest you've been weaving all week,
weaving these intentions, wishes into everything you've done, every thought you've had.
All that goodness. Thank you.
