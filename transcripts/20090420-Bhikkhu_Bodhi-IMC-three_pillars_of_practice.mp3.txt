Okay, first I would like to thank Gil for his introduction and for inviting me to come here to speak tonight. 
I consider myself largely just to be a link in a chain of great translators and proponents of the Buddha Dhamma through the ages. 
And I build very largely upon the work of some of my predecessors, early western Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka, particularly Venerable Nyanatiloka, who is the first monk from continental Europe in Sri Lanka. 
My personal teacher, Venerable Nyanapunika, who is the student of Venerable Nyanatiloka, a German Jewish monk who lived in Sri Lanka from 1936 until his death in 1994. 
And then on the work of Venerable Nyanamoli, an English monk who lived in Sri Lanka from 1949 until 1960. 
Okay, I'd like to speak briefly about some of the factors that assist the practice of meditation. 
Often when westerners, particularly Americans, come to Buddhism, they think Buddhism is just meditation. 
And we come to an identification, what does it mean to be a Buddhist? It means that one sits to meditate. 
But actually, meditation is a particular discipline of training the mind, which is built upon a base of supporting conditions. 
And in order for the practice to develop successfully and to bear its proper results, it has to be built up with the support of these conditions and continually nourished by these conditions. 
It strikes me as somewhat interesting that the process by which we westerners come to Buddhism is almost the exact opposite of the process by which Asian Buddhists relate to Buddhism. 
Normally Asian Buddhists begin with faith and devotion towards the Buddha and the Dhamma. 
On the basis of this, they build up a life of generosity and moral discipline. 
And then when they reach a point where they feel some degree of spiritual maturity, then they will take up the practice of meditation aiming at realization or insight. 
For westerners, myself included, we generally come to Buddhism first searching for some method to train the mind because we often have agitated minds, restless minds, worried, disturbed minds. 
And so we want to find some way to get peace of mind. 
And so we sit down, starting to meditate, sometimes practicing very diligently. 
And what we find is that the mind is extremely difficult to control, difficult to tame. 
Then when we inquire, why is this the case? What is missing? And one thing that we find is missing is that we don't have a proper understanding of the Dhamma. 
And so then we move into the intellectual investigation of the Dhamma. 
And so sometimes we might be studying Buddhist texts, practicing meditation. 
Still the mind doesn't settle down and become quiet. 
We might increase our knowledge. 
Sometimes that knowledge will cause our pride to swell up. 
We might engage in debates with others who have been studying Buddhist texts. 
Sometimes these debates get out of control and they become bitter, acrimonious. 
And instead of producing friendly and harmonious relationships, they lead to bitter, angry, contentious relationships. 
Even if people face-to-face speak politely to one another, if you look at some of these Buddhist discussion groups on the Internet, you can see that there's almost no restraint in the language that people will use to criticize their opponents. 
And so simply the practice of meditation and the practice of meditation can join with intellectual knowledge. 
Neither of them is sufficient. 
Then one starts to inquire, what more does one need? Then one comes to the other factors, proper behavior, which is what we call morally-disciplined behavior, generosity, and a quality called sada, which is often translated as faith. 
And so what I want to touch on briefly are some of these basic qualities that we need to accompany the practice of meditation and that we have to add to our spiritual life in order to provide a satisfactory basis for growth in the dharma, development in the dharma. 
And so I will begin with what the Buddha emphasizes as the first of the five spiritual faculties. 
This is that word sada, which I prefer to translate as faith. 
I know faith, the word faith, often it provokes some resistance from Americans who are coming from a dogmatic religious background. 
But faith in Buddhism doesn't mean a blind submission to authority, but it means a trust, a willingness to place trust in the Buddha as one's spiritual guide, as one's teacher and one's spiritual guide. 
And in order to generate this faith, we have to ask ourselves, what is our motivation in practicing the dharma, in taking up this path of practice of the dharma? And I like to see the goals of the dharma as perhaps we can subsume them under three headings. 
Goodness, understanding, and liberation or freedom. 
The Buddha is the one who through his own wisdom, through his enlightenment, has discovered the consummation of these three qualities. 
Goodness, understanding of truth, and freedom. 
The ultimate goal to which the Buddha's teaching points is liberation, which means freedom from suffering. 
The Buddha says that this is the one taste that pervades the entire teaching from beginning to end, just as in the Great Ocean there is but one taste, the taste of salt, so the Buddha says in my dharma, there is this one taste, the taste of freedom, the taste of liberation. 
And then liberation comes about as the consummation of the development of goodness and knowledge or understanding. 
And so the Buddha is one who has himself reached the fullest development, the pinnacle in the development of goodness, understanding, and liberation, and who understands the laws of the spiritual life that lead us to our own experience of this consummation of goodness, understanding, and liberation. 
What makes the Buddha a perfectly enlightened one is the fact that he has comprehended these laws in their fullness, in their completeness. 
He knows what are the particular courses of conduct that lead to degeneration, what are the states of mind that create obstructions to our own spiritual development and that drive us to courses of conduct that are harmful to ourselves, harmful to others. 
He knows the ways of conduct that bring benefit to ourselves, benefit to others, and he knows all of the different stages of progress beginning from the level of an ordinary person, moving to higher and deeper levels, up to the stage of final liberation. 
And so initially we don't come to the Buddha dharma with the attitude that we have to blindly believe everything that the Buddha teaches. 
It's an experiential teaching, an experimental teaching, that we have to work our own way through the dharma through our own practice, our own experience, taking that which is beneficial to ourselves and finding our own way of integrating these principles into our own lives and practice. 
But still we always look for ultimate guidance to the Buddha as the one who has understood all of these principles, all of these laws. 
Placing faith in the Buddha and his teaching has a function of clarifying the mind. 
It's sometimes said that the mind without faith, the mind troubled by doubts, questions, uncertainties, is like a puddle of muddy water. 
And there's said to be a gem. 
This is an Indian mythology, the kind of gem that when one puts this gem into muddy water, it causes all of the mud to settle down to the bottom of the pond. 
And so faith is compared to this water clearing gem. 
When one deposits that faith in the mind, when one is able to arouse that trust, it causes so many layers of mental obscurity, mental unclarity, unrest, agitation to settle down, and the mind becomes clear, calm, and peaceful. 
So in this way, faith is an important spiritual faculty, the first spiritual faculty. 
It turns into a balla, which means a power, the text speak of saddha balla, the power of faith. 
When one has this trust in the Buddha and his teaching, when one is ready to suspend one's uncertainties with trust, then that mind of faith accumulates strength and power that propels one through the practice, sustains one through many difficulties, many problems might arise, but one remains persistent in one's intention to pursue the goal. 
Okay, so in this way, faith becomes a powerful supporting condition for the practice. 
The second supporting condition is what we call sila, or sila actually means behavior, but it means specifically behavior, which is regulated by ethical principles. 
We can call it moral behavior. 
Okay, the Buddha teaches that our actions are locked into a network of subtle causal laws that are not immediately visible to us. 
We can't test them the way we can test the laws of physics or chemistry. 
We can't test them with our physical senses. 
These are laws that have to be perceived through a kind of inner perception that arises out of the higher development of the mind. 
According to these ethical laws, these laws of the moral life, behavior actions which run counter to these basic moral laws bring about harmful consequences to us not only in this present life itself, but they deposit seeds within the mind that carry on from life to life and cause suffering in future lives. 
On the other hand, conduct which accords with this law of moral causation brings benefit to ourselves, benefit to others in this life and in future lives. 
So when we act in accordance with these laws, then we are behaving in accordance with the underlying law of the whole universe. 
We are bringing our behavior into harmony with the law of the universe. 
An action of this type generates an inner spiritual power which supports the mind, again it clarifies the mind, and it establishes the conditions that help to bring to fulfillment and fruition the practice of mental development or meditation. 
So what are these laws or principles of the moral life? The Buddha has expressed them in the form of certain sets of precepts, and so we have as the most basic precepts the set of five precepts which the Buddha has taught universally to all of his followers, particularly for the lay community. 
These five precepts are to abstain from killing or causing harm and damage to living beings, to abstain from stealing, misappropriating the belongings of others, to abstain from sexual misconduct, abusing others, interfering with the relationships of others, particularly in the form of adultery or seduction, abstaining from false speech. 
Those are four basic ethical principles, and then the fifth is not directly an ethical principle. 
This is to abstain from the use of intoxicants. 
This is not directly an ethical principle, but when people use intoxicants, then they lose their sense of shame, self-respect, self-control, and then they're inclined to break the basic principles of the moral life. 
So these are five principles. 
We call them principles of varita, which means principles of restraint. 
And so the minimal ethical observance is to refrain from these actions which inflict harm and suffering on others. 
But that is not the fullness of the moral life. 
The fulfillment of the moral life also requires the corresponding component, which we call charita, the development of positive virtues, which are the counterparts to these five principles of restraint. 
So rather than killing and harming others, one develops loving kindness and compassion towards all living beings. 
The quality of heart that makes one sympathize with others, feel their pain as one's own, and thereby one generates this mind of compassion towards them. 
Rather than misappropriating the belongings of others, one lives an honest life, earning one's living by a right mode of livelihood, receiving only what properly belongs to one, never misappropriating the belongings of others. 
So honesty becomes a positive virtue. 
Instead of becoming sexually promiscuous, one, if one can, especially as a monastic, observes celibacy, if not one should remain faithful to one's partner, not just trying to enjoy pleasures with other people. 
And so we could call this maybe sexually responsible behavior. 
And then the fourth, rather than lie, one speaks the truth, always being straightforward, candid, and reliable in one's speech, so that others place trust in what one says. 
And then refraining from intoxicants, one maintains a clear and sober mind. 
And so we have these five positive virtues, compassion, honesty, called a sensual restraint or fidelity, truthfulness, and sobriety. 
So these two together, the factors of restraint that's conduct in accordance with the precepts and the development of the corresponding virtues together make up sila, virtuous conduct, upright conduct. 
So that is the second basic principle supporting the practice of meditation. 
First, faith, trust, or confidence in the Buddha. 
Second, moral conduct. 
The third is generosity, giving. 
In traditional Buddhist countries, giving is usually explained as. 
. 
. 
I always feel a little bit shy about saying this, but making offerings to support the monastic order. 
That is because please don't take that in any way. 
But in a traditional Buddhist culture, monks and nuns, they don't work at jobs to earn their own living, and so they depend for their subsistence on the support of the laity. 
And so laity regularly will build monasteries for the monastics, provide their food every day. 
They offer robes, they'll look after the medical care, give them other things they need, buying books, little day-to-day requisites that they have to use. 
And then the monastics also practice giving by teaching the dhamma. 
This is called dhammadana, the gift of the dhamma. 
In our own day, I feel that we have to give a wider, more comprehensive. 
. 
. 
We have to develop a wider, more comprehensive understanding of giving, and to understand giving, not merely just making offerings to support the sangha, but we have to develop our hearts to feel the suffering of other human beings within this world in which we live. 
We live in a world in which with six billion people, two billion people are living below the poverty level. 
One billion people, almost one billion people, are living almost on the edge of starvation every day. 
And perhaps four billion of the six billion people are living in difficult circumstances. 
And so there are many causes, many organizations, which are providing aid to the poor and unfortunate. 
We should find at least one worthy cause that resonates with us, and we should make it a point to provide some assistance to the best of our ability to help those who are less fortunate. 
And it might seem that when we're giving material aid, we're losing something. 
But what one finds as one gives more and more, that it leads to an opening up and expansion of the heart, a sense of growing inner freedom, and a bubbling joy of joy and happiness starts running through the heart. 
Because one feels, instead of being locked into the sense of one's ego identity, this is me, this is mine, one is now expanding one's sense of identity to feel the suffering of others as one's own. 
And in helping others, one has a sense that one is contributing to the welfare of the world. 
And then that will give a great flourishing of joy within the mind. 
And that flourishing of joy will clear up so much clinging and grasping and worry and distress and lighten the mind. 
Making the mind a much fitter, more pliable instrument for the development of samadhi and panya, concentration and wisdom. 
So this is generosity. 
And then the fourth quality to be developed as a support for the practice of meditation is wisdom itself, panya. 
Normally we say sila samadhi panya, moral behavior, concentration, wisdom. 
So we think that wisdom develops out of concentration. 
This is true at the meditative level, so that the direct beam of insight that understands things directly, perceptibly, experientially, depends on a base of concentration. 
But to mature the development of the mind within the dharma, it's important to clarify our understanding. 
And that is the basic step that we take in developing wisdom. 
And so, though we speak about sila samadhi panya, but the process of developing the higher wisdom is actually a concurrent process of developing the mind through systematic practice of meditation and also deepening our understanding of the dharma through the study of the Buddha's teaching and reflection on the teaching. 
And so to lay the seed for the growth of wisdom, one has to turn to the study of the Buddha's teachings. 
And we find in the sutras, the Buddha's discourses lays down what seems to be almost a complete course of education in the development of wisdom through five stages. 
What I like about these lists is that it makes things easy to explain. 
For adult people, people like myself who are getting old, it makes it easier. 
So the Buddha's texts speak about how one develops wisdom, how one begins by listening, because in the Buddha's day, no books. 
One doesn't go to a library, a bookshop, or order books from amazon. 
com, but one has to go to a teacher who's giving exposition, discourses on the dharma, and one has to listen. 
The first step in learning is called sutra, which comes, not sutra in the sense of sutra, discourse, it's s-u-t-a, which means hearing, listening. 
When one listens, then one has to retain in mind. 
That's the second step, because if one just listens, and things go in one ear, out the other ear, then one goes home and thinks, now I'm going to develop wisdom, but what did he say? He had a pleasant smile, he had that, I remember. 
His voice was a little croaky, that I remember. 
But I don't remember what he said, so it has to train the memory. 
Especially in the Buddha's day now, for those of us who are lazy, it becomes very easy, if we don't remember, we just look in the books, or we go to, with our computer, we go to websites, and look on the website. 
But in the Buddha's day, this is how they could develop minds that could remember volumes and volumes of texts, just through training the memory. 
So one remembers, that's the second step, in order to preserve what one has heard in the memory, one recites. 
So one undertakes recitation. 
Then the fourth step is important, this is examining the meaning. 
So when we study a text, now we don't have to listen so much, we don't have to memorize, we don't have to recite, but first we study, then we have to examine the meaning. 
Don't just think, I'm going to read so many Dharma books, and if you take the Majumini Kaya, you flip through it, and finish it in a couple of weeks, then thought, okay, I've read the Majumini Kaya, let's see any interesting novels being published, or a history of the Civil War. 
So we don't take Dharma books as being the kind of book that one just flips through, but one has to read, study very carefully, reflect on the meaning. 
And to help one understand meanings, what's useful if you're studying, very important is to take notes. 
And you could even take the notes, read through several times the Sutta. 
The way I, when I first studied, what I did was to read through a whole Nikaya, taking notes as I read, till I read through the four Nikayas, the main books of the Kutaka Nikaya, then what I did was to take the main categories and topics of the Buddha's teaching, say four noble truths in general, then the truth of suffering, then themes like impermanence, non-self dependent origination, and think practices like Sela, morality, the Jhanas, other statements on Samadhi, wise attention, Yoniso Manasikara, and so on. 
Make these headings, then go through the texts again, and note the most important passages that come under these headings. 
In this way, one is building up a kind of comprehensive, analytical, systematic understanding of the teaching. 
Okay, and so in this way, by building up the systematic picture, comprehensive, systematic picture of the teaching, then one is laying the foundation for examining the meaning. 
Then, based upon examination of the meaning, then one develops the meditative insight and penetrates the true meaning, the experiential meaning, directly through direct perception. 
And so this is the cultivation of wisdom. 
And thus we have these four supporting conditions for the practice of meditation. 
Faith, or trust, whatever term one prefers, ethical discipline, morality, generosity, and then the step-by-step development of wisdom. 
And so I think if you complement your meditative practice with these four qualities, you'll see that it becomes enriched, more fulfilling, and will bring greater happiness and hopefully fruition of the practice. 
Okay, maybe at this point I'll just ask if anybody has any questions. 
Maybe a few minutes left. 
Any questions relating to the talk? Thank you. 
My question is about something that you said early in your talk, when you said when you go to the websites or even the monks themselves disagree and are disrespectful and so on. 
Buddhism is really ethical and I was sort of relieved to hear you say that, to hear you say, well, even monks argue and fight and are disrespectful because I find this so difficult and lately, and I like this very much, but I have a lot of doubt because am I ever going to be ethical all the time? Or enough so I don't. 
. 
. 
You just keep faith and you just keep working on things, I guess. 
How do you get over not arguing and being ethical all the time or forgiving yourself when you're not? Even though you're trying, sorry. 
That's a tough one. 
We also have our human weaknesses and so sometimes we form particular opinions and then we have disagreements, but we know that even though we might have disagreements, we have to be humble about our opinions. 
Maybe I'll give you a useful piece of advice that I had at the very beginning. 
When I first became interested in Buddhism, this was when I was in graduate school, I became friends with a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who was studying in the same university and so I took him as my first Buddhist teacher. 
Though he had been a monk for, since he was a little boy, 20 years, I was just becoming interested in Buddhism, just reading some books and what I got from the books I was reading and my own reflection upon them was different from what he said. 
I was always certain I was right, he was wrong. 
And so I would constantly be arguing with him on the basis of my thimbleful of knowledge. 
After all, like, I'm an American, right? He's an Asian who's come here, he's just stumbling through English, so I must have it better. 
So after a few occasions of trying to put me in my place, he gave me a very useful piece of advice, he said, when you disagree with somebody, instead of becoming so self-righteous and so argumentative, what you do is think to yourself, I might be right or I might be wrong, that's not the important thing. 
The important thing is to find out what is true, what is valid. 
So let me give up my attachment to my own view to the thought, I have to be right, I have to show the other person to be wrong. 
Let's just put down that idea and just open up and investigate and inquire. 
And in this way, one can at least make some progress towards arriving at an objective view of what is true. 
That helps to put away that quarrelsome mind. 
Okay, is kindness more important than wisdom? Given that kindness is available for all of us immediately and for some of us, wisdom may take a lot of years of practice and cultivation. 
On a human level, I say kindness is more important than wisdom. 
From the standpoint of liberation, let's say wisdom is the quality that directly brings liberation, but kindness is the most important as the foundation for one's spiritual development. 
So if one doesn't have a kind mind, one can't even think about developing wisdom. 
And so better to be kind and a little bit dull than to have. 
. 
. 
If you think you have wisdom without kindness, what I think you have is just shrewdness and cunningness, not real wisdom. 
Thank you for sharing, first of all. 
So my question is how to find the compass again. 
And I'll elaborate more. 
It's like how to dissolve attachment but remain with the purpose. 
Let me give you some background. 
When I was in my completely delusional state, I'm still somewhat, but I was completely delusional. 
I thought I know everything and I had such strong beliefs and I gave me so much drive and motivation and sense of purpose. 
It was wrong concept, it was attachment to concept, to idea. 
Then as you grow, the idea change, concept change, and you believe in that and you go and believe in that and you go. 
And then you get slowly disillusioned and say, ah, so nothing is important really. 
Any idea is just an idea, it's temporary as everything else. 
Now, how do I keep myself going and speaking of service, right? It's again so subjective. 
What is truly good and what is not? Here is the situation. 
You see a car accident. 
60 years old lady had kids, six people. 
Car accident, she wasn't careful, everybody was killed, she survived, very in bad state. 
And here I am, of course, good citizen 9-1-1. 
But here is the back story. 
She had killed her entire family by her own fault. 
She maybe has 10 years more left to live. 
Does she want to live? Does she want to live with this guilt and pain that she destroyed her family by her own mistake? So my call of 9-1-1, how good is that? You know, this primitive situation, but where is the compass? Where is the what? The compass, the direction, the guidance. 
How to keep the purpose, understanding that attachment to any idea is the false. 
It's false by default. 
Okay, I'm done. 
I'm not quite sure that I understood the question. 
Let's say that one can't rely dogmatically on one's opinions, but one has to make assessments to the best of one's knowledge to try to find what is the right action within a particular situation. 
But one can't always insist that what I believe to be the right action will always work out that way. 
Do you know the story of Chuang Tzu? It's a story from the Chinese Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu about what is good, what is bad? Let's see if I can think of it. 
Okay, there was a farmer. 
I haven't really looked at the story in a long, long time. 
If I try to relate it now, I might mix it up. 
So let me just stop with what I said, that according to the situation, tries to make the best assessment of what is right, what is wrong under these conditions. 
But one doesn't cling dogmatically to one's judgment that thinks, because I've decided in this way this has to be the right way. 
There might be other factors beyond one's range of knowledge that would throw a different spotlight on the situation. 
But as long as we're always forming judgments under limitations, we don't always have a fully comprehensive view of all the relevant factors. 
And so what we'd have to do is make provisional judgments as to what is right, what is wrong. 
Leaving ourselves open to the possibility that if we had other facts at our disposal, we would see our judgments in another light. 
And if this does actually happen, then we have to have the flexibility of mind to change our judgment, to change our opinion. 
That's what I'll say. 
Okay, thank you all for your attention. 
May I just do the sharing of the merits? Of course, in our tradition, when we speak on Dhamma, listen to the Dhamma, then we acquire a certain kind of wholesome karma merit. 
And so we share these merits with the deities that protect the Dhamma, with the fear spirits that sometimes can be harmful. 
But if we share the merit, then they rejoice in the merits and will help protect us. 
And then we share the merits with all beings. 
So I'll recite some verses in the Pali language. 
And you just, as you sit, generate thoughts of loving kindness towards all beings in your heart, sharing the merit of your dedication to the practice with the deities and with all other beings. 
Thank you.
