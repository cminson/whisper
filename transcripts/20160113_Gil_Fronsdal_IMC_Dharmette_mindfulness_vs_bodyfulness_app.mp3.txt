Dharmette: Mindfulness vs . Bodyfulness

Being mindful is not the same as being thoughtful. 
Mind fulness does not arise through the  filter of thinking 
about things. There might be thoughts involved in being 
mindful , but we are not thinking about the experience. It 
would be like looking at a sunset , and thinking about it 
vs. seeing it.  
 
Another example would be listening to music . You can 
take in the music;  you can sometimes even feel it in 
your body via the base and the beat. You can feel the 
sensation, the pleasantness of it , and this is very 
different than thinking about it, wondering if that was a C 
sharp , or wondering what key it is being played in. It 
may be interesting to have those kinds of thoughts, but 
if we’re thinking about the construction of the music , 
then we’re not really listening, we’re not experiencing or 
feeling the music.  
 
Mindfulness is more like feeling  or sensing our 
experience, than it is a thinking exercise. One of the 
things we actually learn to do with mindfulness practice, 
is to step away from our thinking a little bit. Most people 
take up residence in their thoughts – that’s where they live. It’s ok;  thoughts are fine, but we don’t have to live 
in them. The idea is to take up residency in your body , 
so that your thoughts are like a room, but they are not 
the whole house. Relax into your body;  settle down , and 
begin noticing how the body experiences what i s going 
on. How does the body experience  music ? How does 
the body experience  conversation ? How does the body  
experience meditation?   
 
I know people who have thought a lot about meditation , 
and their thinking about the meditation keeps them from 
being settl ed, because they have all these ideas about 
meditation, about getting mindful and concentrated. 
They listen to people like me too much , and they have 
all these instructions about breathing . They wonder  
which of the 16 steps of ānāpānasati  are they are 
supposed to be feeling ? Or the four foundations of 
mindfulness , and which exercises to do there? O r 
maybe mettā  would be better…  
 
There is all this information, all these ideas, all this 
negotiating  and thinking about it , as opposed to simply 
asking, “What am I feeling right now?”  Or “What’s 
happening for me right now?”  As though i t’s not good 
enough  just to feel. Y ou’re supposed to have some 
purpose , something you’re supposed to do,  or some 
place to get to and figure it all out. No.  
 
What are y ou feeling right now? Come back , and just feel, and b e here . Breathe here. Over and over again, 
the emphasis for the Buddha was the direct experience  
we’re having . For the most part, d irect experience is 
unmediated by our thoughts. If you put your hand und er 
flowing water , you can experience the fluidity, the 
coolness , and the wetness of it. That’s a direct 
experience , which is different than thinking about it.  
 
If you close your eyes , and someone takes your hand 
and puts something soft in it, and then asks you to  
guess what it is , at first you just experience the 
softness . But you don’t  yet know  what it is. Soft! Then 
you start going through your mind… what do I know that 
is soft like this?  You have to use your mind to think it 
over, to try to reme mber, and guess. But the experience 
of softness is not a thought. It’s j ust soft.   
 
The rush to think , and the rush to understand , limits how 
much we can actually feel , and be with what is. This is 
why I like to think we shouldn’t use the term mindfulness 
for our practice , and instead use ‘ bodyfulness .’ For 
some people, t he word mindfulness over-emphasizes 
the mental side of it all. It keeps us removed from the 
experience , whereas ‘ bodyfulness ’ puts us in the 
experience, to sense and be with it. The body is  always 
in the present moment – but your mind might not be. It 
probably isn’t . So, if you rely too much on the mind and 
your thoughts to navigate through your life, or through 
your meditation, then you’re probably less often in the present moment  than i f you use your body to navigate 
the path, the practice, and your life . Be here  in your 
body , and ask, “How does it feel? W hat’s going on 
here? And ho w is the body experie ncing it?”   
 
The reason I wanted to mention all of this is to make a 
different point, which is: when we begin relaxing and 
softening all the thoughts we have about life and we’re 
more in our body, then we can allow something to 
emerge out of the body that can take a very different 
shape in our lives than what comes about out of thinking 
about things. The thinking comes in the wake of all the 
emotions that are driving the thoughts . But there’s a 
deeper place.  
 
I like the word ‘aspiration’ because it has a co nnection 
through the  Latin with the meaning ‘to breathe’. What is 
the aspiration that arises out of you? If we have an 
expectation , or a demand , or wanting something too 
much, this is when we become limited. We get weighed 
down . It’s a burden to have expec tations.  On the other 
hand,  the notion of an aspiration is something born of 
our hearts, something born deep inside , which opens us 
and expands us in the process – like the heart’s wish.   
 
Aspiration is something that feels really good to have, 
even if you  can’t act on it. Isn’t that nice? You don’t 
have to have it fulfilled to get the benefits from having 
an aspiration. You can think, “Yeah that would be nice, maybe someday ” – as opposed to having a desire , 
where we feel we have to have it, or it has to ha ppen 
now. For me, an aspiration is more like a heart’s wish  
that flows up , and comes out of me . And may it be so . 
Let’s see how it plays out.  
 
Try dropping below the usual thinking place . Drop into 
the body . Relax into the body to find out what it is that 
wants to be expressed through the body, to discover 
what it is that wants to come out of you, what wants to 
live in you.  Not because you thought about it , but 
because you made space for something different to 
arise.  
 
Some people find that taking time in nature, meditating, 
being quiet or taking a Sabbath day is really helpful, 
because it allows the deeper movements inside, the 
deeper feelings, aspirations and thoughts to finally have 
a chance to come forward.  I don’t know how it is for you , 
but for me,  I feel that some of the deeper aspirations, 
wishes or movements in my life th at have been so 
important to me  are shy and quiet. If there’s a lot of 
noise, you can’t hear it , or it’s drowned out. It will 
recede , and be shy , and not be known. B ut by having 
some quiet time, some meditation, or some other way of 
settling below the thoughts,  it can allow for what is 
deeper  to show itself. Then when it shows itself, you 
can welcome back your thinking , and figure out how to 
live that way , and follow through.   
So, what is you r aspiration? If you get really quiet , and 
you don’t answer from your mind , but you  answer from 
the quiet place in your heart, does anything come out of 
there for you? If you had no fear , no worries, no 
expectations, and if you allowe d yourself  to wish for 
anything – when  you get into that still place – what kind 
of aspirations are born then, in that courage , or 
allowance that allows something deep inside to come 
up, before any social restrictions arise or reasons why 
you can’t?  What is in you?  
 
I like to believe, I hope it’s true, that when we get to this 
deeper place inside, the embodied deeper place, that 
our aspirations are good . They are trustable . They are 
coming from a good place in our lives.  So as you do this 
mindfulness  practice , and you learn to make the 
transition from thinking to being, from mindfulness 
(having a full mind ) to that of bodyfulness  (a full body),  
then sooner or later, hopefully your aspirations will 
discover something. Maybe what comes out of you will 
even surprise you.
