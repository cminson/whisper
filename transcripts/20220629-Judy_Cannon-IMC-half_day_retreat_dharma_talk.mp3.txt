The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
I'm reading a good book that I want to share some ideas from. Joseph Goldstein
wrote One Dharma in 2002, and his idea was to take ideas from Tibetan, Zen, and
Vipassana Buddhism and bring them together in Western practice. And he
said he based his summaries on experience rather than theoretical. And I
find it's a really good book and it's kind of short and summarizes everything.
So there's one sentence especially that caught my attention for today. In Western
Buddhism, the method is mindfulness. The expression is compassion. The essence is
wisdom. And I thought that pretty much summed up our whole practice. So first
mindfulness is the method. An awful lot of our attention goes to mindfulness and
I like Ram Dass definition. Be here now. Okay, that's simple. I get it. In this
place at this time to be aware, to be awake, to be alert. And when we're not
mindful, we have the experience of maybe just going on autopilot and acting out
of habit. We all have conditions and causes to what we're doing. And when
we're not paying attention, we might be surprised at something that we might say
or something we might do and then say, and then start paying attention. So we
really need mindfulness, especially when we make decisions, even small
decisions, as well as large ones. Sometimes when we're meditating, we have
quite a few distractions. There might be feelings and thoughts about the past or
the future. And then the past and the future become the present, but they take
us away from the focus of our meditation. So our intention when we meditate may
be, for example, paying attention to the breath and letting the thoughts quiet
down and the feelings quiet down and noticing the sensations and all of that.
So going back to the focus is what we do. When I first started in Maryland going
to Tara Brock's evening meditations, she said the sentence I've always remembered.
She said it in the middle of the meditation when we were silent. We can
always begin again. This meditation, this life. That's interesting. We let go, we
begin again. When we let go, what can we learn from ourselves? Now we have mental
formations and some of them are thoughts and we like things and we just like
other things and we have desires and aversions and we might want a situation
to be different from what it really is. And when these things come up, many times
chances are we recognize it and we let it go. And we go back to the focus of our
meditation. And Joseph Goldstein asked, well, when we let go, what emerges? What
do we learn about our minds? So then we also give attention to mindfulness in
our daily activities. Might be a little more challenging. Some of them might be
very refreshing, but they bring our mind close to our body when we're aware.
Walking meditation is a great opportunity for unity within our own selves. And
when people walk, and you might vary your method, but you might do the more
detailed approach of lifting, moving, setting, shifting. And you might, on the
other hand, sometimes take the swoosh, swoosh method, looking at the regular
rhythm. And so in that way we can help become unified within ourselves.
Sometimes, most of the time, we can't really slow down to know what's going on.
And Maria Stratman taught here recently, and I really liked her example of
coming to the beginning of meditation at IMC. She said, she can look at her
experience in two different ways. The first way is, I'm going to be late. The
alternative is, I'm going to arrive later than I intended. And the first is, I'm
rushing. And the alternative is, I need to move with alacrity. I love that
example. So the sense of urgency can be unpleasant. The deciding what to do about
it and just go on from there can be pleasant or neutral, calm and matter of
fact, without emotional stress. And Maria called this approach being
economists. Going back now to Joseph Goldstein, he taught, the Buddha spoke of
mindfulness as being the path to complete awakening, fulfilling our highest
aspirations for happiness and peace. And Joseph quoted the sutra which reads,
This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting
of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the
attainment of the true way, for the realization of nirvana. So those are a
few thoughts on mindfulness. And second, Joseph said, Western Buddhism has the
expression of compassion. Compassion, as we know, is a matter of the heart. It's
primarily a response when we see suffering. And in its full form, we are led
to do something to alleviate the suffering if we can.
Thich Nhat Hanh once said in an interview on NPR, Buddhism means to be awake,
mindful of what is happening in one's body, feelings, mind, and the world. If you
are awake, you cannot do otherwise than act compassionately to help relieve
suffering you see around you. So Buddhism must be engaged in the world.
We understand that compassion naturally arises for us when we're mindful and we
notice pain and struggle. It can be in people who are very close to us, in people
we know just a little bit, in world events, that we learn about in the news.
We can express compassion in small acts of kindness, for example, in conversation,
in giving our full attention to a person. And we can express care and concern in
larger ways as well. And we often have compassion after our own hearts are
softened somewhat, maybe even broken, by difficult circumstances or events in our
lives. And we can then offer compassion to other people. Now, we're also invited
to be compassionate toward ourselves when we're experiencing challenges and
stress. We're mindful of our emotions. We care for ourselves. And we act in ways
that are appropriate in the moment. So we might choose to be quietly alone, or we
might share our feelings with supportive people. Over time, we develop
some resilience, and then we offer strength to other people. A 20th century
Tibetan meditation master called Nyoshul Ken Rinpoche said, I would like to pass
on one little bit of advice I give to everyone. Relax. Just relax. Be nice to
each other. As you go through your life simply, be kind to people. Try to help
them, rather than hurt them. Try to get along with them, rather than fall out with
them. It's very practical advice for compassion. And for us, a familiar
expression is our meta-practice, where we wish all beings to be happy and safe and
peaceful and free. So going back now to Joseph's original statement in Buddhism,
the method is mindfulness, the expression is compassion, and the essence is
wisdom. Joseph describes wisdom this way. The perfection of wisdom is the light
that illuminates our lives, revealing both the causes and the end of
suffering. Through mindful attention in the moment, we see the impermanent nature
of phenomena and understand the happiness of non-grasping. And through
non-grasping, we experience for ourselves the innate wakefulness of the wisdom
mind. And I understand Joseph's description as kind of circling back to
the Four Noble Truths, the perception of suffering, its causes, emphasizing greed,
hatred, and delusion. And then the possibility of the end of suffering and
the eightfold path to the end of suffering. Joseph adds, wisdom is not
something we get and then have forever. Rather, it is an understanding we need to
nourish and develop in our lives. It's up to us to take the next step. We can say
that wisdom enables us to see clearly our experience in the moment and we can
make choices that benefit ourselves and other people. So we have three aspects of
our practice. Mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom, the method, the expression, the
essence. Sometimes we might pay special attention to one of these aspects and
sometimes to another, but they're all essential and it's great for us to
practice together. So we have some time now for you to make any
comments you might wish to make or questions you might wish to ask. And I
had no idea my talk took so long. It's one minute to twelve and we do temple
cleaning. I don't think we have any time for questions or comments. I didn't time
my talk. I thought it was ten minutes. I went by the number of words, but I slowed
down. So instead we'll do mindfulness in practice and I'll stick around for a
while and I'm happy to answer questions or interact with you in any way and I'll
stay for lunch as well. So and now we'll help us get organized for temple
cleaning.
