Good evening.
Thank you very much for having us here.
I am very happy to have been here
because I have a chance to sit with the happy people
and also all the people who seek for the happiness
because I myself am not so happy
because I can still carry on my body.
But first of all, I would like to apologize that
one, I am not a scholar in Buddhism,
but I am just an old monk from Thailand.
Number two is my English.
It's very, very limited.
I mean, I would like to say many words,
but I could not take it out.
But anyhow, I would like to say thanks again to all of you
to listen to me and to give me an opportunity to have met you here.
So there is no topic. I think it would go with some talk,
like 10 minutes, and after that we should open up the question and answer.
Like I don't have many things to offer you much
because I know you know much better than me.
Just I am serious about that.
In Thailand we study Pali and the Thai language,
but here I think on the earth,
United States is the best country to find the knowledge
or get the sources of the knowledge
because I have seen very old scriptures
from India translated into English to Americans.
Mahayana Buddhism, De La Vada Buddhism, all religions,
you can find here, worry much better than in Thailand.
So that is it.
So today I would like to discuss about the, I think what just passed,
the last day of, last month that it was full moon,
that what the Thai Buddhist people celebrate as a hard day,
means the day that happened in the history of Buddhism.
I think about 2,592 years ago.
The first day the Buddha had talked,
had talked to the five monks,
five ascetics, five Brahmins.
In Pali we still use Brahman.
Means the first Buddha, the first teaching,
the Buddha gave the first teaching to his disciples
because if you go back to the history of Buddhism
before that about 3 months, Buddha never taught anyone.
He walked about 260 kilometers from Buddhicaya
to Varanasi to teach five dead disciples.
And we believe that what he taught on that day, it was hard.
It was the principle teaching of Buddhism.
It means about, it's called Dhammacakapavattana Sutta.
Explain about the foldable truth.
So we go back to what you have, you have read, you have heard, you have practiced.
I think if we go back to the teaching of the Buddha
in Dhammacakapavattana Sutta, you have read about the sufferings, the dukkha.
I think dukkha cannot translate just two sufferings, too many things,
because Buddha said,
chatipi dukkha to be born here on the earth is suffering.
Decay is suffering, sickness is suffering, the dead is suffering.
This first fold is called permanent suffering, permanent dukkha.
No one could avoid from that.
Even Buddha himself, he faced that.
He had his doctor to take care of him, he was getting old.
When he was 18, he passed away.
He still suffered from that.
Suffer of the Buddha is not a kind of what we use the word suffering,
but he knows about the changes.
He knows about the changes of the body.
His mind is above that, above the permanent suffering.
He just takes care, does the best he could do.
He had a doctor, like what I said, to take care of him.
And then also he had a medicine to take, but he never attached to that.
Just observe it and do the best you could do for it.
Take it away or be with it.
His mind was down from this kind of suffering.
And another group of the suffering we call temporary suffering,
like sadness, separation from what we love,
get what we don't want, do not get what we want,
or even attachment to our life, to what we have,
what we have been here, the suffering, many, many things, the suffering.
So the first thing the Buddha taught us,
means to know, to understand about that first.
And then number two, the causes of suffering.
If I have used the wrong translation, please help me,
because like what I said, you know what that means.
Because the Buddha said,
ga ma tan ha pa va tan ha yi pa va tan ha,
that is the causes of suffering.
Ga ma tan ha means desire.
A sensual desire.
So I didn't understand much about English, sensual desire.
But what I understood, the teaching of the Buddha is,
we decide the desire of all the material things, all the things.
Like I attached, I want to have the beautiful car,
and I was sitting under a tree, a friend drove,
motorcycle, BMW, parked there, and then they looked,
so beautiful, so big.
I never seen that in Thailand.
This is a kind of desire, or many things.
Or I have this house, this big, and then I want a bigger.
So that is the all the material.
Number two is ba va tan ha.
The desire of being, being something,
always we try to get something from this to another thing.
But before I forget,
the word desire and kusa lachanda means the need.
It's different.
Desire means one without understanding,
wanting the wrong way.
So that's my translation, my understanding.
For example, I am a monk.
I would like to be enlightened.
I want to achieve enlightenment.
That is not ba va tan ha.
But a kind of need of one, that two take me there.
So this kind of desire is like we
drive a car from what puthanya sang from 3 months here,
and then I leave the car there.
The car is the same to this kind of desire.
I park there, I leave it there.
I will not attach to that car.
But if I want without understanding,
specifically understand about all heart, inside all heart,
that is the real desire.
And then the last one would be
the desire of non-being, wanting to get away from that.
Now, for example, now I am a married monk, married man.
I want to run away from my wife.
I don't want to be a husband.
But something starts on my head with ignorance.
So that is what we call ba va tan ha,
the desire of non-being.
Yes, I am able to walk away from what I am.
But with understanding, this kind of wanting is not that,
not we ba va tan ha.
I hope you understood what I said.
So these three causes of suffering, Buddha said,
and then the end of suffering, niloda, the end of suffering,
means we be above, being above that.
But those things still with us, still here.
We still see the things that we don't want to see.
We still touch the things we don't want to touch.
We still associate with those things.
But we are above them.
That is my idea.
That is a kind of enlightenment.
For example, when I was a kid, when I saw candy,
it was hard to find in the village.
Oh, I came back to my mom.
I asked for like five pennies to buy candies.
If my mom would not give me money, I would cry.
Because I need the candy.
I went back to the candy shop again and looked and walked around.
And my spirit started to work.
Because I wanted it.
But now, or maybe later on, like I was 20, even now,
I never want candy.
But I see candy.
I still see the candy, but I don't want it.
The enlightenment is like what I don't want.
I don't need candy right now.
So it's the same to that.
It means I'm my mind above.
And then the past.
The last one, the past, how we go to that point.
That is, I think, all of you also understood,
you have read about that.
It means Samaditi, right to you.
Sammasangapa.
Translate, please.
Sammasangapa.
So Samaditi.
Samaditi, right to you.
Right to understanding.
It means to understand about the truth.
I think it's hard to understand about that.
But for myself, I realized that.
Since I was 11, I practiced meditation,
I practiced Buddhism.
I feel really comfortable with my life.
Not about living or anything, those things.
But if I would face death or sickness,
I would feel really comfortable about that.
Specifically the body part.
It means this part.
Because I understood that my body is not mine.
My body is inverted from my feelings.
And then it depends on the nature I survive.
I just use the best.
It means I take care of the best.
If anything would happen to my body,
I would not cry about that.
If I would still stay here on this land,
I respect that.
No any kind of the medicine is better than the medicine found here.
No any medical equipment is better than here.
I might be wrong, I would say that.
Not in a doctor, more expert than American doctors.
Because here is the research center.
Because if I walk into the hospital in Bangkok,
meet in USA, meet in England, something like that.
When I go back home, oh, the reverend,
A Chan, do you have syndrome?
He is too expensive.
Or something like that.
If I would be here, if I would face any problem,
a physical problem, I think I am happy.
I think I just throw my body to a doctor.
No more than that.
I will not cry.
But I will not put poison on my body.
I care about my body.
I will use my body good in the right way.
What I could do to the society or even to myself.
I love my body, but I will not attach to my body.
This example is to say that,
it means understanding about the body, about life.
I don't know about life.
I would say that.
We should not attach to this.
We should have understanding about this.
I have a friend who is working at VA Hospital.
She is also a PhD in Chinese medicine.
She told me that one thing she saw there, she worked with a patient
who was afraid of death, who tried to fight.
Sometimes their mind caused more problems to the body.
Because when they have fear or something,
much fear in their mind, it may cause something to their body.
It means they don't know how to let it go.
Now she works as a nurse and also she works as a psychologist,
but not her professional, but she just tries to calm down those patients.
That's what she told me.
I think the right view should be like what I just said.
We should understand about everything.
Also, I think that is to understand about being here on this earth.
We suffer because we try to push everything the way we want.
Now I want to sit on the chair.
Maybe next minute I want to remove the chair.
I don't want it anymore.
We always move around.
But for my idea, to have the right understanding,
I think everything here we just associate with.
We own nothing.
Just for my idea, we own nothing.
We don't own the body, but we just associate with the body.
We carry on inherited, given by the parents and by the nature.
No more than that.
I have been here just associated with friends.
And then soon, I think that there's not more than 100 years of average.
Eighty years of average, seventy-eight years of average of life.
So we are going to go away.
But when we are alive, we try to push everything the way we want.
We suffer because of that.
Because we don't understand about it.
We have no time to think about it.
So it's my idea.
The first thing, Samadhi, and then Samasangkabpo.
What's next?
What should we think about?
I think Aihingsah Sangkabpo.
I think about non-violence and Nekama Sangkabpo.
It means how to renounce.
But I think it is too deep for me that word.
I think try to be away from being attached to.
And then Samasangkabpo.
No, sorry.
Aihingsah and Apaya.
Would you please help me in English?
Because there are three.
I remember in Pali.
I could chant in Dhammacakkabpo Watanasutta in Pali.
Aihingsah means non-violence and Apaya.
No, it's an interaction.
Would you please look at the book?
Yes, he was smart. He brought a book.
I think it's 57.
I hope you understood all.
Thank you very much.
Samawaja, the third one, means the third part.
Samawaja means right speech.
I think that is what causes us a lot.
It means about speech.
Speech from us and speech from other people.
For myself, I think it appears there.
I have talked to many people about speech.
All the actions arise from the mind, from the thoughts.
But then it spreads out.
It starts from the speech.
After that, maybe bodily action.
I think that is.
Buddhism asks us to practice and to have the right speech.
Not to lie, not to use hard words, to use beautiful words,
not to use the words that make people.
To divide people, to do those things.
I think we suffer because we use the wrong speech.
Sometimes we may not get the problem directly from other people,
but we feel bad inside.
Why did I do that?
Why did I do those people?
Something like that.
Sometimes it's in our heart, in our mind.
The fourth part of head is sammasangkapa,
sammasangkamantha, sorry.
Sammasangkamantha means right action.
Right action.
I think that is negative.
First three of the five precepts, first three of the five precepts,
not to kill, not to harm,
but practice or cultivate the loving kindness.
What we want, another beings want the same thing.
We try to avoid from harm or to being.
Number two, try to get in the right way,
try not to take what is not given.
Take over the property of the people,
satisfy what we have.
And number three is try to avoid any kind of sexual misconduct.
So those things.
So that sammasangkamantha,
and number six would be sammasangkapa.
What is it called?
Right livelihood.
Tan Bodhiko said that, I believe him.
Right livelihood.
I think that in Buddhism, only Buddha said
the Buddhist people should avoid harm,
do the trading of five things.
Like a poison, the flesh, the spirit,
human beings, and weapons.
Means we try to have the right occupation,
but the monks have another occupation,
like the monks could not ask for food,
but bake.
Bake in another way.
It means you should not ask,
oh, I want that, I want that.
Just take what the people gave.
Take what the people gave.
So it's just those things.
And sammasangkamantha.
Right effort.
So that is.
What is Pali?
No.
The sammasariya.
Samma vayamu.
Yes.
Samma vayamu.
Means right effort.
Means try to avoid,
try to prevent from the bad things,
and also try to eliminate the bad things,
try to develop the good things,
and then try to maintain the good things in our life.
That is right effort.
And sammasati.
That is, I think, that you have been practised.
That is what we call sattipadana,
that four sattipadana, karyanupasana,
vethananupasana, cittaanupasana, and dhammanupasana.
I hope you understood Pali words.
Yes.
You could translate to that.
Means my fullness on the body,
the actions of the body,
and the vethananupasana
means my fullness on the feeling,
and cittaanupasana.
Cittaanupasana is my fullness on our thoughts,
and also dhammanupasana,
and then try to investigate in our mind,
so that what is in our mind,
what the quality of our mind,
and then the last one, sammasati,
so that it is the right concentration,
so that we have to go to China,
but I know we've got China.
So, I mean, could you explain about China?
Yeah.
He said, oh, you already know.
He doesn't want to explain about it.
No, no, no.
So, the path lead us to the elimination of the suffering.
So, I think I talked too long.
As I said that I would like you to come up with the question and answer,
maybe not what I have talked, sorry,
but that is I offer you that I may confuse you.
So, I think we should open with the question and answer.
I think we have, like, another 30 minutes?
Um, nine minutes.
Just nine minutes?
I'm sorry.
So, if you would not have the question, I just would say that
I think we have been here,
been here on this earth now,
and also on this earth.
I think the purpose of being here is to be happy,
but most of us never aware of that,
because I myself, I experienced about that.
I was angry,
but when I have a chance to look at my anger,
oh, that is wrong to do that,
because when I was angry,
it means I want to be happy,
because I could not get what I want,
but why I put the wrong cause,
to make me happy,
like I would like to be clean,
but I put the dirty things on my body,
so I think it is when I would like you to realize about that,
I would like you to remind yourself again and again
about that purpose of being here.
We want to be happy,
and then why we cause the unhappiness by ourselves,
and also I think that I would like you to learn
from what we care about our body,
and then apply to our mind,
to inside.
I think we always care about our body,
oh, today I have five pounds overweight,
I have to fast to lose weight,
oh, I never have a week, I never exercise,
I have to exercise, I have to sleep right,
I have to eat right, something like that.
Always we care about the body,
also we go to the doctors.
I think to the body what we put in,
I don't get that,
means if I eat unhealthy food,
my body will be unhealthy.
So our mind is the same.
If we put the bad thing in the mind,
our mind will not be healthy,
but we want our mind to be healthy,
something that we should put in,
the good things to our mind,
I think from the good thought,
be above everything,
try to be above,
because for myself,
I always practice that,
there is no problem,
but just work of life,
just the job of life,
because when I realize that,
then I think, oh, there is the problem,
it's stuck on my head,
above my head,
if I think, oh, that's my job,
I just put it in front of me,
so that's what I should do,
and then I try the best to do that,
sometimes to cause it from myself,
sometimes from other people,
sometimes I have to depend on many people,
sometimes I need to depend on the time,
sometimes I just cannot just put it the way I want,
something like that,
and also when I have the problems,
sometimes I just think about,
one, two, three, I should do like that,
to solve the problems,
sometimes I put on the paper,
write on the paper,
but I should take care of the problems,
sometimes I just make it easier than that,
and all the people came to me
and told me about his problem,
but the same problem, same story,
and then what?
I advise him to work on that,
I should follow that,
that is the way I practice,
so now I would say that I have no problem,
maybe I would say that I am stupid enough,
not to put the things on my head,
but I just work on them,
just take care of them,
that's what I do,
but at least make me feel better,
because I have no problem,
I just do my job,
because I believe that,
when I think from my experience,
when I think that I have the problem,
ability, the quality of my brain,
only 70% gone,
I become selfish,
create a lot of things that are bad in my mind,
so if I think this is all that my job to do,
I just see it really clear,
I do better,
so that I would like to remind you,
you might practice,
you may have better techniques than this,
but it is very simple,
what I do, I take care of all my life,
so I would say that,
I know I have the problem,
but I have a lot of the work,
other than the job to do,
to take care of my life,
especially at the temple,
many people,
once, I think the last two weeks,
a friend came to me,
and said,
oh, I am going to die,
I asked her, are you serious?
Yes, I am going to die Friday,
I asked her, why is it like,
oh, are you calling me suicide?
So, we talk about three hours,
I think the first minute,
the first five minutes,
she cried, cried, cried, cried,
so, but after 30 minutes,
we just laugh,
we just think about it,
how to solve the problem,
we just talk about Thailand,
because she is not Thai,
and I still remember the last word I told her,
oh, you would die on Friday,
you still thinking of coming to suicide,
please come back to me on Thursday,
because I would like to talk to you again,
and then we will set up the time,
I will follow you there,
means I will go to see you,
when you come to suicide.
She never came back to the temple,
but on,
from, I know she is very serious,
but two things make me think that,
oh, she gave up her idea,
because I think almost three hours,
we laugh, we smile,
we talk some of the things like,
really like, not heavy.
Another thing,
I think that is,
like,
I wait until Thursday,
she never came back to the temple,
during that time my mind,
think about her,
I meditate a lot,
I pray,
what is for the person like that,
but like what I said, I above that,
because I accept the karma,
if it would happen,
yes, okay, her choice,
but we don't want to see that.
But I pray for her,
I think,
the most of the time,
of meditation, of doing anything good,
after the chanting,
I pray, concentrate on her,
make her sit in front of me,
means imagine about her,
make her sit in front of me,
or so you change your mind,
so that you are happy, we are laughing,
so something like that I make,
it would seem good in front of me,
and then I end my chanting,
in my meditation until I do the same thing,
make her sit there,
see her happy,
but end up,
on Saturday,
a friend came to me,
oh, he called me suicide, that lady,
do you know her, yes,
because they found,
what is the notebook,
there is my name there, in her notebook,
so,
I would say that
I feel,
not bad,
but not good,
but I just accept that,
because I try my best,
give her advice,
I did call her,
but her phone disconnected,
I don't know how to drive,
I don't know where she lives,
so I just pray,
pray in my meditation,
because I put her in front of me,
so, when it happens,
I just accept that,
I have a good sleep,
from Tuesday to Saturday,
until now I still have a good sleep,
I still enjoy my eating,
means everything normal for me,
means when we try the best,
we just accept that,
we cannot control,
but why I come to this story,
so I just would say that,
when we try the best,
we should be above everything,
try to be above,
there is no problem,
but we have to try,
try hard,
use our wisdom,
use our effort to do everything,
thank you so much, I pass that,
I hope you understood something,
thank you so much,
and then I would like to,
would you please,
give the blessing in Pali,
please,
I just would like you to close your eyes,
as you are in bed,
relax every part of your body,
make your mind feel like,
feel free,
as if you are smiling to yourself,
concentrate on your breathing in, out,
or any object that makes you feel comfortable
in your meditation,
always make your mind feel free,
feel happy,
and give the blessing,
you are in bed,
as if you are smiling to yourself,
you are in bed,
as if you are smiling to yourself,
you are in bed,
as if you are smiling to yourself,
for one, two, three,
and also by Buddhist tradition,
I would like you to share the loving kindness
to yourself and to the rest.
So please make your mind feel peaceful,
please make your mind feel happy,
and remind yourself that the past is gone,
and the future has not arrived,
and there is only the present moment,
and now is the time to fill your mind with happiness,
and please make the wish for yourself to be happy,
make the wish for yourself to be peaceful,
make the wish for yourself to be successful,
and now if you can expand your mind
out to all the people in this room,
and wish for them to be happy,
wish for everyone sitting in this room to be peaceful,
and wish for everyone to be successful in their lives,
and if you could think about all beings above you
to expand your mind above you,
and may all beings that are above you be happy,
and be peaceful, and be successful,
and with your mind imagine all beings below you.
Please make the wish from your heart
that all beings below you are happy,
that their mind is peaceful,
and that they're successful,
and please expand your mind out to the right
as far as it will go,
and make the wish that all beings to your right,
may they be happy,
may they have peace and success,
and please expand your mind out to the left,
and make the wish that all beings to the left of you,
as far as your mind can imagine,
and wish for them to be happy, to be peaceful,
to have success in their lives,
and please imagine the space behind you
as far as the mind can imagine,
and make the wish from your heart that all beings behind you
are happy, are peaceful,
have success in their lives,
and now please imagine the space in front of you
as far as the mind can imagine,
and make the wish that all beings in front of you
are happy, are peaceful,
and are successful,
and please come back to yourself,
and make your body feel relaxed,
and remind yourself that the past is gone,
and the future has not arrived,
and there's only the present moment,
and please wish for yourself to be always happy,
wish for yourself to be healthy,
for the mind to remain peaceful,
and wish for your success,
and please take three deep, even breaths.
Thank you.
