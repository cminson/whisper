Dharmette: Collectedness and 
Expansion

An important concepts in Buddhist meditation is 
unification : gathering together, or collectedness. 
Sometimes it is associated with ‘one-pointedness, ’ 
meaning that everything is pointing in the same 
direction, pointing together. Sometimes the language of 
one-pointedness can mean that one part of us is 
pointing in one direction , but all of the other parts are 
pointing somewhere else. The Buddhist word for one -
pointedness  – ekaggatā  – literally means “a single 
direction .” It is the idea that we have one purpose , one 
intention  around which we gather oursel ves.  
 
Often , people  who find it hard to be collected  are 
divided within themselves. Some people are at war with 
themselves. There is internal struggle , and for some , it 
is quite strong.  
 
There are parts of ourselves we don’t like. We think we 
should be one way  – or another way. We struggle 
between our good and bad sides . There may be 
inherited ideas from family , society , or religion  around our good and bad sides . If we have  some  bad ideas or  
thoughts , we certainly should not have  them . We 
shouldn’t show them to anyone.  We are doomed if we 
have them. Other sides are good. Some people are 
afraid of their goodness . Some people think they’re only 
supposed to be good  – so they are at war with 
themselves .  
 
For some  people , the war inside  – this fight between the 
two sides  – is very explicit . Unfortunately,  in this internal 
struggle between a good and a bad side , no one win s. 
As long as we  are divided, we can’t  win, because the 
two sides will always be opposed.  
 
The image I like to suggest  for people who have this 
sort of tension is to have the two sides hold hands  – to 
see and respect each other, h and in hand . Rather than 
saying we have to stop fighting , or stop being different, 
we can see how we can work togethe r. We  hold hands , 
see each other , and respect each other.  Each  side is 
there because of causes and conditions  – it isn’t 
inherent. Given  these causes and conditions , we have 
to care for these different sides of ourselves , and find a 
way to have the two sides respect each other . We find 
some unity by not fighting anymore, not s truggl ing 
between different sides of ourselves.  
 
Part of the idea of unification,  or collectedness , has to 
do with opening up the field of our heart, the field of awareness , so that  all is held within that field.  Rather 
than sitting out on one side of the court or the boxing 
arena , and looking at the other side, you keep 
expanding the attention  outward , so that you can h old 
all of it in awareness. Rather than deciding which is the 
good or bad part, expand the attention so that it is 
broader and bigger , and somehow  can hold it  all. 
Perhaps you can  expand your attention by imagining 
that you are standing on a hill across the valley  looking 
at yourself . In that way , you create enough space and 
openness , so that all the different parts of you can be 
held in a more harmonious, collected way. There is 
space for it all. To have an expansive mind of open 
awareness is a very important idea in Buddhist 
meditation.  
 
These two approaches can come together and be 
connected – being collected or unified , and having 
expansive awareness . This points to attention open ing 
up awareness  – having  a presence of mind 
(mindfulness) that is bigger than the tight, 
claustrophobic focus that things hav e to be a certain 
way. If we get caught in that vise of contracted attention, 
then we just r elax and open. The idea of opening and 
relaxing – of making space  – allows for th is 
collectedness to happen by itself.  
 
We don’t have to be in charge of bringing all the parts 
together. It’s more like we are in charge of opening up and making space. A nd a lot of that is dependent on not 
being  so involved in thinking. We don’t want to be at war 
with our thinking . But we also don’t want to negotiate 
only through the filter of our thinking. Thinking is often 
where the divide , the separation , begins. We want to 
broaden the field of attention , so that thinking isn’t the 
only game in town . It isn’t the way we see and 
understand what's happening . We are not caught in the 
meanings of thinking , or the concerns of thoughts. We 
open up  in a wider sense .  
 
This is one of the reasons why Buddhism puts a lot  of 
emphasis on being in the present moment. Thinking is 
often what keeps us out of the present moment. If we 
can open the attention into the present moment to be 
inclusive , then thinking can be part of that inclusive 
picture. If the attention is open and wide enough, then it 
is easier not to be seduced by the thoughts , as if that is 
how we are going to figure out and negotiate our life.   
 
There may be different things  going on at the same 
time: the sense of  relaxed ope nness  to what is here  – 
not divided , not at war  with what is here. And then t here 
can be war . But there is a wider opening , which holds it 
all. It doesn’t choos e between the good and bad side s, 
but hold s it all in a bigger  context.  
 
Not negotiating things through our thoughts  is so 
important . You can’t necessarily stop your thinking, but don’t invest yourself in thinking as being the solution . 
This allows for more space  – a wider context  for all the 
ways in which we are divided  and scattered . All the 
ways in which the mind is fleetingly jumping around  to 
different thoughts and concerns and feelings – it all 
requires work or energy. In a certain way, a s we learn to 
relax and open in meditation  – in open collectedness – 
we allow it all to  be there . It’s also a way of to learn how 
not to invest so much of our energy in all the activities 
that divid e us.  
 
I like the image of f ive different marbles in a big bowl , 
constantly spinning around and bouncing off each other . 
Maybe they are re-energized , because the kid playing 
with them keeps them going. But if we just get out of the 
way, and stop activating or re-energizing the marbles , or 
adding to their momentum , they  will settle . And 
eventually , they will  stop and come to rest at the bottom 
of the bowl. We have all of these disparate  things going 
on, but if we can just hold them in meditative awareness  
– open, broad, wide – in this big bowl of awareness,  and 
not think ing so much , we begin to make space for them . 
Then , slowly , slowly,  everything will start settling down. 
All of your marbles will eventuall y come to rest  in the 
bottom of your heart. And your heart will be at rest in 
itself – this is  collectedness.  
 
In the Pali dictionary , the etymology of one term for this 
unification means “to weave into one. ” To weave ourselves into one. Isn’t that nice  for collectedness ? 
 
May these  ideas give you something to consider the 
next time you sit down to meditate.
