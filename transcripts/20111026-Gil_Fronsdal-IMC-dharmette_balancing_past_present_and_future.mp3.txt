Dharmette : Balancing Past, Present and 
Future

In this mindfulness tradition , and often in Buddhist 
traditions in general, there’s a big emphasis on being in 
the present moment  – being here and now. If you’re 
meditating, it’s  quite common to notice how often the 
mind is in the future and the past , and the idea is to 
come back into the present. There’s a big training in 
that. But, in that emphasis , which is a useful corrective 
to how the mind often works , people can get the idea 
that all you’re ever supposed to do is focus on and be in 
the present moment without ever any thought or 
consideration about the future or the past. I think that a 
life that doesn’t include memories of the past  or 
projections of what the future will be is a very limited life. 
If you’re only in the present moment all the time, I think 
it’s not really a human li fe, because human  life includes 
past and future to some degree.  
 
Many years ago t here was a Calvin and Hobbes cartoon 
in which  Calvin and Hobbe s were  climbing a tree 
together . Calvin said to Hobb es something like, “ It’s just 
wonderful to be so fully in th e present moment, enjoying this time and place. Everyone should do this. This is 
really a rich and wonderful way of  living a life.” Hobbes  
said, “Yes, but you’re  supposed to be at school right 
now” [ laughs] . If you listen to Vipassana teachers , it 
seem s like they’re doing their pra ctice just right.  
 
I’ve seen this in my kids. They’re walking out of the 
house. They see the flowers on the side of the house , 
and the flowers or the ants really fascinate them. 
They’re really in the present moment, look ing at the 
flowers or the ants. There’s nothing else in the world. 
They’re completely there. Sometimes on retreat I wish I 
was that present for something. Nothing else is going on 
for them. I’m trying to teac h people to do this, right? But, 
when my kids we re small, we’re going to be late for 
school [laughs] . School  is starting in 10 minutes. This is 
not the time to be completely engaged  in the ants on the 
sidewalk. This is the time to get in the car and go to 
school. So , there has to be some idea of the big ger 
context of our life , and this often has to do with things in 
the future. School starts in 10 minutes . We have to take 
that into account.  
 
But, what happened in the past is also important. Some 
people focus a lot on the past , and one of the big things 
that weigh people down is feeling bad about the past  – 
what they’ve said, what they’ve done , what’s occur red. 
We’re  always looking backward into the past, just 
pulling ourselves down , feeling depressed , angry or ashamed about  what’s happened  – ethical problems, 
mistakes, conflicts, all kinds of things . For some people , 
it’s tremendous wind  drag pulling them down, being  
fixated on what happened in the past.  As I understand 
the Buddhist  approach , or the wise approach , we want 
to be just backward -looking  enough  so that  we learn 
from our mistakes  and what happened in the past. The 
primary focus is forward -looking, not backw ard-looking. 
We don’t ignore the past ; we learn from it. We set the 
intention to learn from it , and do better in the future.  
 
The first time I got a sense of this was when I was a 
cook in the monastery. It was great. We made all these 
meals. Sometimes we were making six meals a day for 
different groups. It was gr eat to fail at making a meal, to 
somehow make a meal that didn’t come out right , 
because a  meal was distinct. After the meal was done , 
you work ed on the next meal , and you got to start all 
over again. It was a whole new meal. You didn’t bring 
the burnt rice  with you into the next m eal. That was 
then, and now was now. The idea was  that you could 
fail at making the meal, and then you could look back 
and say, “Okay, I get to try again.” Every  morning  in the 
monastery,  I would wake up to go to the kitchen and I 
had this feeling, “ Lucky me , I get to try again ” – as 
opposed to , “Oh no, I made this horrible meal 
yesterday. Everyone in the monastery must hate me. 
I’m sure I’ll do a really lousy job again. I’m just a failure 
as a cook , and I  wish they would assign me someplace else in the monastery .” Instead of  being weighed down 
by the past, you say, “Yesterday I didn’t do such a good 
job. This is what I did wrong , and I  get to try again. Let’s 
see if I can do better next time. ” So, the idea is to be 
forward -looking : “How can I do better? ” 
 
Having  an intention or a vision of what’s possible is a 
very important part of practice . It’s possible to get too 
caught up in the future  with planning . I’ve had 
wonderful, inspired , energizing , and uplifting  plans of 
the superhuman Buddhist practice I was going to 
engage in [laughs] . It’s kind  of embarrassing some of 
the things I thought of. “I’m going to get up every 
morning at 2:00  a.m., and I’ll do this and that. By the 
time everybody else gets up , I’ll have done all these 
different practices.” Sometimes the mind has  no 
perspective where it’s possible to get too caught up and 
lost in planning. That’s  a problem.  
 
But, luckily we have the past and the future. Luckily we 
make a lot of mistakes that we can learn  from, and in 
some ways  be inspired by , and  we feel we’re  on a path 
of development  and growth  towards freedom. So, in 
Buddhist practice, it’s useful to remember the past  and 
look at or consider  what our situation is like  just to the 
extent that we can learn from it and be inspired to try to 
do better, but not so much that it discourages us and 
blocks our path. We try to  review it just enough so that it 
helps us to set a better direction, understand what we have to work on, and then we can commit ourselves to 
doing better.  
 
If you only look toward s the future and ignore the 
mistakes you’ve had , then it’s also sometimes 
unrealistic. It becomes kind of Pollyann aish. It’s 
important to be weighed down a little bit  and not float 
away. But , it’s important not to be so we ighed down that 
you can’t go forward in practice. At times, t here’s a  
wonderful balance between being in the present 
moment, remembering what happened in the  past, and 
then seeing  what  we can do better in the future.  
 
This morning you’ve been meditating . You can be so 
much in the present moment that when you leave here 
you go on to the next thing and completely forget what 
happened this morning , which is okay . But, another 
approach to practic e is to spend a little time  at the end 
of a practice session  reme mbering and considering 
what happened :  how it went, what came up in your 
practice . For example, “How was that?  How was the 
walking meditation period for me? Well, actually, now 
that I think abo ut it, I didn’t really use the walking 
meditatio n period. I went and had some tea. I went to 
the bathroom. I went for a walk around the block , and 
then I  thought I’d have some m ore tea. After that , I 
thought I should do some walking meditation. I should 
get serious about this stuff , but then they rang the bell to 
come a nd sit. That’s  how I did it. Now that  was pleasant enough, but I think that I didn’t really avail myself of the 
opportunity to fully engage in the walking meditation .” 
Or when you look back at it , maybe you didn’t use th e 
walking meditation the whole 45 minutes . You realize  
that you were being too complacent, letting  the mind 
wander off too much into thinking. By reviewing , 
sometimes you see better what  happened than if you 
had stayed  in the moment. Then , you could say, “The 
next time I come to a Wednesday morning at IMC I’m 
going to do the full walking period.” Or “When I do the 
walking period , I’m going to try to remind myself to 
come back and be present more often. I’m g oing to try 
and do a better job  next time.” You’re not trying to be  a 
super practitioner, but just trying  to do better.  
 
So, there’s  a way of using the past – reviewing  it – that 
can help us in this practice  to set the course for the 
future. I would say that  the emphasis in Buddhism is to 
be forward -looking rathe r than backward -looking , but we 
should look back just enough  to learn , and then  look 
forward  enough to se t the course to know how to go , 
and then to do it by being fully in the present moment.  
 
Over the course of a day, the mind will appropriately go 
and review these three  different times . Sometimes  we’re 
here in the present  – that’s  the name of the game. 
Sometimes we review the past,  because that’s helpful , 
and sometimes we consider the future. I think part of a well-balanced practice life is being wise about how and 
when to be in  these three  periods of time.  
 
Thank  you for coming.
