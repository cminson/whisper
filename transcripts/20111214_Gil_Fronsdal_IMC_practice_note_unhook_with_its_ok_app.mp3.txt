Practice Note : Unhook with “ It’s OK”

One of the important task s in doing mindfulness or  any 
kind of meditation practice  is to step back from, 
disengage,  or get unhooked from being preoccupied 
with our thinking, feelings , and the events of our life. 
When we’re preoccupied , we’re kind of lost , or so 
engaged that we don’t see clearly. May be we don’t even 
see at all , except what we’re churning away in.  
 
When  you sit to be quiet and meditate , one of the things 
that often becomes obvious is the power and strength 
by which you get hooked or lost for periods of time  in 
thinking about things. Even  if you’re  mindful of what’s 
happening , you can sometimes feel that you’re  kind of  
mindful and aware , but you’re  also very aware of how 
you’re  really hooked and engaged . There’s a drive or  
compulsion to keep being involved in thinking or feeling  
certain things. You’re  kind of in it , or caught by it , and 
you know you’re caug ht when you can’t easily put it 
down. You keep being pulled away.  
 
So, part of the task of meditation is t o some how step 
back, disengage, get a bigger perspective, and free 
ourselves  from t he compulsion of being driven and caught by things. I want to offer one way to do that. It’s 
a little statement you can make to yourself when you’re 
meditating , which hopefully will give you some  – I don’t 
know if distance is the right word – but will unhook you a 
little bit. It’ll strength en that part of th e mind that can be 
the o bserver – that part of the mind t hat can be 
cognizant of what’s happening without being entangled 
with what’s happening.  
 
Part of the function  of making this simple statement to 
yourself is to help with the disentangling. The simpl e 
statement  is: “It’s OK.” I call it the great American 
mantra. It’s one of the great contributions America has 
made to the  world’s spiritual traditions. It seems t he 
word “OK” came up in Boston in the 1820 s, and since 
then it’s traveled the world. Most pe ople know what it 
means  now:  “It’s OK.” You say it to little kids , to 
everyone : “It’s OK.”  
 
It isn’t that you’re condoning whatever you’re saying OK 
to, implying , “This is great. ” But, in saying , “It’s OK,” 
you’re  stepping back , taking a wider perspective , and 
seeing something  in a way that you’re not trapped or 
caught by it. For example, it’s not really OK to spend 
your time in meditation planning how to get violent 
revenge on your neighbor , thinking about all the terrible 
things you could do and how you’r e going to do it. It’s 
not really OK spend ing all your time in meditation lusting 
after your neighbor, and planning how that’s going to happen. It’s not really OK . However , you can say  ”It’s 
OK,” because in saying that, you’re stepping back and 
you’re not in it anymore  – not trapped or pushed  around 
by it – not necessarily even believing it.  
 
So, in stepping back and creating a wide r perspective, 
saying “It’s OK” in that context becomes OK – not 
condon ing it, but say ing “It’s OK,” because this is what 
human minds do. “Of course , this  is a manifestation of 
life, of things going on, and I see that it  is not useful to 
be involved in this . It’s also  not useful to condemn it and 
try to push it away .” Some  ethically safe place is created 
when we step back or take a bigger perspe ctive. “It’s 
OK. This is what life is like. This is what goes on. ” It’s 
OK because you’re not hooked any more.  
 
While  it’s not OK to get caught in those things, it 
becomes OK when using the  approach of OK-ness. It’s 
a way of estab lishing equanimity, be coming 
equani mous about it, and not being hooked or pushed 
around by it. It’s quite a powerful thing  to tell yourself , 
“It’s OK.” There’s an ending of conflict, resistance, 
judgments , or entanglement . This hopefully creates 
some space and ease. You’re not exactly in opposition 
to what’s going on, but you also haven’t bought into it  
either.  
 
For example, a young three - or four -year old kid  gets 
hurt on the nur sery school playground, goes to the teacher , and is a little upset or scared. The nursery 
school teacher says, “It’s OK; it’s OK.” It’s not really OK 
that the child got hurt,  but they’re OK now. “It’s OK” is 
said in a context of providing safety and reassurance.  
 
So perhaps,  you can treat yourself that way  – “It’s OK” – 
and in so doing , disentangle yourself from what you’re 
caught in. Once you’re disentangled, you can stop 
saying,  “It’s OK” and just be mindfully present for what 
is.  
 
Thank you.
