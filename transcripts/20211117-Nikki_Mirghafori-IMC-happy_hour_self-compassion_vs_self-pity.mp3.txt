 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, here we go. So formally hello and good afternoon, evening, whatever your time zone might be, everyone. So for our practice for today, I'd like to invite us to explore the difference between self-compassion and self-pity, the important distinction. So I'd like to say a couple of words about them before we start the practice. So one distinction between self-compassion and self-pity is that with self-pity, there is a sense of it's only me. I'm the only one. Poor me is having this problem, this pain, this sorrow, this grief. Poor me. And there's a sense of isolation. There's a sense of closing in, into collapsing, collapsing into our problem. And there's a sense of, you know, there's the tenderness, but there is not so much both strength to support ourselves, but also there's a sense of isolation, that I'm the only person in the world who's having this problem. Poor me, poor me, energetically it feels really weak, as if we're fallen into a bottomless pit and there's no way to get out energetically, that's what it feels like, can't feel like. Versus self-compassion can have a sense of tenderness and care and love for ourselves, our eating, our challenge, our sorrow, our pain, and yet there is a sense of common humanity, that it's not, I'm not, that I'm not alone in this, that there are others elsewhere in the world in this very moment, or there have been people in the past or will be in the future. And this is a part of the human condition. And that's one distinction. And the other one is there is a sense of, as we've brought into many of our practice sessions, there's the sense of self-parenting, that there is a sense of strength, there's a sense of care. So there's a sense of strength that cares for ourselves. Sometimes in our practice, we've invited the image of the Buddha or the Kuan Yin, or any other manifestations or archetypes of compassion as a source of strength, as a source of support. And many times we've actually brought a sense of strength from within, as if, for example, we've done practices where we've supported the younger version of ourselves with self-compassion, or a wiser version of us supports us. So there's a sense of support, strength, it's not the sense of collapsing into, this is hard, this is hopeless, and it's only me. So those are a couple of distinctions to bring in. And if you ever find yourself falling into self-pity, near enemy of self-compassion, it's okay, it's okay, it's not a sin. Simply notice that, oh, it's become really isolated, this practice of self-compassion and care for myself feels really isolated, feels isolating and separate. And the vision has become really narrow. Simply notice that, notice that with care and see if we can expand it, extend it with the sea to the feeling of common humanity, common humanity, that I'm not the only one. So with that, let's practice, let's practice self-compassion and with a sense of common humanity. So, as always, let us begin. Ah, let us begin by arriving in our chair, in our cushion. Landing, arriving with this breath and this body, and whatever is happening right now in the body, in the mind. And we know that you're not alone, I'm not alone in this. I bet there are other beings, other human beings, out of the seven billion humans. I bet someone else is feeling this way right now or has before or will in the future. So landing in this body, letting the feet, the Lord likes to be connected to you. Connected to the earth. All the sensations of groundedness, contact, as if your feet are sponges, soaking up the sensations. If you're sitting on the floor, the lower legs, the lower side of the legs, the sit bones, all the areas that make connection, contact with the cushion, with the chair. The sponges, just relaxing, soaking in, soaking up. The sensations feeling more present, more grounded, relaxing, relaxing into, relaxing into. The sensations. The sensations. Relaxing, releasing any tightness, holding. The body, legs, abdomen, chest, shoulders, hands, face, jaw. And as thoughts arise, as they will inevitably do, as they inevitably do for all humans who meditate, who are not alone in this, generously, kindly, smiling at the thought and saying, thank you, but not now. Not now, please come later. And releasing, taking refuge in the simplicity of moments of just sitting and being breathed one breath at a time. We do all this often. you you giving your heart giving your heart fully completely over to this practice in this moment offering yourself up taking refuge to simplicity just being breathed making space calling me collecting the mind and heart you you you you you you you you you you and if you like bringing to mind to heart something that is somewhat challenging for you in your life right now be something physical something the space of the heart emotions some circumstance the thoughts that that brings about the situation brings about and as if and as if your inner Buddha inner Kuan Yin or whatever icon paragon of care and compassion and strength sitting on your shoulder or your underlap or maybe they've entered your body hello let me show you how to hold this let me show you how to be present with this so there's a sense of care sense of compassion love for yourself together within the uprightness with courage the heart being strengthened in its care see what image works best for you maybe putting it on the lap of the Buddha this challenge and feeling feeling held in care compassion with this difficulty you and also realizing that this challenge pain sorrow difficulty this Dukkha is shared is the shared part of humanity so many other beings in fact it's a mark of existence every being every human experiences friction difficulty suffering at some point if not right now in the past or in the future you are not alone I am not alone and imagining this your icon of compassion holding you and all beings all beings who share this form of challenge that you have or some variation of it thereof suffering is not unique may all of us may all us beings who have a similar challenge difficulty in our lives may all of us ease peace and ease with our challenge in the midst of our challenge and freedom both from and in the midst of our suffering you I am not alone in this I am not alone imagining yourself part of a community of beings just as the icon of compassion holds you all of you with compassion and care you hold each other in this circle seeing others just like me just like me and others seeing you just like me just like me you seeing sensing others just like me dear friend just like me I wish you ease you freedom peace grace in the midst of freedom from this sorrow this challenge and seeing your self-help with the eyes of care, compassion by others feeling challenged in the same way as if you're looking in the mirror you see the other they see you the community of others sitting in the circle receiving and giving compassion you you you you you may all of us be free may all of us have ease friends siblings in this form of challenge with Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As well as receiving it. Maybe in your mind's eye. You see others going through similar experience. Reaching out for support. Your act of compassion is to support them. Maybe you've gone through this longer than you have. Act of care, compassion. Opening your heart, both to yourself and to others. Or receiving compassion and support from others who have gone or going through something similar. And for the last minute of this practice period, offering the goodness of our practice as a gift to ourselves and to others. May all beings everywhere be free. May they be happy. May they be well. Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice. So, difference between self-pity and self-compassion. Quite rich, quite rich, this exploration. So, couple of differences that we explored. One is the sense of common humanity. I'm not alone. There are others with dukkha, with suffering in the world, perhaps in a similar way in the past, present and future. So bringing them into the sphere of our experience. Offering compassion, receiving compassion. And also through that there's a sense of strength that comes through. And also at the beginning we brought in an invitation to bring in our compassionate being, the Buddha, Kuan Yin, etc. So, you are welcome to unmute yourself, to raise your zoom hands, sorry. And reflections, comments, and anything you'd like to share, sharing part of your practice for the benefit of others, what you discovered. The appreciation on YouTube. You are welcome Jane. That was beautiful, she says. Thank you, thank you for your practice. So, you can also type in chat, and as always if you type anonymously, I will only read your comment, not your name, and if it's to everyone I'll read the comment publicly. So, what did you notice? What did you discover? Especially when you brought in other beings. Did it shift for you? Was there something that really clicked for you? Would you like to share and offer to others? An aha moment, or maybe something that was challenging. It's all welcome. One reflection through chat, a particular pernicious aspect of suffering can be the notion and it will never change, permanent. Yeah, yeah, everything is impermanent, everything shifts and changes. Of course, of course it shifts and changes. One thing that can support with that is, is looking back is is doing time travel with with your younger self. And remember a time when something was really challenging and hard and the younger self seemed thought that, oh, this will never change and realize, wow, it's, it has changed. Of course it does. And if you're trying to bring that sense of impermanence really into the consciousness that way, and then through induction, then looking forward that yes, this too is impermanent, of course it will change. Thank you for that reflection. Deborah says, I also had the awareness come to me during this meditation that some of the difficulties I'm facing are temporary. Nice, along the same. Yeah. Along the same lines. Yeah. So, as I wait for you, what the reflections, if you like to share, say one more thing. Oh, I see Neil's hand is up. Neil, please. So, you know, one thing I noticed is that, you know, my problems, you know, I seem much harsher in dealing with myself at the beginning of the meditation, you know, and thinking about all these other poor unfortunate people I'm like, hey, I'm everybody that's poor and fortunate people, you know, and that just like really opened up the floodgates of self compassion. Yeah, it was very nice. Oh, that's so sweet. Neil, I love the way you bring that in you say that, and with a sense of humor to just the heart opening and the sense of humor and humility with that yes there are others are more my poor and unfortunate people and I'm the same for there. Oh my goodness. There's this the heart melts. Oh dear one dear self dear being. Lovely. Thanks for sharing that Neil. Oh, lovely. One thing that I noticed is, for me, the practice became specially powerful and ignited and ignited in a beautiful way. And then it gave the invitation of imagine you're sitting in a circle with others, so the sense of sitting in a circle with others going through something similar, just really powerful as if I could look around and see others sitting with me. And also seeing another person and them seeing me and seeing the mirror just a sense of empowerment of, oh yes, let me support you all you can support me. Deborah I see your hand, please. Yeah, I think that when you're, when you're in the Dukkah. It's so easy to lose the perspective. And so both of the things that we've just talked about are really perspective shift shifts. Yeah, absolutely. And yeah. Exactly. Because the nature of the suffering is just, I don't know, it's almost like putting a blanket over you. It's like, and you can't see the person across the street is also suffering there on the bench or whatever it is when the blanket is covering your eyes. Exactly. Well said, it's, it's a perspective shift. And that's why we practice because our common perspective is, oh, okay, suffering makes our, our vision narrow. It's just me and nobody else is having trouble and problems. Everybody's having a great life. No problem. Right. And oh, and what happened for me also is in meditation. I slow down enough to not be at the effect of it all. And to just realize these things like you're not. Beautiful, beautifully said exactly. And, and the slowing down. Yes, slowing down. Yeah, absolutely. Lovely. Thank you, Deborah. Claire, please. And this will be the last comment before we go to follow up on what Deborah said because I have for years, Paul at a practice of bringing to mind when I'm going through a difficult time. I have two relatives who had extraordinarily horrible things happen in their lives. And I've learned over time, whenever I get discouraged about what's going on, to think back to them both of them by the way have survived and thrived, despite the circumstances. And my so my mind always turns to them and I think to myself, if they can do it. You can do it too. They're like my heroes. Oh, that sounds great. They don't know they've made this great gift to me, but they have. It's beautiful, Claire. I am so moved that not only have they survived, but they have thrived and they are your heroes. And they don't know they've given you this gift. I wonder, actually, which brings in question for me, Claire, have you ever considered reaching out to them and letting them know? I have in one case I've considered writing a book about her, because she's so exceptional. Both stories are longer. I would tell them. Yeah, the other one I actually could reach out to because he's closer to me. She's in love. Just just wondering not to put you on the spot. I realize I have, but just an invitation of, you know, maybe they would really appreciate knowing this. But anyway, you can you can contemplate it. But thank you for bringing. Thank you. Thanks for bringing that in. Lovely, beautiful. So, dear Sangha, especially today with the theme of this common humanity, let us turn into small groups together. And may you please stay if you can, because that's so rich to support and be with others in this way, in the small groups tonight, especially with this theme with the theme of common humanity. We're not alone. Of course, we're not alone. And we have the sense that, you know, it's just us. So if you can stay, please do. And if you have to leave, it's no problem. No problem. Understandable. So the rooms are created, and they are now open. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. And with compassion. Here you go. And the rooms are closed, everybody's back. So we have just about a minute for any final reflections that have come up, and you're burning to share them, please. And if you haven't spoken today for a while, we'd love to hear from you. For the benefit of all beings. Okay, well, going once, going twice. All right, well, thank you all. Thank you for practicing. Thank you for being part of happy hour for the shared common humanity, cultivating our hearts for to serve ourselves, each other and the world. And for you all, be well, happy, safe, and free. Thank you everyone. Be well.
