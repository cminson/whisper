 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, thanks Martha, I appreciate it. Welcome to you all. Happy to be sitting with you and welcome to the folks out there. We'll have the usual form. I'll lightly guide us till the top of the hour and then offer a talk. Maybe you have time for some dialogue, we'll see. And, yeah, so please settle into a posture that feels sustainable. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Just making your mind a welcoming environment for the sounds of people trickling in. A welcoming environment for the intensity of having a body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the breathing that helped you arrive. Maybe it's a deeper, fuller breath that reaches into the belly. And just ever so gently smooths out the energy of body, mind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There's also often a sense as the winds of phenomena blow through the sensations of our body, of affect, of sound, thought. It's almost as if our bracing against phenomena is an attempt to protect some kernel of our being, the center point of self. Sense that something inside of us needs protection from phenomena. But our practice is to let the winds of experience blow, trusting that there's nothing inside that will be blown over. It's nothing more than pleasant and unpleasant. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The winds of grasping and aversion, an opportunity we sense on the horizon, the unpleasantness of sound or sensation. We let those winds blow too, all held in the openness of awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The Dharma never asks us to pretend, to pretend we like what we dislike or are neutral about what we like. It asks us simply to meet these winds in the openness of awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
