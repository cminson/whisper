The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So again a warm welcome for everyone who's here attending this IMC's Asian Dharma Circle
hosted open house event and those who are online joining through YouTube as well as
those who are in person. I'm so happy to see some faces that I've been waving
Lulu and I've been seeing on Zoom and now I get to see you all here in person.
That's nice. I want to say a few words about today's open house event. So we
don't have a long history but we did start this last year where our
intention was to allow the Asian Sangha in IMC to meet with the broader IMC
community in some way that may be meaningful and supportive of the overall
community. And last year we did this and we also had our guest teacher and
speaker joining us Chen Xinghan who shared a bit about her book and being
the refuge and we had a good time discussing the book and its relevance
in our broader community. And she's here today those who are online and you will
see her hopefully in the course of this event. And then today we're so
fortunate to be able to have Trent Walker here with us who will be our guest
teacher and guest speaker who share a deep practice and history in the Asian
Dharma scene. And today Trent will be sharing his new book as well as leading
some chanting that is rich in the Asian Buddhist history. And so we'll be doing
some chanting together and learning about the book. And the formal part of our
gathering together will include some of this introductions and chanting
together as well as some chance to have interactive discussions for those
who are here in person and some question and answer time and kind of we are
exploring this together as a community. And we will end the session around 2.30
Pacific time and after that the the formal part of our session will end close
and those of who are here you're welcome to join us for an optional gathering
out in the parking lot of IMC where we'll have time for some tea and some snacks
and and so just kind of informal connecting and so that will be happening
out in the parking lot. And so with that I'm gonna pass it on to Li Lu. Thank you
Ying. It's just such a pleasure to be here in person. There's kind of an energy
and coming together that I'm really appreciating right now and for those
joining online I'm just loving that this is happening here but also happening in
broader broader scale across across the worldwide web. I'll say a little bit now
about our group the IMC Asian Dharma Circle. I think it's been it's been two
years maybe a little bit more three three and a half years that we've been
going for and the the the group kind of just sort of happened to come together
in a way I think I had come to a point in my own Dharma practice where I almost
accidentally started sitting with people of color sanghas and noticing how in
those environments something dropped away that I wasn't I didn't know was there
something relaxed that I hadn't been aware of that was a holding and there
was a wish that the benefits that I was receiving could could continue for others
and for myself and so I wanted to see if IMC could have something like this could
offer something like this for practitioners and fortunately Ying was
also happy to join and lead it and so we sort of started this and we've been
going since the pandemic and it's just been such such a gift actually for my
own practice and for all those who I've met who seem to have benefited a lot
from this group as well we meet twice a month on the second and fourth Sundays
at this time about one to three one to two thirty actually and it's a usually
pretty intimate but kind of casual group we have some regular people we have
some people who come and they're new and we offer a guided meditation and a
short Dharma talk and I think what's really rich is because it's a smaller
group there is a lot of time to ask questions and interact and kind of
share of each other and connect in a way that's really rich that I think has
been very helpful for our own practices so that's a little bit about Asian Dharma
Circle at IMC and we have this tradition this is our second time of
hosting this open house once a year and it's a way to acknowledge that the
boundaries of what is constituted as Asian if they're not you know firm and
hard and that many of us have family members friends the practice of what
is constituted as Asian Buddhism is also kind of porous and to just explore
and appreciate this together so today we have Trent and I'm so happy to have him
coming to share a little bit more about chanting practice in our group there has
been a lot of interest in kind of chanting as a practice and I don't know
if it's coming out of kind of growing up hearing chanting or just being in
cultures that are more amenable to this practice but wanting to share it and
bring it to the whole community and I'll say a little bit to formally
introduce Trent so Trent at researches and teaches about Southeast Asian
Buddhism literature and music he is currently a postdoc fellow at the Ho
Center for Buddhist Studies and lecture in religious studies at Stanford
University and Trent received a BA in religious studies from Stanford and a
PhD in Buddhist studies from UC Berkeley where his dissertation focused on
Cambodian chanting manuscripts and you can visit his website where there's
lovely audio recordings of him chanting many of the pieces from his book
it's Trent Walker.org and I just feel like it's such a treat to be able to be
here in person and hear you share about this work and just be able to be part
of this this like auditory experience so thank you so much for joining us today.
Thank you so much Ying thank you so much Li Lu for inviting me here it's such a
pleasure to be here on this special day for the Asian Dharma circle on this
sounds like second annual open house and to see both new and and familiar faces
so thank you for for making this this possible. I just wanted to say a few
things about chanting about the book that some of the translations I've put
together in this packet are coming from and how I came to this particular mode
of practice and study but mostly what I'd like to do in the time we have
together is make time for us to chant and that's what the the packet here is
for it's just to allow us to sample and experience a couple of different types
of chanting together and many of you I'm sure have experienced a whole wide
range of of chanting styles whether in your own practice or things that you
grew up hearing or things that you've encountered in Buddhist practice or
other kinds of practices in your life and for that I'm also grateful that Ying
and Li Lu will facilitate some reflection and discussion both about sort
of what we've experienced today and then also tying that into your lives and
your practice more broadly and thank you to everyone joining online as well it's
a real pleasure to be here. I'd like to begin just by passing around a few
things if that's okay I don't have a PowerPoint but I just want to give you a
few images if I may and maybe we could pass them in different directions so
this one here that I'll pass around this is one of my main teachers of Chen
Gao Ran I just wanted you to be able to see a picture of her when I when I
speak of her and this next one is of my other main teacher Prum Ud just just
you can see a picture of him and I'll just pass this around as well because you
can see in this book some Cambodian banner banner paintings of scenes from
the Buddhist life that are connected to some of the chance so just you have a
sense of what might be happening visually in context with some of the
chance I'll just just pass those around maybe I'll keep passing things around is
that okay can I pass these around to these are just two examples of chanting
books in the Cambodian language or Khmer or Khmer and I just especially if
you could see the cover the covers show a scene of some of the ways this
chanting one of the particular styles of chanting that I'll talk about more is
used my interest in Buddhism and Buddhist practice and music really grew up
together when I was in high school I started to practice at a couple of
different Buddhist centers in San Francisco at Gold Mountain monastery
in Chinatown and also at the San Francisco Zen Center and in both of
those contexts I was drawn to silent meditation but also to ritual and
chanting practices in particular I had also grown up here on the peninsula
studying music trumpet and voice these kinds of things so I was really curious
about this interaction this intersection between the dharma between the
teachings of the Buddha between the practices that we engage in and sound
what what might be happening at this this intersection and that drew me after
finishing high school to go before going to college to work for a year in
Cambodia with an organization called Cambodian living arts and doing
research for them on this intersection between Buddhism and music and through
through that organization I became connected to the two teachers whose
images I've passed around so you can see Kao Ran and Prumut who became my root
teachers in the Cambodian dharma song or thought-bought tradition which is this
particularly melodic style of chant that we'll get to explore together and that
that experience and then also studying chant in a monastic setting I spend
about half a year ordained temporarily as a novice in Cambodia made me really
curious both in my own practice and in my academic life to continue thinking
about and trying to understand what's what's happening in this relationship
between particular Buddhist teachings and ideas and the way they're lifted into
music or a sound or a chant
if it's okay I thought I might mix up the portion in which I'll I'll say a
little bit more about the Cambodian dharma song tradition but I would like
for us to chant together a little bit first then we can get a feel of some
chanting in our bodies and I'd like to begin with a chant that actually isn't
in your packet but just something very very very very simple and this is coming
out of the Cambodian tradition in which certain forms of meditation practice
involve concentrating on syllables these may be repeated silently sometimes
repeated aloud and that's somewhere in between what we might think of chanting
as a practice that takes place out loud and meditation as a practice that takes
place silently in the Cambodian Buddhist context and this is similar in
Thailand Laos other places as well this word this poly word bhavana that we
might think of as meaning mental cultivation or meditation in many
cases really refers to chant I often chant done silently in this way here I
would like to take these three syllables mo and these are syllables that in the
Cambodian tradition can stand in for the Buddha the dharma in the Sangha there
are syllables that can stand in for the virtues of our mothers our fathers our
teachers and other kinds of symbolic meanings within the esoteric
teravada context but for now I just like for us to explore them as as sounds so
the the syllables again are mo and ooh and so let's chant just we'll begin with
mo and I invite you I will start on a particular note don't feel you have to
do that note you can pick any one sound that feels comfortable to for you and
your vocal register and then we'll just do that for one breath then we'll move
on to awe and then we'll move on to ooh so I'll start each of those and then you
can join in just hold it for one breath and we'll pause taking a breath in go
on to the next syllable and ending with ooh make sense okay
mo
all
Om.
Om.
Now let's do the same thing,
but for each syllable,
whenever you come to the end of your breath,
just take a breath again and rejoin everyone else.
So we'll continue on mo until I ring the bell.
Then we'll pause, do ah, then we'll pause,
and then do ooh.
Makes sense?
Mo.
Mo.
Mo.
Mo.
Mo.
Mo.
Mo.
Om.
Om.
Om.
Om.
Om.
Om.
Om.
Om.
Now I'd like for us to continue that same approach to sound,
but extend it to this first chant here on the top of page one.
As you might be aware, the Pali language is pronounced in many different ways,
depending on the particular linguistic or cultural context in which it's used.
So there is a so-called Indic or international pronunciation of Pali.
It's similar to, not exactly the same as the Sri Lankan pronunciation.
And for this first chant, it would be something like,
namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya.
And then there are also, depending on the phonetics of local languages,
all kinds of other ways Pali might be pronounced.
So for instance, in the Cambodian context, that same phrase is pronounced,
namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya.
So let's try this chant.
One thing that I wanted to highlight here is in gray, those are the syllables that are longer,
and the ones that aren't in gray, those are the syllables that are shorter.
In many styles of chanting, that distinction between short and long syllables,
when chanting in Pali, determines the rhythm of the chant.
This isn't true in all styles, but in many styles, particularly in Cambodia, Thailand,
Laos, to the less extent, and Sri Lanka and Burma, but particularly in those three contexts,
that distinction between short and long syllables determines the rhythm.
And the long syllables are exactly twice the length of time as the short ones.
So it leads to this rhythm of namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya.
So slow down, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya.
So let's try that. We'll try it in this international pronunciation of Pali, namo buddhaya first.
And then, like before, just breathe when you feel comfortable,
and you don't have to breathe at the end of the phrase.
In some styles of chant, one might recite, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya.
But here, let's just continue without a breath there,
but take a breath whenever you would like to, because we're chanting in a group,
and then join back in wherever the group is.
So, for instance, if I was chanting by myself in this way, I might go,
namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya, namo buddhaya.
Makes sense?
So let's try that altogether.
A simple phrase just means homage, namo, to the Buddha, buddhaya.
Namo, buddhaya, namo, buddhaya.
Namo Burn Thayana-Namo Burn Thayana-Namo Burn Thayana-Namo
Burn Thayana-Namo Burn Thayana-Namo Burn Thayana-Namo
Thāyānamo buddhāyānamo buddhāyānamo buddhāyānamo.
Let's continue with that same style, but we'll add the Khmai pronunciation.
Just so you can feel what it's like to chant in a different pronunciation of Pali.
So instead of namo buddhāyā, namo buddhāyā, we'll try na-mo buddhāyā, na-mo buddhāyā.
So let's just repeat each syllable first, na-mo buddhāyā, na-mo buddhāyā, na-mo buddhāyā.
So we'll do the same thing.
And feel free to experiment with what pitch you're chanting on.
It doesn't, in Cambodian styles of chanting that sounds monotone, sounds like each individual
chanter is usually on one pitch.
Generally speaking in a group, people take on many different pitches, whatever is comfortable
for them.
And it creates this interesting layered kind of sound.
So feel free to experiment.
Namo buddhāyā, namo buddhāyā, namo buddhāyā, na-mo buddhāyā, too.
Thiyanamoput Thiyanamoput Thiyanamoput Thiyanamoput
Can I get a time check on how much? Yeah.
Go ahead. Okay, wonderful. Thanks so much.
So let's do maybe just one more chant in this simple style of just chanting on one pitch.
And then I'll transition and we'll explore some of this more melodic style of Cambodian chant.
Of course. Yeah.
Just a curiosity really in the top line where it has the Khmer script poly, which I can't read.
Nonetheless, it says that there are only two long syllables compared to the three below. Can you say about that?
Sure, sure. So if you look at that second long syllable, you'll see that the second part of it looks a little complicated.
So there are actually two syllables in there. In other words, the Dha is written kind of below the Put.
So it's like Namu Put Dha. Yeah.
And many scripts that are used to write poly have similar kinds of principles.
So that's why it happens to look like that.
So let's look at this second chant here that many of you might be familiar with.
This one that in the international style of pronunciation would be Namu Tas Bhagavato Arahatto Samma Sambuddhas.
Or in this Khmer style pronunciation, Namu Tas Bhagavato Arahatto Samma Sambuddhas.
Maybe we'll do it just in this international style, but just want you to invite you to be aware of these other kinds of pronunciations.
And often when this is chanted, the individual words might be separated with a pause.
One might chant something like Namu Tas Bhagavato Arahatto Samma Sambuddhas.
That would be one style. But let's try this other style where there's no break between words.
And the only thing determining the rhythm is this difference between the long and short syllables.
Here the long ones again are highlighted in gray. So we get this pattern of Namu Tas Bhagavato Arahatto Samma Sambuddhas.
Namu Tas Bhagavato Arahatto Samma.
So let's just do that once, all together three times, again without a pause at the end. So all together three times.
Namu Tas Bhagavato Arahatto Samma Sambuddhas.
Thank you.
So we can, if you'd like, and if we have time, we can explore more about different other chants often in this monotone style.
If you turn to the second page now, I just wanted to offer some other approaches to chant.
So this distinction between long and short syllables and the rhythms behind that are part, one part of the aesthetic joy and beauty of chanting in Pali.
So for instance, this one at the top, which is often used to recite prior to reciting Buddhist texts, to invite local spirits on earth and in the heavens to come listen to a recitation of Buddhist chanting.
So the pattern of these syllables repeats each line, and that's how poetry in Pali works.
There's these patterns of short and long syllables that repeat each line. So this is a slightly more complicated pattern.
But when in recitation, we can hear the pattern very clearly of.
So it creates, again, each line having this same kind of rhythmic pattern.
But sometimes in a Cambodian context, it might be recited in that way, like.
Or sometimes a melody would be applied to it.
And it's these melodies that I was really drawn to in encountering this Cambodian Dharma song tradition.
So I'll just give you one example of a melody of this, and then we'll turn to some of the other texts in this tradition via English translation.
So one melody that could be used here, I'll just give you an excerpt of it would be.
Sankin ka me charo pahin kere sikhar tad de chandhali khe hanga vimhe ne.
Thee phair watne hai tyak nhinga me a tarwana ke hane ke hawathom.
And when I first encountered this tradition through Brum Ud and Gautran, I was really curious about what's this relationship between the sound of the chants and the texts, what's happening in this relationship.
And Gautran in particular really emphasized that some texts and the melodies that go with them are designed to bring about this experience of samvega,
samvega being this Pali word that means this experience of shaking or being stirred, particularly being stirred by the encounter with impermanence.
So when Buddhist texts narrate the life of the Buddha and describe him leaving the palace and encountering the four sites of an old person, a sick person, a dead person, and a renunciate, this is the feeling or the experience that's described.
And samvega in this Cambodian tradition as in elsewhere in Tauravada Buddhist context is sometimes paired with this experience of pasada. Pasada literally means this sinking down, just as a glass of muddy water.
If it's allowed to sit, the mud will sink to the bottom and the top part becomes clear and bright. So it has this sense of clear, bright faith and clarity in the mind that can be paired with samvega.
So some other kinds of chants in their melodies and in their texts might be crafted to bring about this kind of experience.
So if you turn to page four on your handout, this is a very simple melodic style chant.
If it was that here would be chanted in Cambodian and Khmer in the language of Cambodia, would sound something like this.
And because our time is short, let's just try chanting. We'll just take one stance of this and learn it in English together.
And let's learn the fourth one, the one that says here, no joy equals that of peace. Nothing else can end suffering here in this world and beyond. Peace is the cause of true joy.
And I've made this little space in between the lines here so that each line is divided into a group of four syllables, then a group of three syllables.
And Cambodian chanting in, not in Pali, but in Khmer, often almost invariably the melodies are structured based on a certain number of syllables.
For one part of the melodies, a certain number of syllables for another part of the melody.
It's very analogous to when we're singing a song that has multiple verses, usually there's approximately the same number of syllables in each verse so that we can put the same words to that same melody.
So the same practice is happening here.
So let's just try this one. This one is one that's associated with this experience or this feeling tone of basada, of clarity or bright faith.
So I'll recite a short bit and if you could repeat after me, that would be, then we can experience this one together.
No joy equals
That of peace
Nothing else can
And suffering
Here in this world
And behind
Pieces the cause
Pieces the cause
Of true joy
Let's try that one more time, but we'll just do it all together. I will chant along with you. Don't worry if you can't remember what the melody was.
Just listen to those around you and we'll make our way through it.
No joy equals
Nothing else can
And suffering
Here in this world
And behind
Pieces the cause
Of true joy
Let's just do one last one here.
Let's just do the one in the next page.
And I think we'll have time just to do this and call in response.
And let's skip to the third stanza.
This is one that's associated with Samvaka.
And the story here is this is recreating this moment after the Buddha has been born and his mother in these texts is described as dying seven days after his birth.
And this is Maya, Queen Mahamaya, offering her guidance to Mahapachatabhi Goldmi, who as the Buddha's aunt takes care of the Buddha after Maya's death.
So this is Maya's guidance then to Goldmi.
So if we just take the third stanza here in Kamae, this sounds something like
And so we'll apply a version of that same melody for this line, what can I do when we are born only to be destroyed, etc.
What can I do
When we are born only to be destroyed, etc.
When we are born only to be destroyed, etc.
All humans and animals, animals, animals,
die and decay, die and decay by nature, by nature.
Thank you.
So I think we're going to transition now to have a chance to discuss and reflect.
You're welcome to take a look at any of the other chance that we didn't get to the other ones on like pages five, six, seven, eight.
Those are just examples of other ones in this Harmasong style. They have melodies of their own that might be recited for when someone is passing away, sometimes for funerals, sometimes for the consecration of a Buddha image,
sometimes just for a ceremony in gratitude for parents.
So many different occasions. And the book that they're coming from until Nirvana's time this book just has more translations and essays that try to
For me, try to fulfill what my my teachers promote and go around wanting to do, which was to share this particular Cambodian tradition with the world.
Particularly younger Cambodian Americans who are maybe more familiar with English than Khmer so that they can access this part of their heritage and their tradition, but also for people who are not Cambodian but want to appreciate this particular window on the Dharma that's
offered through the Cambodian Dharma tradition. So thanks for your attention. And I'll turn it back over to the two of you.
Good to sit here and listen for a while and feel this. We have a chance for those who are here in person to get into a small group of three or four to share a little bit about what this experience is.
Chanting, listening to the sound of the chanting, and maybe what might have evoked in your heart in your mind in your bodies.
And I would invite folks to mingle a bit. So maybe go to the people you may not know much at all. And we can spread out in the hall and maybe even outside on the deck, if you like.
We have about 10 minutes or so. And once you settle into a group, maybe just take a moment to kind of collectively recognize that you're in a group and find a way, you know, whoever might want to start first.
And then go around the circle and to say one thing at a time. So as we get together, we kind of also are learning from each other.
And this is not a chance to comment about other people's experience, but really allow this to be something that we're sharing together, collectively sharing together, and receiving the gift of sharing.
And so maybe we can just stand up and form the groups. And for those who don't find the groups, maybe you can come to the center of the hall and we'll find you a group. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
