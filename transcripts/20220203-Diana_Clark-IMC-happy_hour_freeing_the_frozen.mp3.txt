The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So welcome, welcome everybody.
So before we turn on the recording, we were talking a little bit about weather.
I don't know why this is a little dorky side of me, I'd love to hear about the weather.
I don't know why, it's just one of those things.
And it's so much nicer for me right to be nice here, cozy in the Bay Area
and just hear about all the other places, right?
So, but I saw a little video today on YouTube, I learned about it from another Dharma teacher
that maybe I want to describe just a little bit here, describe briefly.
And it has to do with cold weather, but it also has to do with loving-kindness too.
So maybe some of you guys have seen this video, it came out years ago and there's lots and lots and lots of years.
Hold on one second, I have to cough.
Thank goodness for mute buttons, right? What did we do before that?
So this video, it shows a little sparrow who's on a, like a pipe, a metal pipe.
And the sparrow is flapping its wings, but it can't get off because its feet are frozen to the pipe.
And you can see that, you know, looks like maybe this is a ranch in the background and covered with snow.
Everything is covered with snow and this poor little bird, right, these little sparrows are so small.
And you can see that the person who's holding the camera is getting closer and closer and that poor little sparrow, right, is trying to get away.
And so we see this hand, it's a big kind, it's a masculine hand, come and take the sparrow and kind of like firmly hold the sparrow.
And it's, of course, the little head is sticking out. And then we see just the side of somebody's face who has a mustache going, trying to warm up the feet on this little sparrow,
so that the feet, right, get unfrozen sober. He does this for a while. And then he kind of like helps a little bit, one of the feet, and he's still holding the sparrow.
And he says, there you go, little birdie, fly and be free.
It opens his hand and off goes this sparrow.
It's very touching, right, the whole thing is, I don't know how many seconds, right, it's not very long, but just this, in my mind, it's somebody on a ranch who's looking after the animals and sees, oh, look, here's a little sparrow that's stuck and wanting to take care of it.
Sometimes maybe we can relate to this, you know, maybe this idea of kindness, right, of course, loving kindness practice, we want to have this movement in our hearts that are open and care about the suffering of others, whether they're little sparrows or other humans
or other beings.
So much about this practice is helping us to just be sensitive to the suffering. Where can kindness be added? Where is, could it be, you know, in order for this person to free the sparrow, they had to just notice.
And then they also had to care.
So part of loving kindness practice is to help quiet the heart and mind of which we can notice these things.
And which we can.
Maybe, what would be helpful here?
This person that was taking the sparrow, right, it was kind of a decisive move, right, if it wasn't, if he didn't hold it in a way that was tight enough, maybe it would have tried to flap its wings, maybe broken its wings, right, it kind of becomes the being in the hand of the person.
But of course, if he held it too tight, right, you could squish a little creature like that, these little bones.
So to notice and to care.
But it also goes, this little vignette goes the other way that sometimes we are the sparrows.
Sometimes we are stuck and we just aren't quite sure how or why or, and we're flapping our wings doing what we know how to do, doing what comes natural and it's not working.
We don't want to suggest that we always need some other being to come rescue us, but just to recognize that sometimes we get stuck.
We get stuck.
And so, is there a way in which we can be, we find ourselves being both, being that sparrow being stuck, can we also be the person who just blows some air.
It didn't require that much effort, it didn't require something new or different, but this person has air to give, right, it didn't have to go call some Google how to save a sparrow metal wire or something like this, you know, we all have warm breath.
So, is there a way in which we can so what is it that's inside of us that can help us that maybe reassure us with this warm hand and blow a little warm air.
Maybe, maybe loving kindness practice can be that maybe some loving kindness for ourselves can be a way can be just enough warmth.
That we can find ourselves. Okay, now we can take flight.
And it's so sweet that this in this little video that I don't remember the exact words but this man he says, there you go little birdie. Okay, fly away. You know it's this this tenderness.
So, loving kindness practice to help all the little frozen sparrows inside our hearts, the ones that we meet in the world, and maybe those of you who are having cold weather, maybe there might actually be some frozen sparrows.
I don't know how common this is.
So, with that as a little introduction let's let's let's do some practice.
So just settling into our meditation posture.
Just arriving.
Nice way to arrive is to tune into whatever bodily experience is obvious and readily available.
Often that's the pressure against the body where it's sitting.
If you have a regular meditation practice that might just be the breath maybe you're accustomed to being with the breath. And that's what's obvious.
Maybe there's some discomfort in the body that's asking for some attention.
Maybe that's what's obvious.
Whatever it might be, letting our awareness land on sensations in the body.
In a simple and complicated way.
Just being with the bodily experience.
That's now.
Maybe resting on the sensations of breathing.
And when the mind wanders.
Just very simply, gently begin again.
Without making a big story.
This is what minds do.
And sometimes wonder.
And then to start our loving kindness practice.
Starting where it's easy.
Bring into mind a loveable being.
Maybe it's something that calls our heart to little sparrow and distress frozen to a metal pipe or, yes, probably was a pipe.
Maybe it's somebody who's really touched our life.
Maybe it's our teachings.
Maybe somebody a coach and mentor.
And then connecting with this loveable being.
It can be helpful to say the phrases to help us stay with loveable being to stay with our cultivating.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you live with loveable being.
May you be blessed.
And then to expand our loving kindness and great dear friend.
Somebody with whom we have a relationship.
Bringing them to mind.
Connecting with them.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you live with ease.
This well-wishing that we have just naturally inside of us.
Turning into it for a minute.
This well-wishing that we have just naturally inside of us.
Care, warmth, respect for ourselves.
Of course, of course we include ourselves.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
If we were to be the person that warms our own feet.
Is there a part of us that can do that?
Help us get unstuck.
This part that we're cultivating, love and kindness.
Can help get unstuck.
Corrosion.
Corrosion.
Corrosion.
Corrosion.
Corrosion.
Corrosion.
Staying with this movement of expanding the love and kindness.
Include a neutral person, somebody we don't know.
I always offer up maybe somebody on the Zoom call, somebody in the neighborhood,
but maybe there's another setting in which you encounter an individual that you don't know.
It's helpful if it can be an individual rather than just a generic, unknown person.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you live with ease.
We all want to imagine that we will be a good Samaritan.
Help others.
This practice helps create the conditions in which we can be sensitive perhaps to others that need help.
And with wisdom to provide support.
Where we can.
Thank you.
Thank you.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sometimes we find ourselves not really sure how to go forward or what to do.
Sometimes we find ourselves not really sure how to go forward or what to do.
Maybe about 13 minutes or so, maybe 12 minutes to talk about this idea.
Maybe about little sparrows being frozen.
Maybe they say one thing, one point, and let it go to the next person, and they say one point, and let it go to the next person, and they say one point.
And then it comes back around to you, and now you've heard something that you hadn't heard before, and maybe you have something new to say.
So you have a new understanding that you wouldn't have thought of before if you had just kind of informed others of your ideas on this.
So you can go in the order of the length of your screen name, short, a few numbers of characters, you go first, lots of characters, you go last.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Okay, so welcome back.
If you have a question or comment or something they'd like to say, after discussion.
Have frozen sparrows.
Sometimes we're the free Z and we're that D freezer.
Fred.
I guess I was going to say just that it seems to me that that that's exactly my experience in life is that, you know, one day I lend a hand and the next day, I need a hand.
And oftentimes they're the same people, you know, in my circle of family and friends, we all, you know, we watch for each other.
And then there's the hand that you don't know that that steps in and disappears and where there's the moment that you can be of assistance and then vanish and that has its own charm.
Thanks.
Thank you. Thank you.
Jerry.
I guess that's, I was just kind of thinking about just like reading about exercise and thinking about journals or books, but how good it is for your physical exercise.
But you still have to do it to get the benefit.
So you can, you can be reading about modeling kindness and oh my goodness, it's this and that. But until you actually do it, it like I come here at night.
It's this, I think Fred said is I was like adhesive because it takes the edge off the day that is accumulated. And I find that I don't know if it's all in the insula, but in the part of the brain. But when I wish someone else well, just that act of holding my mind, someone that's maybe helping me, it's easy to that.
I feel better.
And then I do it on myself. I'm like, oh my goodness, what was I all up regulated about.
I like it. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, Jerry.
Yeah, right.
And some and with doing this practice kind of regularly also we start to see where we kind of get hooked up for stock or snarled up or tangled up or something like this we start to understand ourselves better and start to see things a little bit easier.
Thank you. I'm a little reluctant to tell the story to the large group but I was in the midst of it with our small group when we were sent back to see you.
And I had to do with my husband who went to the business school at Harvard. And that's only relevant because two of his section mates are among the wealthiest men in the world, literally, and it's not his class, it's just this little section.
And they all hang together when you go to a reunion so that halfway through I looked around and both of these men had disappeared. They weren't in the group anymore.
So I got curious and I started asking around, you know, where were Steve and Fred, and it turned out that both of them had been approached by people in the class who were in serious trouble.
And they had left the group to go and work with these men one-on-one and help them get out of the difficulties they were in.
And it really struck me, I was a lot younger than, you know, that it is really a mark of a great person, actually, that they tend to be very selfless, actually, and put others ahead of themselves.
So it was just a lovely experience.
Thank you. Thank you, Claire. And maybe I'll add, it's also a mark of a great person to recognize I need somehow.
Yeah, that's when we need, instead of thrashing around, harming ourselves, harming others, whatever it might be.
Thank you, Claire. Okay, so it's the top of the hour.
Thank you all. And may you stay warm wherever you are and not get frozen to whatever you happen to be touching.
I'd like to unmute, we can say goodbye. Bye-bye. Thank you.
Thank you for your stories. Thank you. Bye-bye.
