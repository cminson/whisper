The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, back to the continuing with the Four Foundations for Awareness.
This particular set of practices that Buddha teaches is calling upon a toolkit of attention.
If you think of attention as a toolkit, it has different component parts, different tools within it.
Different tools for being attentive, being present, for helping awareness become established.
And one of those supports for establishing awareness and maintaining it and letting it grow is knowing, which we talked about.
There's a simple knowing of the breathing.
And another tool for attention that the Buddha talks about in this text is feeling.
And for some people, the subjective inner body experience feeling is a stronger entry point into the present moment to be established here in awareness.
For other people, it's knowing, their capacity to know.
For other people, it's their ability to just settle back and observe what's happening.
So all of these are part of the toolkit that supports awareness, knowing, experiencing, and observing.
In this discourse of the Buddha, the first instructions, first exercise in breathing is to first know, as we breathe in, a long breath, to know it's a long breath.
As we breathe out a long breath, know it's a, we're breathing out a long breath.
And same for the short, as we breathe in a short inhale, know it is a short inhale, as we breathe out a short exhale, know it as a short exhale.
And so here we're knowing some particularity of breathing.
And to just kind of vaguely be present for breath coming and going, doesn't give an anchor, doesn't give a strong rootedness in the experience of breathing, but to know the particularity of it.
And here for me, the idea of long and short is just represents all the different things we can know about the breathing.
We can know the feeling, like you're aware of the breathing in the chest or the belly, the expansion that happens with the inhale, or the contraction or gathering together on the exhale.
We can be aware of the sense of pressure or movement.
We can be aware of tautness and tightness and fullness.
We can be aware of the feeling of release and maybe there's some pulling in or contracting that goes on, on the inhale.
There's a whole range of different particular sensations, each person, each day, each breath, slightly different perhaps.
And there's an art to helping us be rooted in the present moment is to know some of these particular sensations that come into play.
It isn't that we're chasing after all the possible sensations we can have. It isn't like we're being busy trying to have a catalog of sensations.
But we're using the sensations, the knowing of the sensations as being a way of helping us be established more and more here in the present moment with our experience.
As we do this, it's working as an alternative to having the mind wandering off into thoughts and thinking, but all kinds of things.
And this is one of the big movements, especially for beginners in meditation, is to train the mind to be present for something that's not the world of thinking, the discursive thoughts.
But the attention is present for something that is healthy, wholesome, useful to kind of center ourselves on as an alternative to the way that the thinking mind not only distracts us, but also fragments us, undermines us.
They say that one of the leading causes for depression, not the only cause, but the leading cause is rumination.
Kind of endlessly thinking, sometimes in loops, the same debilitating thoughts, same discouraging thoughts, critical thoughts.
And so it's probably a leading cause of anxiety as well, the ability to think and imagine all kinds of dangers.
And so to keep coming back and come back and find ourselves rooted here as an alternative and become self-reinforcing after a while, because there's a goodness, there's a feeling of rightness.
There's a feeling of gathering ourselves together, unification, concentration, a sense of ease, lightness.
Something like that depends on what begins to come together as we stay with the breathing.
So the knowing is one of the faculties that supports that, gentle, relaxed, soft.
I like to think of it as the natural way in which the mind knows things.
You know, if you, there's a, next to the camera, I'm looking at this YouTube, there's a clock.
And as I'm saying this, it's obvious to me that the clock says, I know the clock says 7.39.
And so I don't have to, there's not a lot of work to see that, it's just so obvious, I see it, I know it.
So it's that easy, the knowing, it's not meant to be straining and investigating hard what is actually going on here.
But it is kind of a, of a centering ourselves in that experience through knowing.
The second tool of attention that Buddha talks about after knowing is this experiencing, feeling.
And that you can also do with the breathing.
And you can feel the subjective experience of the body breathing.
What's the body's experience of breathing?
So the very things that you can know through the first tool of knowing what's happening,
is used or can be used to help us then also to feel what it is we know.
And this is a little bit of a protective protection from the knowing being only kind of a cognitive event.
But also we can feel and sense, experience the texture, the flavor, the taste, the fullness of those sensations.
And for some people that works actually better and that the primary thing they can do is they feel the subjective experience in their body,
they kind of sense and rest in that experience.
And as they do that, at some point the knowing of what they're experiencing becomes clear.
And for some people it's the knowing that comes first and then they can feel.
The direction the Buddha takes this text, and maybe it's just because you have to start somewhere that text,
is to know and then experience.
And the way he words it is breathing in when experiences the whole body, breathing out when experiences the whole body.
I'll talk more about that tomorrow, but for now what I'd like to suggest to you is that as you go through your day,
and maybe you could meditate at least one more time before we meet tomorrow,
is do that only with breathing.
So the instruction would be breathing in, experience, feel, sense what breathing in is like.
As you breathe out, experience, sense, feel what it's like to breathe out.
So rather than the whole body, just that part of the body that's engaged as you're breathing.
And kind of resting in that experience.
So again it's not a probing, a penetrating, a forcing ourselves onto the experience,
as it is almost a relaxing and receiving the experience.
And maybe that happens more in the inhale.
A little bit more of the exhale can be if necessary about relaxing and letting go.
So maybe what I've said today is a lot of instructions, and the idea is to keep it simple.
And so from what I've said here, maybe choose the simplest way for you that's supportive.
But for these next 24 hours, maybe try to see if you can discover the richness or the more fullness,
the more experience of the experience of breathing.
And maybe you have a timer on your phone or something you put on,
and periodically through the day, just be reminded of how's my breathing now,
what does it feel like, what's the experience like.
There's so much to be discovered about oneself through how we're experiencing breathing,
what's going on with breathing at any given time, how contracted it is, it's tight,
where in the body we're breathing, is it mostly chest breathing, are we breathing in the belly in a relaxed way,
is it uncomfortable to breathe, are there restrictions in the breathing,
does it feel like it's easy and flowing, not to be critical of any of this,
but just drop in, drop in and feel, oh, it's like this, and experience it for a while.
And try to do whatever you can to familiarize yourself with what the experience of breathing
at different times through the day, and then we'll continue tomorrow.
So thank you, everyone, and may you have a wonderful breathing day.
