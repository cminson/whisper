This evening, I'd like to offer a guided meditation that kind of frames some supports for practice. 
And I'll be offering three basic words that are useful tools. 
We can think of them as useful tools for our practice. 
Whether you're doing a kind of more focused attention on something like the breath or a more open practice, more choiceless awareness practice, these three tools will support you. 
And those three, these three words that I'll explore a little bit in this time with you, this guided meditation, are relax, receive, and allow. 
So first, relax. 
Relaxation is a really important support for mindfulness practice, for any form of meditation practice, actually. 
And with mindfulness, mindfulness being an ordinary kind of quality of our mind, quality that is not something special, but is something that's just naturally there in us. 
When we relax, we relax our body, we relax our mind. 
This capacity of mindfulness, this simple aspect of recognizing our experience in the present moment as experience in the present moment, this becomes much easier. 
And the exploration around relaxing itself can be a mindfulness practice. 
We attend to, we recognize what's happening in our experience, notice whether there's tension, and then see if there can be some relaxation, consciously relaxing the body. 
And so we'll start in this kind of a systematic way to relax the body, essentially scanning through, relaxing the head and face, softening the muscles of the head and face. 
Particularly around the eyes, the mouth, the jaw. 
Relaxing the neck and shoulders. 
The arms and hands. 
Softening the muscles of the chest and upper back, the stomach, the abdomen, middle and lower back, just seeing if there can be a relaxing of all of these muscles. 
As to whatever extent it's available to you to consciously relax the muscles of the chest, the torso, the back. 
And softening the muscles of the hips, the pelvis. 
Maybe even possible to relax kind of deeply inside the hip socket. 
Relaxing the legs, the feet, the arms and hands. 
And then it's also sometimes possible to relax a little more deeply in the interior of the body. 
So as I name each area, just check in and see if there can be a softening. 
Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. 
Maybe the heart can relax. 
Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. 
And then perhaps the mind can relax too. 
Don't think about it so much. 
Sometimes an analogy can be supportive or kind of an image can be supportive to help relax the mind. 
And Gil offers at times, just as if your brain were a muscle. 
Maybe the brain can relax. 
That can be a kind of a pointing in the direction of relaxing the mind. 
Relax the brain. 
Seeing if you can let go of worries, concerns, thoughts about past and future. 
As the body relaxes, it helps the mind to relax. 
And as the mind relaxes, what it naturally can do is to simply be present. 
As we relax worries and concerns, thoughts about past and future, what the mind will naturally do when it's relaxed is to take in this moment. 
And so this brings the second word, receive. 
We'll start with just a little bit of kind of settling back and just seeing what, what experience is coming to you right now. 
Maybe something in the body, the body's a pretty obvious experience. 
And so maybe there are sensations happening in the body, just naturally happening and being known. 
Not that we have to do a lot of work for that. 
Receiving what is obvious, there's a body sensation and hearing happening. 
The sound of my voice is coming and going and you have to do very little actually to hear. 
Receiving sound, quiet sounds in the room, sounds outside. 
Just settling back and letting experience come to you. 
Hearing, body sensation, maybe the breath. 
Some of you may have a practice of connecting to the experience of breathing for meditation. 
And if that's your main practice, I encourage you to explore the possibility of rather than focusing on or looking at the breath to just settle back and let the breath come to you. 
And the sensations that are obvious about this breathing, let the mind relax and receive the breath. 
The mind can actually rest quite deeply and still be very aware, still know what's happening in the present moment. 
And so this receptive kind of practice can be useful whether we're attuning towards a particular experience like the breath. 
So we can attune to the breath and then receive what the breath has to offer. 
Receive what our physical experience has to offer. 
Receive what our ear receiving sounds, what the world of sounds has to offer us, just receiving. 
Accepting what is offered. 
And this brings the third word in, allow. 
In our mindfulness practice we cultivate a capacity of awareness to be non-judgmental, non-reactive. 
That our receiving aspect of our mindfulness doesn't have to push anything away or pull anything towards it. 
It can be kind of balanced in the middle, just accepting and allowing what is offered. 
This allowing is not about agreeing or disagreeing with what is here. 
We don't have to somehow convert if there's something that is unpleasant. 
We don't have to start liking that unpleasant thing, that's not what allowing means. 
To me allowing is more about acknowledging this is what is here. 
Holding and stepping into a place where the mind can hold what is here with some measure of equanimity, of balance of mind. 
This allowing attitude is also not necessarily about not being responsive, but rather from this place of fully opening to and knowing exactly what is here without resistance. 
Wisdom can support a skillful response as opposed to a reactivity. 
And so we explore, relax, receive and allowing what is here to be here. 
That may include the experience of resistance or confusion or frustration or love or kindness, compassion, calm or peace. 
And this allowing attitude lets us recognize this is what is happening right now. 
If resistance is happening, we can recognize, oh, resistance is happening, can resistance be allowed? There's a difference between resisting something and being aware that resistance is happening. 
This is moving into that allowing attitude. 
Oh, hearing is happening right now. 
Body sensations are happening. 
Relax, receive and explore this possibility of allowing. 
If you're struggling with something, can you recognize struggling is happening? If delight or care, kindness is happening, can you know all kindness, delight is happening? Receiving and allowing what is offered. 
And of course the mind will wander at some point, you'll recognize that. 
And that moment when we recognize the mind has been lost, that is such a powerful moment in our practice. 
We may often have a relationship with that moment of judgment, of frustration, which is not necessary but often happens. 
And so rather than believing that if that happens, oh, frustration is happening and can that be allowed without kind of buying into the frustration? It's just another thing that's coming up, just another thing that's arising. 
And in the allowing of it, perhaps a skillful response might be to relax again. 
Remember that you're already receiving experience. 
Mindfulness does the receiving, so you don't have to work at it too hard. 
It's more of a stance, relax, receive, and allow.
