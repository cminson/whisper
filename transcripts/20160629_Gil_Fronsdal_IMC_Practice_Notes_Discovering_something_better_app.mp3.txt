Practice Note : Discovering Something 
Better

One of the useful skills in doing meditation  is to track 
your thinking just enough to know that you’re thinking  –  
not to be too involved in it, just enough to know and 
recognize your thinking. That simple recognition will 
give you the ability to let go of your thoughts and focus 
more fully on what’ s happening in the moment.  The 
simple recognition that you’re thinking can be helpful 
because you can consider whether what you’re thinking 
about is useful. Is it really helpful in this moment to have 
those thoughts? Do you need to believe what you’re 
thinking? D o I need to think what I’m thinking about right 
now? Is this the time for it? Are there better things to do 
than to be thinking about this? Very simple questions  
like that  can take away a l ittle bit of the authority that we 
grant our thoughts .  
 
You might not realize how much authority and 
investment you give your thoughts. We often think  that 
they’re important , and that you’re going to solve 
problems, deal wit h issues, provide satisfaction , or 
provide entertainment. To have the simple realization that you might not really need to think about this right 
now can be really helpful , because then it can be easier 
to just come back  – to come back to your breathing or to 
the simplicity of walking in doing the steps.  
 
Developing a little bit of wisdom and u nderstanding 
when you’re thinking that you don’t really need to think 
what you’re thinking at this moment  – that is very, very 
helpful and effective. As you go through this morning , 
you might periodically ask yourself or recognize your 
thinking and questio n yourself : Is this really necessary 
right now?  
 
There might be issues in your life that are necessary to 
think about , but maybe not necessary to think about 
right now. Maybe there’s something better to discover if 
you’re not thinking about your issues , and the bet ter 
thing to discover may be that just being present, being 
here in this moment, this breath, this step, the simplicity 
of just being here , sometimes is a much richer world  – a 
three dimensional world compared to the two 
dimensional or one dimensional world of thoughts.  
 
I hope you enjoy this morning here.  
 
 Thank you .
