The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
There we go. So welcome.
So this evening I'll introduce a topic.
I'll just speak just for a few minutes.
And then we'll do mindfulness of breathing as a way to help get settled
and to introduce an alternative practice if, for whatever reason,
loving-kindness practice feels overwhelming or doesn't feel like
the right thing to be doing right now.
And plus, you know, a little bit of mindfulness is supportive
for our whole life and for loving-kindness practice as well.
And then we'll do some loving-kindness.
And I'll guide us in some loving-kindness meditation.
And then we have the opportunity to interact with each other
and to discuss a topic and or share some about your experience.
And for some people, that last part about the interactive part
is really meaningful.
You might think initially like, I don't know.
These are people, some of them I don't know who they are.
Am I really going to do this?
We'll discover a lot of beautiful, kind, warm-hearted people
are here as a practice of happy hour.
It's quite something, actually.
And it can be a great way to support our practice.
Okay.
So one thing I wanted to talk about a little bit this evening
is that with loving-kindness practice,
we're asked to have loving-kindness for all beings.
Often when I'm teaching it, I'm focusing on lovable beings and the self.
But those of you who are familiar with meta loving-kindness practice,
classically, it expands and bigger and bigger and bigger
and bigger spheres to include all beings.
But it really starts with where it's easiest
and then kind of fan the flames of that warm-heartedness
until it can grow and grow.
So with loving-kindness practice,
we're asked to have loving-kindness for all beings,
including ourselves.
And I notice that sometimes it's that last bit,
including ourselves, where our being also,
that sometimes it's a little bit...
maybe isn't as easy or sometimes feels maybe not as smooth.
And maybe sometimes we have this idea,
well, I love these certain aspects of myself,
but not these aspects.
Or I love myself sometimes, but not all the time.
And that's part of the reason why we do this practice
is to help kind of fold in all aspects of ourselves,
all the times with a recognition that we do have...
I don't know, can I use this word imperfections?
We do have habits of mind, habits of behavior
that maybe are not so helpful for us
or helpful for other people.
But what would it be like if you could love yourself fully,
including all these imperfections?
What would it be like?
You might fear that, oh, wait,
if I love this anger that I often have,
then I'll turn into an angry person.
Or if I love this laziness that I sometimes have,
then I'll just turn into a lazier person.
Or if I have my addictions, my anxieties,
my difficulties with my partner, whatever it might be,
we might have this fear that we'll just become more angry,
more lazy, more addicted, more whatever it is
if we were to allow these aspects of ourselves,
if we were to love these aspects of ourselves.
Somehow it's not uncommon to have this idea
that stoking, fueling, feeding,
supporting the inner critic is the best way.
Somehow promoting the inner critic is the way forward,
as opposed to loving ourselves,
loving all aspects of ourselves.
This inner critic is a little bit like a...
My notes.
But inner critic is a little bit like...
Sometimes it can feel a little bit like a subpersonality,
like there's this one part of ourselves,
one aspect of ourselves that's constantly putting us down,
belittling us, it's this voice of negativity
or judgment or self-blaming or something like this.
And it can feel like this has a tone of harshness
and it can feel oppressive and constrictive and heavy.
So my invitation is to do an experiment
and just see what is it like, what might it be like
to have more love, more care, more respect,
more warmth, more goodwill for yourself.
All aspects of yourself.
And I'd venture to say that if you do this experiment,
what will happen is the opposite of our becoming more lazy,
more angry or whatever it is that we feel
are the things that shouldn't be loved,
what aspects of ourselves shouldn't be loved.
As we care for and extend warm-heartedness and love
and accept ourselves in a bigger, wiser way,
in a way that's more inclusive and unconditional,
we discover that our fear, our neediness,
maybe our aggression, maybe our inertia,
these things that are underneath the inner critic
that are somehow tangled up with the inner critic,
those things really diminish and they lose their power,
lose their hold on us, their habits.
There is some momentum to having them there,
but their authority or their effect on us
really diminish until they get smaller and smaller and smaller
until maybe we can recognize, like, oh yeah, here's anger.
And not say angry things, not do things out of anger.
Maybe there's a little bit of an inner twinge or twitch
or something that feels like anger,
it doesn't lead to all the other things that anger,
we might have habitually led to in the past.
So my invitation is to try it as an experiment
and see what is it like just to imagine
that you are able to love yourself.
Imagine that you are able to treat yourself with warmth and care
with all these human flaws, quote unquote, imperfections,
quote unquote, as part of the human experience, right?
That some aspects of ourselves are a little bit more mature
than other parts or they're more skillful
or some of the other ways that we behave
is a little more wholesome or helpful.
In some ways our task in this life is to see all aspects
of ourselves clearly and to love ourselves anyway.
So not to love ourselves as a way as putting a cover
over our experience or our behavior
or to condone everything we do
to behave in a way that feels polyanna-ish or delusional
but to see ourselves clearly and to love ourselves anyway.
And then with this accepting presence
we'll see that we start making different decisions.
We'll start to see that our life unfolds differently
because we're motivated or not out of fear
or not out of hatred or not out of shame
but instead our decision-making
or impetus of what kind of supports or drives our decisions
is care and warm-heartedness.
Okay, so with that is an introduction.
Let's take a seated upright posture,
a posture that expresses both your intention to meditate
and your intention to be warm-hearted,
to have some softness and some care.
It's not always obvious which posture is the best,
maybe what worked yesterday,
isn't working quite as well today
but it's worthwhile to spend a little bit of time
to find a posture that's supportive.
Let's begin with three long, slow, deep breaths.
Just as a way to connect with the body,
connect with the breath.
Let's do the exhale, seeing if there can be some sulfonane
or letting go.
It can be a tremendous support to do a light body scan
with different areas of the body
to bring the opportunity
in which there might be a little bit less tension or tightness.
It can be helpful to check in with the face
and the eyes and the jaw.
Not that anything in particular needs to happen
or that we have to do anything,
but sometimes just bringing our warm-hearted awareness
to these different areas of the body
allows something different to happen,
something other than just increased tension.
Then bringing our attention to our shoulders
and then be away from the ears
and the shoulder blades slide down the back,
the upper back and lower back
and the chest
and seeing if there might be a way
with a teeny, tiny little opening of the chest.
Maybe it's not noticeable to anybody,
just this gesture of having a little bit more space
around the heart.
Maybe it's only figurative.
And the belly,
I often have tightness in the belly
and feeling the pressure of the chair
or cushion against your body,
feeling grounded, connected.
The upper legs,
the lower legs, the feet,
the upper arms,
lower arms,
and the hands.
You might notice what the hands are touching.
Feel the softness or maybe the roughness
and the warmth or coolness of what they're touching.
And then bring your attention
to the interior experience of the hands,
the experience of having hands.
That is maybe throbbing or pulsing, tingling.
Maybe the pressure, warmth, whatever it might be.
Now maybe to bring the awareness,
stretch it out to the whole body,
and the experience of sitting here.
And maybe feeling that this body is breathing.
Just feeling the movement of the chest
or the abdomen
with the breath
or maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose.
Nothing in particular needs to be happening.
Just tuning in to the sensations of breathing.
If you find yourself lost in thought
and have to be a problem,
very simply, gently begin again
with the sensations of breathing.
And then to begin our loving-kindness
and then to begin our loving-kindness practice.
Bring to mind somebody or some being
for whom it's easy to feel warm-heartedness,
love, care, respect, goodwill.
You may or may not have a personal relationship with this being.
They may be kittens, puppies, babies,
so maybe imaginary beings
or perhaps someone you actually know.
Choose someone for whom the relationship is uncomplicated.
Straightforward.
And for whom you have this,
naturally have this warm-hearted feeling.
And then to support our intention
of cultivating, developing, loving-kindness,
going to build on this feeling of warmth.
I'm using that word.
You might use a different word
that we have towards the loveable being
and support it and maybe allow it to grow.
And we can do that by repeating these phrases
while having the loveable being in mind.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
You might want to check in with the body
and see if there is any feeling of spaciousness
or warmth or openness.
And if so, allow that experience to support you
and your cultivation of loving kindness.
Allow that experience to get as big as it would like.
And if you don't feel anything in particular,
feel perfectly fine.
Now, what would it be like to imagine
that this lovable being loves you?
In the same way, this warm-heartedness
that you've been cultivating, this openness, care
that you've been developing for the lovable being.
What if you imagine that they're sending it right back to you?
They love you.
They are wishing that you are safe, happy, healthy, and living with ease.
Can you imagine that?
Even if you're working with a kitten, puppy, baby,
there's a way in which they can be loving.
What would it be like to feel tremendous love from lovable being?
What would it be like to drink that up,
allow it to support us, nurture us, nourish us?
To drink up this experience of being loved?
And now we can do loving-kindness practice for ourselves.
Perhaps having primed the prampa,
or in some way acknowledged that others love us,
or just joining the gang in this way in terms of loving ourselves.
So just as we did with the lovable being,
can bring to mind a felt sense of yourself
or maybe a mental image of yourself.
Let me use these phrases.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be safe.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
If you find that the loving kindness for yourself is
waxing or getting a little diffuse,
maybe you could dip into so to speak,
the loving kindness that you felt for the lovable being
or that you imagined they were feeling for you.
Bring to mind that experience
and use that to support the loving kindness for yourself.
May I be happy.
May I be happy.
And the last little bit of this meditation
can feel into what would be a kindhearted way
to meditate now for yourself.
Continue with loving kindness for yourself.
Maybe mindfulness of the breath.
Maybe doing loving kindness for a lovable being.
You can do whatever practice feels the right practice for you right now.
Thank you.
And then to end this meditation
feel the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body.
Feel your feet on the ground
and when you're ready you can gently open your eyes.
So at the beginning of our time together I talked a little bit about
maybe imagining or running the experiment.
What would it be like to love yourself, love all aspects of yourself
all the time?
Can you imagine a life like that?
And maybe the word love isn't quite the right word for you.
Maybe there's treating care about or true with respect.
I like the expression warm hearted just because it's kind of vague enough
that it incorporates a number of different ideas or experiences.
Kind of a diffuse way but maybe that doesn't quite work for you.
Maybe there's something that feels a little more resonant.
But the invitation is to run the experiment as best you can
as best you can.
What would it be like to have warm heartedness, to have care, respect, love, goodwill
for yourself all the time?
And this is not an exercise in self-criticism.
This is not an opportunity for the inner critic to really take over
and say, well, I can't because of XYZ.
Or if you set the intention that you want to try this experiment
and then you find that it's difficult then to beat yourself up.
But that's not the direction we're going.
So whatever you do, please don't take this as a further support
for the inner critic to have fuel or to somehow berate ourselves
or belittle ourselves.
So it can be a tremendous support and fun to talk about these types of ideas
with others.
It's supportive sometimes for us to hear ourselves say out loud
and to articulate ideas that perhaps we aren't fully formed
until we speak them out loud, as well as it's a beautiful gift
to offer others to do some deep listening, to not interrupt,
to not be offering advice, but just to hear, to witness
somebody's experiences or the way that they're processing it.
So with that, I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms.
And we won't be there for very long.
But just as an opportunity to talk about maybe this invitation
to what might it be like to love yourself,
to have warm heartedness towards yourself.
So we will have maybe just 12 minutes.
Maybe I'll make it 11 minutes.
It's kind of funny to be so surprised.
So I see here, but whom allows me to do that.
And you'll be in groups of two or, I'm sorry,
three or four, mostly three here.
Okay, so have fun.
We don't have a lot of time, but would somebody like to share
what was I like to either to talk about this idea of loving oneself
or even just that practice of being in a small group
talking about these types of things.
It's always nice for me to do the breakout groups.
And now I feel like I have some friends in this group,
people know everybody so far apart,
but times I've been in groups with Trudy several times
and I feel like I'm getting to know her.
Yeah, same plan.
That's really nice for me.
My online buddies.
It's quite something how this technology allows us to have
these connections and just these brief few minutes
we can feel a connection with people.
It's quite something.
And I so appreciate you doing these.
I'm hoping they can continue, but they must be,
it must be a real effort for you to do this.
I'll say this that Nicky and I were initially thinking like,
okay, we'll do it to the end of May.
And then we're like, okay, now we'll do it to the end of June.
We don't want to give it up.
There's something very sweet about this.
Please do hear that.
It's so sweet and tender and a beautiful thing to be doing.
It's really great.
Thank you.
So we're taking it one month at a time and kind of like
instead of saying we're going to do this forever,
but so that's the current plan now is again,
through the month of June, six days a week,
Saturdays is in the morning.
That's great.
Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you to Lisa and Hannah.
I really appreciated those breaks of time.
And of course, for me,
like I get the alerts on my phones, you know,
happy hour, you know, every day I get it and not here all the
time, but you just get that sense that this will be here all the
time, like every month.
So it's good to hear that it might not possibly be that way.
So take advantage of it because this is very so valuable.
I love this Zoom process.
Great.
Thank you, Trevor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We might not be, we have been doing happy hour.
We were just doing it once a week on Wednesdays when we were in
person and we had been doing that for years.
So, um, yeah, I don't, I don't know what's how this is quite
unfold, but thank you, Trevor.
Okay, it's seven oh one.
So I'm out of respect your time.
And what a delight it is to see you all.
And I wish you a wonderful evening.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll unmute us all.
I was ready.
So it'll be a little bit loud, but it's just a way to say goodbye.
So bye.
And thank you.
Bye.
Thank you.
Bye.
Thank you.
Bye.
It's nice to do that sometimes.
Yes.
Thank you, Diana.
And hi, Trudy.
Hi.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
