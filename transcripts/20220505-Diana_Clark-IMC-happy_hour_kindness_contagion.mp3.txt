The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

Okay, so welcome, welcome.
So earlier today I was listening to somebody talk about what is it like to be on a meditation retreat, and I've done a lot of retreat practice.
And I haven't done, you know, with the COVID, I have not done an in-person retreat where I am not teaching, but I'm just a practitioner for a couple of years.
And I'm so happy that I'm going to be going on retreat.
There's a part of me that's kind of hungry for this to kind of settle down and put the heart and mind just be quiet for a little bit.
But I was listening to somebody describe what it's like, and this person was emphasizing, it was a conversation and one person had never been on a retreat and another person had been on lots of retreats.
And they were, the person had never been was saying, I had no idea that there would be this connection with these other people, even though we never spoke.
It's just being in silence together. Over the days, there's something that happens, we just noticed the way people move, the way they enter the room, the way they stand in line for the meals, or the way they open and close doors or,
I don't know, just their posture, the way they sit up sit and stand. I'm just making this up. I don't know exactly what it is.
But there's a way in which there's a communication and a certain bonding that happens when you're on retreat together.
So this and this for those of you who don't know on these retreats, they're in silence, and often we don't have eye contact either. So just allowing everybody to have their own experience and not have any distractions but some people have eye contact and some don't.
So it's up to the individuals. But it just highlighted the way that we impact each other, even when we don't use words, even when we don't look directly at somebody.
An example that's not on retreat, of course, is if you are in a restaurant and somebody is having a heated discussion, but maybe their voices are low, but you can tell like, okay, just their body language and the way that they are.
I don't know. I don't know exactly how it is. Honestly, maybe it is just body language or maybe there's something more in which we tune into one another.
The neurologist will say that our nervous systems are designed to tune in and intermingle and be sensitive to each other's physiology.
So maybe that's what's happening here.
So, whether we know the mechanism or not.
For me kind of reiterated the impact it can have for us to have this loving kindness practice for us to have meditation practice which enables us to have a little bit more self awareness, and not only self awareness, but also a certain type of aspiration and intention
and some warm heartedness, both for ourselves and for others, but just having that as an orientation, kindness as an orientation allows it to be contagious.
In the same way that whatever mood or whatever mind state we find ourselves in is contagious.
So this idea of kindness contagion, contagious kindness.
I find inspiring.
I have this, you know, crazy wish for the world to be a better place and like what can I do what can all of us do. And maybe this idea without being poliana without repressing without pretending that everything is something that it's not.
We can still meet difficulties with kindness we can still be in physical pain and be as kind as we can. Sometimes people lash out when they're in physical pain, we can be in emotional pain and not take it out on others.
This making a commitment to kindness in a way that's authentic, but also is maybe uplifts not only our own hearts but those around us.
And certainly a loving kindness practice can support this.
Just make it easier more familiar to maybe even a little bit of rewiring our brain chemistry or neurons.
Just makes it more likely that whatever arises, we can respond with some kindness.
So with that as an introduction.
Let's do some meditation practice.
So feeling into this moment.
What is the bodily experience.
The body is restless maybe that body is feeling like you're tired, doesn't have enough energy, whatever it might be.
Okay, with that.
Feeling into the physical sensations, pressure against the body where we're sitting.
Where the hands are touching, where the hands are touching.
Turning into the sensations of breathing.
Feeling the body moves in that rhythmic way.
As if nothing else needed to happen at this moment, as if this moment were good enough.
The way it is.
The way it is.
We just very simply begin again.
And then to begin our loving kindness practice, bringing to mind someone or some being.
And then on the recording, we were talking about cats and dogs. Maybe it's a kitty, maybe it's a doggy.
One that's this uncomplicated relationship with this feels uplifting.
Love, warmth, care, whatever being it might be and bring this being to mind and connecting with them and connecting with the warm heartedness or care.
You have for this being.
And then to support our loving kindness cultivation development, you can say these phrases.
I'll keep it in mind the loveable being.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
Connecting to that sense of goodwill that we have for this loveable being.
And allowing ourselves to feel it and be nourished by it.
If it's there, it might be that maybe it's not there right now, it's perfectly fine.
You have the intention of feeling the goodwill.
You have the intention to expand your loving kindness to include ourselves.
May you be safe.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May I be safe.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
And then to extend our loving kindness practice to somebody we don't know.
It might be somebody on this Zoom call, somebody you see occasionally in the neighborhood.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.

I just want to say thanks to Neil for keeping this going and thanks to you and Nikki for keeping this going for so long.
I'm just feeling my appreciation of the consistency of this group.
I also want to offer about Neil saying thank you and it's quite amazing for years.
I'm amazed I still have something to say sometimes.
I have to teach it a half hour.
Diana, it wouldn't matter if you said exactly the same things you said before.
We all love your voice and it makes us happy.
I'll bring you guys with me while I'm sitting this retreat.
I'll be doing loving kindness and we'll all be doing it together in some kind of weird way.
Maybe I'll be thinking of you guys at 6pm in these evenings and I'll be back in a few weeks.
If you'd like we can unmute and we can all say goodbye.
Will we still see you on Saturday though?
Will we see you still on Saturday on the Poly?
Yes.
I'll be there.
I'll be there.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
