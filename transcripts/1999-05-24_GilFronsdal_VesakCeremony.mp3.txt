 Celebrating the sacred, probably the most sacred day for Buddhists of Southeast Asia, the date of the Buddha's enlightenment, the date of his birth, and the date of his passing away, his dying. And it's a joyous time. It's partly a flower celebration. It's said that when the Buddha was born, the flowers rained down on him from the trees. And that's when the Buddha laid down underneath the two trees to die. The two sala trees, out of season, blossomed. And the flowers kind of sprinkled down all over the people who were there. And so many people have brought flowers, and we're here to kind of celebrate these occurrences. And we have, in front of us here, we have the baby Buddha, who was somewhat precocious. That when he was born, as soon as he was born, he took seven steps. And then he stood there, and he pointed a finger to the sky and a finger to the earth. And remember, Blake, what he said? No. I alone am the world honored one. And the trick is, or the task for each of us is in a non-egocentric way, find out how each of us can say that for ourselves. Heaven above, earth below, I alone am the world honored one. And then there was his passing away, and the Buddha passed away laying down in the reclining position up there. He lay down on his right side and propped up his head with his right arm, and then entered into states of meditation, some of them which brought him a lot of joy in the process of doing those. And in those states of meditation, one of them, the one that had the most equanimity as part of it, he then passed away. So what we'll do is we're going to do some chanting first, and do some of the traditional chants, and we'll lead you in them, and then you can follow. And then when we finish the little ceremony part, then I'll give a talk a little bit. And then when we're finished with a talk, then if you want, those of you who come up, and it's traditional to come and wash the baby Buddha, welcoming him to the world, welcoming yourself. The baby Buddha is each of us, and we symbolically wash ourselves clean inside and out. So I thought we would start with the universal chant of loving kindness. Loving kindness is one of the central virtues of the Buddhist tradition. Loving kindness is feelings of goodwill, wishing people well, wanting people to be well and happy. It's a kind of friendliness. And there's a beautiful chant, a very simple chant that some of you know, and I'll teach the rest of you. It's four words. And it's Sabe, Sata, Suki, Hontu. And Sabe means all, and Sata means being, and Suki means happiness. And Hontu means like, may they be. So may all beings be happy. And as we do it, we'll do it a few times. Blake and I will teach you how to do it. And then we'll do a few, when I have a sense of the hang of it, how it's done, then Blake will start off with a few rounds. We'll pause between each time we say it, and Blake will say which kind of being or persons or people we should dedicate the next round to. And then after Blake is done a few times, then we'll open it to the whole floor, and any of you who are inspired can offer up some category of being or people for us to, you know, send our universal feelings of goodwill and loving kindness to. And the feeling in Buddhism is that the establishment of loving kindness as a field, the field of friendliness is very, very beneficial as a foundation for the work of wisdom and liberation, wisdom release enlightenment. And I think it's very beautiful that there's such a tremendous interrelationship between the joy of loving kindness and the joy of liberation in the tradition. So we'll do one word at a time first, and then after you've learned it, then we'll do the whole line to get together. So are you ready, Blake? So put it together so we do one word and they can repeat. One, two, three. Sa, be. Sa, be. Sata. Sata. Su, ki. Su, ki. Home to. Home to. Then we'll do a line. You repeat the line after us. Sa, be. Sata. Su, ki. Home to. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. Do you think they learned it? So we'll all do it together now. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. Do you think they learned it? Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. Sa, be. May all parents be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all parents be happy. Sa, be.

May all bears be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. Should we open up the rails now? So now it's your turn. And whoever wants to speak up. May all grandmothers be happy. Sa, be. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all women be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all elders be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all mothers know that they're going to die be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all mothers know that they're going to die be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all those waging war be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all those who have no homes be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. Home to. May all those who are ill be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all those who are hungry. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all those who are hungry be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all teenagers be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all those who dislike us be happy. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. May all those in this room be happy. Sa, may. Sa, be. Sa, ta. Su, ki. Home to. So part of a ritual like this in Buddhist countries is often a time for a festival. A kind of festival is a very ceremony, a celebratory kind of event. But whenever people come to a temple or to a monastery, one of the things they'll do for this kind of occurrence is they'll take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and the Sangha. And then they'll renew or receive or take the precepts, the five precepts of Buddhism as a way of re-inspiring themselves to live a life coming from the Buddha. Live a life that expresses our potential for awakening, for compassion, for caring for our fellow human beings and all beings everywhere. And to take refuge in Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha is to take refuge in that capacity that each of us have in living at peace, in living without strife, without anger, without sadness, without greed, without aversion. That capacity is to live with generosity and live with compassion and live with friendliness. And the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are those things which resonate with that capacity each of us have. The Buddha is the person who discovered for himself awakening. The Buddha represents awakening itself, this potential for all of us. The Dharma is the teaching, whatever teaching that you know about, that resonates with these qualities that all of us have within us. And the Sangha is most simply the community of people, of beings, who support us, inspire us in trying to live from our deepest intention, our deepest purity. And the Sangha is those beings, those people who have for themselves really deeply witnessed this potential that resides deep in each of our own hearts. And it's very inspiring to know that there are such people, because not everyone has really witnessed. Many people know kind of as a belief perhaps the potential of an awakened heart. But there aren't that many people who have really witnessed it for themselves. And the Buddhist tradition finds great inspiration that there are such living people around who have witnessed it. So I'll lead you through the basic chants of first paying homage to the Buddha, and then taking refuge in Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. And then we'll do all that in Pali, and then we'll take the precepts in English. And for those of you who might be new here, taking these things doesn't have to mean anything if you don't want it to mean anything for yourself. Taking the precepts, hopefully you take it with some sincerity, and you can take it for however long you're inspired for. Some of us will hopefully try to live this way the rest of our lives. This is kind of a recommitment. And some of you will hopefully try to live this way until you leave the room. And that's the extent of your commitment. So it's for you to decide. So I'll do one word at a time, and you can repeat. Namo Tasa Bhagavatam Harato Sammam Sambuddhasam Namo Tasa Bhagavatam Harato Sammam Sambuddhasam And all together, Namo Tasa Magavatam Harato Sammam Sambuddhasam And then again, word by word, Buddhaam Saranam Gachami Dhammam Saranam Gachami Sangam Gachami And then we repeat with the whole line together, or after me. Dutayampi Buddhaam Saranam Gachami Dutayampi Buddhaam Saranam Gachami Dutayampi Dhammam Saranam Gachami Dutayampi Dhammam Saranam Gachami Dutayampi Sangam Saranam Gachami Dutayampi Saranam Gachami And then all together, Dutayampi Buddhaam Saranam Gachami Dutayampi Dhammam Saranam Gachami Dutayampi Sangam Saranam Gachami And then after me, in English, for the sake of our practice together, for the sake of our practice together, I vow not to take life. For the sake of our practice together, I vow not to take what is not given, for the sake of our practice together, I vow not to lie. For the sake of our practice together, I vow not to misuse my sexuality, for the sake of our practice together, I vow not to misuse intoxicants, for the sake of our practice together, I vow not to lie. For the sake of our practice together, I vow not to take life. So now this water has received the wonderful intentions and efforts of Blake to wash the Buddha. And in washing the Buddha, she's washed into the water, back into the water, the wisdom of the Buddha and the kindness and loving kindness and goodwill of all the people in this room and the deepest intention that's been expressed in all of your taking refuge and taking the precepts. And now I'm going to take this water and bless Blake and then Blake. Now you can take it and you go take some water and then sprinkle it across people in the room here, just in all directions. You stand up and do it and bless everyone with the wisdom water. Put it all the way in. You put it all the way in so it can really get wet. Yeah. And into the middle of the room. And into the side here. Thank you. So thank you, Blake, for all that. And may Blake be happy. Sabesata sugi houtu. So thank you, Blake. And I know I'm going to give a talk now, so I don't know if it's so interesting. So you can stay if you want or you can go if you want. It's up to you. Okay. So this day commemorates the birth of the Buddha, his enlightenment and his passing away. And the first and last event being born and dying is something happens to all human beings. And it's part of the shared humanity that we all have. We all know that we've been born. We all know we're going to die. It's inevitable. And the Buddha shared that with part of his shared humanity. There was no way of getting out of that. In ancient India, I was understood that birth was an event of tremendous suffering. They didn't have the kind of medical care that they have nowadays here in America. So many people died in the process of almost expected. Sometimes people would die in the process of childbirth. So birth was considered to be a somewhat traumatic event for people, all people concerned. And the Buddha's mother, in fact, died seven days after he was born, probably from complications with the birth. And death is considered to be a form of suffering, a difficulty that transitioned from many people. There's a number of passages in the sutras where the Buddha describes himself as an old man. The statues of the Buddha that we see around tend to show him is somehow usually in a relatively young age, maybe the time of his enlightenment. He looks kind of like maybe sometimes he looks like he's 16. But you know, he's in his late 30s, perhaps, and quite in good shape. There's very few, or maybe no statues or images of him as an old man that I know of that I've seen. But in the sutras, there are stories of he talks about himself as being an old man. He talks about himself being kind of crooked and bent over and talks about his face being all wrinkled and talks about tremendous pain of being in an old body where he didn't have the medical care that we have, perhaps, today to alleviate some of that. So the Buddha had a shared humanity with all of us. And I think it's important to recognize that because in kind of in distinction or kind of in contrast to religious traditions, which are theocentric, where the center of gravity is a god, Buddhism would be not theocentric at all, but rather would be human-centric, anthro-centric, perhaps, human-centric, in that the focused center of gravity is human beings who are just like us. The Buddha was like us. What the Buddha attained, he said, anyone could attain with a serious amount of practice. So the Buddha's birth and his Buddha's death are what we share with him. And what perhaps we don't share with him is what's in between these two was the experience of his enlightenment. And he was enlightened. He found his release from all the various forms of strife, of inner conflicts, outer conflicts, of greed, of hate. He discovered the kind of peace and happiness in his heart when he was about 36 years old, 35, 36 years old. And for the next 45 years or so, he wandered around India on foot, teaching, happily teaching, offering his presence, offering his peacefulness, offering his wisdom, his friendliness, his compassion, to countless beings that he encountered. And he taught them, and he helped many people see the possibility of not living in so much strife, not living in so much inner conflict, not live in a way that where compulsion or drivenness, being driven to succeed or driven to defend ourselves or protect ourselves or just live a life of being drivenness, is what he was released from. A Buddha, enlightened person is someone who's no longer driven. And in not being driven anymore, discovers a kind of capacity of compassion and service to the world, which is unparalleled. So his enlightenment was a very important experience. And it's really what he offered us in his life, was the path, the teachings to help us get a taste of that experience of freedom and how to find ways to become freer and freer. It's not easy to stop being driven, but through practice, it's possible to slowly discover how to be deeply, deeply at home with oneself, deeply, deeply at peace with oneself, and how to pick up all the messages we get from society that we're supposed to be very wealthy or make a lot of money or get power. So all these messages we have to be beautiful or intelligent or we internalize or we for whatever reason we have, that represent the kind of inner conflict that makes us unhappy, that makes us driven. Blake, what do you think of some of the messages we get from society about how we have to be and it causes a kind of suffering to be that way? Do you ever get the impression from people that you're supposed to have a lot of things? Not really because I have more than my friends do. So you already have a lot, so you're content? You're happy with that? So there's a lot of messages that get internalized and there's a lot of inner conflict. So the Buddha was one of the great people that we've been celebrating, humankind has been celebrating for 2500 years. There's many people, but there's very few people who recognize over that many millennia as someone who's really special and somehow who's something about their presence, their wisdom, their peace, got enough of people's attention that they sent a huge momentum going that's continued down to today. We wouldn't be here today as a group, this community here wouldn't be meeting here today unless it except for the enlightenment of the Buddha. If the Buddha hadn't been enlightened that full moon night in approximately the month of May, about 2500 years ago, we wouldn't be here together as this group. Some of us would be Sufi dancing, some of us would be doing something else, but we wouldn't be here doing this. So he's passing away. There's not a lot of description of the Buddha's biography in the suttas, in the discourses that survived from that time, partly because the life of the Buddha wasn't considered to be that important by the people who were recording the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha said very clearly at one point, those who see the Dharma, those who see the truth see the Buddha and you shouldn't be chasing after the Buddha as a human being. There was one guy who really loved the Buddha more than anyone else and was always following the Buddha around and wanted to always worship the Buddha and just thought the Buddha was the greatest and just always wanted to be. He didn't feel good, didn't feel happy unless he was next to this great guy. Finally the Buddha had enough of it and then he told them somewhat strongly, said that this is not what it's about. It's not about some kind of personality cult here. If you really want to see the Buddha, you have to see the truth. When you see the truth, you've really seen the Buddha. If you see the Dharma, you've really seen the Buddha. There is one discourse that recounts the last weeks of the Buddha's life called the Parinibhanasutta, the discourse on the Buddha's final release. This is a quite beautiful discourse. There's a lot of teachings and a lot of wonderful stories in this account. One of the ones which is very nice, some traditional teachers like to remind us at this kind of ceremonies. This ceremony is a kind of time when people come, gather together to pay homage and worship and celebrate the Buddha. The teachers will say, and I'll say it now, if you really want to celebrate and pay homage to the Buddha, you don't do this kind of stuff. What you do is you practice. You awaken that capacity in yourself, the Buddha was talking about. That's what the Buddha said in the last weeks before he died. He specifically said that. He said, if you really want to pay homage to me, just practice. Discover for yourself how to live without any conflict. Then you've really paid homage to me. In the beginning of this discourse, a few weeks before he dies, it recounts that the Buddha was really sick. It doesn't say exactly what sickness is at first, but he was wracked with a lot of pain. I think he probably went into some kind of, maybe, I don't know what kind of state he went into, but his attendant Ananda thought to himself, well, the Buddha is not going to die now because he'll come back and give his last instructions to his community before he dies. He won't die without giving some final instruction. The Buddha, in fact, was revived and didn't die that time. Ananda told him that he had this thought that the Buddha wouldn't die without giving final instructions. The Buddha said, I think probably very kindly, but something like, he kind of said, you got it all wrong. I should probably just read the Buddha. The Buddha said, but Ananda, what does the order of monks and nuns expect of me? I have taught the teachings, Ananda, making no inner or outer and making no secret teachings and public teaching, no esoteric teachings and exoteric teachings. I have taught with no teacher's fist in respect to the teachings, meaning that he didn't keep anything hidden from anyone. Everything was open-handed. He didn't have any hidden teachings, any special teachings. He gave just a few people that they would be kind of monopolized, but rather he offered everything freely and openly to everyone. If there's anyone who thinks, I shall take charge of the order after the Buddha dies, or the order should refer to me, let him make some statement about the order. But the Thagata, the Buddha, does not think in such terms. So why should the Thagata make a statement about the community before I die? So he wasn't willing to appoint anyone. He didn't really want anyone to become the leader of the community after he died. He wanted the Dharma, he wanted the teachings and the practices to be the leader of the community. And the reference for the community should be the practice itself. And that's my hope for our community here in Palo Alto, that as we become, as we get more developed and more mature more in our practice as a community, we understand better and better that the reference for our community is our practice, certainly not any person. And then he goes on and says, I am now old, worn out, one who has traversed life's path, I reached the term of life which is 80 years old, just as an old cart is made to go by being held together by straps. So my body is kept going by being strapped up. It is only when I withdraw my attention from the world, from sense experiences, and by the cessation of certain feelings, by kind of shutting some of this through meditation, you sometimes have the ability of shutting down certain abilities to feel and sense and be conscious of certain things in the world. That my body knows comfort. So here is a man, before they had, you know, pain pills, and he talks about, you know, he had a lot of pain. And when he went into deep meditation, he could be free of pain. But when he wasn't in deep meditation, much of the time he'd walk around and do different things and give talks, his body was in pain. Therefore, the Buddha continued, therefore you should live as islands unto yourselves, being your own refuge, with no one else as your refuge, with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge. And how does a monk live as an island unto himself? This is a very beautiful teaching where he says, you really have to do it for yourself. You have to find some ability to be your own refuge. We take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and the Sangha, and it's very helpful to do that. But ultimately, the mayor gets turned back on ourselves and we have to find some ability to be a refuge for ourselves. So again, the Buddha said, no one else is going to take leadership of the order after I die. But you, yourself, have to find some ability to take refuge in the Dhamma yourself. And how does a person live as an island unto himself or herself, with no other refuge? Here, a person abides, mindful of the body, in the body, earnestly, clearly aware, mindful, and having put away all hankerings and fretting for the world. And likewise, in regard to feelings, the mind and mind objects, this is how a person lives as an island unto oneself. So I think that's a beautiful teaching myself. A few weeks before he died, he said, don't rely on someone else. Rely on your own ability to practice. And then he went on and he started walking. And people have kind of traced his path that he took. He crossed the Ganges and he went northward in India. I think that if he'd been able to complete his journey, he would have made it back to his home country where he was born. That's the kind of direction he was heading. But in fact, he didn't reach home. In fact, he was invited to a meal, I think it was about a blacksmith named Kunda. And he went there with his monastic order. And this man offered a wonderful banquet to the monastic order and to the Buddha. But one of the dishes was literally called Pig's Delight. No one knows what it is exactly. But one possibility is that it's some kind of mushroom because that's what takes delight in using mushrooms or maybe with some kind of pig dish. But in any case, the Buddha said, I see no one in the universe, no one in the world, you can eat this dish except for a Buddha and somehow survive. Give it to me and I'll take a portion of it and bury the rest. And so he ate it. And the next day he was wracked in pain and he had bloody dysentery, the discourse says. So you can imagine you again, an old man with great difficulty and bloody dysentery and all that. So this is shared humanity that we have with the Buddha. The Buddha has with us. But he kind of rallied his forces, rallied himself up and he continued on his travels walking a little bit further. And nobody couldn't go much further. So then he said to his attendants, prepare a place for me to lay down between these two trees, the two Sala trees. And he laid down the posture that was up there. That statue up there is actually statue of the Buddha in his mode of passing away. And so they did that. They laid him down. He lay down there too. And he said, you better, Ananda said, this is not a good place to die. This is like this little out of the way kind of jungle place. There's nothing good here. It's actually what he said was actually the translation is so great. There's an Englishman who translated it and. Ananda said, Buddha, may you not pass away in this miserable little town of, I don't even know how to pronounce this in English, but they're English words. Waffle and daub. Waffle and daub. Thank you. What does that mean? You build a house by waffle, weave and stick through another and then drove on the mud. So what's the implication here? Okay. So in this miserable little town of waffle and daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond. But there are great cities that you can go and die in where there are wealthy, wealthy people and householders who are devoted to you and will provide for your funeral in a proper style. You shouldn't die here. And the Buddha says, no, actually, what you don't know is that in ancient, ancient times, this place here was a huge capital and a huge metropolitan area with lots of, and I've come to die in this place. And it's kind of nice because it's not no longer there. It's decayed. The great old cities no longer really disappeared. The teaching of impermanence kind of permeates Buddhism through and through. So he lays down underneath the sala tree and one last person comes to the Buddha for teaching and he gives instruction and the person gets some initial kind of inspiration and is ordained as a monk and then goes off to do his meditation practice. And that night before the Buddha died, it's recorded, he was the last person who became enlightened during the life of the Buddha. He was actually enlightened doing walking meditation. For those of you who want to be inspired in your walking meditation, the last person in the life of the Buddha to be enlightened did so through walking meditation. And then the Buddha, before he died, he called together his community of monastics and he said, does anyone have any questions? Is there anything which is not clear? Anything I've taught you? The teaching is really important. The teachings of the practice are really what's going to sustain you. Is there anybody who's not clear about what that is anymore? Any last questions? Any doubts? Nope. No one asked any questions. So he asked this three times. He really wanted to make sure that no one was shy about asking or afraid or out of reverence or something and no one had any doubts. So the Buddha was quite pleased because he had made a vow early in his life that he would not die until he was confident that there were people alive who would carry on his teaching, who understood what he had to teach and understood about awakening and freedom. And he was no longer needed because other people could carry it on. So he had that reassurance and he said, it is wonderful, it is marvelous. I clearly perceive that in this assembly there is not one monastic who has doubts or uncertainty. And the Buddha said, you Ananda speak from faith. You don't really know. But I know, I actually know this assembly. In this assembly there's not one monastic who has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha, the Dharma or the Sangha or about the path or the practice. Ananda, the least one of these 500 monastics is a stream winner, first to attain the first stage of awakening and incapable of falling back into states of woe. They are certain of attaining full nibbana, full release. Then the Buddha said to his community, and these are the last words of the Buddha before he passed away. Now monks, I declare to you, all conditioned things are of the nature of decay. Aniccho, vata, sankara, strive on untiringly. And then he closed his eyes and he entered into the first jhana, the first states of concentration. And he proceeded through, step by step through all the stages. The first ones are filled with lots of rapture and happiness, followed by equanimity. And it was like he was doing one last run through. He went all the way up to the top, the highest state of concentration is possible meditation. And then actually Ananda said, oh, it looks like he's died. Because when you're in the highest state of meditation, it's kind of like there's not much signs of life. Because Ananda wasn't so well practiced himself, so he couldn't really read what was going on. But another monk, Anurhoda, who was fully enlightened, he could kind of follow the Buddha along in his progress through the meditation states. He said, no, no, no. The Buddha hasn't died yet. He just reached the highest state of concentration. And then to now, and now the Buddha is going backwards from the top, all the way to eight, seven, six, you know, down to the first one. And then you went back up again to the fourth state. And the fourth state is the place of tremendous equanimity. And kind of with full, it's a place where all our faculties of consciousness are still alert and present. But there's a phenomenal level of equanimity there. And in that state of equanimity and peace, he passed away. There's a noun in Buddhism, so you get nirvana-ized. But to be a final nirvana, your final nirvana-ization, it can be translated as the final release. So he didn't pass away, he attained the state of final release from all suffering and all clinging and all holding. And I think it's a beautiful image of a person who for was devoted to a life of devoted out of his compassion and concern for the world, entered into the monastic life, lived as a renunciant. Most of that time, not as an ascetic, which was one of the paths of India at that time, but he very carefully chose what he called the middle way. Wouldn't seem that way to us. But he lived such a way that it was a very, very simple lifestyle, as simple as he thought he could live, without, while still getting enough food to eat, having enough clothes to wear to ward off the cold, and to be able to get whatever medicine that India offered at that time to take care of his health. So he lived a life that was basically comfortable, but with nothing extra needed, life of great simplicity, we call it the renunciant. And he lived that way for some 50 years, almost 50 years. And it's said in a few places and discourses that every evening, after his evening meditations, the Buddha would wander around his community of monastics and visit anyone who was sick. So it's a beautiful image of someone who's spent his life teaching and caring for people out of the inspiration of his own enlightenment. And to spend a lifetime, you know, half a lifetime with this kind of beautiful activity, living at peace and offering himself for the wellbeing of all beings. And then to peacefully pass away, to be a model of someone who suffered physically quite a bit in his old age, but had the capacity to die at peace without regrets, without conflict, and without any fear at all, and die with a drive to manness equanimity. So that's the person we celebrate today, the life of the Buddha, the enlightenment of the Buddha. And even though the Buddha said that the best way to pay homage to me is by practicing, we still kind of bring flowers and chant and do these things anyway. And hopefully it's for all our benefits. And I myself am tremendously inspired by the life of the Buddha, by this example of the Buddha, the teachings of the Buddha. I'm not always so sure where myth and reality depart from each other, or where this distinction is in the life of the Buddha. When you have a founder of a religion, there tends to be certain mythology that builds up. But even if it's a myth, for me, the myth of the Buddha points to the capacity that each of us have to take whatever deepest experience of peace and wellbeing and happiness that any of us have ever tasted in our life, and integrate it throughout all our being, and all our days, and all our life. And the path of practice has a lot to do with finding slowly, step by step, integrating that capacity into all ourselves, and all our nerves, and all our speech, and all our interactions. And the Buddha, whether it's a myth or not, represents the total complete possibility of full integration of that in all our lives. And I'm inspired by that. So, Blake knows where we find the Buddha. Where do we find the Buddha, Blake? Remember when we look at the Buddha statue and I say, where's really the Buddha? Not in the statue, but where is it? So the Buddha is where? Say it loudly? So when you come up here, if those of you want to come up here and wash the Buddha, you're washing your own heart. So thank you all very much for this evening, and may all beings be happy.
