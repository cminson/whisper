The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Hello everyone and welcome. Happy to be here with you and happy to read these
chats. Those of you who can read them, they're lots of good mornings and lots of warmth in those
chat comments. And this is the theme of today is in fact to be happy or maybe to be a little
different word, to be inspired. Inspired is a form of happiness, of delight, of joy, of gladness.
And it's inspiring to sit here with you and to have the opportunity to appreciate meditation,
the teachings, community that's so widespread. So thank you. And maybe to be a little provocative
for this meditation. And I hope you allow yourself to be, I don't know, provoked is the right word
or evoked. And that is to allow yourself to be inspired. And maybe the provocative question is
why not be inspired? Why hold back? Why not recognize, in spite of the challenges,
in spite of the difficulties and the sufferings of yourself and your circumstance, your world,
of our world, why not be inspired? There is a tremendous amount of good in this world.
There's a tremendous amount of people, in spite of also being the other, who live lives of
generosity, who support and help and do so much for others. Many of them are unrecognized,
unthank even all the parents do so much for their children. To be inspired by the people who are
ethical, who are honest, who avoid sometimes almost all costs to be causing harm to others,
and to themselves. To be inspired that this is possible, even if only a very few people in
the world do it. Wow. It's possible. The possibility is inspiring. But there's a lot of people who do
it. To be inspired by your ability, to be inspired by the almost divine circumstance of being able
to sit and meditate, regardless of how difficult again so much of your life is, to have the circumstance
to sit quietly, to sit still in a place that has a modicum of safety, a modicum of comfort,
a modicum of demands perhaps on you. Isn't there something about this that's divine that's
heavenly, just so different in ordinary life? And to be inspired to not be chasing after
desires of all kinds. Some people get up in the morning and it's just kind of going out. One
way of analyzing a life is going after one desire for another incessantly. So much of human
pursuit is the pursuit of comfort and pleasure, much more than people realize. So here to be
inspired for these few minutes, to be here inspired, glad, happy, why not? Why not be inspired in such
a way that you want to partake of this potential, this heavenly capacity, heaven-like, to really
appreciate it, to really take it in, to be nourished, supported in such a way that the heart can feel
safe and contented and happy. Your mind, the thinking mind is happy to be turned inward on
this experience here, to become quiet and still. So that whatever the thinking mind is, it can
become quiet enough that it really partakes of the goodness that's here in you, with you, here. Why
not be inspired? Why not be glad for what is possible right now? To be glad for, to be happy
for, to be happy with. So to gently close the eyes and to feel here in your body, what is
happening for you now after hearing these words? Was anything touched? Was anything repelled?
Is there some, is there anything within that now you can take some time to be glad about, to be
inspired? I like to think that the word inspired is related to the Latin word for breathing.
What is it that you can be filled with gladness, filled with the light, happiness in being filled
with your breathing? And this idea of filling ourselves with every breath, with presence,
with embodied awareness, and a gentle, quieting inspiration to do so. Where the path of practice
is not linear, going down the path in a linear way to better and better, but the path is more
like filling out, filling ourselves more and more with every breath, filling out with
awareness, embodied attention here, now. With happiness riding along, inspiration riding
along every breath, every movement of awareness, of attention here and now, filled, filling
with peaceful inspiration.

Why not be happy, inspired?
Why prioritize thoughts that are unhappy, that are nothing to do with here and now?
Why prioritize feelings that might be about other things?
Why not be happy with what is good right now, inspired by the simplicity of being here,
living?
