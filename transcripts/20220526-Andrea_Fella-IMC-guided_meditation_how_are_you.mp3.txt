 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Not checking in in terms of thinking about how you are, but how is your experience in this moment? Letting yourself land with yourself in this place, in this time. Connecting with your body. Connecting with yourself. And seeing if there can be an allowing of how you are. Accepting, receiving how you are as you are. The receiving, the exploration of receiving experience can support that quality of allowing. Just taking in what is here already with curiosity. The sense of befriending yourself as you are. If a friend were to ask you how you are and really mean it, they would be interested to hear just exactly what's happening for you. And this quality or capacity we have to be aware of our experience in the present moment can be like a friend, really opening honestly with a friendly, receptive curiosity. How are you? Maybe there's tiredness at the end of the day. Can that be there without resistance? Maybe there's energy, maybe there's the mind kind of a little bit active at the end of the day. Can we meet that? Can we just be with ourselves? Really be with ourselves as we are. The teaching that's been resonating with me for the last week or so has been an offering from the suttas, the way the Buddha met his own experience, whether difficult or pleasant. He said he crossed the flood of experience by neither tearing or hurrying. Just meeting this moment, really connecting, not hurrying past it, really being with how you are, but then not being stuck there either. The next moment, the next experience will arise. And so not tearing with anything and not hurrying, not hurrying either to try to get past something that's here or to try to get to something in the future, not tearing with something that's pleasant because we want to linger with it or tarry with something unpleasant because we want to fix it or change it. Just meeting each experience, a light touch, receiving how you are in this moment, in this moment, in this moment. Thoughts will, of course, come in and kind of pull us out of the present moment. And yet mindfulness will return. That moment of mindfulness returning is a great opportunity to cultivate this allowing attitude. The mind has been wandering, can't change that, but what's here now? Allowing that you have returned into experience. And what has the mindfulness connected with as it returns? Might be connected to something that was shaped by the thoughts that were happening. That's okay. That's what's here now. Can you meet again with a kind of a sense of a friend? Oh, I see you were wandering off. What happened? Where are you? How are you now, now that you've rejoined us together? Thank you. For some of you, it may be supportive to connect to some aspect of your experience, to support the mind to settle, to remember. Perhaps the breath, perhaps a broader sense of body sensation. And still, even in that exploration of narrowing the field a little bit, you can be the receiving of that. How is this breath? How is the body right now? That exploration of allowing the breath to be as it is, the body to be as it is. Neither tearing or hurrying with experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
