The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Here we go. Okay, great. So, so dear ones, welcome, welcome. So for tonight's
practice, I'd like to invite us to engage with with self-compassion, both the soft
gentle nurturing type of self of style of self-compassion, as well as as what
actually feels like fierce self-compassion. There's a sense of strength,
uprightness, and and it's very loving and it's also powerful at the same time. So
for us to engage in both of those ways. So, so, especially, I think, especially as
as we are in the holidays in in the US, it can be both a joyous time for many
and it can be a stressful time for many. In fact, a very stressful time for many,
for a variety of reasons. And of course, not not assume that everybody else's
experiences like us, so who are getting together with family and and it's great
to for us perhaps to to acknowledge and and perhaps consider that for some
people, maybe if they've experienced loss, this might be a difficult time,
especially this stressful time. So, and and of course, the two can coexist
together, joy and sorrow can exist together. So one does not negate the
other, we can hold joy and delight and happiness and gratitude. And we can also
our heart can also hold challenge, difficulty, perhaps sadness, melancholy
at the same time. It's our heart is so expansive that that they can both be
present and it's okay. In fact, the state of equanimity, state of equanimity,
equipoise, allow us to be with everything that arises as a part of this human
condition. So so self compassion can be a healing a healing wand, both for us. And
as we have it for ourselves, it can support others. So and the very first
step towards self compassion is acknowledging actually realizing that
we're hurting. That seems kind of simple and straightforward. But actually, that
first step of realizing and knowing that we're hurting, we often miss. We often
kick ourselves in the shins. Okay, get going. Why are you being XYZ calling
ourselves name and not names and not realizing that actually, oh, maybe, oh,
this being who is me is having a hard time right now. Oh, I'm having a hard
time. This is difficult. This is difficult. Anyone else was in my shoes
right now, with this background with his genes with this upbringing with the set
of experiences, life experiences, etc. They would be having the same, the same
challenge, same difficulty. So so it could just be as simple as oh, this is
hard right now. This is hard right now. And that recognition, that simple
recognition can help transform us from kicking ourselves and adding more
insult to injury versus cutting ourselves a little bit of slack, bringing
more kindness, bringing more compassion, finding our balance through
gentleness and kindness, and then maybe some fierceness, some ability, some
compassionate power and accountability for ourselves that we couldn't have
before because it hurts too much, can then show up but then together with
kindness, together with kindness, compassionate accountability can come
in as a sense of fierce compassion. So I'll try to invite us to to play with
these concepts if it just seems like too heady right now. What is she talking
about? Don't worry about it. I'm just introducing some ideas and I'll guide
us. I'll guide us in the guided meditation for us to explore and for
each person the exploration might lead you in different places and
that's perfectly okay. Trust, trust your own wisdom, trust what is
appropriate for you right now, okay? So with that let's transition into our
sitting practice. So inviting you to arrive in your body. As always we're
going to start with settling in the body, arriving, settling with the breath, with
the sensations of the body.
Ah, taking refuge. Ah, in this moment, the simplicity of this moment of just
sitting and being breathed.
Letting go of the busyness that might have come before. Just resting, resting
with the breath. So sweet, so nourishing to just be here, just here. That's it.
Nowhere to go, nothing to do in this moment. And if thoughts arise I want to
take you away. Nothing wrong with thinking per se but right now tell them
not now, thank you, come back later. With ease, with a smile, tell them you're
giving your heart to this practice right now. You want to stay, you want to
stay. Later. And let's stay with the breath releasing into the body. One
breath at a time.
you
here, just here. Letting go of thought balloons.
Ah, feeling lighter as you let go. Feeling lighter as you let go.
Well, feeling lighter, your heart lighter and feeling more grounded.
Grounded, heavy, connected to the earth, to this body, holding dichotomies.
you
here, just here. Settling, arriving.
you
here, connecting, connecting with the entirety of the inbreath, with kindness
receiving the entire inbreath, in the abdomen, receiving the entire outbreath,
allowing them to ground you, support you in stillness, and with each outbreath
letting go, your neck and shoulders, the stress, the holding tightness, eyes in
their socket, let them rest, hands, let them relax your feet, give their weight
off to the earth.
you
just this inbreath, as if it were your first breath, as if you're first and
last inbreath, same with the outbreath.
you
you
you
loving the entire in-breath, the entire out-breath as a gift.
you
you
you
if there are distracting thoughts, or plans, memories, it's okay, be kind to yourself.
they arise, part of being human, part of the monkey mind. it's okay, be kind, be gentle.
bow to them, smile. thank you, not now. release them with ease. let them go.
connecting with the breath, with the body, here, I'm here, I am here, in this moment.
writing yourself, be breathed, gently, gently.
Continue to be breathed, connecting with the breath, in breath, out breath.
Continue to be breathed, connecting with the breath, out breath.
Continue to be breathed, connecting with the breath.
And now if you wish, as you continue to feel embodied, feeling the breath, in the body, sensations of the breath, sensations of your sit bones, the cushion on the chair, your hands on your lap, your feet on the earth.
Continue to be breathed.
Invite, sense a feeling of yourself as being who's you, as if it beloved other.
A dear friend, someone you care about dearly. You want this person, you want this being to be safe and happy.
Just as you would want that for a dear friend, or a child, or a pet.
If it might be helpful, you can even take the perspective of a fully compassionate being.
Say the Buddha or Kwan Yen as the ultimate example, paragon of compassion, just accepting you completely, seeing you with kind eyes.
Holding you with care, but you're fully deserving of love, compassion, goodness, just as you are, just as you are.
You don't have to earn it, to deserve it, just as you are.
Just because you are a human, and being human is hard enough, hard enough, hard enough, you're held.
Either put up by Kwan Yen, or any other compassionate being, that you like to conjure up,
just being knows your ups and downs, all the challenges of your life. Understands, accepts, you just as you are.
Your body can feel safe, relax, feel seen and held.
Thank you for watching.
If instead of an archetype, archetypal figure, someone from your life connects better for you,
who's held you with love and care, feel free to conjure them up and their sense of acceptance. See what works for you.
Or it could even be a pet that's offered you complete sense of acceptance and love.
Thank you.
At your body, feel at ease.
Receiving this sense of acceptance is unconditional compassion.
At your heart, put its weight down.
And now if you would, if you would like, in the space of being held, bring to mind, bring to your heart,
maybe something that has been hard for you recently, not the most difficult thing, but something that's been a little difficult.
Just a little bit. Maybe a pain in the body, something challenging that happened, let yourself acknowledge.
Yeah, this is hard. This was hard. This is hard.
Just as this loving presence would know, this loving, compassionate being, who knows you, yeah, this was challenging for you.
This is challenging. And it's okay. They see that. Let yourself acknowledge.
Without falling into grief or sadness, but just acknowledging, yeah, this is hard.
And it's okay. I can hold it. I can hold it with care.
Not self-criticism, but yeah, this is hard.
Ah, let your body soften. Let your heart soften.
Thank you.
Let this acknowledgement of the challenge be held with kindness.
Anyone in my situation would have felt the same, would have felt challenged.
May I have ease. I wish myself ease and freedom from this challenge. May I hold myself with kindness.
And acceptance. May I offer myself safety and generosity of spirit.
With respect to this challenge, especially.
Just as this compassionate being holds you with care, compassion, holding yourself with care, compassion.
And maybe as you hold yourself with recognition of the difficulty and with compassion, a brightness, a brightness awakens, a brightness, a power of compassion.
That compassion together with its soothing nature also empowers you from within your heart.
It's both soothed. And feeling soothed feels more ready to take on.
To be with what's difficult, what's challenging for you.
So compassion.
Maybe it feels you can feel that it's both soothing, calming, nurturing and empowering at the same time.
If the empowering aspect of it isn't clear, lean into the soothing, calming, nourishing, healing.
And when enough healing has happened, the heart will feel more whole and more empowered in its own healing.
See and explore for yourself.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And as we begin this, begin to bring this seated practice
to an end together.
Offering kindness to yourself for whatever arose and did not arise and letting your sense of goodness and kindness, however much you were in touch with it, let it shine.
Let it shine internally and externally.
For the benefit of yourself and others equally.
It's a gift to ourselves or practice. It's a gift to others.
Same, same.
And may our practice be a support for our awakening and the awakening of all beings everywhere. May all beings be free. May all beings be happy.
Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice.
Well, I certainly feel happier and happier and calmer.
Yeah, practice is sweet. It's so sweet.
Lovely to share it with you in community in Sangha.
So we have time for reflections, questions, comments, and I invite you, if you wish, for the benefit of both yourself to share and be witnessed and for the benefit of others.
What came up? What did you discover?
Stephanie.
It's funny. I had a meeting with a meditation teacher I work with today, and she was talking to me about self compassion.
So we showed up on this call was funny that that's what we're talking about. So I really got a lot of other practice as I always do your practices, Nikki, and really appreciate it.
It will definitely have to listen to this one again.
Thanks, Stephanie. Thanks for sharing the serendipity synchrony that has happened for you. And I'm delighted that these offerings are supportive to you.
Yay.
Thank you.
Thank you for being part of the Sangha, Stephanie.
Dan.
Hi, thank you.
I don't quite know my difficulty. Maybe you might have some comments or insight.
I have no trouble whatsoever being compassionate to the first seven, you know, fifth, seventh, eighth level of compassion for you.
But I can never make it past two for myself.
It seems self centered. It seems selfish. Give me some perspective, your place.
Thank you, Dan. This is such an important question.
And it's, it's important to bring this up as you as you well articulated it.
I would say it is very common. It is so common for many, many people to have this sense that it's easier to give compassion for others.
And for ourselves, it's a little more challenging. It feels, and you named a couple of things that come up.
A couple of blocks that you mentioned feels self centered, you said, selfish.
Remember what else you said? There's, there are many of them. There are many blocks to compassion.
One is, oh, if you become compassionate, then, or especially self compassionate, then you will not get anything done because you're just, you'll lie on the couch and eat bonbons all day.
So it's, I mean, there are lots of fears of compassion, lots of fears of compassion.
And the one that you named is one of them that it feels like, oh, it's not appropriate somehow that, yeah, I'm being selfish and there's so much need in the world.
Here I am trying to be kind to myself.
And so, so, and there might be more there. And I'm going to ask you to unmute if there's more there if you want to share so that we get to the crux of it.
What is that it basically? That's, that's sort of it. I come, I've spent most, I've done both Buddhist meditation and sort of non denominational meditation on and off for a number of years.
I come from a classic Christian background with lots, lots of optional theology and this that and the other thing.
I'm old enough to, to, you know, go back to the Latin mass and stuff like that. So I've got a lot of time on the meter, so to speak.
And it, despite your time words, I'm going to have to reflect on this and oh, we're not finished yet. We're not finished.
I wanted to ask you that we're not finished. I just wanted to give you a chance to reflect some more. So before I, I was just hype. I was just formulating the problem before getting into it.
So, so, so let me take it if I may. So, and thank you. Thank you for more, more background.
So, so here's a couple of things to consider then. One is that this, this challenge could be a sense of perspective. So consider the perspective. What are the thoughts that are creating the block on and actually catalog them.
I invite that you journal, you write down, okay, maybe there's a sense I'm not deserving maybe sense that it's a waste of my time. Other people are needed more or I need to earn it and or whatever the perspective is.
Just, you know, there could be a diamond doesn't whatever person and then try to catalog them. It's like, okay, well, is that really true?
Really? Is that really, really true? And, and, and with kindness, like, okay, I don't deserve that. You know, the thought might come, I don't deserve it. I don't know if that's the case right now, but I'm just giving an example.
Say, well, actually, is that really true? And then reflect on that. And given that you have a rich background with different theologies. Well, every human being and, and maybe I'll use the Christian language for a moment.
God loves everyone. I'm as deserving as everybody else. Why wouldn't I be deserving of love and my own compassion. So, so examine all these unseen, unseen assumptions that there might be that when you're in meditation, they just come up and the mind believes them and it just blocks it.
That's it. So take time with kindness to examine all these hidden perspectives. And, and also what one holds on one to add is that there's that that if, you know, if we really fill our own cup with our own compassion with our own kindness, first, if we do that first,
then, then we don't go around basically to the whole world saying love me, love me, love me, love me, take care of me. It because we might be doing that subconsciously. But if we there's sense of acceptance and love for this being who is me as as if it's a third person,
then there's a sense of contentment as a base for compassion for others actually. And as you mentioned, you know, you can have level seven or eight for me and two for yourself right now. And that will become Oh, 10 for yourself and 10 for me, it will just open up that other extra, you know, that the blocks that there
are so so offering that for your reflection dad. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for being here. Beautiful. Serena I see your hand up and we'll let this be the last reflection before we transition to the groups.
Thank you so much for this opportunity and much appreciated. Yes, so I have a really difficult time. Well, one of the things that happened to me during meditation was that I was at a meeting before I came on.
And I stood up very strongly to somebody to someone of a certain point of view.
And I could really see I could really feel at one hand I was feeling a lot of strength within myself which I haven't been feeling at all.
As a matter of fact, I've been quite depressed for a few months and and I'm just kind of wondering how to be with with that kind of strength and you know standing up kind of energy and having compassion for it.
Yeah, I get it. Yeah, I get I did get the gist of the question. Thanks Serena. And for the for given that the time is short, I like to respond in this way so so how to balance that so so actually fierce compassion is loving.
So you can have you can as you said stand up to someone but not from hatred and not from well I'm going to show you but if actually loving them and loving yourself and out of love for the community out of love for the cause out of love for what it is you're doing instead of
instead of resentment or anger so that's how you bring these two together. And it's it might sound like a tall order but it isn't. It's it's it's something that I do trust every single one of us can do if we practice if we and that's why we come but that's why we practice so that this practice becomes the natural
tendency. So that's what I like to offer for your reflection Serena. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Okay, let's transition now it's 10 minutes till the hour. Let's transition to small groups and the small the the prompt for so the groups will be size of roughly three, and each person is invited to just share something from their experience or say pass and hold compassionate space for others.
And the prompt is simply how does how does self compassion when you experience self compassion. Do you notice that there's there is some gentleness some kindness some ease with suffering do you notice how self compassion actually can hold the suffering and can you see how it actually brings more
resilience, how self compassion can bring more resilience. So that exploration and your answer might be no I haven't really thought about this connection at all it's like oh you know actually see that when I was kind to myself oh there was some resources or strength that I hadn't realized
so that's the explanation exploration. Each person will say maybe one minute and then the next person will say them. Another minute and the next person another minute and you go around and run and make sure everybody gets a chance to speak so so hold back from the full story just just give a little bit and and
be kind to take care of yourselves take care of each other. Yeah, so I'm going to create the rooms now. And here we go.
And dedicate the merit of our practice together I hope and trust that the small groups were nourishing and you're welcome to share any reflections or shares in chat if you like.
I thank you all for your practice both for your own sake and the sake of everyone whose lives your touches may all being be beings be well may all beings be free and happy including ourselves.
Thanks everyone. Bye.
