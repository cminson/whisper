The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good evening everyone and welcome to IMC, those of you who are here and those of you who are online, welcome.
And I hope it was nice for you to sit for the 45 minutes in quiet.
That's how we used to do it here on Monday nights for years, for over 30 years.
But then with the pandemic, when you started doing online, you started doing the guided meditations.
And when I sat down to meditate, I thought it was so nice and quiet in here.
They wanted to disturb it with words.
So I don't feel like I have a lot to say today, but what I have to say I think is important.
So we'll see where it goes. Maybe we'll have some discussion.
And that is, I'll start with, there's a very famous story, or in a story exactly, but a teaching from a time monk meditation teacher named Ajahn Chah,
a teacher of many people here in the West.
And he said something like, if you let go a little, you'll have a little piece.
If you let go a middling, you'll have a middling piece. And if you let go a lot, you'll have a lot of peace.
And so the emphasis is on letting go. And many people do associate Buddhism and Buddhist practice with letting go.
And then there's a lot of wonderful words, associated words, like there's relinquishment.
Some people talk, sometimes talk about renunciation. And what's interesting, if you look at the teachings of the Buddha about relinquishment or letting go,
it's generally not about relinquishing anything, but rather it's relinquishing the grip, the holding.
So it's re-releasing the clinging. We're not necessarily releasing or letting go of the things of our life.
Now, some of us might be doing things which are unhealthy, and it's good to let go of things which are unhealthy, unethical and wise.
But for the Buddha, I think he was just assuming people were doing this practice or living an ethical life.
And so the focus was just letting go of the clinging, the grasping.
And what I'm about to say next is one of the reasons I wanted to emphasize, it's possible to hold on to something tight.
Hold on to it. So if you hold on tight, it might be useful in the wind to hold on to your umbrella tight.
But if you do it all the time, even when it's not windy, and you have it really attached to that umbrella,
eventually your hands might get knotted up or start cramping up.
You know, you can't do a lot of other things with your hand.
So it's nice to not be attached to umbrellas and put them down when it's not raining and leave them at home.
And so we learned to let go or release without holding on so much anymore.
But in English we can say that once you're not holding on anymore,
it doesn't mean that you've dropped something, no longer have it.
It can mean you still can hold it without holding on.
You can have your open hand open, and you can hold something freely and openly in the hand.
And that's a world of difference.
You don't have to let go of something, give it up.
But can you hold it lightly, loosely, not, just holding it, bearing it this way with an open hand.
So if you were holding on to a little bird, you would probably fly away.
That's what birds do.
But if I'm holding on to the striker, you know, it's not going to fly away.
But maybe one of you has a really good use for this and asks me for it.
It's really easy then. It's almost like this is holding it this way.
It's almost like an offering. Here, take it.
Holding it like this, it's almost like a fist.
That makes a very different impression.
So what I'm proposing is that we can learn to let go of the grip
and then hold the things in our life, the people in our life,
loosely, lightly, without any restrictions on anything, without holding tight to anything.
And then things will take their course.
Things will unfold. If it's a bird, it'll fly away.
If someone wants a striker, maybe you're ready to give it.
If something needs to be comforted, well, it's nice and warm and soft in the palm of the hand.
So you're there.
But we're not limiting anything.
We're not saying you can't go away.
And we're not saying you have to stay here.
But you're welcome to stay here. I'm available here.
So what ways do we hold on rather than simply hold?
One of the ways we hold on is we identify with it.
This is mine.
This is mine, so it's my striker, so you can't have it.
It's my whatever, so I have to protect it.
Maybe it's appropriate sometimes to protect your umbrella.
It's raining on you, but not on someone else.
It's a very narrow little rainstorm.
But I was in Hawaii. That's very local rainstorms.
But what about living a life that somehow holds everything lightly, holds everything without restriction,
holds everything without keeping it trapped in the fist of our clinging, our grasping, our holding on.
Is it appropriate?
What happens if we go around with an open hand always?
Pick things up. We hold it in an open hand.
We're offered something. We hold it with an open hand.
Someone once said we offer it many years ago.
I was spending time with a monk named Ajahn Amaro,
an Englishman who was an abbot of a Theravada monastery here in Northern California.
This must have been the very early 2000s.
I don't know exactly when it was, but he had a cell phone
that was maybe a smartphone before there were smartphones.
Before we had that name, he did all this stuff.
I think he could do email or something, but he did all this stuff.
He was amazing what he could do.
And it cost something like a thousand dollars.
And so I said to him, what are you a monk doing with this big, expensive, fancy phone?
Aren't you supposed to be a renunciant?
And he said, oh, someone gave it to me.
And I figured it was okay to have it.
If anybody asked me for it, I would give it to them.
So I thought about it.
Not so much that I wanted the phone, but I wanted to test him.
I wanted to find out if this is for real.
But I didn't.
But he was holding it, I think he was probably genuine.
He was holding it this way.
He was holding it loosely.
And what about someone you're in conflict with?
What if someone's angry with you, you're angry with them?
So then the gesture might be, like this, stay away, go.
But what about if that, if you go like that, also with a person who you're angry with?
Don't push them away, but like here.
What does that mean to hold someone who's angry with you,
or you're in conflict with this way?
If you hold them this way, hold on to something, then it's not very friendly.
But with an open hand.
The gesture of fearlessness in Buddhism,
that people have nothing to fear from you, is to hold your hands up like this flat,
with no weapon, just flat and open.
So it's the idea of the open hand, open mind, open heart.
So it doesn't mean that we have to give everything up.
Unless maybe they ask you for it.
Maybe. Who knows what you'll want to do.
But it doesn't mean you have to give things up.
But in the Dharma, what we're learning to do is something different.
We're learning to not hold on.
Hold, but don't hold on.
If it's appropriate to hold, hold it, but don't hold on.
Because holding on prevents the natural flow of things to happen.
Things come, things go.
The Zen master in San Francisco started the San Francisco Zen Center.
It's Shinryo Suzuki Roshi.
He said renunciation is allowing things to go when it's their time.
When things go, when things have time to go, then we let go.
So it's like he was quite happy to hold.
But when it was time to go, then the renunciation was letting it go.
I think parents have to learn that at some age.
Sometimes the kids are ready to leave before the parents are ready for them to leave.
In all kinds of stages.
Okay, you have to go. You have to go.
I remember when my son was, I don't know, he was maybe five.
And he came out of the bathroom.
He dressed like a 1970s disco king.
I couldn't believe what I saw.
Where did he find those clothes?
And where did he figure out how to slick his hair?
It was like he had some kind of gold necklace.
I don't know.
In our house, what did he find?
And I looked at him and I thought, okay.
I mean, this was like represented something which I don't stand for.
It just was so different than anything that I could, you know, appreciate really, whatever it was.
And I looked at him and said, well, this is what he's done.
Who am I to say that he shouldn't do that?
Just because I don't have a good association with that.
It's not my place to tell him that he can't dress up this way and to figure it out.
So I have to keep my hand open and he's going.
Who knows what direction he's going to go in his life.
But, you know, he gave in at five.
He's making choices and, you know, it's not my place to shape him in every possible way.
Parents have a role, of course, but, you know, it was a moment of like, oh, okay.
I have to let him go in certain ways.
So this freedom of the open hand.
But is that a freedom that you're comfortable with?
Do you feel safe or do you feel like you lose too much?
Or do you feel safer and more comfortable holding on, gripping?
No, not that.
It's fine for guilt to say that, but he doesn't understand.
He doesn't understand what life is about.
The challenge is, I have to keep my things so I'm safe.
And it goes on in all the justification.
But is it really?
What are we trusting? What are we not trusting?
We're not being asked to let go of anything.
We're asked just to hold it with an open heart, open mind, open hand.
And care for it. I love this gesture.
I think when you put two hands together like this and hold things,
then it's really supportive.
I love this as a metaphor for mindfulness.
And we take our attention and come from underneath our sadness, our anger, our fear,
and just hold it like this.
But again, it's open.
So it can go if it wants. I'm not holding on to it, not resisting it.
So just hold everything.
And maybe if it's time for it to go, maybe it's okay.
Maybe it's okay because the biggest gift we have, the biggest treasure we have,
is the open hand.
Is the open heart.
Is that freedom?
To lose that by clenching from a Buddhist point of view is impoverishment.
Even if I think that it's so important to keep the striker,
the fact that I'm gripping it is a kind of poverty.
If I hold it like this, it's a kind of a wealth.
If I hold it like that and it goes away, I still have the wealth.
The freedom.
So holding but not holding on.
I think it's a very respectful way to live a life.
It's kind of like the middle way.
The middle way between clinging and throwing things away.
Clinging and letting go of things.
The middle way between accumulating and getting rid of things.
Just hold it like this.
Things come and go.
People come and go.
Things come and go.
All kinds of things come and go in that openness.
And maybe it's a phenomenal form of respect,
reverence, care, generosity to hold other people in that open hand.
To hold on to other people maybe is not respecting them.
To discard people is disrespectful.
But that middle way.
Hold but don't hold on.
Hold but don't discard.
So that's the thing that I wanted to say today.
What do you think of that?
Do you have any comments about that? Testimonials? Protests? Questions?
Hi, it's Nancy.
I have some possessions that are very dear and nostalgic for me.
And I realized that when I pass away,
my nieces and nephews have no interest in them whatsoever.
Even though they're family heirlooms.
I've been thinking about it lately.
What do I do about these treasured things that are so dear to me?
And how do I let those go when they're really going nowhere?
I don't have an answer to that.
But what occurs to me is that in that open hand,
you might figure out how to let go, how to give it, how to do something.
But they represent something for you.
And so what they represent is different than what the object is.
And maybe there's something some way with the open hand
to preserve, protect, stay close to what they represent in your heart
that will actually better allow these memories or whatever it is
to live in you than the object.
And maybe it's easier than to figure out a good home for the objects.
And so maybe doing a ritual that maybe transfers
the memories or the associations from the objects to your heart.
What did that sound like?
Sounds good.
How do we adapt this way of thinking for day to day life?
I think the idea is great, but I think just living life,
it's kind of hard to understand when you are grasping to the object
or idea, thought, whatever, etc. versus just keeping it open as you've mentioned.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I guess it occurs an example happened recently to me
that in the last months where I went to a restaurant.
And there was something strange about how the credit card payment worked.
And I didn't get any receipt.
So I wondered about that.
What's that about?
Am I in trouble?
Am I going to be charged the whole bunch?
And I wondered about it.
So I did check my credit card account online.
But I didn't want to...
I didn't seem necessary.
I didn't want to do the usual things I would have done years ago,
which got anxious.
Somebody would take advantage of me.
I was kind of like, okay, well, let's see what happens.
And what happens if they charge me twice as much
than they're supposed to?
Do I need to get worried about upset or feel injustice of that?
What should be my role?
So I didn't have answers to those questions,
but those questions existed with me feeling like this,
very relaxed about it.
Is that appropriate or should I have gotten anxious?
I've rushed back and said, hey, something's wrong here.
I didn't get a receipt.
And I don't know, you know, what's going on?
I also didn't sign that a little slip you're supposed to sign
when you do credit cards.
I was like, this is unusual.
What's going to happen now?
So I don't know if that answers your question,
but that's what occurred to me.
I think it's a very different way of living.
Maybe it's a...
In one point in my life, I would have referred to it as
living a life of trust.
But now I don't think of it as trust anymore.
I just think of it as freedom.
Do you have any suggestions for if you feel like
you're the one being grasped, like the person being grasped?
Well, if you're the person being grasped.
Yes.
If I'm leaving your family or your friends
and they sort of hurt you sometimes.
What do you do then?
Ideally, in my world, ideally for me at least,
is that you would have friends
that you can talk honestly with.
And if you can't have an honest conversation,
maybe that's to reevaluate the friendship.
In an honest conversation, maybe it would look like this.
You have noticed for some time now that you're really
attached to me or grasping onto me, holding on.
And we have a friendship and I value you.
I can imagine you have a need for companionship
or a need for something.
But it's also hard for me.
I feel limited and boxed in.
I wonder if we can have a conversation about this
together, too, that works for both of us.
So some kind of conversation like that.
And that would be my inclination.
I put a tremendous value on this communication.
How does that sound?
That sounds good. That sounds hopeful.
Not hopeful?
Yeah, good. It's hard.
Not everyone wants to have that kind of honesty
and communication. It's difficult for people.
So for people who it's a foreign idea to have such
open, frank conversations, you have to kind of come at it
a little bit slowly and carefully and work into it
rather than like, let's sit down and be honest.
And to be able to learn the skill of these kinds of
conversations is one of the great things.
This was my introduction to the spiritual life.
I was witnessing these kinds of conversations with people.
I lived when I was 20, 21 at the largest hippie commune
in the United States.
It was about 800 people.
And then Tennessee, they called the farm.
And it was a spiritual commune of sorts.
But they had gotten their start in spirituality through LSD.
But when they moved to Tennessee, LSD didn't work.
Taking LSD didn't work so much there.
So they had to figure out something different,
something as powerful as LSD.
And the powerful thing they discovered was honesty.
So when I went there and stayed for a while,
I stayed there because I saw the amazing honesty
between people who were there.
And how they worked all kinds of things out.
And it was so inspiring to me.
And because it was kind of a spiritual community,
I got a sense that spiritual life could be this way.
And that inspired me.
Yeah, I think that's really helpful.
I've always believed in honest communication.
I think I need to slow my delivery.
Should slow the delivery?
Slow delivery, slow delivery.
Yeah, because communication is definitely...
Great, thank you.
Your first examples of the beautiful imagery of an open hand
were very clear to me.
I believe the very first one you gave was
an open hand with the striker.
And that seemed very comfortable
because that's a neutral object to me.
I may have one, I may have two.
I can get another one easily.
So certainly I can do this.
And it may leave my hand.
And similarly with the bird,
it wasn't neutral,
but it was the nature of the object that I had.
It was the right thing to do to open and let it go.
But if something is so personal,
not even high value, perhaps like Nancy,
if I may refer to that,
that this is such a treasure,
an actual object of treasure,
but something so emotional like
the anger you would feel with someone
and the thought of opening up
and expecting that to just leave.
Certainly no one's going to take it from me.
It's not very valuable to anyone else.
But why is that feeling so different
than the bird or the striker?
Do you have any ideas?
Because it's a very personal question,
so I don't see if you have any for yourself.
It's just the intensity of the creation
that it is from me.
But it seems to have high value.
And it may be anger on one day,
but it may also be something about my self-image
or something that, again,
it just seems to be, if it's so much about me.
So there's a wonderful saying in Buddhism
that I learned from Buddhism,
that if there's a gap between the ideal and the actual,
a gap between what's ideal about to be
and what's actually going on,
study the actual.
So you've heard this teaching today,
this idea today,
and now you're asking about how to do it,
when you have this intensity and so important for you
and so valuable.
Study why it's valuable.
Maybe that means that you haven't really studied,
you haven't really looked at yourself.
What's really going on?
Why is it valuable?
What are you trying to do?
What are you afraid of?
So that's why you find the answers to yourself,
rather than, you know,
that's where the answers come by.
So if the ideal is to be like this,
you can't do it in some areas of your life,
that's okay,
but that becomes where your practice goes.
Then you discover something.
I can't tell you what you'll discover,
but something useful.
It's lovely, thank you.
I thought at the beginning when you were speaking
that you were going to maybe ask something else,
and that is,
what if what I have is really valuable
and someone asks for it?
What do I do then?
I think that,
like this spell and this striker,
we've had it here for now almost 20 years.
I remember very fondly the person who gave it to us
was a gift,
and who came to sat here and sat in this room
for years and all that.
So for me, I have this wonderful association,
it's important to connection to that person
and all the years we've been here,
and it has value.
So if you came and said,
you know, I think I'd like that striker,
I'd say, oh, well,
let me tell you a little bit before I give it to you.
You know, this is not any old striker.
This actually has a lot of value
because of the memories, associations,
and kind of the background here.
So I don't know, I mean, I'm happy to give it to you,
happy enough,
but what if I go buy you a striker,
a different one, would that be okay?
Or I would just say, I explained to you,
yes, but this is what it means for me,
and then you'd say, oh, I didn't know that.
Okay, well, then I don't want it.
Or many years ago, I had a Zen teacher,
he, we were facing each other,
and I asked him for time to meet with him
to talk about practice or something.
And his respect then people had date books.
And so his response to me facing him saying,
do you have time to meet with me?
Was he came around shoulder to shoulder next to me
and brought out his date book
and put his date book between us
so I could see his schedule.
And it was like, he wasn't going to tell me,
I can't meet you in the next week.
I have to wait, you know.
He said, let's look at this together.
And then, oh, it's obvious.
He can't meet with me right now.
And it wasn't me versus him.
It wasn't oppositional.
Why doesn't he care for me?
Why is he putting me off two weeks?
It was like, oh, it was done cooperatively.
And this idea of doing things cooperatively,
letting people know what's happening for you.
This is striker is valuable.
Do you still want it?
Something.
So I thought that's where,
that was the answer I was getting ready to tell you.
No, you went someplace else.
I'll try to be more careful.
No, no, no, it was great.
No, no, it was great what you said.
But you asked.
Gil, I'm wondering if you can talk about
letting go of what's going on with you.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I can talk about letting go of one's self-identification
with one's work or whatever one's doing,
moving from a place of, like you said,
identifying with the task to a place of aspiration.
So is this an identity that you keep like this 24 hours a day,
seven days a week?
Or is it, what is it, kind of waning wax through the week?
Probably waning wax.
So what is it like, what do you like when it's most not there?
Open to more possibilities.
A little more relaxed.
But you could study identification.
But another thing you can study is study when it's least there
and see what you have to learn from that.
And that might be enough.
That enough to change it and shift it.
Thank you.
I'll try.
Hold on.
So it's horizontal?
You're like, yeah.
OK.
I want to say just a little off topic,
but I haven't been here for a couple of years since COVID.
And I really appreciate being here in this space.
And I've, I'm usually the one that doesn't speak.
So I think for me, I've been holding onto my,
it's interesting, holding onto my fear,
holding my fear of not speaking.
And it feels good to say what I said.
Oh, fantastic.
And just to describe your fear that's here.
And so I hear that you're holding your fear,
but not being held by your fear to speak this way.
Yeah.
That feels accurate.
You're practicing what I'm talking about already.
That was, that was beautiful.
Thank you very much.
Come practice more often.
I will, yes.
OK.
So thank you for being here this evening.
This was very nice.
And I still find it very lovely to be with people.
And still, even though, you know,
the serious part of the pandemic of really being isolated
is kind of over.
I'm still not actually spending a lot of time with people
directly, like the way I used to.
And so anything like this I value.
And I think it's wonderful to be together with people
practicing together.
So I appreciate it.
And thank you for being part of this.
And I hope to see you again.
I don't think, I think I'm scheduled to come Mondays,
maybe about once a month.
And Diana probably two to three times a month or something.
And other people will come through as well.
But it's a lovely to be here.
Thank you.
