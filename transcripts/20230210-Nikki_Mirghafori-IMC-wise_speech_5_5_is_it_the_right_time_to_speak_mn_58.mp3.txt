 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Greetings, friends. So this week we have been exploring wise speech together, the different teachings, the different teachings that Buddha asks us, directs us to ask ourselves. So I wanted to do a quick review as I've already done in the guided meditation and add the last one today, which is so important. And that is, is it the right time? Is it the right time to say what I'm about to say? Is it the right time? And this is particularly important when we're saying something that is challenging for the here to here. It's disagreeable, as the Buddha says. But before I get into that, I want to share with you the six guidelines that I've said, that I've mentioned. They actually amalgamation of different parts of the suttas. And you might have heard only five. And I'm giving six and you might have heard slightly different ones. So I've brought all of them together because they're also wonderful. I couldn't just choose this and leave that. So in my third, I brought them all together. And so I just I wanted to share the suttas references with you. So so in S.N. 45.8, the Buddha defines as also elsewhere as well. It's not the only place defines why speech or right speech, appropriate speech as abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech and from idle chatter. So these four not lying. And we talked about truthfulness, right? Divisive speech, not abusive speech and no idle chatter. And then in A.N. 5.198, he gives five guidelines for well-spoken speech for why speech. Is it timely, true, gentle, beneficial, connected, beneficial means connected to the goal of the path and spoken with a mind of goodwill. So usually those five are the ones that teachers teach. But in another suttan, I didn't write the reference. It's elsewhere in my notes. It don't take too long to graph. The Buddha also talks about is it true and factual. It makes the stickstait distinction that is it true and factual, not just true. So that's another thing that I've tried to bring in the teachings today. And in M.N. 58, Majima Nikaya 58, which I will talk about more today, he especially gives additional considerations for saying what is disagreeable, what is challenging for others to hear. And if it's beyond fact, if it's already true and factual and beneficial, one still has to wait for the right time. So timeliness shows up in various teachings, very important. So let's talk about that a little bit. So in let's think before I talk about the suttat, let's say you want to have a relationship conversation with a friend, with a serious conversation. And yeah, all of these, all the guidelines we have talked about, yeah, they are met. What you're going to say is true. It is factual. It is what happened. It's going to create harmony in your relationship. You're going to say it very gently, gentle to the ear, goes to the heart. It's beneficial for your growth, both of you coming closer together, supporting each other. And you're going to be speaking with a mind of goodwill, love for both of you. But your friend is sick right now. They are ill or they've just lost someone or they've lost their job. It's not the right time to have this conversation. Of course it isn't. No matter how much you want to get it off your chest and just have it and get it over with. It's not wise. It's not the right time. Similarly, if you want to give someone feedback or it's not wise to just put it in an email and send it off and get it off your chest, it's kind of actually cowardly. You really want to reach out, have a conversation with them, or actually reach out, make a time, set a good time. There's something I want to share with you. Just give them a heads up and then set up a time to either have a phone call or meet with them in person even better and have the conversations just the right time, create the right circumstances. You never know. They might open the email. A very, very difficult time in their lives if you just don't know what's going on. They might be at the funeral, leaving your funeral. Who knows? Anyway, so the right time. Is it the right time to say what I'm about to say? In addition to all the other things, so even all the other things are met, all the other conditions are met. So I wanted to now share a little bit about this, where the Buddha really gives this teaching and it is so beautiful. It's Majjhima Nikaya 58. And this is the setup. So here's a little story. So the setup is that Prince Abhaya has gone to Naganta Nata Putta. And Naganta Nata Putta apparently was one of Buddha's rivals at the time. So this prince goes to them having conversation. And then this is this rival, Buddha's rival, says, you know, Prince, you can go and refute the words of Gautama, the contemplative, Gautama the Buddha. And, you know, if he refused his words, then you'll become more mighty. People would say, wow, Prince Abhaya has refuted this wise man's words. And the way you can do that is go to him, go to him, Prince, and say, Lord, would you, Lord Buddha, would you, would you say something? Would you say words that are un-dear, un-endearing and disagreeable to others? Would you do that? And if the Buddha says, see, and if the Buddha says that he would say it, then he would say, well, what's the difference between you and the run-of-the-mill person who would just say things that are disagreeable to people? And if he answers no, then you would say, well, gosh, then, you know, you're afraid of other people, you know, you won't say something that's disagreeable. And basically, it would be, you know, either way you would get him, either way you would get him. So basically, there's more detail about this, get us to devas and devatas without getting into the details. But anyway, keeping the story short to get to the point, the Buddha, they're trying to set the Buddha up. So Prince Abhaya goes to the Buddha and says, so would you actually tell, would you speak things, words that are un-endearing and disagreeable for others to hear? And basically, the Buddha is silent and essentially he says, it depends, it really depends. And then he gives this beautiful teaching and Prince Abhaya bows and is devoted to the Buddha. Anyway, so here is the teaching and it's so beautiful. Basically, he says, it really depends if I know it to be, and basically he gives this table of conditions that if it is, if it's unfactual, untrue, unbeneficial, and un-endearing and disagreeable to others, of course I won't say it because those other conditions are not met. Now, if it's factual and true, but unbeneficial and un-endearing and disagreeable to others, I still won't say it, even if it's true and factual, but there's no benefit in saying it. So I'm not going to say it. If it is true and factual, it is beneficial, but it is un-endearing and disagreeable to others to hear. I have the sense of the proper time for saying it. So waiting for the right time. And then he continues, there are three other clauses. If it is unfactual, untrue, unbeneficial, but it's endearing and agreeable to others, this is an important one, so it's not true, it's not factual, it's not beneficial, but it's endearing. Basically, you're saying something that other people want to hear, there's no benefit, it's not even true and factual. He doesn't say them. Beautiful, right? So wise, so wise. Because sometimes as lay people, maybe we say something that other people want to hear, but it's not even factual or true. So beautiful teachings. Couple more of the words of the Buddha. If the Tathagata knows it to be factual and true, but un-beneficial, but endearing and agreeable to others, he doesn't say them. So in this case, now we're raising the bar a little more. It is true, but it's un-beneficial. And other people would love to hear it. He still doesn't say them. So if it's not beneficial, even if it's true, and other people would love to hear it, it's endearing and it's sweet, still doesn't say it because it's not beneficial. And I love this last one. I love this last one. So if the Tathagata knows it is factual, it is true, it is beneficial, and it is endearing and agreeable for others to hear, he still has a sense of proper time for saying them. Why is that? Because the Tathagata has sympathy for living beings. Ah, that just touches my heart. So even if all of those conditions are satisfied, he still says it at the proper time. Proper time. Why? Because he has compassion, sympathy. He has compassion. This word simply can be translated as compassion because he has compassion for living beings. A lot of compassion, choose the right time. Choose the right time. So, ah, these teachings are so beautiful and so wonderful to be able to share them with you. What a joy, what a delight. So, so I will put the guidelines, the amalgamated, I've put all of these together and let's see if sometimes it doesn't let me up 200. Okay, I need to make it a little shorter. So, the guidelines, here we go. Oh, still, I'm trying to put them in chat so that you have all the guidelines. I think I need to cut and paste. Hold on. The chat has a limit of 200. So I'm going to have to put them in two different chats. So I'm going to post the guidelines. Here is the first set, the first three, and I'm going to post the second three. And here we go. These are all the guidelines that I've shared with you and also put them on the video and a couple of announcements are I'm going over time just a couple of quick announcements. One is that Meg Galer, you'll be in good hands with Meg Galer next week. She'll be joining you from Southern France and substituting for Gil. Deep, dedicated practitioner, you're in great hands. And another thing I also wanted to share with you is that I'm teaching the Sunday morning I'm stopping for Gil and I'll be giving a talk, which will be both online and in person, most likely on Samadhi on concentration and also put my website.
