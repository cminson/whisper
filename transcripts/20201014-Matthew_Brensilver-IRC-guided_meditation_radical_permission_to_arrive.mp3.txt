So welcome. 
It's good. 
Good, of course, to take in the screen and and good to take in the space around the screen. 
And so the screen in a sense is where the action is and there's a lot happening there. 
But it's just part of space. 
And so sometimes maybe useful to Yeah, just to have a sense of either the screen is situated within space. 
All of it mediated by by our mind. 
Even if we were in the same room in the hall together, it's still in its own weird Buddhist way, virtual reality. 
So sometimes we orient to the screen sometimes to space. 
And then we begin to settle into our our posture. 
Firewood is completely firewood ash. 
It's completely ash. 
You are completely you. 
And so as we settle initially, we orient towards a way of making space for all of us. 
And while we'll tend to direct attention in a particular way to the breath to the body to the soundscape to feeling tone, we direct attention maybe in particular ways as we'll share over the period of the week. 
But nothing is actually excluded from the field of experience. 
Every part of you has its place. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
When we really get the sense, like the genuine invitation of the Dharma, that no part of your experience is excluded, we start to relax, to take our seat, to be more completely who we are. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
In one sense, meditation is a technique. 
But in another way, it is simply with understanding and love. 
It is, in a sense, the most radical form of self-acceptance. 
Saying yes to exactly who you are in this moment. 
All the goodness of the path comes out of the force of that yes. 
So breathe. 
Feel your body. 
Feel the space that runs through your body. 
Feel it. 
Being here, being here, here. 
Now. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Draw a line around certain phenomena. 
And say inside this circle is the area of focus. 
The area of the body. 
Chest or belly. 
Maybe the sensations of your breathing felt across your whole body. 
When we draw that circle around some experience, what is outside that circle is not the enemy. 
In fact, to rest the attention within the circle, we have to say a deep yes to everything outside the circle. 
To the thought and feeling, emotion, sensation. 
When we say no to that, it becomes more and more sticky or more compelling. 
We give a radical permission for everything outside the circle to be what it is. 
It's a certain kind of equanimity. 
And then wherever we've drawn that circle, it's easier to rest within it. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
You don't need to shape or control your breath. 
It's more like you take your cues from the breath. 
The breath train you. 
You're energized by the inhale. 
Soothed by the exhale. 
Soothed by the exhale. 
Radical permission.

So thank you. 
Thank you. 
As many of you, you know. 
As many of you, you know. 
In balance in terms of energy. 
You know, kind of zonked out. 
Or restless. 
Yeah. 
And I sort of picture like a, some cartoon character from when I was a kid is like running, except there's an elastic band attached to the characters back with an anvil attached to the rubber band and you stop. 
And the rubber band kind of. 
Slams into us and. 
And so just to be gentle with that. 
That process. 
You know, like sometimes joke that, like, if we, if we could design, if Max and I could have designed a five day retreat. 
Without a first day. 
For sure we would do that. 
For you. 
We're not. 
We're not. 
But we can't. 
So there's a first day and. 
Something is happening even as it seems like nothing's happening or it's useless. 
Suffering something is happening. 
And. 
The first day. 
Is ever, you know, you can settle as if it's the last day. 
Yeah, you don't, don't know what's going to happen. 
Yeah. 
But stay close in today. 
There are no, no. 
Interviews, no practice discussions. 
It's a simple day. 
And. 
Yeah, and just, just, uh, yeah, staying close in. 
Being gentle, but clear. 
And, um, and some sense of trust that even when it seems like nothing's happening, something is happening, something necessary is happening. 
Yeah. 
So, um, yeah, Max, would you say something about walking? Thank you, Matthew. 
Yeah. 
Most of, most of us are familiar with the suggestions for walking, the instructions for walking. 
I mean, you notice on the schedule. 
That walking meditation is, is. 
Given sort of, you know, pretty much equal billing. 
With, with sitting, you know, we, we include walking during the retreat. 
In just periods of sitting and then there's like a break, you know, like five minute break and then sitting in a five minute break and sitting by their break. 
But we include walking because it has so many benefits. 
And this, I think of walking meditation as. 
The one hand equally important, equally as profound as sitting. 
And on the other hand, it's like a wonderful compliment to sitting. 
It's this energetic compliment. 
Like to, to do some sitting practice and then get up and walk. 
And come back to sitting. 
It's like this reset renewal. 
And so just to notice how it is for you. 
How, what would it be like for a walking meditation to be restorative, to be nourishing. 
So the usual invitation is to. 
Find some. 
A path or, you know, something like 20 or 30 steps. 
And walk back and forth. 
And the idea is to separate the kind of. 
Utilitarian walking to get somewhere. 
From just the experience of the, of the, of the beauty of the process of walking itself. 
So when we're walking back and forth, we can kind of, you know, find a place to walk. 
It could be inside the house. 
It could be. 
One of my favorite memories of walking meditation was just walking in my room. 
My yogi room, which was quite small. 
And maybe it was just a few steps, but there was so. 
So with it. 
And so in the flow. 
And so just the idea of even space. 
Doesn't really apply. 
You know, and you're just, you're just in that flow of movement. 
So, so that can be nice. 
And then it's also nice, maybe, you know, once a day or. 
Once a week. 
If you're able to. 
And if it makes sense for you, maybe it's taking a relaxed walk around the block or around the neighborhood. 
And I love this idea of taking oneself for a walk. 
You know, we usually take the dog for a walk. 
Or we're also. 
And. 
And to just have this. 
Just stay in the body. 
Let the feet be sponges that just absorb sensation with each step. 
And you're just kind of taking in the world in this unmediated. 
Simple direct way. 
So that's also walking meditation. 
And. 
You know, I think the whole instruction about how fast to go. 
Is. 
That it depends basically, you know, and I know for myself. 
I like to, especially at the beginning of a retreat. 
I like to walk. 
Just a little bit more slowly than I normally would, but just a little bit slower than usual. 
And then just let, let the pace of walking. 
Kind of match the. 
The speed of our mindfulness. 
No. 
When the mind feels calm. 
And open and soft. 
And mindfulness feels sharp and precise. 
I think it's the most natural thing in the world to just slow down. 
If I feel very agitator, the mind is moving a lot. 
Sometimes I like to take a brisk walk. 
And there's something about that, you know, just getting. 
Everything flowing. 
And. 
It feels, it feels really right. 
Sometimes if I'm really tired in a sitting, it's nicer to take a more brisk walk and just get the energy up. 
So use your wisdom. 
Around the walking, but just this encouragement that it's, it's a wonderful support and wonderful, you know, aspect of the practice. 
And it's also a support for having continuity of mindfulness through the day. 
You know, the danger is we start to think of like the sittings as like, that's where the real action happens. 
And then the walks are kind of like a break and, you know, get everything done, you have to get done and then scramble to get back for the sitting. 
And the problem with that is it's like trying to boil a big pot of water. 
And so we turn on the flame. 
And then we think, Oh, I forgot to, you know, I need to go send that message. 
So I turn off the flame and I go do that. 
Come back. 
Oh yeah, boiling water, turn it on again. 
And I think, Oh, I have to do that other thing, turn it off. 
And so water never heats up because we don't give it that continuity. 
We don't give it the continuity of the heat of the flame. 
So retreat practice is a chance to, to have this kind of modulated low level of a continuous flame. 
We don't want to burn ourselves. 
And we don't want to just have a tepid, tepid pot of water at the end of the day. 
So it's like, what is it for you to keep that heat of mindfulness, heat of awareness, of attention going? You know, so it can be a very helpful thing to do to take a sit, a walk and a sit and say, I'm going to treat this as one whole thing, you know, and see how, how, how much continuity of mindfulness is possible to maintain. 
And whenever I do that, you know, so you have a sitting and then stay, stay in the body, stay connected. 
Do you walking? If you go to the bathroom, drink water, fine, just stay connected, stay in the body. 
And then they come back to the sitting, it can be quite remarkable, the impact of that continuity on that next sitting. 
You've built up something, you've built up a kind of heat, momentum. 
So, so yeah, so just this support, encouragement for enjoy the walking, let it be nourishing. 
And, you know, as Matthew was saying, this is a little bit of like a transition day, you know, coming into this new way of being, so being gentle with oneself, and as much as possible, you know, staying connected to the body, staying, the body is such a, such a wonderful support for being present. 
Thank you very much. 
Enjoy, enjoy this day. 
Do you want to say anything else, Matthew? Okay, okay. 
Enjoy this day of practice.
