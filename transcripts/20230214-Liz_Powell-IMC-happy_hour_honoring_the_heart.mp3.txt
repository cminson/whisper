 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Yeah, thanks for the reminder. So, since today is Valentine's Day, I thought it would be a good day to honor the human heart, both our own and that of others. One form of appreciation, I feel, is recognition of how amazing and powerful the function of the heart is and how science has caught up to these 2,500-year-old practices we do, supporting what we're doing during happy hour. So, I'd like to share some interesting excerpts I've read about the heart. According to Abbott Laboratories website, while there is much still to understand, science already tells us that there is no doubt that emotion impacts not only our mental health but also our physical well-being, especially that of the heart. A growing body of evidence suggests that psychological factors are literally heartfelt and can contribute to cardiac risk, Harvard's medical school reports. Our hearts are innervated, meaning that many nerves supply them. Some slow the heart down. Those that slow the heart down are activated when we relax or meditate. That's good to know. Others turn on when we're under emotional stress, causing the heart to quicken, ready for fight or flight. Another site reports, the heart is more than a pump. It actually sends messages to the brain. Dr. Roland McCready of the Institute of Heart Math discussed the science behind the theory with the Today newspaper, which reported, Psychologists once maintained that emotions were purely mental expressions generated by the brain alone. We now know that this is not true. Emotions have as much to do with the heart and body as they do with the brain. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The experience of an emotion results from the brain, heart, and body acting in concert. The Institute of Heart Math, a research center dedicated to the study of the heart, and the physiology of emotions, has conducted numerous studies identifying the relationship between emotions and the heart. A number of their studies have provided new insight into understanding how the activity of the heart is indeed linked to our emotions and our health, vitality, and well-being. Recent heart math studies define a critical link between the heart and the brain. The heart is in a constant two-way dialogue with the brain. Our emotions change, the signals the brain sends to the heart, and the heart responds in complex ways. However, we now know that the heart sends more information to the brain than the brain sends to the heart, and the brain responds to the heart in many important ways. Heart Maths research shows that when we experience heartfelt emotions like love, care, appreciation, and compassion, the heart produces a very different rhythm. In this case, it is a smooth pattern that looks like gently rolling hills. Harmonious heart rhythms, which reflect positive emotions, are considered to be indicators of cardiovascular efficiency and nervous system balance. This lets the brain know that the heart feels good and often creates a gentle, warm feeling in the area of the heart. Learning to shift out of our stressful emotional reactions to these heartfelt emotions can have profound positive effects on the cardiovascular system and on our overall health. It is easy to see how our heart and emotions are linked and how we can shift our hearts into more efficient states by monitoring their rhythms. So this feeling of appreciation is one of the most concrete and easiest positive emotions for individuals to self-generate and sustain for longer periods. Almost anyone can find something to genuinely appreciate. And by simply recalling a time when you felt sincere appreciation and recreating that feeling, you can increase your heart rhythm coherence, reduce emotional stress, and improve your health. So I love this support for what we're doing, these practices we do during happy hour, appreciating the ways that they work with the organ of the heart in healthy ways and reshape the mind. So with that, let's do some heart-centered meditation this evening. And as always, if the words I offer at the beginning of the meditation are supportive for you, great. If they're not, please let my voice fade into the background of your meditation and meditate in the way that's most supportive for you right now. And I'll speak mostly at the beginning, first 10 minutes or so of the meditation. So as you settle into the meditation, allowing yourself to recognize with kindness how the body, the heart, and the mind are in this moment. With whatever they may be bringing to this meditation. And taking your time to find the posture that is supportive for whatever conditions are present. Posture that allows for both awareness and kindness to the body, whether you're sitting, standing, or lying down. It's easier to do these practices when you're not fighting with the body. So perhaps lightly scanning the body from head to toe with awareness of how the body is aware of whatever is most obvious in the attention. If there are areas of tightness or tension that can be released or softened, perhaps using the out breath to release whatever can be released. And if there are areas that remain activated in some way, allowing them to be exactly as they are, just letting them be. Perhaps sending them feelings of kindness. And just allowing your presence to hold them in awareness. Perhaps bringing to mind an image or words of appreciation for what the body does for you every day. Without your asking it to. Without remaining vigilant for any viruses or bacteria and as best it can quietly fending them off. Without your asking for any information for the way the body metabolizes food and water into energy. Gratitude for the body's capacity to repair itself from minor and even major injuries. I appreciate this loyal, hardworking body. You may want to quietly whisper in the mind, these phrases are these inclinations of heart. I wish this body health. I wish this body free from harm. May this body enjoy happiness. May this body be at ease. And perhaps allowing the attention to be aware of the heart area. You may feel its sensations and allow the heart area to fill the mind. Allow yourself to sense the heart. Perhaps sending it your good wishes. I appreciate this hardworking heart. The way it takes in whatever is happening physically, emotionally, mentally. Doing its best to keep me healthy no matter what comes its way. Protecting me. Caring from my body and mind, my emotions. May this heart be as healthy as possible. May this heart be safe. May this heart be happy. May this heart be at ease. And if there are other emotions or thoughts present, simply receiving them with awareness, kindness, and as we continue with the meditation, allowing these phrases we've been saying or any others that occur to you, or simply feeling the feeling of appreciation radiating from and to the heart. Thank you. Thank you. And if the attention drifts, not a problem when awareness returns, simply allowing whatever form of appreciation for the heart that's accessible to you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As we feel the sensations and the wishes for the heart, it can be quite natural that others for whom we feel appreciation may come to mind. And you can either continue with the phrases or the feelings of appreciation for this heart in your body, or you can extend those wishes to others. Holding them in mind, really bringing them into your heart. May your heart be healthy. May your hearts be safe. May your hearts be happy. May your hearts be at ease. May you experience some appreciation for your hearts and the care and love they bring into others' lives. And also including any phrases that spontaneously come to your heart and mind towards yourself or others. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May your hearts be free of suffering. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And for the next 10 minutes or so, we have time for breakout discussions. And these are small groups of about three people each. It's a wonderful thing to get inspiration from each other, to share how it's going. And the way we do that is each person takes a turn and just puts one statement at a time into the mix and then allows when others are speaking to listen from the heart without commentary on each other's sharing, without advice giving. Simply listening to what's coming up in your own heart and listening carefully to the other person is a form of amazing kindness. And so we will break into these groups for about 10 minutes and then we'll come back for a final few minutes in the group. So, by the way, if you do not have enough people in your room, let's say you're the only person, be patient and I'll move you to another room so that you'll have companionship there. And maybe you can start with the person sharing first who has the shortest hair, then going from there. Thank you. Usually you have to accept... Yeah, there you go. Hi, Olivia. If you'd like, I can put you into a room. I'll put you in room eight if that's okay. Sounds great. Thank you. You're welcome.
