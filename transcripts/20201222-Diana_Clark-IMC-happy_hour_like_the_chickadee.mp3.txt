The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
What I wanted to talk about this evening was maybe building a little bit on what
I had talked about the last time I was with you guys with
building on this idea. Sometimes we could use this word
of perseverance, but that's not an inspiring word.
Trying to see if I could think of something else or something that's a little bit more
speaks from the heart, kind of like just hanging in there or stick to it in this.
But without a sense of straining or without a sense of striving, but more of a sense of
okay, you know, COVID is up and many of us have more restrictions again.
And how can we just kind of like hang in there, hang in there with what we know is helpful
and what we know is not helpful. Can we stay away from those things and
to have the, what is it, fortitude, wisdom, the strength, the capacity,
and along these lines, endurance, Bill offers that word.
So it's another poem by Rosemary Traumer, Steadfast, Billus offers, yeah.
And this poem that Rosemary Traumer, last time when I talked about her,
I mentioned that she posts every day and this she posted just a few days ago,
three days ago, maybe, I'm not exactly sure how many, but you know, less than a week ago.
And so here's, and she titles this poem, so maybe she's feeling the same thing we are.
I know that she lives in Colorado. I don't know where, but you know, they have
winters there, a little bit different than here in the Bay Area.
The title of this poem is called, Instructions for Perseverance.
It goes like this.
It's the chickadee that saves me today.
Though the world gets cold, the chickadee stays.
Despite snow, despite frost, despite lack of sun, it doesn't leave the winter land.
Oh, tough little bird who sticks around, who thrives in any weather,
whose cheerful tunes spirals like hope through the frigid folds of December.
As if to say, let it come, I can sing through anything, let it come.
So I feel kind of inspired by this in the sense that who thrives in any weather.
So so much about this practice is gaining the capacity in which whatever weather, quote, unquote,
that we are experiencing, that we have the ability to meet it, to not be blown over, to
stay upright in some kind of way.
And then here the chickadee is singing, because that's what chickadees do, they sing.
So maybe we don't necessarily sing, but is there a way, oh, the chickadee is the main state bird.
Thank you, Paul, for sharing that.
See, there's a reason why.
You need some of these tough little birds who stick around and thrive in any weather.
But this idea that we don't necessarily have to sing, but just to have the capacity to just keep showing up,
to show up, just to keep showing up.
And that is so much what meditation practice is about, whether it's mindfulness, meditation,
concentration, meditation, or loving kindness concentration.
It's just kind of stretching our minds and our hearts so that we can hold more and more,
so that we can hold difficulties, our own difficulties and the difficulties of others.
So whatever the weather might be, as well as we can hold the joys too.
Sometimes we tend to be dismissive and thinking like, you know, whatever's difficult is really what's important.
We have to solve all these problems and we put our attention to all those things that aren't going right.
But to gain the capacity to hold what's going well, to gain the capacity to appreciate ourselves,
to appreciate others, sometimes this is a practice to be able to gain this capacity.
So the chickadee, this tough little bird who sticks around, who thrives in any weather.
I don't know, I feel kind of touched by this, these adorable little birds.
I think they're adorable there.
And then before we go to meditation, Neil, I was thinking that in the past I had mentioned that there's this group in which people can
talk to one another outside of this particular setting.
And so, and I had, I've forgotten the past three times I've been teaching, but maybe Neil, can you put in the chat, the URL for this group?
I kind of cut you off, probably, you just one minute, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He didn't know I was going to say this to him, so he needs just a minute here.
But this is just an opportunity to, some of you have been coming so many times, it's really great.
And, you know, to connect in other setting to share resources, maybe you know about things that you want to share or have a question or something like this.
So, here we go.
So, thank you, Neil, for putting that in the chat box. For those of you who want to join, it is open for people who are attending here in happy hour.
And many of you know one another.
Just as a way to, maybe during the holidays, it's nice to have different ways to connect.
Maybe sometimes if the weather is particularly dreary, whether quote unquote, you know, maybe it's nice to connect with others.
Maybe some of others can be chickadees that are singing through the frigid faults of December as if to say, let it come.
I can sing through anything. Let it come.
Okay, so thank you, Neil. And with that as an introduction.
Let's do some meditation.
Another upright posture.
A posture that has both ease and alertness.
In a way that's not rigid, but not slouched either.
And taking a few long, slow, deep breaths.
And then allowing the breath to just naturally return to normal, following the natural rhythm.
Tapas gets settled. Do a little bit of a body scan.
Checking in at areas that often hold tension.
And the shoulders.
And the back.
The chest.
And feeling the pressure against the body where you're sitting on the backside.
Feeling connected, grounded.
The legs.
The feet.
The arms.
The hands.
Just bringing some awareness, some presence to the bodily experience.
And then resting awareness on the sensations of breathing.
The movement of the belly, the chest. Maybe feeling that air in the nose.
Of course the mind is going to be distracted.
Chances are you've been thinking all day. There's a certain momentum to thinking.
So just very simply, gently begin again with the sensations of breathing.
And we wake up into the story within the mind is doing.
It doesn't matter one bit how many times you wake up into thinking and then begin again
noticing the breath.
So it's just what practice is.
It's a little bit of persistence.
In a relaxed, easy way.
Without straining.
Without a sense of striving.
And then to begin a loving kindness practice.
I always like to start words easy.
Bringing to mind a lovable being.
Someone that's easy to love.
Bringing this being to mind and connecting with them in some way.
Some people have a visual image.
Some people more have a sense of warmth or openness in the body and the heart center.
With that they're connecting with the lovable being.
For many of us it's helpful to use phrases as a way to help support the mind to connect.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
Is there a way to connect with the lovable being with warm heartedness, care, respect, kindness.
And of course the mind will get distracted.
Just begin again.
It's the chickadee that saves me today.
Though the world gets cold, the chickadee stays.
Despite snow, despite frost, despite lack of sun.
It doesn't leave the winter land.
Oh, tough little bird who sticks around, who thrives in any weather.
So we're cultivating our capacity to stay with the open heart, warm heart.
Thank you.
And staying with lovable being just a little bit more here.
Maybe exploring different ways to connect.
Using an image, using bodily felt experience, using phrases.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
And then to expand our loving kindness to include ourselves.
If we have experience of loving kindness for ourselves, we know that that's possible.
That increases our confidence, which increases our capacity.
We can have a cheerful tune that spirals like hope through the frigid folds of December.
And if to say, let it come, I can sing through anything, let it come.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I be happy.
May I be safe.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I live with ease.
May I live with ease.
Can we have some appreciation for ourselves?
Remembering some positive, supportive, helpful things that we've done.
Thank you.
And then to move on to a neutral person, somebody that we don't know.
Just like us, they too wish to be happy and safe and healthy at ease.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
Maybe the neutral person is somebody here in this Zoom meeting, somebody you don't know.
Maybe somebody you sometimes see in the neighborhood.
Maybe somebody you don't know.
And if you didn't have that capacity.
Maybe somebody you don't know.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
And then to end this meditation.
Feel your feet on the ground and feel the pressure of the chair or cushion on your body.
And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes.
So this idea of perseverance as a way to increase our capacity.
So that we can meet with whatever weather we find ourselves in.
Whatever circumstances, whatever life brings us.
So maybe you offered some synonyms, some alternative words.
So persistence and endurance and steadfast.
But I'm offering this idea also with the idea that we don't want to make it feel burdensome and heavy.
So is there a way that we can keep showing up but with some ease, some spaciousness.
We can take a certain amount of effort, but can we use this effort not in a way that closes us down and that we collapse into and, but, or that we have a, I keep on using this word ease or certain relaxed attitude about it.
Now I'd like to put you into some small groups and you can talk about this idea of using perseverance as a way to increase our capacity so that we can meet whatever weather you might meet.
And then, and how meditation practice supports that.
One example is, you know, coming back again and again to the breath or mindfulness practice. And then with loving kindness practice, it's helping to create create the way that the mind in the heart know that there is access there can be some warm heartedness there can be some love for others and for oneself.
That's independent of all the conditions of the world being just right.
When we have that when there's something about us that really understands that, then our confidence goes up, of course it does.
We're allowed to meet others in a different way.
Okay, so
it's just for 12 minutes, maybe 13 minutes.
And it can be helpful if it's not just monologue.
But instead is to discuss things that one person says just one or two ideas and then the next person says one or two ideas, and then the next person the next person and then it might come back around.
So three or four.
And
let's do it that
can go in order of the last digit of your phone number.
The phone number that you use the most, and we'll say that zero comes before one.
So we'll go anymore numerical order by last digit the phone number.
Okay, enjoy.
