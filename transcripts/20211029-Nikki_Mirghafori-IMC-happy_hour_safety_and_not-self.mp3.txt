 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodarma.org. So hello, dear Sangha. Hello and good evening, good morning, good afternoon, so many time zones you're joining from. So lovely to see you and to be with you. So for today's practice, I wanted to bring in the theme of safety more. As we've talked about safety as a part of META, one of the META wishes. And it's so important, the more I practice with safety and think about it and sit with it, I realize how important it is. And now with the comment that was made about no-self versus not-self, I'm also inspired to bring that in a little bit somehow tonight. Weave that into our META practice. So let's see how it goes, all these inspirations that you bring into your Sangha, with the co-creation. So these two themes. So regarding safety, as you know already, may you be safe, may you be safe from inner outer harm, may I be safe is one of the META wishes as well as wishes for happiness, health, and ease, taking care of oneself happily. And sometimes some teachers put safety at the end, we start with happiness, may you be happy in the sense that, oh, happiness is the most important one or leading with that. And yet having practiced with the different orders and different variations over the years, it's become clear to me that there is a reason why may you be safe, may I be safe. Safety only is the first phrase because there needs to be a sense of safety. We need to offer ourselves a sense of safety. In order for us to be happy and healthy and have ease, safety is fundamental, offering the sense of safety. And there is research by John Bulby, I think is John his first name, Bulby, definitely Bulby is the last name. Regarding the attachment period, the Bulby's attachment theory with young children, how safety is so fundamental and how kids develop with their sense of safety, with their psychological development, with their sense of autonomy, etc. So safety, that sense of safety really being fundamental for all of us. And we're all grown up, we're kids, in some ways we are grown up, and in some ways we are still those children who need safety. So offering ourselves safety. So fundamentally important. So offering safety to our poor minds, so that when the mind wanders off, or there is fear, or there is sadness, or there is suffering, or anything that comes up, there is a sense of well, okay, stop it now, enough. And offering safety for everything to be, for everything to be, to be cared for with metta, cared for with metta, with kindness, with warmth, with warmth. Now, so that is the primary theme. And then I felt inspired at the beginning when we had this little exchange about not self versus no self, which is actually not self, because no self is a denying of there being a self whereas the Buddha never said there is no self, there is a self, you are here, you have an address, you have a profession, you have a body, there is a self, and yet it's not self, it's not personal. It's not about you. It's not about me. That's one way, there's so many different ways to approach and understand not self this impersonality, this ungovernability. So and one way to feel into this not self is that it's impersonal. Yes, it is personal. I am here, there is a self here, this person, this being whom I need to care for, I need to offer safety to. And, and why, why do we do this? Why do we cultivate metta? It's not to have a big head. It's not to have a self to self aggrandize. But it's not about it is about us. And it's also not about us. It's about this being who lives and dies and suffers to serve both this being and all beings that are interconnected to us. So maybe that sounds like a call on a bit like what is she talking about? Don't worry about it. Don't, don't try to think I'll try to bring these themes in a little bit in the guided meditation. And for now, let it go. Let all the words go and let's just start practicing together. I think I've said enough to set the frame. And whatever you need will be offered to you in the guidance. So let go of thinking, let go of thoughts and let's just practice together. Let's arrive together. Ah, self arriving, arriving, arriving in this body. Triggling, letting go, letting go of all the words, of all the thoughts, all the thinking that has come. Let go, not needed in this moment. The seeds have been planted. No need to attach even to the Dharma. Ah, release, release. Turning, turning the awareness inward. First to land, first to arrive. And this body, feeling our feet on the earth, on the floor, connected. Well rooted. I am here just as the Buddha touched the earth, the earth mudra. We touch the earth with our feet, the floor in lieu of the earth. I am here. Ah, this being who is me, I am here. May earth be my witness. And landing, releasing any holding tightness. And the muscles in the forehead. Letting the eyes rest in their socket. Letting the jaw, the chin, muscles behind the ears. Can we offer safety? Offer safety? The muscles of the face. Oh dear muscles, you don't have to do anything. You can release, you can relax. Dear muscles, it's okay. You have worked hard enough. It's okay. You don't have to be vigilant. You can relax in this moment. It's okay. Taking refuge. Just releasing. Inviting your heart. The proverbial heart center, home of emotions to feel safe. And relax. Sweetheart, dear heart, dear heart, it's okay. You can be just as you are. Nothing is expected of you. Any different. Any differently than what already is. Embracing with loving awareness the lower abdomen. Oh dear abdomen. It's okay. No judgment. No holding. You're safe to just be. To just receive the breath. Because you already are doing nothing extra. And oh dear sit bones. Yes. Supporting the upper body. Yes dear sit bones. You can relax, feel safe to give your earth, give your weight. Release your weight, the tightness. Release your weight onto the earth. You can drop any holding. And so too. Bringing awareness to the groin area. To the upper legs, knees, lower legs and feet. Can be just as they are. Releasing tightness, tension. This body can be just as it is. Whether there is discomfort, it's okay. Your body, you are loved just as you are. It's okay. It won't have to be any other way. If you need to move and shift, that's okay too. Do it lovingly, mindfully, caringly for this body. This body that is mine and not entirely mine. I don't control all of its functioning. It's as if I'm the guardian of this amazing, amazing piece of mystery entrusted to me. Letting the breath be received. Letting the breath be received. Tired of the in-breath, the entirety of the out-breath. As if the breath is like a soft blanket. Letting the breath be received. Letting the breath be received. Offering safety, offering good will. There's nothing you have to do. Letting yourself be breathed. The expansiveness, expansiveness of this moment, this breath, the possibilities for safety, offering to your body, to your heart, to your mind. It's okay. And if judgments arise internally, externally, I can't do this. I'm distracted, I'm sleepy, I don't know what I'm doing. Let the judgments, let them feel safe. The mansion of your heart can be spacious, a place of safety refuge for everything to be. See what happens if you don't push things away as bad, as wrong. Just let them be. Be a friend to yourself, be a friend to whatever arises, the body, mind, and heart. Be a friend to the breath, sensations of the body, no matter how difficult. And be a friend freely to the thoughts, whatever they may be. Offering safety, offering safety. Just this moment, your heart, safe space. Heal yourself. If the phrases are helpful, you can use phrases. May I be safe for myself. May I offer safety to my heart, to my body, to my mind. May I be a safe refuge. May I be a refuge. May I serve as a refuge. May I offer myself safety. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. May I be safe for myself. The Buddha said that the Knight of Buddha's enlightenment marrow through so many arrows, arrows of doubt. The Buddha, so much mitta. The sense of safety, ease that they got transformed to flowers before they landed. The doubts, the slings and arrows of our minds met with a smile, met with safety. Transformed. Yes, yes. Trusting in our Buddha nature, yes, possible for me here and now. Thank you. I wrapped in the blanket, every cell of the body, every thought, the whole body wrapped the blanket of safety. It's okay. It's okay. You can relax, you can rest. Thank you. I'd like to invite you to try something on, if you wish. Trying on a perspective for a split second, perhaps, if you wish, as an experiment. What if, what if this universe, is inherently safe, above and beyond our imagination, in ways we can't fathom? That it is inherently safe, living is safe, that dying is perfectly safe? What if this offering safety, it isn't about us doing, giving, it just is, it's the way things are. Through this practice, we're acknowledging, acknowledging the Dharma, that small d, the way things are. Reminding ourselves of something we deeply know. Our heart, our Buddha nature deeply knows, that it is safe, it has always been and always will be. Through this formal practice, we're just reminding ourselves of something we once knew. That fear is perhaps just like what is experiencing a dream, when you wake up from a dream. Oh, it's perfectly safe, you're not dreaming anymore. No reason. Fear has no foothold, as it is. Safe. No reason. This impersonal, both personal and impersonal self, is held in complete safety. And for the last moments of this practice period, however it was, sleepy, distracted, confused, it's all okay, offering safety to yourself. For however it was, no judgment, just appreciation. You showed up, you've planted seeds, trusting, trusting, but they will flower in ways you cannot fathom, don't limit yourself. Thank you, me, for showing up. Just showing up and offering even a second of safety. May all beings, may all beings in ways I can't imagine, may all beings including myself benefit from the goodness of my heart, goodness of my being, trusting, trusting in the goodness. May all beings be safe, may all beings be free, including myself. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice. And now in this practice, the invitation once, to explore safety, this basic, basic tilling of the soil for love, for metta, for care, for happiness, for ourselves and for others. Aspired by the comment at the beginning of The Hour by Neil about not-self, I also brought the aspect of not-self and the invitation of dimensions of safety, which are not typically what we think of. And again, was an invitation for you to try a perspective, maybe for just a second, maybe something would open up and if it didn't, no problem. Let it go. All good. Planting seeds. So, I'd like to open the floor for reflections, for questions, for comments, in the spirit of sharing the benefit of the Sangha. Whether you observe, maybe something opened up for you, something was challenging. Violet, I see your hand is up. Hi. I had a whole journey. I don't know if I'll be able to articulate what I'm trying to say. I have this view I've been working with that pain is unsafe, that there's something unsafe about pain. And today, as I was trying to offer myself safety, there was pain in my body, there's pain in my mind, but there was safety in my awareness. So that's where the safety was found. So then I was like, okay, what's the nature of my awareness? Can I see what that is like so I can hold on to it when there's painful stuff going on? But it felt very far away from me. Like, it felt like this bubble that was like 10 miles away from me. And it almost, it didn't feel very close so that I tried to bring the awareness inside like, okay, what if the awareness is like inside my body next to the pain and then almost immediately after I started working with that you said something about like the blanket is in your cells or something I was like, oh, yeah, that. That's I tried to like keep it in my body. And then when you said this idea that the universe is inherently safe, then that, again, that's like challenging this view that pain is unsafe because the universe is painful. But then you're saying that in some ways pain is safe. So I'm still working with that. But that's some of what I experienced. Beautiful. Thank you, Violet. Thank you so much for sharing. I am so touched. I love the way that for you. One way you worked with it skillfully is what it came up for you with with awareness, the safety awareness in beautiful safety. How profound and beautiful because whatever awareness is aware of is okay. This is safe. Oh, pain awareness is aware of it. Oh, yes, it's just a beautiful way and I have full trust that what you just described in this way of working, it will continue to open up for you. I have trust for you. This is this is beautiful. This is profound what you describe. Thank you. Lovely. Yeah. She says I found the issue of finding safety in death profound. Yeah, thank you, Jerry. And that quote I like to give credit to Steven Levine. I think that he has said, and I was quite impacted by it, that death is completely safe I forget that might be paraphrasing but something about death is completely safe. I just love the way that he says it. Thank you for that. And if you ask what you spell the name of the universal sound you spoke about on October 25 is not a sound and a DA, not as in nothing zero. And then we have the reflections we have a few more minutes you can raise your hand or you can type in chat. If you wish. And if you type to me personally I will only read the reflection not your name so it's private. Thank you so much. The is a very interesting meditation. I confess that. And I don't want to, I feel like I'm going to be a wet blanket and, but the saying everything is safe. It took away the meaning of safe, and it for me anyway it became sort of a meaningless concept to say everything is safe. I think like what maybe matters never destroyed. And, and sort of in that sense, I'm never I'm always going to be around in some form and some sort of faith. But anyway, I am. Maybe I sort of lost why I confess, I hear that and confessing is completely safe. You are completely safe to confess that he was, it was intended. It was intangible it kind of became heady I'm hearing. It's perfectly fine you know that invocation that invitation may not be the appropriate one and the right one for you, and right now in in this way and it's perfectly okay. It's not needed and that's the invitation that was really trying to say hey, if it's not working, don't spin out, just let it go there's plenty here already to, to, to feast on and yet some seed has been planted instead of arguing with yourself and saying this doesn't work and let it go, just don't get into the argument. Please, and trust that something might open up at some point into a different way of seeing an insight. And if not, that's okay too. It's all good there's so many paths to the temple, so many different paths. This is not the only one. So many paths. Thank you, Don, for that beautiful confession. Thank you, it's safe for everything. This work this didn't work what the heck do you mean by everything is like what does that even mean, that's okay too. So dear ones, how about we turn at this point as we do at this time to turn to practice in small groups offering each other safety offering ourselves safety and offering each other safety and it's so beautiful to practice in the small group of three and the invitation is to start with 15 seconds of meta silent meta for each other. And, and then you can share as much or as little as you wish about your practice. Offer safety please to yourself and to others, take care of yourself, take care of each other, and see what needs to be held witness what needs to be said. What doesn't want to be said, it's all okay. So I'm going to open the rooms. Actually wait, I'm going to not get open the rooms, shifting up here we go. I'm opening the rooms. Take care. Okay, welcome back everyone. The rooms are closed. We've got a couple minutes for reflections. Any. So feel free to raise your hand or type in chat. And while I wait for your hands to go up especially if you haven't shared in a while if you have, please pull back let's people allow people who haven't to pull forward. That's the way of taking care of the community. As I wait for you I'll say one thing more about this invocation that towards the end of everything being safe is actually from the perspective of the enlightened from the enlightened perspective awakened perspective. Ultimate safety, and that is the invitation that I was trying to bring in to see from split second that perspective could could make sense and maybe it can't at this point, and sometimes it can drop in something can open up when the mind is already with these invitations something can open up profoundly so that was my hope. Even if it jiggle something. And if it didn't, don't worry about it didn't work. Barbara, please. My breakout me to find a say, talked about visiting people, family in Arizona I think it was where he was so surprised to see people. I'm just going to pause actually before you talk about that but we just want to make sure it's okay with your partner for you to be talking about what they shared. Oh okay. Maybe he should share it. Yeah, if they want to maybe that's what I think is. Yeah, that's more appropriate. Thank you. Pause me for a moment. Yeah, if that person wants to raise your hand they're welcome to if not somebody else. Yeah, thank you Barbara I think it's a way of offering safety to each other to speak from, you know what, I trust that whatever they shared it really touched you and yet since it was in the small group. Okay, we'll respect that. And Wayne. I just want to share with people that maybe read about it or something but how in schools are having, especially public schools are having kind of been a crisis with the lack of support people and teachers and everything and substitutes. And I can see why it just it saddens me that, you know, I work in the, probably the wealthiest middle school in the district that I that I'm in and that I work in and, and I can see why safety is first because there's just so many. It's like a boiling pot where it just at any minute to could explode. Yeah, thank you way knowing that you're a teacher and you deal with a lot of kids. Yeah, safety being very important and also David on on YouTube said it is john Bowlby and the attachment theory. So yeah, safety definitely very important. Last reflection. I'm going to read it and then we'll close Carmen says this meditation definitely gave me a thought to think of what makes me feel safe and what doesn't. And breathing is definitely an anchor to help me find out. Beautiful. Breathing as an anchor to find out what makes you feel safe and what doesn't. Yeah, what an important note to end on and and similar to what violet brought in with awareness with safety being imbued with awareness with knowing. With sati. Lovely. Thank you all. Thank you for your practice profound. Yeah, profound shares practice may you all be safe, happy and well, may our practice serve us and the world. Thanks everyone.
