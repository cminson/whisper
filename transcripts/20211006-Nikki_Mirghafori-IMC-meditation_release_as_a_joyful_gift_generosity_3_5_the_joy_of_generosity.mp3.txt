 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Hello and greetings there, Sanja. It's lovely to be with you. In this moment in time and to practice together, even though we're separated in space, various time zones, different places in this world, and yet to feel the generosity of each other's presence supporting each other, supporting ourselves in this practice. So we've been exploring or inviting our minds swimming in this beautiful practice, in this liberative practice of generosity the past couple of days. And today we continue this exploration. And today we'll be opening up to the dimensions of joy, dimensions of joy, and generosity, delight, gladness, which Buddha talks about. And I trust and know that each of us have experienced. So we'll open to exploring joy and delight in our meditation, and then I'll speak more about it in the Dharma. So with that, let us get started. Let us land ourselves in our seat, in our cushion, wherever we are in the world, in this moment in time, feeling our presence, arriving, landing. And opening, opening our mind, opening our heart, the sensations of this body, first to get embodied, to land, to arrive on this earth, inviting our bodies. To relax, to soften, to give their weight to the earth. Our heart can be uplifted while our body is connected and deeply rooted. Our heart uplifted as if to the heavens. Our spine, the sense of integrity lifted up. And our muscles relaxed, soft. Both holding intention with the uprightness of the spine, the uplift, let's say the uplift of the spine, the heart, uplift. And the rootedness, groundedness of the body. As if we have wings, our hearts have wings this morning, this afternoon, evening. Our hearts have wings and our body has roots, well rooted, connected. And our breath connects the two. Our aspiration aspires, inspires us and helps us feel connected, rooted in each cell of the body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Each breath received, each breath received in its entirety, the beginning of the in-breath, middle and end of the in-breath, the out-breath, beginning, middle, and end of the out-breath. And as if we were tuning or allowing it to be tuned, turning our antenna to pick up waves that are already here, tuning into receiving the gifts of being here, sitting in this body with as much comfort as possible. There might be pain present, but there is enough health and cognition, the gift that we're here. Practicing together receiving, sharing Dharma. How we tune into the good fortune, just joy, the delight of, yes, I am here, practicing with Sangha and this moment on YouTube. Wow. How wild is that? How lovely. How delightful, hundreds of people around the world. I am one part of the Sangha. Feeling the interconnection, the hearts of so many beings right now, their smiles, their wholeheartedness, inspiring, inspiring yours with every breath, with every aspiration, tuning into the gift, receiving the gift graciously. The joy of being here, practicing breathing in this container, container as if we're sitting in this interconnected, joyous container. Breathing each breath, the entirety of each breath, one at a time. And know that joy, delight can transform after a while into peace, peacefulness. The other side of the coin of joy. So perhaps that becomes more present.ths And notice if and when you wake up and realize, that the mind is thinking, which does happen, will happen. Whether with the release, with the letting go of the thinking, the story, whether with the release, there can be a recognition of joy. Ah, ease, yes, letting go of this, oh yes, relinquishing. With a tinge of delight, gladness, yes, for the benefit of myself and others. I return to the body and the breath, the peace and ease, the joy of being here. Notice if with every letting go, every relinquishment, generously releasing every thought or story, there can be a delight. Oh yes, thank you, yes, lovely. And how that might transform your practice. Thank you. Thank you. As if you're putting every thought as you release it, as if you're putting it on the altar. Here, dear Buddha, hold it with me, for me. Here. A sense of generosity and giving away, not needed right now. Here, released, released, joyfully released. Offering the release, putting the release on the altar. As the gift. Thank you. And letting go the release, relinquishment of each thread of thought, the release as the gift, as our offering. Taking delight in each of these offerings. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Every time you release your relinquish thinking, entanglement, notice the joy, the lightness, the ease that comes from that release. That release, offered as if you're putting a flower on the altar as a gift. Here, offering your release, your letting go as a gift of your practice. And by heart feeling more joyous and lighter with each gift of letting go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The last moments of our practice. Offering our practice, the gift of our practice with generosity. A gift of service, a gift of service to support ourselves, support all beings everywhere in ways we can't fathom. May our practice, may our letting go, may our generosity be of service to ourselves, to others. May we all wake up together. May we all be free from suffering. May we all cultivate loving and being loved. Thank you for the gift of your practice. Thank you. Greetings. Greetings, sanga. Lovely to practice with you. And in this practice today, we tuned into, the invitation was to tune into the joy, the delight of release, letting go, which is one movement of generosity. And as an inner dimension, how generosity as an outer dimension of giving supports the inner dimension of practice is to consider every time we let go of entanglement of thinking or perhaps a, an entanglement. The times when it's useful to let go, there are times that it's helpful to be aware and be present with it. And there are times that it's just skillful to let go, to, to consider that letting go that relinquishment. The ease, the joy, the delight of that, instead of, oh, you were thinking you were entangled instead of the judgment really tuning into the delight, the beauty, the grace of this letting go and considering this letting go as a gift, as a gift of our practice, as a gift of generosity, that we put on the altar of humanity of the Buddha of ourselves of this practice. So in that way, making a gift out of every moment of release in our practice, making a gift out of that so really bringing the sense of generosity into our practice in every moment. So, so speaking of joy of generosity. The idea is, is not of course you know this already is not to be generous or let go from a moralistic stance of shooting, but, but to gladden and inspire the heart as a practice as an inner practice. And the Buddha, I love something that Buddha said and really impacted me actually early on in my practice when I saw this from on guitar and the kayak three 637. And the Buddha says, In this world, there are three things of value for one who gives. What are these things. Before giving the mind of the giver is happy. While giving the mind of the giver is made peaceful. After having given the mind of the giver is uplifted. When we are happy before so when we're considering giving a gift of generosity. Thoughtfully preparing, perhaps, or. And while you're giving it the delight that it gives you to be to be doing something for the benefit of someone else and this this this release this this act of service, giving can bring up joy and peacefulness as the Buddha says and then after having given the mind of the giver is uplifted. And this can happen for a long long time fact I appreciate receiving a couple of stories from some of you an email about stories of of generosity acts of kindness that still uplift your heart and. For example, for me, one story when brief story I want to share is, is. I love persimmons I love persimmons, the fruit of the fall, and in California and other places in the world. I was raised persimmons it's endemic to that area. I've ever tasted is the one I never ate, and the one I gave away, it still makes me happy to this day. I was at an airport about to board a plane and I have so many dietary restrictions so I have to really pack my food and I have got to persimmons from the farmers market, and I was eating one of them. When I was waiting to board the plane and and the lady came up and asked me Oh, where did you buy it in the airport and I said oh I got this from the farmers market, and she looked a little bit and then were and went and sat and I thought wait, you know I have to I have. I'm eating one this one, you know have another apple, I can, I can give this away so I went and gave it to her and said please have it it's already washed it's from the farmers market is organic enjoy and she said are you sure no please. Yes. So that was that and I was happy and she was happy and then later on the plane she was sitting a few rows behind me. And when I got up at some point, she said, you know, this is of course long and she said, you know, I grew up in Japan, and in our yard and there was a persimmon tree from my childhood, and I live on the east coast where there are no persimmons and. The way she was sharing how precious how important it was for her that persimmon to connect her with her with her parents grandparents, it moved me so much that to this day there's this uplift there is this delight there is this joy of the persimmon I never ever ate. I've eaten so many I forget their, their taste but that one still tastes delicious with joy and uplift, knowing how it, it supported this person. So, and who knows these acts of generosity that that we give we really don't know the impact. And this is just a tiny little story and and I trust I'm sure every single one of us, we have so many stories that uplift our hearts our minds when we think of them, and and inspire us to to to be generous as a practice as an inner practice. So, a couple of things I wanted to bring in as I promised, not that we need any scientific research or studies to support this important inner practice that we know is happy making and. And as we discussed yesterday is is supportive of release nirvana awakening is the same movement of the heart as we discussed yesterday. So, it turns out that couple. So, couple of studies one in 2008 was done and was repeated actually by others in 2017. The 2008 was studied by Harvard Business School Professor Michael Norton and colleagues, and the 2017 similar one was by by Park et al, which also brought in fMRI. So, they found that giving money to someone else lifted participants, the people who participated in the study. lifted their, their level of happiness more than spending the money on themselves, even though, even though before the study, the participants had predicted that spending the money on themselves would make them happier. But actually spending it on others made them happier when they actually went through the study so that also not only tells us that generosity makes us happier, but also that sometimes we're not a good estimator we cannot exactly predict what will make us happy and trust that generosity will make us happy and similar study by Sonia Leo, but mercy and university of California Riverside. Similar results when she asked people to perform five acts of kindness. Each week for six weeks the level of happiness went up. There's also a study of what's called study was 2006 by Jorge mole and colleagues that there is areas that are associated with pleasure and social connection and trust and what's called creating a warm glow effect. Actually, the warm glow effect and what's called the helipse high, which is associated with the release of endorphins producing positive feelings happen when we are generous so the Buddha was definitely onto something he was a neuroscientist in his own way he had studied the mind so clearly knowing that giving generosity brings brings happiness lights up the heart of the mind and, of course, scientists with their fMRI and all of that their, their studies they're confirming the same yes, it does make us happy generosity makes us happy. Another thing I wanted to bring in is also a couple more things one is studies about what's called targeted generosity. So being generous in general is wonderful. And specifically, there are some studies about when you know the person you are giving to you that the person you are supporting directly that targeted generosity. It also has some other aspects it increases the feeling of social connection and and heaven knows these days. COVID times we all need, we can all use increased sense of social connection to feel socially connected to one another. So targeted generosity when you know the giver directly supported help helping someone increases the sense of social connection. And also it turns out, it potentially has some health benefits reducing fear anxiety, and the amygdala activation of the brain. I thought that was interesting about targeted generosity specifically. And one of you had asked about the relationship between gratefulness gratitude and generosity in email that I received. And yes, absolutely, of course, and we know this first actually let's tune into our own heart before I talk about the research study. When we feel more grateful. When we have gratitude. We feel the abundance of our heart we feel so abundant we don't feel my really we feel we have so many resources we're grateful grateful for life for our bodies for our clothes for our roof over our head for food for all the good we turn to the good we see the abundance of our of our life and our heart instead of what's lacking. And that sense of gratitude not only makes us happier and heaven knows there's so many studies on gratitude making you happier and and and supporting well being and liberation to, of course. And also that that that abundant heart becomes more generous, of course, and the last thing I'll say is studies by Christina carns fMRI studies where he or she suggested that participants engage in writing a gratitude journal for three weeks. And then in the fMRI machine studied their the activities of their brains, and they derived, there was more delight more joy, more pleasure from giving. When people had engaged in gratitude so as she puts it, you can proactively choose to retrain your brain, so it gets more pleasure out of giving increasing neurotransmitters. So, and the way you proactively choose to retrain your brain. So it gets more pleasure out of giving is through the practice of gratitude. So, these are absolutely connected. So, I'd like to invite us, if you wish to for today. If you'd like to. So yesterday the invitation was to look for an opportunity to be generous in some way, your choice of course, and today. But looking for an opportunity to be generous and also observing before, during and after what is the state of your mind, noticing what the Buddha talks this delight this joy of generosity before the act of generosity, do during generosity, and after again it could be your resources, it could be your time, it could be your affection, your smile, calling a friend, anything. But notice, notice what happens in your heart and mind. And we will continue tomorrow. Thank you for the generosity of your practice and your presence. May you be well and free. See you tomorrow, or feel you tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
