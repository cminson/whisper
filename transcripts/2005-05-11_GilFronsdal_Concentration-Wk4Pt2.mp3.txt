 Now, there are categories or different levels of these jhanas, and in the Buddhist tradition they enumerate eight. Sometimes they have nine, but for our purposes we talk about eight. And now different teachers of jhana, of these absorptions, have different criteria for what constitutes a jhana, what qualifies. So if you read different books about this topic, you'll find different teachers have different ideas about it. Some people, it's not really fair to judge different people, but some people, a friend of mine, kind of evaluated different teachers of jhana, and he says, well, this teacher, he has jhana light. What qualifies for him as a jhana is really light, and he allows the student, the practitioner, to still have some thinking going on in that state. And then, and this teacher here, he's jhana heavy. And not only is there no thinking, but there's no self-awareness. You don't even know, you don't even realize what happened until you come out of the state. And so it's that power for you, so absorbed that you kind of, in a sense, lost, you're really present, but you're not exactly aware of what's going on. So when you come out, then you can review what happened and you realize what was going on. So there are different teachings, different ideas of what it is. Probably my theory is that, because I haven't studied with all these teachers, they don't know what their story is, but my kind of theory these days is that each of these eight jhanas can be experienced in different levels of intensity. And so some people are experiencing it at the mild intensity, some at a strong intensity, but it still involves the same qualitative shift. So there are eight jhanas, eight absorptions. Some teachers will refuse to talk to their students about them. Students will say, have I reached the first jhana yet? And then the second or third? And there's someone wrote an article recently called Jhana Without Numbers. And there's some, sometimes rather unfortunate things that happen about jhanas and ambition and measuring where am I and I'm at this level and where are you and I'm better than you. And all this neurosis around anxiety around jhanas and all that. Some teachers don't talk about it at all, but rather what they focus on is paying attention to what are the mental factors that come into play as a person gets concentrated and then beginning to help the student work with those factors so the concentration gets deeper and deeper without putting it into some measurements, some categories for a second or third absorption. But what the principle behind going deeper and deeper into these states of absorption is going from coarser mental activity to more refined. And so as we go deeper, what we learn to do is to let go of coarser and coarser, but relatively coarser mental activity until the mind gets more and more refined, more still, more rarefied. And it's amazing the rarefied states that can arise, that can occur. So at the first absorption, there are five factors which are present, that are important, that are recognized, and these are the five that we focused on in access concentration. So it's the initial and sustained application of attention, joy, happiness, and one-pointedness. Of those five, the coarsest is the initial and the sustained application of attention, which takes intention, takes directing the mind to doing what you do. So in order to go from the first to the second, that doingness of the mind has to fall away. And it's kind of relaxed. There are various ways, different teachers have different systems of how to get a person to go from one to the other, but kind of relax that course, I mean not that course, but the relatively course, that's the courses thing, you relax it. And then it will open up into the second. And that's characterized by the presence of, for now we can just say, the other three. And in particular, joy seems to be really strong. And so it's characterized by a lot of joy. And some teachers will actually encourage at this point the student to cultivate and strengthen that joy, and really pervade it through the body, kind of just kind of like work it through the body, and expand it, and grow it, and intensify the joy. And this is where the joy can reach levels of rapture, from a phenomenal rapture that can happen. It's better than any kind of rapturous kind of experience that you could have in non-meditative life. Some people don't have peaks of rapture in this, some people it's much more kind of mild, but there's this kind of joy that's part of it. The tradition lists five different kinds of joy that can happen. I don't know if I remember all of them right now, but there's momentary joy, just kind of like there's cascading joy, there's kind of flashes of joy, these kinds of flashes, sometimes flashes all over the body. There is, you know, pervading joy, and there's different kinds of joy. It's wonderful, like Eskimos have all these words for snow supposedly, the Buddhists have all these words for joy. And this cascading joy, I remember once I was going through very deep states of concentration like this, and had a lot of this joy coming up, and the sitting ended, it was time to go have lunch, and I went to the dining hall that got my food, and managed to get my food, because sometimes when you're, some people when they go into these deep states of altered states, the sense of being altered stays with them after they come out. Some people seem to pop out pretty easily, but some people stay in it. So I was kind of in it, you know, I managed to get my food and sit down, and then the act of being focused on picking the fork of food up into my mouth, you know, it takes some concentration, right, to do that. And so somehow my, seemingly my system kind of locked back into the concentrated state, and I'd have these waves of joy just washed through my body, and it was so intense I had to put the fork down. And I sat there in dining room for a long time without being able to eat, because this is, you know, just, you know, so it gives you maybe a little bit of sense of, you know, what can happen. And some people get frightened by this, they never had something so powerful, you know, what's this going on? Sometimes the symptoms of this rapture, this joy, the Pali word is piti, which is P-I-T-I, and sometimes has some physical symptoms in the body, which are not, people normally wouldn't identify with joy or rapture. And it's a little bit strange when you go to a teacher and they say, you say these things are happening, my body, and they say, oh, that's good, you're having joy, you're having, what? And so that might happen to you maybe sometime in here. Sometimes it can be shaking in the body, sometimes there can be jerking in the body. I mean, I didn't want to tell you because it's not so usual, and if I tell you, then you get frightened and think, you know, this is supposed to happen or whatever, but I tell you, when I, one of the retreats I sat in Thailand, there was a nice teacher there I sat with for a month, but he had a little bit, he had a little bit strange in the way he was, guided me. And I showed up there, I was a, he introduced himself myself as a Zen priest. I've been in Japan, I had my Zen robes, and so I guess he had a lot of hope for my ability to get concentrated. I said, good, a live one here, you know, he's going to, and so I had to go, I had this little hut, and I sat alone day after day, but every day I had an interview with him, and so interviews went along fine for a while, and after a while he started saying things like, are you shaking yet? Are you bouncing around yet? I said, no, nothing's happening, you know, I don't have any specialty report, and finally, oh, you know, just a few weeks ago there was this Brazilian woman here, and she was just bouncing off the wall, you know, as if, you know, there's symptoms of the rapture. Some people, when they have a strong rapture, have to feel as if their body is floating, like, just gets really light and comes like lifting. Maybe that's where some of the stories are, people kind of saying they can fly when they meditate, just a few times, it kind of seems to lift. If you open your eyes, maybe you've, so one of the, one of, so some teachers when they want people to work with, you know, second John, and with a lot of joy, when you really get, again, not to go through it too quickly, but stay there, stabilizing it, get used to it, until such a point when you begin thinking, realizing that this joy is a drag. Can you imagine that? No, this is a drag. It's like too much, it's like the whole energy happening all the time. It's like always being kind of wired or kind of, you know, kind of feeling really good, and it's kind of like, you know, if you, you always have a smile on your face, if you, you know, I've smiled so much that I got tired, you know, nothing to smiling, please, you know, you get so tired smiling. So, so like in some social situations where, you know, you smile, smile, smile, it's all, and so it's kind of like it's too much after a while, and so that, that, when you're feeling that's too much, then some of the enchantment, some of the attachment, some of the, you know, that, where that joy begins to fade, and then at some point the person lets go of the joy, and then what's, what's left is, is the happiness, and the happiness is much more sublime, much more satisfying than the joy, and, you know, it's much, much better. Now, there's a kind of progression that happens, you know, that's going on here, and I once in one retreat tried to bypass that progression, because I thought the joy was kind of getting kind of old, I knew it was kind of like, you know, kind of, you know, relative, right? It was kind of like more near the surface, it's kind of not so deep, so I could feel the joy was going to start happening. I don't want anything to do with this, I just want to, I want to go for the deeper stuff, so I kind of held the joy at bay, can you believe it? You know, I'm not going to have this joy, you know, no thanks, and I remember I was doing walking meditation, and this was going on, and I was just kind of keeping it down, and after a while I started getting a headache, and so I finally said, this is ridiculous, I said, okay, because I just let it happen, so the joy happened, kind of, as soon as I let it happen, I just, and then as soon as I let it happen, it passed really quickly too, and I dropped into deeper states. I didn't need to, you know, it was all this time spent repressing my joy, you know, it was just a waste of time. So, so, so this progression goes on, and then at some point you can stabilize the happiness, and at some point you're trained to let go of the happiness. What? Isn't that the whole point? But there's something better than happiness, and that is a state, the fourth absorption, a state of equanimity, profound equanimity, and where there's no, there's very little or no pain in the jhanas, but in the fourth jhanas, there's none at all, there's tremendous equanimity, there's tremendous balance, sometimes, some people, the sense of the body disappears, you kind of, your eyes are closed, you can't, you know, your eyes close, you kind of try to look around or feel around to see if you still have a body, and you can't, you know, there's no evidence you have a body anymore, you know, what happens to your body? I mean, you can open your eyes, it's still right there, right? It hasn't gone anywhere, but, but empirically, the way you're kind of sitting there, you just can't identify a body. Sometimes at this, if it hasn't done happen earlier, so at this point, sometimes the breath seems to stop or has stopped, and you don't even notice your breathing, maybe there's no breath happening at all. And so, and it's tremendous sense of peace, of coolness, of equanimity. And you might have to take my word on it, but it's much more satisfying than the happiness that you had just let go of. So it's pretty great. Some teachers who are into this kind of stuff will stop at that point, that's enough. You get to the fourth jhana, that's more than you need, this is fine. Now let's get, now let's do the real work. You know, this is just kind of, this is just kind of warming up. Now let's start doing the mindfulness work. Let's switch over to Vipassana. And that'll talk about next week, it'll be about how the concentration practice is integrated with Vipassana practice. Some teachers will have the students go continue and go further into what's called, so these first four have a, as a group of four, are called the rupa jhana. And rupa means form. But for this purpose, it might be better, well, I just say it, you know, you can forget it if you want. Here, rupa might be better translated as concept. It's meditations of conceptual meditation in a certain way. Then you go into the rupa or formless jhanas or conceptless jhanas, in a sense. I'm not sure, I'm a little bit, but anyway, the next four, five, six, seven, eight, are called the rupa jhana, the formless jhanas. And here, it's partly formless because there's no body, there's no form, there's no objects anymore that you can identify. And the first one is infinite space. So you're sitting there and your body disappears. And when your body disappears, what's left? Space. So you let go of the equanimity and you let your attention get filled or sink into or disappear into the sense of just in space that's left. And you become more of infinite space. It's pretty far out. It's kind of like acid, you know, just like, wow, this is far out. But it's legal. So far. And then, but then, in order to know that there's infinite space, there has to be consciousness. So then you let go of the sense or the experience of space and tune into consciousness and how consciousness feels like it's infinite then. What's left then is infinite consciousness, boundless consciousness. And you've heard sometimes in spiritual, some spiritual traditions, you talk about having cosmic consciousness or infinite consciousness. And I don't know what those people are talking about, but Buddhists will often say, oh, what they're doing is they're falling into this seventh jhana of this infinite consciousness. And it feels so far out. A lot of these stages of the jhanas, sometimes people will come and say, is this enlightenment? Or they're convinced, I got, I'm enlightened because it's so, you know, it's so compelling and so different from ordinary life. So then there's this infinite consciousness. And then from infinite consciousness, if you let go of consciousness, I mean, first you had space, right? And you let go of space. So the consciousness is the new, the space is left, right? But if consciousness, if you take away consciousness, what's left? What's left? Kelly? Well, what do we say? Nothing, right? So nothing is left. So then is a state of nothingness. So there's nothing to do. You can't talk about space because space is kind of like a thing or consciousness is nothingness. Now what happens if you let go of that? So the mind is getting more and more refined, more and more simple. In a sense, you can say there's less and less activity going on in the mind. And so a lot of things we normally take as being natural or just inherent part of the mind are actually involved functioning of the mind. For example, time or in space. So a sense of time kind of pretty much disappears in these states of absorptions. The sense of space, spatial sense disappears because it's an activity of the mind that creates time and space. So what happens when there's no that activity? Time and space disappears. Isn't that far out? And so when you let go of nothingness, then there's a state called neither perception nor non-perception. Because you can't say there's perception there, but you can't say there is no perception there. You can't see, kind of like can't quite say what it is, but it's you know the mind's gotten very very simple. Now you might be asking what in the world is this about and why should Buddhists want to do this? And it's so different from ordinary life. One is because like Hillary said, Sir Edmund Hillary, because it's there. Another is that there are benefits from these states of concentration, especially the first four are very very healing. They're phenomenally healing states. And if you can access to them, it's kind of like you're accessing, you're kind of separating yourself from the world of suffering, of pain, of illness and sickness, and into a state of tremendous sense of well-being. And you can sometimes almost feel the healing and the goodness kind of moving through the body in some of these states of concentration. But the Buddhist reason for it, it also it's it's it starts to recondition the mind. Most of most of our human minds are conditioned phenomena for the most part. We have certain kind of stimulus and we develop certain conditions in response to it. If every human being you meet for the next year yells at you, and then a year from now you walk down the street and you meet a new person, you're probably going to brace yourself to be yelled at again because you've been conditioned by all those thousands of people during the first year. But maybe that person is going to whisper, right? So you don't know what's going to happen, but the mind is conditioned in some way. And so we condition ourselves in all kinds of ways. Some of us are very unfortunate and it's really amazing to begin discovering how much, how we see ourselves, how we see the world around us, our perceptions of things, our values or attitudes, our conditioned phenomena, and not inherent in the natural part of the whole system. And some of that conditioning is very unfortunate. We have a tremendous feeling of neurosis and anxiety and psychosis and feeling this lack of self-worth and feeling of self-criticism, self-hate. A lot of unfortunate things can be conditioned in our mind. As we get into these states of absorption, the suffering of these psychological states is replaced by a tremendous sense of well-being. And that well-being is like you're being bathed in goodness. And it reconditions, it re-educates the mind, re-educates the kind of the cells, the cellular level, they say sometimes. And it's very helpful for some people to have that re-education process and to realize, to get a sense of themselves, a perception of themselves as having capacity of having all this goodness and joy. And it begins to kind of loosen up the grip of the old identities of what we have, who we think we are. And the final thing, the reason for these deep states of concentration, is so that the mind is stable enough, clear enough, focused enough, and simple enough that it can identify the most subtle or the most tenacious core places of clinging in the psyche. Somehow they address those. And it's one thing to address our clinging to the clothes we wear. That's kind of relatively easy, right? But there are deep, deep clinging in the psyche that's usually not known by the mind at street level, street consciousness, how we walk around, that is really only accessible when the mind is really concentrated. And so this deep concentration gives us both the stability to see it and gives us a sense of well-being. So when we look at this part of us, look at the clinging and letting go of it, we're doing that from a position of feeling good, feeling delight, and seeing something beautiful. If you see the depths of clinging and the need to let go of it, but you're feeling really afraid in general in your life, you might feel really afraid to let go then. So it's a really wonderful system where it brings you up to the edges of the deepest clinging, but you have this sense of well-being all around it as you do that. And then it gives you access to these deep states of clinging, and then the opportunity might arise to let go. And now it's possible to let go at the deepest levels without doing these absorption stuff. It's very deep absorptions. Some teachers don't really care if you get absorbed or not, or don't even teach you to do that. Some teachers occasionally tell you to avoid doing that, and just focus directly on doing the vipassana work. Some teachers will say, no, you should before you're doing vipassana, you should do this absorption work, get that under your belt first. There are different theories, and different theories are useful for different people. It's not like one shoe fits all. There are different minds. Some people have really good concentration minds, some people have really good mindfulness minds. So it depends on what's suited for each temperament and each kind of person. I wanted to give you an image for each of the first four jhanas that's used in the ancient discourses of the Buddha. The first jhana is like having a soap powder. In the ancient world they had soap powder like we have flour. Or to make soap, they would moisten it and knead it until it got equally moist throughout. You got this workable, pliable, kneadable ball of soap. It's kind of like we're making bread dough. Again, just the right amount of moisture in there knead it, and if it's pliable and workable. So first you're kind of saturating the mind with moisture. So the mind is pliable and workable, soft, luminous. The second jhana is like with this joy that arises, is like the mind is like a clear mountain lake or pond that has no water coming in from the surface, like no river's going into it. But it's fed from the inside, from the bottom of the pond by this cool refreshing spring that the water's flowing up and it's fusing through the pond, through the lake. So it's this inner kind of suffusion, inner kind of movement of refreshment. And the fourth jhana is the same lake, but here the mind is like into a lotus pond which is floating on top, has roots going down into the refreshing refreshment of the pond, but it's kind of a little bit above it all, kind of floating peacefully on top. It's not in the currents. And then the fourth jhana, the equanimity part, that's where the image of being wrapped in a soft cotton blanket. It's like a kind of soft, white, clean, pure cotton blanket. It's kind of enveloped in that. It's very soft, it's very nourishing, it's very comforting, it's very present. And there's also in the being wrapped, there's no stimulus coming in from the environment around. Nothing's coming in, pinching in us. We're not aware of sounds so much, or sounds, or smells, or things outside, because we're kind of contained in this very peaceful and quantum estate. Some people fall into these jhanas seemingly accidentally. They're sitting, they're minding their own business, and what happened? Who was that? And then they pop out. Some people are a little bit frightened by this because they're so different. Some people are delighted. Some people get really attached to it. And some teachers say, oh, you have to be very careful with the jhanas because you can get really attached and get in trouble. I've known people who've gotten seemingly stuck in them. And some people say, teachers say, there's never really a problem. You can get temporarily attached. That's a good attachment because you have this really good thing going. And then as you continue practicing, you'll work through the attachment. You'll self-correct with time. So for most people, these absorptions are not something you can just sit down and sit half an hour a day and expect that in a few weeks, one, two, three, four, five days. There are a couple of people who have tremendous capacity for concentration who can do it very easily. But those are very rare person. I think a regular person, usually it takes a lot of dedication, a lot of effort. Usually something happens on retreats. You go on long retreats, and that's where these deeper stages might begin happening. Some people will go on jhana retreats, specific retreats that are meant to help in concentration. Some people who develop a daily sitting practice on a very consistent basis, day after day after day, and sit long enough, maybe an hour each day or day after day, sometimes maybe after many, many years, their mind is stable enough and concentrate and has the abilities there. So maybe they can be touching into some of these jhanas. Some people will develop their capacity to get concentrated in deep way on retreats. And then once they learn it there, then it becomes easier to do it in daily life. So maybe more accessible, the door has been opened, you know the route, so then you can do it more easily afterwards. So the last thing I'll say is for the purposes of liberation, for the purposes of mindfulness and vipassana, it's not essential to go into these deep states. But one of the principles that some of these five factors come into play as you get concentrated can be applied and used for developing concentration well before getting into the jhanas. So one of the things to do is, if you want to develop concentration, is to try to cultivate or develop or arouse or evoke or tune into feelings of well-being, of joy. And then let that joy grow as part of the effort of being concentrated. You're encouraged to feel joy when you're trying to develop concentration. It's not always easy, but it might take a long time. But at some point when you start feeling some inkling of sense of well-being or delight and joy that might be associated with the concentration, let it be your cheerleader, your cheerleader that's cheering you on, encouraging you on. This is great. Keep going. I'm kind of like a biofeedback system. I'll stay focused on the breath and keep using the breath, keep working the breath to see if I can let this joy grow. As the joy grows, it's incentive to stay focused on the breath. Does that make sense? Today, I didn't give you any chance to ask questions. I hope that was okay. It was a lot to offer. I hope no one's confused or discouraged. But I wanted to lay it all out so you'd know what that's about. And next week, we'll talk about the integration, a few other things, but it's the integration of this concentration emphasis with the Bipassa Network. Thank you.
