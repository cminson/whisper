Settling into your body, into your experience here and now. 
Allowing the body to relax. 
Maybe scanning through the body and checking in if there are areas of tension, just taking some time with relaxation at the beginning. 
In particular, head and face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands. 
Chest and upper back, stomach and intestines. 
The inner landscape a little bit also. 
Abdomen, middle and lower back, hips, legs and feet. 
Maybe the inside of the throat and heart can soften. 
Maybe the mind can relax. 
Maybe the body relax. 
Opening to the recognition of awareness. 
We've been practicing awareness with relaxation. 
Can you just simply attune to yes, awareness, aware. 
Am I aware? That is obvious. 
Body sensation, sound, emotions, moods, thoughts. 
Seeing if there can be a settling back and receiving rather than aiming or looking for experience. 
Can there be a willingness to settle back and see what wants to come to you? What is already known right now in this moment? What's this? And now, what's obvious, this opening to receptivity requires a flexibility of mind to keep receiving, to recognize that the attention shifts from one thing to another. 
Are you aware and what's obvious? When we relax, the mind can simply do its job of being aware and recognizing experience. 
Are you aware? That is obvious. 
I am aware. 
Excitement. 
In this moment after moment, a gentle reminding yourself to be aware. 
Touch, of course, the mind will wander, we get pulled into thought. 
There will be a moment when mindfulness returns, awareness returns, and you'll be aware again. 
Can that be the curiosity the mind attends to? What is it like to be aware again? Oh, awareness is back. 
What's that like? I'm taking a moment to check in. 
How has the wandering shaped the experience? Whatever the mind has been doing, that is a condition that shapes what's happening now. 
So how are you now? When the mind returns that question, what is it like to be aware? And how am I now? What's here now? Just opening and being curious about that. 
Sometimes I say that whatever the mind has shaped, it's like we can end up like we're on a completely new planet. 
Our minds shape whole different worlds. 
And so in the return of awareness, recognizing awareness, and what planet am I on? Am I on planet agitation or planet calm? Are you aware? What is obvious? Are you aware? Are you aware? Are you aware? Are you aware? From time to time, check how you are in relation to experience. 
What's the attitude? You could just drop that question in. 
What's the attitude or how am I? How is the mind in relationship? Be open to recognizing something happening that we might not have been aware of before. 
Sometimes it can be useful to check the various categories. 
Do I want something to happen? Do I want something to stop happening? Is there some idea about what should be happening? Or maybe it's okay. 
It's just okay. 
Maybe there's calm or ease or peace in relationship to what's happening. 
It's useful to notice when that's the case. 
Relax. 
Are you aware? Receiving whatever is obvious. 
Continuing each moment a gentle connection reminding yourself to be aware.
