The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, hello again, hello again everyone.
So, for today's practice, we're continuing with exploring the significance of the instructions in the refrain of the Satipattana Sukta.
And in the guided meditation, I brought some invitations to practice with arising and passing away of different phenomena.
The refrain, actually, just to remind us, just as a reminder, I will put up again the structure and the structure of the Satipattana.
There are four sections, just as a reminder, from the bottom there is body, feelings, or feeling tone, which you've already studied with Gil the past few weeks.
There is mind and there is Dhammas.
And the refrain shows up between or after every teaching, after every teaching, as an emphasis.
And as I discussed yesterday and on Monday, the significance of the refrain.
And you can listen to that again, if you wish.
By the way, this drawing, this is from Bikhanalya's book, and I have this uploaded into audiodharma.
If you want to look at it, it's associated with the talks from these mornings.
And also the refrain itself, the paragraph of the refrain, I have it included in the text of the YouTube.
If you go back to YouTube, you'll see the text of the refrain.
So today we have come to this part of the refrain, which is one abides contemplating the nature of arising in the body, or one abides contemplating the nature of passing away in the body, or one abides contemplating the nature of both arising and passing away in the body.
And again, the word body here repeats after the six sections having to do with the body.
The word is feelings for the section after the feeling section, and of course, mind and Dhammas.
So it's not always the body changes.
So one contemplates the nature of arising and passing away of all phenomena, all phenomena.
And in the guided meditation, I was inviting you to explore arising and passing of sensations in the body.
And also sounds is part of the experience of the body too.
It's in that sphere, it's in the sense sphere, the first Satipatana.
I also invited you to explore feeling tone, which you've already explored with Gail, feeling tone, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral.
Oh yes, it arises and passes away.
Maybe we didn't focus on that, I just brought it in.
And even thoughts, you can see, gosh, it just arises and passes away.
It's a stream, it's a stream of experience, like a waterfall of experience, waterfall of experience.
So I'd like to speak a few minutes about the importance of this instruction.
Even perhaps maybe I would venture to say even more important than the one we discussed yesterday, which already seemed, wow, this is important.
The internal, external aspects of just being internal.
So here we go.
So according to the discourses, not seeing the arising and passing away of phenomena is simply ignorance.
While regarding all phenomena as impermanent is knowledge and understanding is wisdom.
So the one definition of wisdom is seeing arising and passing away.
Seeing arising and passing away, as well as seeing arising and passing away, which is impermanent on nature, which also seeing on nature leads to seeing dukkha, unsatisfactoriness,
and also seeing the nature of the selfless nature, impersonal nature of all things. They're all connected.
And in fact, in the suttas, there is a central importance placed on the direct experience of seeing the impermanence of all phenomena, all phenomena.
It is so important, so central importance. And as some of you might be new for you, some of you know the teachings, have heard of the teachings on the three characteristics,
on nicha dukkha, anatta, impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not self or selflessness or ungovernability, so many ways to translate that. It's not no self, by the way.
It doesn't mean that there is no self. Yes, there is a self. It's not self. It's not personal.
So coming back to the refrain, studying, observing, knowing, contemplating, one abides contemplating the nature of arising.
One abides contemplating the nature of passing, one abides contemplating the nature of both arising and passing.
This contemplation, one gets to see experience impermanence. Ah, it's a river of experience. It's just passing. It's passing.
And what is impermanent cannot be satisfactory because it just changes all the time. You can't hang your hat on it.
It's like it's satisfactory one moment. It's pleasant one moment. It's not pleasant another moment. It keeps changing. It's unsatisfactory.
It just doesn't give me lasting satisfaction. And whatever it does give lasting satisfaction, what is unsatisfactory also appreciating the selfless nature.
It's not personal. It's not personal. So impermanence really is the foundation for realizing dukkha and anatha for the other two, the other two marks of existence.
The three are called the three marks of existence. And the insight into arising and passing away is the key aspect of insight, insight,
knowledge that opens up the four stages of awakening. Again, some of you might have heard about the four stages of awakening, the four stages of nibbana,
the unfolding of those four stages, the progress of insight, what's called progressing through those stages of awakening, what unleashes this progress, what is significant,
what is really significant is insight into impermanence. That unleashes all the other key insights.
And in fact, in the Vibhanga Sutta, in the Samyutta Nikhaya, insight into arising and passing away of phenomena is highlighted as the distinction between a mere establishment of Satipatana and its complete and full development,
Bhavana. Let me say that again. That this point is so important that I want to say it again. So in the Vibhanga Sutta of Samyutta Nikhaya, they make a distinction between just establishing Satipatana and its complete and full development,
Bhavana. So the difference is establishing the four foundations of mindfulness, four foundations of awareness. Establishing is becoming aware of the phenomena itself, the feeling tones, the sensations, the breath, just knowing them.
But what leads to the full development, complete and full development, which is Bhavana, Bhavana, is this insight into arising and passing away of phenomena.
So it's not just phenomena itself studying the phenomena itself, but studying that arises and passes away. That leads to the full development. That leads to awakening. That piece is needed.
So that this highlights even further the importance of the refrain that the teachings of the Satipatana Sutta may not suffice on their own, might not suffice on their own for the task of developing penetrative insight,
but actually developing a comprehensive and equanimous vision of impermanence is needed. Quoting also from Biko Analu here, but for us to really appreciate seeing arising and passing away is so important, is so important.
So a couple more words and wrapping up. It is said that when the Buddha gave the first sermon to the five monks who became fully enlightened in the Anattala Kana Sutta,
he took them through the same door, through the five aggregates, which you'll actually study in a few weeks and it's in the fourth Satipatana.
The five aggregates of existence, which really cover all aspects, all aspects of existence.
So the Buddha invited them to see the arising and passing away of all aspects of the five aggregates of experience, five aggregates of experience.
After they saw impermanence, then they saw that, oh, what's impermanent cannot yield to lasting satisfaction and therefore does not qualify as I, me, or myself, and they became fully enlightened through this doorway.
So, and this seeing the impermanence of the five aggregates is so important that, by the way, when you get, again, in a few weeks, when you get to the aggregates in the Satipatana Sutta as Gil covers it,
you'll notice that the arising and passing away to see the arising and passing away isn't just in the refrain, but it's also in the text of the Satipatana Sutta itself. It shows up in both places.
It's pretty cool. So watch out for that when that comes.
Fascinating.
So, so just the last word to say that through this insight into impermanence, we lose this assumption of stability, temporal stability of both the perceiver, which is the perceiver of us, and the perceived objects, internal, external.
There is no permanence. It's always shifting and moving.
And in this way, all notions of stability in a way, stability or fixedness, fixedness, like I'm this way, I'm always this way, like, oh, the world is always, it just, they vanish.
And one experience is a radical paradigm shift when you see it in every aspect of phenomena, no leaf left unturned, no stone left unturned.
And a distinctive feature of stream entry, which is the first stage of enlightenment is this comprehensive realization of impermanence.
Let me say that one more time.
A distinctive feature of stream entry is this comprehensive realization of impermanence.
So cannot highlight the importance of this part of the refrain strongly enough.
These teachings are so sublime, so beautiful, and so freeing, and they can completely change our frame of reference, completely change our frame of reference and lead to freedom.
It's not just stories that are told for reserved for some special beings. This can happen to us in this very life.
It can happen to us. So trust, trust in your practice.
Thank you, dear Sangha. Thank you for your practice and thank you for your kind, kind attention.
I look forward to being with you tomorrow to continue this exploration with Satipatana.
Oh, one invitation. I always like to give you invitations for the day. Notice arising and passing. Notice arising and passing internally, externally.
Notice arising and passing of all phenomena, thoughts, preoccupations, sensations, sounds.
Just notice arising and passing internally, and you'll see this perceiver and the perceived is the sea of experience.
Okay, thank you so much.
