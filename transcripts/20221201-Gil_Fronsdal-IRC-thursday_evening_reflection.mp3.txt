 As we come to the end of this meditation, as part of it, I'd like to offer you a metaphor, an image. If you're in a large house, and it's cold, cold winter day, all the rooms are cold, and you have a little heater, electric heater to plug in, in the room, right in the middle of the house, then that heater will slowly, slowly warm up that room, and from that room it'll then eventually spread out to the rooms around the middle room, and slowly spread through the house, warming up the whole house. So in the same way, you have deep inside a little heater for love, and if you plug it in and let it be warm, the warmth will begin to spread outwards into the first room first, which coincidentally happens to be you. And if you spread the warmth and the love and the care outward from some center inside, outwards throughout your body, your arms, your legs, your heads, everywhere gets touched by your love, by your warm heartedness, and when it's warm enough there, then it can spread beyond you to the next room, the people around you. And then from the people around you to all the people here in this room, and all the people in this building, be all the people in this county, and so if you're warm, if you keep it plugged in, keep it turned on, and you have enough time, your love will reach out really far. But it always begins with warming yourself, and you have more to radiate outwards into the world. And the wonderful thing about this kind of metaphor is all you have to do is turn the heat on and it'll warm you up. You don't have to even like yourself. Just turn the heat on, and it'll spread, the love will spread and include you regardless. It's the nature of love. So may it be, maybe as you go to bed tonight, that you're laying in bed, that you remember that little heater you have inside, and may you turn it on. May your care, love, tenderness, gentleness, kindness, goodwill, warm heartedness, may you fall asleep with it gently spreading through your body, comforting you as you lay there falling asleep, but just leave it on overnight, so that maybe when you wake up in the morning, you'll be warm enough so it radiates from you out into the world tomorrow. May we all be touched by each other's love. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
