The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good evening.
Nice to be here again. Nice to see some familiar faces as well.
It's always really a pleasure to come
to IMC and to be invited.
Whenever I come to teach here, Gil has invited me personally,
and that's really an honor. I was thinking about how Jack
Cornfield doesn't call me up to come to Spirit Rock, so I do teach
there, but they just have a regular scheduling person, so it's nice
to have the top man contact you and bless you and all that.
I wanted to mention, and I think one of the reasons that Gil
invited me to come this week is because I'll be teaching or co-teaching
a day-long retreat on July 31st, which is a Saturday,
obviously the last day of the month, and it's on Buddhism
in the 12 steps, and I'm co-teaching with Stephanie Tate,
who leads a group in San Jose, a Dharma and recovery group.
We are going to be working particularly with the
Brahma Viharas, the loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy,
anonymity, and talking about them, kind of their healing qualities
in relation to recovery from addictions, the range of addictions.
I also will say that I brought a few of my books.
This is my new one. I put them over there by the free books,
not to be confused with the free books, if you must.
That's your choice if you want to take one, but there's a little envelope
that you can slip in money or checks or your first born or whatever
you think is appropriate.
Actually, this is all the prelude, sorry.
The subtitle of the book actually changed, I guess, since that bio.
The book is called A Burning Desire, Dharma God and the Path of Recovery.
There's no comma between Dharma and God, which has been a disturbance
to several Buddhists.
But I'm not going to get in so much to the recovery topic tonight,
partly because this group didn't come for that necessarily,
although it does tend to slip into my talks, whether I like it or not.
But I'd like to talk tonight about stories
and how they relate to practice and how they don't relate to practice
and how they relate to the tradition.
It's common to come into an interview with the teacher
and start to talk about yourself and have them kind of ask you not to...
It's kind of the let go of your story. We're often told this in Buddhist circles.
And I think that's a wise guidance, and yet it's not so easy to do, certainly.
So first I want to kind of talk about what I think stories are,
just so that we understand what I'm talking about.
And anybody who's written fiction at all sort of knows this,
that stories are really selective events that we choose to put together
and claim that there is a causal relationship between the arising of each event,
one after the other.
So if you're in a movie or a novel, a lot is left out.
You don't see people sleeping for eight hours,
and you don't see them going to the bathroom, grocery shopping.
All the things that we do in our daily lives, we leave out most of it in stories,
because it's just not that interesting, all that stuff.
But we love stories, and they're really important to human beings.
Obviously, as far back as we know, his story, as opposed to his story, which we won't even go there,
but even our record of human past is a story very selective,
and obviously we've seen how revisionist historians can show us a completely different version
of what we thought was the story.
I've just been reading Mayflower and the story of the Settleman at Plymouth.
When you get the real story or this other version of it, it's horrific.
This thing that we grew up thinking was like this wonderful little jolly thing,
and oh, they came on Thanksgiving and brought it peanut-nut cups or something.
And you'll find out about these horrible wars and battles and violence and racism.
You sort of wish you didn't know.
In our personal lives, of course, stories have a tremendous role as well,
and this is where we really confront them in practice.
You sit down to meditate, and the teacher says, follow your breath,
and you try to figure out what that means, and then you sort of figure out what that means.
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling the air here.
Yeah, good.
So, you know, when I should go to the, and you're gone, and the story goes off.
And then, oh, right, I was supposed to be following my breath, come back to the breath,
and then again, the story goes off.
So what are these stories that take us away from our practice?
Well, again, they are sort of selective collections of events, to some extent,
which we choose to, and I need to expand that definition of story,
to say that we choose to give meaning to this selection of events.
And particularly, in our own story, we give it meaning.
It tells us something about us, gives us information.
And when we, I would say, if we have not explored stories,
if we just accept them, we also believe them to be true.
We believe our own story to be true.
Now, this story that arises in my mind, here on Monday night at IMC,
has been a long time in being shaped.
It has its roots in childhood relationships.
It has connections to my genetics, my DNA.
It, of course, is intimately related to memory.
It also is connected to what we could call personality or the kind of
tonal quality of our personality, whether we inclined toward the positive or the negative.
So that something arises in the mind,
and it has a great deal of evidence behind it as far as we're concerned,
which is why we believe it.
It is, it feels true because it resonates with something emotional,
some emotional history that's been repeated over and over.
It seems true because you have an image in your mind very often of an experience
or a series of experiences, and very often the experiences eventually disappear
from the fact of the meaning of the story becomes actually the whole story for us,
becomes the thing that we carry with us.
And when we go into therapy, for instance, we go back and start unraveling
how some of these facts came to be, how they came together.
I recall when I was 18 or 19, I was playing the guitar,
and by then I was a fairly good guitarist.
I've been playing since I was 12 and really probably playing virtually every day
over those years.
And I remember saying to someone something that I had believed for a long time.
I said to them, you know, and I'm sitting there,
finger picking some, you know, blues lick, fairly complex thing.
I don't have much manual dexterity.
And they looked at me and said, what are you talking about?
Look at how you can play the guitar.
Think about how much manual dexterity that has.
Well, I had this memory, and I don't even know now if it's a memory
or if it's just a dream of having been told by my father when I was five years old
that I didn't have good manual dexterity.
It seems like a strange thing for a father to say to a five-year-old.
But, you know, I don't think I have to say my father was particularly strange
to say fathers can say strange things.
I am one now, and I'm sure there's things that my daughter will remember
that I wish I hadn't said.
But it was so patently absurd that there I was acting out
the opposite of this fact that I believed that was a story
that I'd carried with me, unexamined.
And that's the new story, by the way, that I once thought this
and then I learned this, then there was this other experience.
The truth is that I still feel that way.
I still feel that I don't have much manual dexterity.
I have learned that what I probably lack to a degree is actually patience
because what I recall, the comment from my father was about putting together some model.
If you saw me trying to put together my grill from Home Depot,
you would see that there's something lacking.
There's also something spatial.
But anyway, it all gets so complicated.
Well, I was talking to a dharma teacher friend of mine the other day,
and he's also an author so we can commiserate.
He said, well, there's really nothing to write about anymore.
I know dharma books to write because it's all been written.
And this was shortly after he told me that he had recently done a performance.
This is a Wes Nisker, I won't pretend that I have to hide his identity.
He had recently done a performance at Berkeley Rep,
where they had asked him to bring in more of his personal story into the performance.
So when he said this about there's no dharma to tell anymore,
dharma books to write anymore, he said, well, that's why they want stories
because all the technical stuff has been told, but people love stories.
Stories give us the sense of meaning on the personal level, on the national level,
on the cultural level.
The teachings of the Buddha, if you read the sutras, they are stories.
They are stories of the Buddha's time and events that took place.
And much of the time the Buddha is either telling a story,
or it's a situation which is being described in the sutra,
or he often creates images that have narrative elements to them.
I was on a retreat with Lee Brazington a couple weeks ago,
and I don't know if you're familiar with his teaching, a wonderful teacher,
and he has a pretty amazing mind that he can, he recited one of the long sutras
from the dig in the kaya, it's called the Long Discourses of the Buddha.
He recited it, which took about 30 to 40 minutes.
And it was really like the oral tradition, this is how this was all passed along.
There's this great sutra, there's really some drama in it,
and there's some back story that he filled in.
And the group of us, 30 or so retreatants,
I was sitting in the back and kind of looked around a little bit,
because my sense was sitting on the edge of my chair, even though I knew the sutra,
that it was just the drama of it unfolding and having been told.
It really could feel that kind of ancient primal quality sitting around the fire
with the elder telling the story, the cultural history.
But one of the things that I noticed as he was telling the story
was that when he got out of the narrative elements and into the more technical dharma elements,
it got more boring, because it wasn't a story then.
It was like, oh, the five hindrances, yeah, the eight-fold path,
okay, let's get on, what happens next?
So when we're sitting, of course, this is one of the reasons why the mind keeps wondering,
because we want to be entertained.
But on some more essential level, there's something else going on.
And that is that a story gives form to the formless.
And the formless, yes, perhaps it can be boring, but it's more frightening.
And this is, I think, the more getting to the primal reason why we create stories,
why we create meaning.
All there really is, is this moment.
Any Buddhist worth their salt knows that.
Anybody who's been here for three dharma talks knows that.
All there is, is this moment.
There is no story.
There is no past to dredge up and to re-experience.
There is no future that this is all moving towards.
There's only this, and this is formless.
Our consciousness is formless.
It may have meaning on the level of form, but on the level of formlessness,
it has no meaning.
It just is.
This is not the most appealing concept to a living being.
We grasp onto things, to concepts, as well as objects,
because they give us a sense of security.
There is a stage in the, what's called the progress of insight,
the process of moving, we could say, moving towards enlightenment.
And this is kind of a traditional Theravadan mapping.
Again, a totally unreal, but just a model, another story.
But in this map, there's a stage where it's called rolling up the mat,
which is the monks would sit on a mat.
So when you're like, okay, no thanks, I'm done.
I'm out of here.
You roll up the mat and leave.
And the reason you roll up the mat is because at that stage,
you see how it's put in these terms that everything is impermanent.
But we could say it in another way, that everything is formless,
that there is no solid thing to hold on to.
And that's scary as hell.
We're in so many ways in a constant process of trying to make solid
and make real everything around us,
the most essentially ourselves to create our own sense of identity.
And yet, once we are prepared for this rolling up the mat stage,
it's really okay.
Because when you've seen clearly that everything is impermanent,
but so what, that is, yeah, well, I've been doing okay so far.
And it's not that everything became impermanent all of a sudden.
It's not like everything suddenly is formless and whoa, I've got to work.
It's just that I'm finally seeing the truth of it.
So if we're prepared for that, which is what a lot of practice traditionally is for,
is to prepare you for the different realizations.
If you're prepared for it, it's actually tremendously free.
Because this is what the Buddha was telling us,
that actually the problem isn't the formlessness.
It's the trying to make something solid.
It's the trying to hold on to form that causes the angst that we call dukkha.
That's ultimately causing our suffering.
So most of the time what we're doing is we are choosing a level of discomfort
in which we find acceptable so as to avoid the more scary option of having nothing to hold on to.
So we hold on just enough to make us feel secure.
And then if that becomes a problem, we try to, you know, hopefully we let go a little bit
or we go through the grieving of having to let go.
We're ripped apart from our problem or from the non-solid thing that we're trying to hold on to.
But when we go deeply into practice and come to this place where we actually taste that formlessness,
one of the things that becomes apparent is that most of the time we're actually in formlessness.
We just don't notice it.
This is what, maybe not most of the time, actually.
I don't have statistics on it.
But this is what Ajahn Buddhadasa called little nirvana.
He said that every day we experience many moments of letting go
and of falling into just not holding on to anything.
So in terms of the language I'm using tonight into formlessness, little moments.
You're just brushing your teeth and you just forget about everything for a second, you know.
And he says that if it weren't for these little moments, little nirvanas,
that we'd actually become way too stressed out, we'd go crazy.
You can see that our culture is moving, of course, more and more into the crazy realm.
There's less and less maybe little nirvanas happening for people,
but still, according to him, we wouldn't make it at all if it weren't for these moments of letting go.
So this is actually the place, I guess, I didn't realize it as I was preparing this talk
until I was about halfway through, that this is the place that I was working with on this last retreat two weeks ago.
But seeing that every time I simply stopped thinking as you get to do a little bit more on retreats,
every time I was just in my body, just in the present moment, that I was in this formless realm.
There was no... I wasn't creating anything. I wasn't making anything.
Things just were as they were.
Now, that isn't to say that there wasn't...
I'm mostly talking about mental when I'm talking about form in that practice way.
As we can see that there's forms around us, and there's lots of structure to things.
When we probe deeply, though this teaching on impermanence shows us that what looks to be solid actually isn't solid.
So again, the idea that it's formed and has some concrete existence loses its validity when we look closely.
And we see that the atoms are all just spinning and the molecules are...
that there's mostly space, mostly formlessness in an atom.
So where does this leave us?
One of the temptations with practice is to latch on to an idea, and that becomes our obsession.
So let me say that another way that I can frame what I'm talking about is the relative and the absolute.
So form is relative and formlessness is the absolute.
But it's not that one is more correct or more useful than the other.
They actually depend on each other.
And in the heart sutra it says form is emptiness and emptiness is form.
That they actually co-mingle and that they're interrelated.
So if we decide, oh, everything is formless, I'm just going to stop paying for my life insurance.
Because what's the point? I don't exist anyway, the future doesn't exist.
Why should I be paying into a retirement plan when there's only this moment?
There's no future to retire.
We can see that that doesn't work on the level of form.
We have to honor form, but also I would say that the practice, the Buddhist practice is trying to correct an imbalance.
The Buddhist viewpoint I would say, as a spokesman for Buddhism, is that we overemphasize form.
So let's learn a little bit about formlessness.
Let's just sit and do nothing so that we're not creating anything on the physical level.
Close our eyes so that we're kind of cutting ourselves off a little bit from our sense experience.
And see if we can just be so that we can see and become aware of this formless realm.
So getting back to what this talk was supposed to be about, stories.
As we try to work into that formless realm and the story comes up, we start to work with this in a new way.
Because as we have insight into formlessness, as we start to see that my story is created by me, we can start to change our relationship to the story.
Which is a critical aspect of practice, and I would say a critical aspect of any spiritual or really personal development,
is to see that our story can be deconstructed.
And that we can actually remove ourselves from the story and look at it as an object,
and we can question the story and look at its components and say, is this true? Is this useful? Does this still have meaning?
Because of course our story is changing all the time, even though our memories are changing.
You think you remember something, but then you remember it differently.
So when we can start to see our stories as constructs, then someone asks you about your life, and you can talk about it,
but you can hold it differently in your heart.
And as you start to think about it, if pain starts to arise, for instance,
you can step back and say, oh, wow, this story has created pain for me.
And then you can see whether it's really useful, whether it's really true,
whether there's some component of it that can be revisioned or re-understood.
This is where things like compassion come in, rather than thinking, you know, wallowing in our misery to think,
oh, this was difficult, this was painful, and bringing in that sense of compassion,
which is something we also contain besides our story.
So the idea ultimately is to learn from the story, see what's useful there,
and then to let go of what's not helpful.
You know, when I was working on my first book, one of my ideas, which I didn't follow through on,
because it just didn't work for the book, was to, and I actually wrote this stuff,
but it didn't get published, was to have a chapter called Two Stories,
and it was two different versions of my life before I got sober.
And it was these two streams that I saw that there was this stream that was moving toward spiritual growth
that was interested in becoming a better person, becoming a wiser person,
finding my way in the world, and then there was a part of me that was just seeking after pleasure
that was, you know, addicted to drugs and alcohol and other things.
And they were kind of two different versions.
And before I got sober, I believed more in the one that was about the spiritual growth.
And then when I got sober, I started to see that there was this other story.
Oh, I could also tell it like this.
After a while, I realized that one of the things that people do in recovery very often
is they start to so emphasize the addiction story that they lose the fact
that actually something brought them to recovery.
And it wasn't their addiction.
Yeah, their addiction was the suffering that motivated them,
but the thing that motivated them to change, to grow, was something else that was very often going on.
And when we neglect one aspect of the story, we see ourselves as,
oh, I was bad then, now I'm good.
And we throw away all this time of ourselves and sort of stigmatize ourselves.
So in these ways, we can start to take apart our own story.
And rather than be a victim of it, we can use it as a gift to ourselves and to others.
And to hold it lightly, you know, even as others may project on to us who we are.
I mean, you know, an author, Jim read My Bio, right?
Well, I wrote My Bio, you know?
Nobody does that for you at the publishing company, you know?
And you have to get into this weird role, okay, you've got to make it sound really professional
and, you know, like you've done all these things, you know,
and it's got to be in the third person for it to sound authoritative.
It's just a story, you know, a convenient story that goes well in the back of the book
that will hopefully make you want to buy the book, you know?
It's not true, it's not not true, it's just a story.
So those are some thoughts, a story, a connection of ideas that are an attempt to make coherence out of the formless.
I hope it's of some help that, as Ajahn Amaro says, take what's useful and please leave the rest behind.
Thank you.
We have a few minutes, I think we end at nine.
So if there are any questions or thoughts anyone would like to share, I'd be happy to dialogue with you.
And it can be on anything, yeah.
Oh, are you going to give her the microphone?
Something occurred to me when you started with the title of your book about Buddha and God without the comma.
Yeah.
And then you talked about formlessness and I was thinking about God and formlessness
and you said that people can find formlessness and emptiness very scary.
It occurred to me that Buddhists have to be a very mature lot because to be comfortable with formlessness,
which does provoke fear for me, to be comfortable in that realm, often fear does not bring out the very best in humans.
I wanted to know if you could comment on that from your life experience.
Drawing on the fear of formlessness that you referenced, do you face fears far more in Buddhism than you did before you found Buddhism in recovery?
I don't know.
It's hard to remember.
I've now been officially practicing Buddhism for half my life and that everything's a little fuzzy back there.
But I can certainly talk about that relationship to fear that what I see is that people that fundamentalism of all sorts is rooted in fear,
of fear of the unknown and so fear of the formlessness in the language we're using tonight.
I think that when I came to Buddhism, I was grateful for the don't know mind.
Because it actually explained a lot more than the things, the forms, which had not, that had all broken down.
And as you say, I agree, but we're all going to pat ourselves in the back.
Yes, Buddhism is the best thing.
There is a certain spiritual maturity to being able to come to that place. It's a stage of spiritual development.
And Scott Peck talks about this in his book, A Different Drum, and the different stages of spiritual development and rejection of traditional forms is a stage after the clinging to the form.
But that primal tendency is to grab on to one idea and say, okay, this is right.
And if I just do this, then I'll be okay. Then I will be saved or I'll be redeemed or I'll be enlightened.
And so we want to stick with that, but if you find yourself disillusioned by something like that, as I was, to come to something that says, no, actually there isn't an answer like that.
It's actually just happening in the present moment. The truth of it, the reality of it, felt in harmony with my experience.
It felt in harmony with the reality that I knew. So even though there was that loss of security, it was a greater sense of security because it wasn't.
The problem with those single answers are fundamentalism. And when I say fundamentalism, I really mean that in the broadest sense because I see fundamentalism in many forms, not just religion.
But the problem with the single answer or the black and white solution is that you're always having to hold on so tightly to it and fend off all the things that are disproving it that it's ultimately kind of uncomfortable.
Because you're holding on to a lie. And so when you let go of that, it's really a relief to just go, fine, I'll just fall into the void. Great.
That's where I was, as I said before, that's where I was anyway. So now I'm just acknowledging it and I don't have to hold on to something else.
Thank you. I never would have thought of that until you asked the question.
I really, I enjoyed the talk, but if you don't mind.
Go ahead.
You'll see what I mean. If I may steer back toward addiction for just a minute. And I don't suppose there's an easy solution to this.
I don't even know what question I'm about to ask, but I do know that there's someone in my world, a young person who's experiencing drug addiction and it seems to be escalating and going from softer to harder.
And then the various behavioral problems associated with that. And I see this person surrounded by a constellation of people trying to help him.
I see that their intentions are good, but there's the usual dysfunctional family, relationships at work. And I'm outside of this, but I see it. I'm not related to or friends with really anyone.
But I see what's happening and I'm just curious from your experience, what is the best way to, is there a best way, is there a way to go forward in a situation like that with someone who clearly needs help, probably too young and too wrapped up in his everything to ask for help.
And yet surrounded by people wanting to help him.
I think the best way would be inception. I don't know if you've seen the movie yet, but if you could plant the idea in the person's head in their subconscious and make them believe it.
You know, there's interventionists. I don't know how effective they are. But traditionally, and this seems to have some validity, the key is for someone to hit their own bottom, whatever that is.
It doesn't necessarily mean that everything falls apart, but that somehow they get confronted. They see the truth of their own problem. And you can't make someone else see that a truth.
You know, you can't make anyone else think anything.
You know, the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous talked about how they would wait until their prospect was at the end of a binge, you know, hung over, and then they would drop in on him.
Say, how are you doing? You know, you're sick of the, are you done yet? Would you like to try a different way? So that's kind of the, it seems to be the key.
But certainly it's no reason people shouldn't try to help. But that's a very complicated thing because the trying in itself is often coming out of their own need for this person to be different.
And that person, the addict, knows that instinctively.
It's hard to watch a car crash.
It is. It's very painful. And I get, you know, regular emails about them. It's the hardest thing. You know, when you talk about treatment and recovery, it's all about what to do for people who have decided they want to get sober.
There's very little out there about the 90% of people who never even try. That's the problem that nobody seems to have an answer for.
So we have fortunately run out of time, so there won't be any more questions like that.
Just to say that this center is supported entirely by your donations and you can give donations to the center or to me. So anything is appreciated.
I will not keep you any longer, but may all beings be free from suffering.
