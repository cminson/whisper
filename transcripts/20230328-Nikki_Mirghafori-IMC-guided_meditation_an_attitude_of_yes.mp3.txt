 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Greetings, friends. Greetings. Good morning from Mountain View, California, where it's a rainy forecast. It's forecast to be a storm, another storm coming to Northern California. Yes, yay. Hope you are well wherever you are, wherever in the world you are. Greetings, greetings. Looking forward to continuing our exploration and our practice together this week. And the theme we are exploring is improvising our lives, improvising our lives. Lessons from improv for our practice on the cushion and in life. So, so saying yes, saying yes to what is, saying yes to what is, that would be the theme of our meditation and I'll offer more reflections, of course. So let's, let's begin. Let's practice together. Ahh, arriving, arriving in the body. Arriving in the body, arriving in this moment in time with an attitude of yes. An attitude of yes in our hearts. Yes. Yes. Yes, to this moment. Yes, to this body, however it is. It may be feeling great, it might be tight and achy, hurting, whatever is happening in the body in this moment. Can we say yes? Can we say yes to all of it with an open heart? Yes. Exploring, experimenting with this perspective, this shift in perspective just a tiny bit. See how it shifts and changes our experience. Starting with the body, saying yes to however it's showing up. There is tightness, achiness, etc. Opening up these areas, saying yes, you are here. Yes, accepting the truth of the moment. This is what's arriving right now. Yes. Instead of blocking, pushing away, which brings more agitation and tightness to the mind and heart. Saying yes to the body, relaxing, softening. Saying yes to the breath. Each breath, each in breath, each out breath individually. If the acceptance, the saying yes can come from your heart, from your body, not from your head. Your heart taking a stance of yes towards whatever is arising. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Noticing where there are these subtle no's. No, to experience. And first, can you say yes to the no? Accepting saying full yes to the resistance, seeing what happens to the resistance if there is any, this attitude of yes. It's not to be forced. Or seeing no's to become a yes, but accepting no's with a yes. Seeing what happens, maybe the heart softens, the body softens some more, and then there can be a genuine subtle soft yes, yes. Whatever is arising. Thank you. Any other questions? Thank you.. you And being curious, lighthearted, exploring the different tones of yes How does this subtle yes feel in your body, gentle, soft? Yes. Like the gentle rays of morning, sun, dawn. Yes. Yes. yes. you What if you turn the volume up in your internal yes? What does an enthusiastic, abusive, effulgent yes feel like in your heart? Yes. Whatever is arising in this moment explore, be curious. As if you were shouting yes, yes, delightedly, to your life. How does that volume feel? What is the name of the heart? Explore your heart. Discover. If you explore the volume one of yes, let it be very subtle. It's simply a stance that accompanies your awareness, awareness imbued, your mindfulness imbued with. The subtle yes. Acceptance, open, opening to experience, very subtle, simply knowing.

Yes, we see you. We see you, yes. Yes. Acknowledging. Ah, letting the heart relax in its seeing. See what happens. The heart may settle into yes to the present moment, not planning future past. Right here, yes, to what we truly know. Right here, right now. Thank you. Thank you. And now and then you can drop in the word yes into your heart. Let the driver reverberate, soften, settle, open up with brightness. Not like him on trial with every breath, but now and then, dropped in to tune. Our attitude, our perspective, yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we bring this meditation to a close, can we have our hearts say yes? Yes. As if with arms wide open embracing what this moment is, what this practice has been this morning, however it's been. Thoughts of the past, future, distractions, pain, or fully here, does it matter? Can we say yes? Yes. Yes, I showed up. I showed up. I'm here. I showed up doing my best. Yes. Yes. Saying yes to your life. Yes to the causes and conditions that are. Yes. Interesting that we're planting seeds of openness, non-resistance, open-hearted acceptance, curiosity, and confidence, and confidence. And I'm here to show you that we're planting seeds that will flower in their own time, support us, support others, and offering, offering generously, saying yes, offering this goodness, offering this goodness to all beings everywhere. May my goodness, may my cultivation, my efforts be of service, not just to myself, my own life, but to all beings, those whose lives I touch directly and indirectly. May my life be a source of good. Yes to this life. May all beings everywhere be well, may all beings everywhere. Be free, including myself. Thank you for your practice, friends. And as we take a brief pause, if you like to share a word or two about what's arising for you in this moment, after this practice, to take with you through your day, you're welcome to do that.
