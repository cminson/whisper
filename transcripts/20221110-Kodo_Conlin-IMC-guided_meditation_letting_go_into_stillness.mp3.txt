 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Mmm. So greetings far and wide, early and late, light and dark. Mmm. Taking 45 minutes together to settle in with ourselves and reconnect with our intention for practice. Reflecting on these precepts again and beginning as we do with mindfulness. I notice in myself a sort of quality of appreciation or something edging on reverence for the practice and the ability we have to come together as Sangha. Something to celebrate as we settle. So let's take our seat. Coming into that. Upright, alert, and easeful meditative posture. Reclining if that's the need for your body. Or sitting upright. Sensing into balance. Maybe the shoulders are asking to roll back. Maybe the breath is asking for just a little more depth. Listening to the body, taking its cues to guide us into alignment. As we settle, if there's any obvious tension or holding, just a little relaxation. It's okay to let go. Relaxing, releasing, settling, and attentive. Attentive breathing in, attentive breathing out. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Attentive with the breathing. If the attention happens to be vague or dull, perhaps adding just one more level of precision with the awareness. A little bit closer with the breathing. How is that connection between attention and the breathing? And if the attention feels tight or over-energized, rather than putting the attention, forcing the attention on the breathing, letting the breathing come to you. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Attentive breathing in, attentive breathing out, allowing each moment of experience to arise, register, and release. No trace. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Attentive breathing in and attentive breathing out. If you notice both activity in the mind and stillness, so let go into stillness. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. Relaxing, relaxing. And as the sitting comes to an end, the moment of appreciation for these minutes of practice, for our renewal of the intention to be mindful, clearly aware, discerning, letting any goodness of the practice permeate the body in small ways, perhaps. May everyone we encounter today benefit, even invisibly, from our practice together. Relaxing, relaxing.
