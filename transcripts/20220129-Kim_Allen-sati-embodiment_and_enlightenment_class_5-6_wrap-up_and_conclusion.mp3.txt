Okay, so gently bringing yourself back from the meditation. We're now moving
into a period of kind of integrating and gathering up the threads of our five
sessions together. I just want to offer a few words about mindfulness of the body,
kind of this adventure or journey that we've been on, some of the milestones
that there were along the way. So in this sutta, the Buddha is describing many
different ways that we can encounter our body in a sense. And he talks about
deconstructing the conceptual way that we see the body through mindfulness of
the breath, focusing just on this energetic exchange, through being aware
of the body as parts, as elements, no different ways of conceiving it. And yet
it's right there at the beginning, it's not only about altered perception, but
we're also meant to be mindful in all of our ordinary activities, know which of
the four postures you're in, while you've now tried all of them in a
meditative sense, but we use them all throughout the day, and also the general
activities that we're doing, being aware of chopping the carrots or more
simply extending the arm or bringing it back, being aware while talking, being
aware while eating, all these things. So he's asking us to see the body as a
vehicle through and through our life that is with us much of the time, and we
may not be aware of that all the time. And then he moves, you know, with this kind
of basis of seeing the body a little bit more flexibly and a little bit more
continually, we can use the body as a basis for some mental states that are
quite beautiful. So elevating the mind into the jaunas, for example, concentration
states or cultivation of samadhi. So the body somehow ties directly to the mind,
and through the, you know, the progress of this, we deepen our connection to
various truths such as impermanence and also not self understanding that this
body is really composed of things that are not us fundamentally. And so there's
a, there's a cultivation of the mind through the body. And then this brings
various tangible benefits, some of them quite every day, you know, the ability to
be with cold and heat, hunger and thirst, you know, the basic things that body is
always going through every day, all these things we have to keep doing to it. We
become somehow more easeful about all of that. And also the ability to tolerate
various mental states, fear and dread and discontent and delight and harsh words
from others, somehow the groundedness of the body, container of the body is
something that can help us manage that inherent vulnerability of having this
body. And then from there we can even realize more deeply the truths of the
Four Noble Truths and all the way to awakening. So the body is a source of
dukkha, discontent, and yet it also carries within it the path and the
possibility of awakening. So it's kind of a sweeping sutta. And I hope over
these five sessions together, we have realized that there's quite a lot of
potential very close at hand. Maybe our best teacher is closest to us, the one
right here that we live in in a sense. So I spoke in very general terms because
of course this practice is highly individual and I would guess that there
are as many different experiences of this sutta and these practices as there
are people here. And so whatever it was for you, whatever it brought up or
whatever discoveries or challenges or surprises or irritations that came from
looking at the body in all these different ways, celebrate them all. They're
great. That was what was supposed to happen for you, whatever did. So here we
are nearing the end of this together and I think we'll just offer some verses
perhaps that are related to mindfulness of the body. So maybe we'll start with
David on that. Yeah, thank you, Kim, for sort of bringing things together there a
bit. There are many, many references throughout the discourses that come down
to us, to mindfulness of the body and its particular powers as sort of a
central realm of our practice. And one that I've always loved is one from one
of the many awakening poems left to us by disciples of the Buddha. And this one
says simply, it's too bad it's not a rainy day. I couldn't arrange that. But it
says the sky rains down like a beautiful song. This little hut is roofed and
pleasant, sheltered from the wind. The mind is serene in the stillness of the
body. So go ahead and rain sky, if you wish. Thank you, David, this idea of being
secure in one's hut with mindfulness of the body. Thank you very much. Maybe I'll
just add, we didn't in this course talk about the corpse contemplations, the
charnel ground contemplations. And maybe that's worthwhile of its own kind of
like practice. So I'm just thinking with my co-teachers here, maybe that's
something that we'll do in a future course is to consider that and how to
practice with that. And a verse that I would like to offer, excuse me, is it
still, it's not a verse necessarily, it's a prose and it's within the Majma
1-19 that Kaya Gita Siddhi Sita. And it also stands alone in that and Gudra
Nakaya. And it goes like this, even as one who encompasses with their mind the
great ocean, includes thereby all the streams that run into the ocean. Just so
whoever develops and cultivates mindfulness directed to the body, includes
all wholesome qualities that pertain to true knowledge, pointing that this
practice can be a tremendous incredible support all the way to awakening. Perhaps
might even that be the only practice with with all its variations all the way
to awakening. Kim. So I would like to offer one also from the awakening poems. If
the Buddha were to grant me one wish and I were to get what I wished for, I choose
that the whole world be always mindful of the body. Thank you, Kim. And finally, and
pitch hitting for Ying, who hopes to be back by the end but may not be with us,
she sent these verses also from an awakening poem. This the awakening
poem of Ananda or from the awakening poem of Ananda, the Buddha's kinsman and
longtime companion and support. And this verse from that awakening poem of
Ananda says, this is after the death of the Buddha, when your friend has passed
away, when your teacher is passed and gone, there's no friend like mindfulness
directed to the body. Thank you, David. Okay, so beginning our closing here, just
wanted to express our gratitude and thanks. Excuse me. And Nancy put and that's
when you could share the verses offered. Yes, so you'll receive a final email from
us that will include these verses that we just shared as kind of maybe like
capping verses for our time together. And maybe I'll say that what a pleasure it
has been these five courses. And today there was this, for me, I'll say this
tenderness, this sweetness to practice together what we've been talking about
and to explore these different postures and the deep bow to your practice and
to joining us on this adventure. And of course I could give a deep bow to
micro teachers as well. And hand it over to David. Yeah, sometimes as we conclude
these courses, people ask us or after we've ended, people ask us how they can
support the Sati Center, these classes, these teachers that provide classes
through the Sati Center. We like to just let people know that practicing
generosity is part of the practice. We love the way we love sharing the dharma
freely and we love the way it exists and prospers and flourishes in this field
of generosity. If you feel so moved, and I hardly need to say it, we feel no
obligation. We feel no holding back and sharing the dharma. We encourage no
obligation in giving freely to the Sati Center. But we'll provide in the email
that Diana spoke of a link to the Sati Center website and you can find pretty
easily on the website a donate button. And there's a way to make gifts of
Donna Express Practice Generosity online there. Kim. Okay, so I want to just say a
couple words about upcoming classes. Our next course will be in April. Well, right
at the end, it'll be two Saturdays, April 30th and May 7th. We're going to repeat
actually a class that we did last year, which is the Entering the World of the
Oli Canon class. So it's a kind of an introduction to this body of literature.
Although I suspect it might be slightly different than it was last time. We
might spruce it up a little bit in some way. So even if you did it last year, you
could do it again. But it's two Saturdays and the classes are slightly longer,
8.30 to 10.30, two hour sessions on those two Saturdays. And this will be
on the website and so forth coming up fairly soon. And then we're going to do
something really radical in August, which is that we're going to have a class on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday. We've somehow gotten on this Tuesday, Thursday,
Saturday thing. And you know, sometimes you just have to change things. So August
8th, 10th and 12th, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, we'll be teaching a course on
DN3, which is the Ambatta Sutta in Madhika Nikaya. And you can read an
event if you want or just come for the adventure. So that's what's coming up in
the near term. So we're winding down then to the end. And it looks like Ying has
not made it back yet. Is that correct? So why don't we just gather our thoughts and
good intentions together and remember that there are certain gestures in the
in the Buddhist tradition that are done with the body and can express maybe
something of our devotion, our sense of sincerity, and you know, maybe what we've
connected with in this practice. So I thought I would invite us to dress
together, take one of your hands, maybe the right, and touch the earth down in
front of you. This is a gesture that the Buddha did. You'll see it on Buddha Rupa's
statues to connect himself into the entire cosmos. You know, of course, the
story is that Mara was challenging him, you know, what right do you have to
awaken? And he touches the earth and, you know, declares that he does have this
this right. But for us, I find even sometimes at the end of a meditation just
reaching down and connecting with the earth, healing the way the body has
earth, earth touching earth. And there's this sense of connection in the fireside
chat, we had an illusion to the sense of oneness or non separation. And though the
body is actually a gateway to that, despite being our own little individual
thing. So maybe just remembering that. And then as we bring our hands up, we can bow
to each other, to this beautiful Sangha, those of us who have been together for
these last couple of weeks to examine the body. This too is a gesture of the body,
a simple bow. Or sometimes we bow maybe before sitting, we can even put the head
all the way down to the ground. So I encourage you to see your body as a
vehicle for these expressions of the Dharma of what's meaningful to you, what's on
your heart. These ones or other ones, we're about to carry our bodies off into
our lives doing our usual daily things. And in what ways your body expressing the
Dharma for you. So then just in our last moments together,
collecting our minds and dedicating the merit of our time. So maybe closing the
eyes, feeling the body sitting with whatever posture you're in. And just
wishing well for the beings that we'll encounter. Beings and bodies, maybe some
beings don't have bodies. But just the sense that the goodness that we've
cultivated, we spread outward into the world, simple ways, touching those
directly near us and rippling out, farther than we can know. So may all
beings connect to their bodies, may all beings feel at home where they are, may
all beings find freedom and happiness internally, and may all beings find
liberation for themselves and for the whole world. Thank you everyone. Thank
you everybody. And if you'd like to unmute and say goodbye with full hearts. Thank you
everybody. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you very much for
your time. Thank you teachers. Thank you teachers. Bye bye. See you everybody. Take care. Thank you.
