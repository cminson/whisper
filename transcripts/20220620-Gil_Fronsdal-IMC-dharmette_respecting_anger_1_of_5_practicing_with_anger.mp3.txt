The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, hello again and on this Monday morning and for those of us in the United States,
it's a holiday, the Juneteenth Day holiday, the second of the two or the first of the
year of the two independence holidays here in the United States and I gave a
talk about this holiday yesterday. So, last week I talked about the emotions
and offering five different perspectives on emotions for support and
practicing with them and this week I wanted to take some specific emotions
and like case studies and go through them and I decided that I would start
with anger and when I considered anger I considered that it's actually a lot to
say and maybe it's more useful to spend the five days on this topic rather than
just doing one day and be done with it. So, that's what we'll do and maybe this
the title of this week can be respecting anger. Anger of course is a very
important emotion, attitude, motivating force in our society and a tremendous
amount of harm gets caused through anger and one of the, I don't know if it's
fair to say that any one particular harm of anger is worse than others but what
comes to mind in the moment is the tremendous influence it can have on
young children if they grow up with anger or they grow up afraid of unexpected
anger coming at them and also anger is a protective device. Anger also some
people motivated by anger will protect other people, protect their children,
protect society. Some people with their anger protect themselves and set up
strong boundaries and strong no and can be ferocious sometimes in that
protective movement. Some people by their anger can put a tremendous amount of
energy into a cause, a good cause, because the energy is forcing them. So
anger has many different expressions in our society and but in one of the it
then it can be confusing because sometimes anger is treated as something
that's wrong or bad, painful and sometimes is treated as something that's
necessary and important and justified. And in Buddhism whenever there's a
discussion about anger in the Buddhist English the discussion is, implies that
anger has hostility as part of it. So if that's how we see it then we have to
come up with another word for something like anger or anger which has no
hostility in it. There might be a very strong expression of displeasure that
will look like anger but there's no hostility in it. There can be very strong
movement ferocious movement of protection of a strong no but there's no
hostility. There's no desire to harm anyone. It's just setting up a very
strong statement of asserting a certain ferocious ferocity of purpose,
ferocity of negation, something. And so a very useful way of looking at our
anger is to look and see is there any hostility in it. And if there is be
careful. The hostility I would like to suggest is never necessary, never
appropriate. Ferocious boundary setting, ferocious standing in front and saying
stop. Ferocious sense of displeasure at this is not right. That I think can be
very healthy for ourselves and for others. And the first time I saw that was
when I was working in the kitchen. I was a kitchen manager at the monastery, the
Zen monastery. And I don't remember the details of how, what light up to this,
what I did but I was kind of the manager managing other people in the
kitchen. And the kitchen was kind of a pressure cooker. And an older man who was
in the kitchen, we're standing next to each other on the big table. And and he
just stood up straight and turned to me and with ferocity said to me, don't ever
say that to me again. And so it was quite ferocious but what was amazing to me
was the moment as he said it, I could, he turned it off. He was, he was, then he was
back to being kind of clean and clear, just present doing his work. And I then,
I was so surprised because I only experienced before that people stayed
angry. People were upset that they would stay and there'd be a kind of a conflict
and a fight. And he had this clean anger. It was completely clean. It was just like
don't do this again. And he said what had to be said and he wasn't carrying it.
He wasn't being continuing with it. It wasn't like I was forgiven but I didn't
need to be forgiven. It was just like I got the message and he wasn't holding
on to it. He wasn't carrying anything with it. He just made his, said what had to
be done. And, and I was so amazed by this, that you can take care of yourself
this way. But regardless, if anger is as, is only defined by as having
hostility, or it's anger that's a kind of ferocious, ferocious boundary setting
or displeasure, it's helpful to see anger always as a messenger. Always is
something to study and get to know better. That anger is a tip of an iceberg
of something deeper inside of us that probably useful to get to know well,
to understand well. Part of the challenge of any kind of anger is it
tends to be directed towards something with such strength of
directionality, even if it's towards something inside of ourselves, that we
don't see the bigger picture. And we don't see where the the anger is coming
from. It's directed outwards and we don't look backwards to see what is
happening there, what's going on there. And, and that's what the practice is
about. Very broadly, in broad strokes, kind of there are four stages that
Buddhists can be point to around anger. One is unrestrained anger. You see it
sometimes in a young child where they're just completely consumed by their
anger. And I've had it with my child when, with a toddler and I was
carrying him through the supermarket aisles and having a temper tantrum about
something. And probably I just assumed that people at the store thought that I
was just a horrific father. And I know that other parents have had this
experience too where the child, you know, just unrepress pure volcanic anger at
something that maybe it was that they saw a toy that they wanted, but it wasn't
really the time to give them a toy in the store, buy it for them. And the, so the
first is unrestrained anger where it's explosive, freely given, you know, felt
like every anger is justified and, and then very broadly then the next kind of
stage is holding anger in check, sometimes repressing it, denying it, hiding
it, and because it's dangerous to express the anger or something. And some
people as they grow up and they learn, they learn that growing up. Sometimes
they learn it on with the violence done to them, that they express anger and
they're hit or attacked or something. And so they learn that they can't, they
can't express any anger and they bottle it up or turn it off something. The third
is what we do in this practice. We respect it, we attend to it, we study it, we
get to know it better, and we get to know it without shame, without further anger
towards the anger. We get to know it because it is an expression of our life
force. It is an expression of what it means to be alive, alive, and it arises
out of some, it's not just anger that's happening, it's the something deeper and
fuller about who we are that's in that anger, our values, our emotions, our
fears, our desires, our loves, our past sufferings and pains and wounds, a whole
bunch of consolation of things come together. Some of them which is part of
our beauty and wonderfulness, and some of it is that which is what we're trying
to let go of in practice. To let go, to let go of conceit, the self-centeredness,
intense self-centeredness is often a recipe for intense anger and hostility.
And so that kind of anger we don't want to allow, give free reign to, but we don't
repress it either. What we want to do is turn around and really look deeply
what's going on here. And meditation is one of the best places for this. In
meditation you're committed to being still, not moving your body, you're not
going to punch anyone out or screaming anyone. And to give when you, so you might
even try it, when you find yourself having anger, go and sit down to meditate
and let the anger be a volcano, let the anger course through you and just feel
it, make room for it. Let go, keep letting go of the thoughts, the stories, and let
the body compost the anger. Let the body hold and process the anger and sit there
allowing it, but being present for it, feeling in the body and see what happens.
This is very respectful of anger. It allows it to be there, but we're not
fueling it and feeding it with more and more activity and stories, but this is a
place to really get to know it. And in the fourth stage of Buddhist practice at
least with anger, is that anger doesn't get triggered. Partly because we've
learned other ways of responding, other ways of boundary setting or protecting
other motivations that get what needs to be done done, and partly because the
attachments we have, the clinging, the conceits that are part of the triggers
for anger are no longer there. And there might be strong displeasure, but no
hostility at all. So that's kind of an introduction for this week. We'll spend
the week looking at anger and as a little homework assignment for this next
day or as you go forward here, see if you can learn to be comfortable or to be
empty or to be non-reactive to other people angry at you. It doesn't mean
that they're justified in the anger or they should be angry or hopefully, you
know, it's a safe context for this to happen. Don't do anything unsafe. But if
you can learn to be present and stay relaxed and breathe when other people
are angry, this will go a long way to your ability to do that for yourself. So
whether you're angry or you're a recipient of anger, see if you can
practice mindfulness in the middle of it. It's invaluable. So this is what we'll
do this week and it's a difficult topic and hopefully I'll do it in a way that
is respectful for all the different ways that people have experienced anger, been
angry, been harmed by anger, and that each of you will maybe
hopefully find some usefulness in what's said this week. Thank you.
