 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome to the Insight Meditation Center. It used to be that that was identified with this building that I'm sitting in. But now more and more over this course of this pandemic and doing these YouTube sittings, I think of IMC as something much broader and wider, maybe even international. Maybe we should call IMC International Meditation Center. So thank you for being here and for expanding the meaning of what our sangha is and being part of this. One of the really valuable aspects of discoveries of this practice is a way of being, the quality of mind, a capacity of the mind to be desirelessness, to be desireless, to be without a desire. And it's probably pretty foreign idea to the way most minds work, because most minds are kind of going from one desire to another. But to be without desire is to be without any compulsion, any attachment, any kind of need for something to happen. And I know that this goes against what's necessary for much of ordinary life. So not to think of it as this is how we're supposed to be, the ideal way of being. But rather, it's kind of like if you are been working in the garden and you're dirty and grimy, then it's good to be dirtless for a while, to take off the dirt and then refresh and then we can go back out into the world. So to spend a few moments without desire as a way of kind of refreshing, a way of cleansing, a way of opening to something different, as a way of tapping into another way of being in the world, where there is a response, where there is a way, there's wisdom and intelligence that can operate. But it seems to come from a very different place than where ordinary desires come from. And it's a place where we don't identify with our desires, we don't make a self out of desires, or we don't tie the desires to self-fulfillment, self-enhancement, self-protection, all kinds of things. So what would that look like for you to sit and meditate without a desire? And maybe it sounds like a very foreign idea, but maybe you just assume that something in you knows what that is. And that it's something, maybe also assume that it's something precious, something valuable, something that is maybe once we tap into it deeply inspiring. So to assume a meditation posture, and maybe you can adjust your posture a little bit, maybe sway back and forth sideways a bit, maybe move your shoulders in a circle or something, and kind of loosen up a little bit in your body. And then taking a posture that supports being alert, and then hopefully the same posture as one that supports relaxation. And to gently close your eyes. And to take a few long, slow, easy-going breaths, as if you have all the time in the world to exhale. And allow the exhale to extend itself as long as it's comfortable. Sometimes by extending the exhale, it's possible to soften and relax parts of the body that otherwise wouldn't be felt or known. And to let your breathing now return to normal. And as you continue now with a normal breath, in a comfortable way, see if with the exhale, you can let the exhale continue. Be a little bit longer exhale at the end, mostly by releasing and allowing. A fuller exhale without any special effort except letting go or allowing. And at the end of that exhale, may perhaps make a very short pause. Not so much maybe making the pause, but rather allowing a pause. Or allowing yourself to wait a moment to feel the urge to breathe in. Very simple urge. And then allow for that inhale. Perhaps receive the inhale. And as you inhale, see if you can attune yourself to the fullness of that experience of breathing in without strain. But an attunement that's more in allowing the experience of inhale to be experienced. And at the end of the inhale, see if you can have an allowing. Releasing of the exhale, allowing of exhale. Releasing of the exhale, allowing of exhale, allowing of exhale. communicated pharmacology. And taking a few moments to more fully feel what it's like to allow and receive, to allow the exhale to receive the inhale without any other desire. Almost as if it's a release of all desires, and in the release of desires, there's an openness and awareness to the experience of breathing in and breathing out. Where desirelessness is closely related to allowing and receiving, and if you notice there are desires or thoughts, desirelessness is more found in letting go of those or letting them be. Desirelessness is in not picking anything up or getting involved. The kind of letting go that is not even letting go, just letting be closely related to receiving, allowing, whatever happens in experience. And becoming attuned to that part of your experience that is free of desires, even if there are desires present as well. Don't prioritize the desires, don't live in desire. See if you can live in the place that is content, open, receptive, being with what is, not what we want. the the the the the the for a few minutes experiment to the best of your ability with being free of desire being content to do so even if you're at the edges of it being able to being content even if it's just an intuition or feeling for what it's like to be that way experiencing what comes alive in you when there's no desire that is obscured by the presence of desires and desires often come with a lot of baggage associated with it. Beliefs we have, aversions we have, ideas about who we are and what we need in. And all this baggage can obscure something deeper. To allow ourselves a chance to be free of desire can allow for the well springs of a warm, caring heart. A caring heart can allow for compassion and love, can allow for a simple warmth and goodwill for others. A warm, thin goodwill which has no resemblance to ordinary desires because it's not tied to me, myself and mine. It's deeper, more intimate within than thoughts, ideas, and feelings of self. And perhaps in these last minutes of the sitting, maybe you can intuit or imagine or feel a place within which is not governed by desire but which is a source for warmth and care and love where in a sense nothing needs to happen. But where we can allow for that warmth and love and care, the tenderness. Without complicating it with shoulds and shouldn'ts, anxieties about caring for ourselves, in the last minutes of this sitting, perhaps to, if you can, sit quietly with a sense of warm heartedness, tenderness, care for the world. That maybe in a certain way is free of desire to do anything has also a momentum, a motivation, a wish that all beings be well, that others be happy, have the opportunity to feel safe, have the opportunity to be peace at peace and to be free. And then as we get ready to end this sitting, now maybe is a time for desire. And maybe your desire can be to contribute to that possibility. May your desire be to be free. And then as we get ready to end this sitting, this is the time for the possibility. May you live your life to make this a better world for others, for everyone, you and others. May you contribute to the happiness and welfare of the world.
