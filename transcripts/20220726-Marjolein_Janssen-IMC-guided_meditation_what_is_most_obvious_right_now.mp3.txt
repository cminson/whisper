 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. You can settle into our meditation posture, feel the body, and the sitting posture. You can tune into the body and see if there's any areas where there's tension. And then we can invite those areas to relax a little bit. Maybe there's discomfort or even pain. Maybe we can invite those areas to relax. It's an invitation of relaxation that doesn't have to happen. It's really an invitation. You can be detached from what happens to the body. And then we can invite the whole body to relax. You can even invite the mind to relax. Putting in an intention, make the mind relax. pulls in your backbone and your body. Sometimes these infertations are enough to help us relax. Sometimes the mind is just dizzy. The invitation is not really doing anything, it seems, at least. Your way is fine. That's about wholesome intentions. So much about the result right away. You can be aware of what is most obvious right now. Our attention will pick up what is most obvious. You don't have to do anything. It's kind of like receiving whatever is most obvious in this present moment. It could be a breath, it could be thoughts, sounds, sensation in the body. And it will change. Maybe the breath is most obvious for a while. And it changes to something else. Maybe a sound or a thought. Just follow this string of meditation objects, as we call them. One can even be aware of being mindful itself, aware of awareness. Sometimes that is accessible to us. Sometimes not. Either way is fine. If you would like to sector, why don't you watch the ears of me for the show. Cause we may not have ever given you such a accounts of experience while dedicate to And of course these moments of being aware of objects, being aware of awareness, will be interspersed with moments of not being aware, being lost in thoughts. This is a natural process. The mind just likes to think. At some point awareness comes back again. And we notice, oh, it was away in thoughts for a while. Maybe we can have a kind attitude towards ourselves, towards our awareness and our thoughts. Kindness because this is just a natural process. It's not our fault or anyone's fault or anything's fault. It's just nature. And then we come back from a thought excursion. We can simply ask ourselves what is most obvious right now. Maybe that's the impression left from the thought excursion. Maybe something else jumps to the foreground. Continue with silence. Thank you. Hi. Hello. Thank you. Thank you.
