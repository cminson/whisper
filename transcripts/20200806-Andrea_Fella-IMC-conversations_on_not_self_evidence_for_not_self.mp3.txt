Continuing this conversation about not-self, just a quick kind of summary of what we talked about last time, that the kind of the key teaching around not-self is not that there's nothing here, you know, that sometimes the idea with not-self people think, how do I get rid of this thing that I think of as self, but it's more that the teaching on not-self points to a misunderstanding, an attribution of a thing-ness or a stability or an entity-ness to what is actually a process, that there's not a stable kind of entity that travels through time in this body, but that it's just a whole set of processes that are unfolding, and that that set of processes unfolding is kind of misattributed this stability. 
So I wanted to read a couple of questions from the questions that were submitted and start there, kind of questions about what are practices, they're kind of really practical questions, what are practices for releasing identity or identification, how does one let go of the identity of self to overcome the fear of failure, and so these questions are essentially kind of practical, practice-based, what does it mean to practice with letting go of a sense of self, and what I'd say just to start, and this will be, this is kind of the thread of the whole conversation that I want to offer, that you know there are ways to practice to understand that what we think of a self is not a self, but we do that, how we do that, how we practice with that, is to get to know really well what it is that we think is self. 
So it's kind of an exploration, the practice isn't about how do I let go of it, but how do I understand what I actually think self is, we need to understand what we think self is, and that supports the mind to release it, and we don't do the letting go, it's like you know we don't we don't look at this and say oh there's that self I can let that go, it's more the understanding that we're misunderstanding, and the system kind of recalibrates and lets go of that misunderstanding, nothing really changes except the misunderstanding goes away, so it's kind of a funny thing, but but there are ways that we get caught, we identify with things, this person mentions a fear of failure, we identify like for me I had a very strong identification around anger and self-hatred, and there are many of those identities can be very painful, and so they're suffering bound up often with some of our identities, but not always, you know sometimes our identities are kind of, I think many of our identities in the ways that we attribute a sense of self are kind of strategies for navigating the world, there are ways of ways that we have responded to the world that have kind of become patterns, and those patterns become familiar, and then we kind of have a sense of yeah that's the way I respond to this situation, and I'd say too that those you know those identities, those strategies for navigating life, they're not even the ones that are like like my self-hatred, you know even those, there's something in there where that strategy is somehow trying to help us, you know it's like these strategies are created in our conditions and our conditioning in our lives, and often they are they are trying to help us in some way, and so part of the exploration around getting to know what we think of as self or exploring our identities, and that's one of the ways I like to think about this, how do we how do we begin to understand not-self, we begin to understand not-self by exploring our identities, getting familiar with our identities, and as we get familiar with our identities we see that some of the threads of our identities are kind of tied up with you know reactive patterns in history, and some of those threads are tied up with wishing for our well-being and our safety and the safety of our community and our family and our friends, and so those senses of self are not always wholly you know reactive, and so I think that the investigation or the exploration around what is it that we take to be self, what are what are what what is this identification, what is it that I'm thinking of as self, that kind of helps that investigation or that curiosity begins to help the mind to kind of understand which parts of those of those patterns are based in wholesome wishes for our well-being and our safety and our security and our and so those are meta-wishes actually, those are those those are meta-wishes and many of the strategies that we navigate life with are connected to those meta-wishes but they do get kind of tangled up with fear and confusion and wanting and a version but so they get tangled up, but the the process of exploring the identity with mindfulness and that's a lot about what we can do here get familiar with what we're calling a sense of self with mindfulness, that the mindfulness begins to help the mind tease apart the reactive side from the the side that's actually rooted in wholesomeness and so the the investigation of the exploration begins to help us to to understand that we were calling something a thing that isn't a thing and then begins to tease apart the processes that were embedded in that and help us to let go of the processes that are not so helpful and encourage the processes that are helpful so this this this exploration around letting go of identity I think I think I would put it more can we understand our identities and then the wisdom that develops as we understand our identities helps the system to let go of those parts of the process that are not so helpful and and supports those parts of the process that are more leading in the direction of an ease a heart of ease a heart of connectedness a heart of caring a heart of compassion so I wanted to kind of start there with the kind of that frame that what we explore here one of the big explorations is kind of curiosity about what is what do I call self and we all have many different things that we call self actually when we start to ask this question of ourselves what do I take to be self we might find and we talked about this a little bit last week we I asked you to kind of name some things and and some people talked about identity you know roles you know different roles that you take so you know parent or sibling or student or co-worker or those kinds of things those can be identities and we also identify with particular patterns in our mind habits of mind like for me the identification with the habit of self-hatred it's like oh yeah that's me I hate myself you know so that the we identify with patterns and familiar familiar things that arise so there's a lot of different ways that we identify and over the course of this the the series of reflecting on having conversations about not self we'll touch on a variety of those different different ways social identities that we might reify around or take to be me or mine emotional identities and role identities we'll talk about some of those but tonight what I wanted to aim at was one that the Buddha really highlighted in his teachings there's a one Sutta where he kind of gives a discourse on this teaching of not self and I won't go through the whole discourse tonight because I liked it what I'm trying to do in this class is talk for a short while and then open it up for conversation but we'll go over it during some of the other some of the other classes but a little piece of that is that he points out or asks he asks people to reflect he asks his followers having a dialogue with them and he asks them to reflect so I mean basically it comes down to can you control your body entirely you know it's like we we we can do certain things like I can choose to move my arm or you know you know do certain things physically so there's a little bit of control that I have around my body a little bit of control perhaps I can have around okay I'm gonna breathe in now gonna breathe out now so we have we have little ways in which we have control but we misattribute a a sense of control one of the key ways that the Buddha points to a sense of self coming a sense of self kind of a way that we identify as I or me is the part of our psyche or our system that seems to have control or that feels like it should have control so it we have this attribution of control a lot and we and when we and when we feel like we don't have control over something we usually feel I mean we might feel either that we blame somebody else for that we we feel betrayed by the world or you know somebody else took my control away from me or we blame ourselves we didn't do it right but what the Buddha points to he actually says for various areas of our experience he says you know the body is not self we tend to identify around the body he says the body is not self he said if the body were self then it would be possible to say of the body may my body be thus may my body not be thus but it is not possible to say that of the body because the body is not so and so it's kind of pointing to any he talks about that with respect to feelings and the ways that we perceive things and mind states that arise so emotions for instance he calls them mental formations the Pali is Sankara he says they're not self Sankaras are not self and so that includes the whole range of emotions and mind states and so we could substitute in there a couple of different emotional things like you know we sometimes feel like we should have control over our emotions like why why don't I have control you know why can't I just make the mind not be angry you know it's like it doesn't feel good to be anger why can't I turn it off but the Buddha would say well anger is not self it is if it were self it would be possible to say may my mind not be angry or you know may my mind be may my may my mind around anger be like this but it's often not possible to do that because the anger is a conditioned phenomenon it's arising based on conditions and sometimes those conditions have momentum and so we get to live out that we get to experience that so that I mean sometimes we can step back I mean there is little bits of elements of ways that our system is designed to navigate and choose okay well maybe I won't follow through on that anger or maybe I can repress that anger there so there's there's certain ways that our mind does have some measure of control and that some measure of control that we have it's like it's pretty small actually but our minds pick that up and think yeah I have control I should be able to control these things if I can't control them it means I'm failing or somebody is failing me or the world is to blame or there's something like that and so the one of the things that Buddha is pointing to in this I think one of the things I I find so so interesting is that so many so many ways that we get frustrated so many ways that we get frustrated are are simply manifestations of the fact that we don't have control over something so many ways that we get angry or confused is there's a piece of it around uncontrollability like that that I can't make it be the way I want it to be and the Buddha says that's just evidence for not self it's not a problem it is the nature of experience to have its own unfolding and so the the the kind of the curiosity we can explore around this particular sense of self I think is is to kind of be open to all of those times when there's a sense of I mean I think that this this this sense of self does manifest kind of more obviously perhaps with something like frustration like why can't I make this be the way I want it to be why can't I control this and so when there is that frustration and the mind is kind of railing about well why can't why can't I do this you know why can't why can't I be mindful when I want to be you know that very that that example you know I pointed to it in the in the guided meditation you know the mind will wander we sit down to meditate and say I'm going to be mindful and the mind wanders you know who did that that you didn't choose to have your mind wander it was a process that unfolded but when we wake up we blame ourselves you know we think I should have had control over that but and then the waking up is another whole piece you know it's like who did that you know the waking up happened the the mindfulness return of its own accord that too is evidence for not self so this this piece around the uncontrollability kind of that this is the key piece I wanted to kind of express and then we'll open it up to questions is there's a lot of evidence for this understanding of not self we just don't see it as evidence for not self we see it as a failure of self you know so the fact that the mind wanders is not a failure of the the meditation you know it's not a failure of the meditation its conditions unfolding and if we can explore that I mean if every time we reflected on the re-arising of the mindfulness as being oh evidence for not self that would begin to have a momentum of understanding around not self but no what we do is my mind wandered I I I shouldn't have done that what can I bring my mind back so so yeah there's a lot of evidence for not self actually and this is this is interesting because it's a count it feels counterintuitive right this this teaching of not self it feels like this self is so like obvious you know how can it not be what I think it is and so the but but what that that points to too is that we are not in we're we are misinterpreting the evidence for not self too we don't see it and and this is part of the way views work so we have a particular view for instance a view about something an idea about something and when we have an idea or a view the modern-day psychology calls this selective attention that when we have a particular perspective on a situation our mind based on that perspective will pull things out of the environment that confirm that view and won't pull things out of the environment that disconfirm that view and so the sense of self is like that view it's a view in our minds that we believe this me is here this I has control and so we don't when when we when evidence for not self when this this evidence around uncontrollability presents itself we don't understand it as a as evidence for not self we actually interpreted as evidence that I failed in somehow reinforcing the sense of self so this is a this is an interesting kind of exploration whenever there's a sense of feeling like it's uncontrollable you know maybe something happens like you know your your your washing dishes and the you know the dish lips and the dish breaks and it's like uncontrollability it's like why didn't I control it well it was conditions unfolding it wasn't I that didn't it wasn't an eye there it was just conditions unfolding and so anytime there's something that happens where there's that sense of uncontrollability maybe the mind can turn towards oh evidence for not self and just beginning to explore that as a different view you don't have to pick it up as true yet you don't have to believe it yet you don't have to like believe that this is true but just begin to question your your your perspective of self by kind of countering it with oh well maybe that's evidence for not self that I didn't have control of that so that's that's the main piece I wanted to reflect reflect on tonight and let's just check in and see actually let me break the recording here.
