 Tonight I would like to give a talk. How to practice mindfulness of breathing. In Pali we call Anapana Sati. This meditation, mindfulness of breathing, was practiced by all body sattas before his enlightenment. Mindfulness of breathing is samatha meditation. The purpose of this meditation is to achieve unification, one-pointliness, concentrated in peacefulness state of mind. It's very important to develop concentration first before one starts Vipassana practice. Why? Because the Lord Buddha said in Samadhi Sutta, discourse on concentration, he said, oh monks, develop concentration. The one who has concentration penetrates into things as they really are. This is the reason it's important to develop concentration first. How shall we start to practice this concentration, mindfulness of breathing? Now I would like to give you a brief instruction. This practice according to my instruction. The object of this meditation is breath. So first of all, breathing in, breathing out. Literally, breathing in, breathing out. Fix your mind on the tip of nostril or upper lip where the breath touches. It can be on the right side, right side of tip of nostril or left side or upper lip. Breathing in, breathing out. Breathing in, breathing out. If you can feel the air touches the tip of nostril, then you should fix your attention there. You should not follow the breath up to the head or down to the body. If you follow the air or the breath up to the head or down to the body, you will not be able to develop one-pointedness of mind. So bear in mind, fix your attention on the tip of nostril where the air touches. If you cannot feel the touching point, just be aware of the breath. Feel the nostril. You should not pay attention on the cold or heat of the breath. Heat and cold is the characteristic of fire element. So if you pay attention on heat and cold of the breath, then you are practicing element for element meditation, not mindfulness of breathing. Be aware of the breath. For some people, the breath may not be clear. It doesn't matter. You should not breathe loudly in order to make the breath clear. Whether the breath is clear or not clear, it's not important. Breath is fixed your attention under the nostril where the breath touches. Breath is fixed your attention under the nostril where the breath touches. Your mind may wander here and there. The moment you know your mind is wandered off, you should come back to the breath immediately. Remember not to follow the breath inside the body or outside the body. Fix your attention under the nostril where the breath touches. If you feel difficult to concentrate or the breath is not evident to you, then you should come back to the breath immediately. Then go back to one again, up to eight. The breathing method helps your mind to calm down. If other sensation in the body becomes prominent or clearer than the breath, then you will even so, you should not shift your attention to it. If you shift your attention to it, your concentration on the breath breaks, then you are unable to develop one-pointliness of mind. The breath is your only object. Breathe naturally. You should not breathe loudly to make your breath clear. If you breathe loudly to make your breath clear, you will get tired very soon. The moment you know your mind is wandered off, please come back to the breath. If you allow yourself to think here and there or drifting along with the thoughts, nothing can be accomplished. If you allow yourself to think here and there or drifting along with the thoughts, then you should come back to the breath. Try not to follow the breath up to the head or down to the body. Fix your attention under the nose wheel where the breath touches. You should not focus too strongly. If you focus too strongly, it will cause tension on the head and on your nose. Control your mind not to drift along with the thought. Always fix your attention on the breath. If your mind is well fixed on the breath continuously, there is higher wholesomeness of mind. If your mind is well fixed on the breath continuously, there is higher wholesomeness of mind. If your mind is well fixed on the breath continuously, there is higher wholesomeness of mind. Breathe naturally, simply away of the breath under nose wheel. Accept the breath. You should not pay attention to other things. You should not pay attention to other things. You must have the faith. The mindfulness of breathing helps you to develop deep concentration. Breathe is the method practiced by all bodhisattvas before he became Buddha. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
