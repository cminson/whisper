 So welcome, welcome everybody. Really warm welcome. So here in happy hour, you know, I'm often giving these little introductory talks about you know loving kindness can show up and help you know in this area of your life or make this better and it's gonna be a support here and there and you know I'm often doing these kinds of little talks. And so it would be perfectly natural it would be perfectly natural if while you were doing practicing loving kindness every now and then there would be the mind would lean towards well am I feeling more loving? Is it working? Is it am I being more loving and which would be perfectly natural? But it might get some a certain momentum that might happen where we're getting more focused on well am I I must not be doing it right or may oh I finally got it today and what did I do right that's different today or something like this. So there might be a way in which the checking to see whether we're being loving ends up being more the focus of the practice than actually just practicing. That is there might be a way in which the kind of the ego starts to strive and wants to be able to check the box yes I'm more loving or yes I'm experiencing this whereas the practice of loving kindness is really about some more open heartedness and more spaciousness the opposite of oh do I have it do I got it am I the best am I the worst am I whatever it might be but loving kindness is this opposite movement. So is there a way in which we can practice we can cultivate loving kindness and be aware of when are we as best we can at that time it's not always available to us we are humans but as best we can when are we like opening up relaxing into the practice of loving kindness and when are we constricted and overly concerned about am I practicing loving kindness am I being more loving. So of course we need to check in occasionally to get a sense of whether we're on track but there's a way as I was saying that it can we can get carried away with that. So if you discover that I'm just overly concerned with whether I'm being loving in this moment or being loving in a manner in which I think it should be or ought to be can we just notice that with a loving attitude. Yes of course of course there's the mind the self that wants to be loving welcome come on in and practice loving kindness with me. Something like that some type of just an inviting it in. So I'm talking about is two things one is to recognize the difference between when we're practicing loving kindness and when we are checking in to see if we're being loving yet. And maybe in some ways we might think about as if we were putting some water in a pot on the stove and we're trying to turn on the heat and we're waiting to see if it's warm and in some way it might be like we're picking up the pot up off the stove in order to check to see if it's warm yet and not recognizing that the more that we're checking it's not it's no longer on the stove so the invitation is to put it back on the stove but to put it back on the stove with warm heartedness with tenderness with love with care kind of return to the practice. So one is to notice the difference between checking how we're doing and practicing and two is to when we notice that we're checking in just to bring loving kindness there and in fact that's exactly how we bring it back down to the stove. So this clarity about the difference can be a tremendous support for us and what's completely extra and not needed is any idea of like oh I shouldn't be checking in or I should check in or anything like that that's extra. We don't need that. Every now and then it'll arise but you can just notice yeah I'm not feeling anything in particular right now and just have that be the end or yeah I am feeling a bit more spacious a little bit more relaxed a little bit more warm and then let that be the end of that. So without it having to do this over and over again or building a story what it means about ourselves or something like this. Okay so without as an introduction let's do some loving kindness practice and I even sometimes say this word check in check in with the body. So we'll see how this how this how it goes can we do it in an open-hearted warm-hearted spacious way. So taking an alert upright posture and just feeling into this moment our experience of the moment. Just noticing that you have a body and this body is sitting or in whatever posture you're in. And how does it feel at this moment to be in this posture? Can there be some a brightness as well as some ease? This is such a this can be a practice itself just to find the balance between the brightness and ease. Just perhaps as we find the balance between checking in on our experience doing loving kindness practice and doing loving kindness practice. You might feel the pressure of whatever it is that's supporting us. The chair the cushion couch bed bench feeling connected grounded. And checking in with the sensations of breathing feeling the movement of the chest or the abdomen or the air going in and out of the nose. In some ways letting this movement the rhythm be a support. Kind of like how we like to rock in chairs sit on swings because there's a certain soothing quality of the frequency that periodicity that going back and forth. We tune into that experience. Appreciate it. Just noticing the rhythm. Not breathing, this rhythm that's with us all the time. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Beginning where it's easy. The lovable being. Someone that we know we have a relationship with. An uncomplicated relationship that just fills our hearts with some kind of inner smile when we think of them. Maybe an imaginary kitten, puppies, babies. Or melts the heart. Maybe somebody that has really supported us and helped us in a kind, generous way in our life. A coach, a mentor, a teacher, a guide. An author maybe. Connecting with this lovable being. In whatever way, feels accessible and comfortable. Often we do this by visualizing. But it might also be more of a felt sense. Sometimes I feel like in the heart center, like a little vibrancy. Whatever way feels comfortable for you without striving or straining. To connect with the lovable being. Then to support this connection and the cultivation of loving kindness. You can say these phrases while keeping the lovable being in mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Connecting with our lovable being. Perhaps modifying the phrases using your own words. Is there a way we can relax into? Good will, warm heartedness, care? Good will, warm heartedness, care? May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. Good will, warm heartedness, care? Good will, warm heartedness, care? May you be safe. May you be safe. The sense of warmth or care, sense of openness, spaciousness, like a physical bodily aspect to it. It's perfectly fine if it's nothing obvious. But if there is, can you allow it to grow, to get as big as it would like without forcing it, without demanding anything, but just allowing? And then to expand our loving kindness. To include a friend. Sometimes our relationships with our friends are a little bit more complication than with the lovable beings. We invite them into this field of loving kindness we're creating, abiding in. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease.O May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. You might just notice how does checking in feel compared to practicing with love and kindness, how does that feel? What are the differences? May you be safe. May you be happy. May you live with ease. And then to extend the loving kindness to ourselves, bringing to mind either the felt sense, the experience of being here right now, or an image of ourselves, either as how we are now. Where some people like to begin with the image of themselves as a child. Whatever feels uncomplicated with loving kindness practice, we are always starting where it's easy. May I be saying, may I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be with ease. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be with ease. May I be with ease. May I be with ease. May I be with ease. May I be with ease. Can we expand our loving kindness to people that we don't know, people we don't have a relationship with. May I be somebody you see in the neighborhood. Somebody in this zoom call. Even though we don't know them, can we extend some well wishes. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be with ease. May I be with ease. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be with ease. May I be with ease. May I be with ease. May I be with ease. Feeling your feet on the ground and the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body. When you're ready, you can gently open your eyes. You can be helpful to spend a little time just noticing our habits when we're practicing loving kindness. How much energy is getting towards wishing or thinking or checking or like how we're doing, which is perfectly natural. Of course we're doing that. But just to gain some familiarity. How does that feel compared to loving kindness. Sometimes like use the language of contraction and or spaciousness. But maybe you have your own experience, your own way of like how does it feel different when we're concerned about how we're doing versus when we are sending good will or bringing to mind a loveable being or something like that. Just gaining some familiarity between the differences. When we meet people, when we bring people to mind when we're about to make the phone call or when we pick up the phone and often these days, right. We know who's calling us. So, just to have a little familiarity with this. Okay, loving kindness feels like this. In general, and it's different than this when I'm self concerned. And just having that familiarity can help bring us some awareness to how we're showing up in the world. Maybe, maybe it becomes easier to bring loving kindness to more and more of our interactions. So it can be helpful to talk about these ideas or experiences with others. So now I'd like to invite you to some breakout rooms, be three or four people, and an opportunity to even talk about this idea of checking in how we're doing versus loving kindness, and or maybe sharing how that meditation was for you. So, it's really helpful in these groups to just say a single point, and then let it go to the next person, and they say a single point and then it goes to the next person and then it goes to the next person each one saying a single point. And then it comes back around and you've been influenced by what you've heard and you have something else to say. So, in this way it's kind of a contrived meeting it's not like the usual way that which we chat into small groups. It makes space for the introverts, and it helps make it so it doesn't happen that one or two people take all the time and then at the end, some people may have like just a short amount of time, just kind of helps level the playing field in some way. So, if it's helpful to decide who's going to go first, can use the last digit of your phone number. And we'll say zero comes before one, and whatever phone you use the most, or whichever phone you want to use I guess for this. Okay, whoops, I guess I have to finish this up. And we'll meet for 12 minutes. I guess you'll meet for 12 minutes. Here we go. Welcome back. Welcome back everybody. Does anybody have a comment or question. Yes Diana, yes Diana. Every day is a new day because I've been doing the treats for decades I have never heard of someone doing a retreat with surfing. Only California is going to have something like that. So that's what we had in my group. I'm sure that surfing. Yeah, yeah. That's the first that's you know you never know what you're going to discover, you know, I know what the treats were but I didn't. Anyway, here we go. I'm guessing, Michael. Yeah, yeah. I've never surfed on a retreat myself. Yeah, I just said anyway you surf it I am this is if there's a slippery floor, that's about it. I see there. That's right. That's true. Thank you. Thank you, Rebecca. Anybody there's a Zochen teacher. There's a Zochen teacher that compares. Zochen meditation to surfing. Yeah, in some ways, as a Zochen is kind of like surfing I could see that. Nice, nice. So, maybe to get some actual surveying experience with. So it doesn't have to be so much of a metaphor. Thank you. That's my next project. Okay. There we go. So let's have a comment or a question. There was someone in our group who just lost his wife, and I felt like he was experiencing rather than doing he was really there with the loving kindness towards everyone in the group. Because because grief just really breaks your heart open. Grief really breaks your heart open. Yes, yes. If we let it right that's a natural part or a grieving. Our hearts being broken. And if we can trust us it takes time and if we can just allow it to be there, there can be some poignancy and there that is wouldn't necessarily be there otherwise tender hearted joy. Yeah. I found that the exercise. It's focused on looking at when am I in loving kindness and when am I maybe forcing it or this or that and how do I come back to letting go of any agenda or forcing that that in itself is very loving towards oneself. It opens one towards oneself. One's own experience. Yeah, thank you Abraham. Exactly. It's a way that we can bring loving kindness to all things including when we are unknowingly kind of slipped out of the practice. Yep. Thank you Abraham. That sort of presentation of a put into relief. Well they mix up. It was very helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah right we all do this, and sometimes so much about practices just bring in some awareness to some more and more of our experiences. And maybe I should say some warm hearted awareness to our experiences. Okay well it's a minute past the hour and I want to respect everybody's time. So, with a deep bow of appreciation. And if you'd like we can unmute ourselves and say goodbye, and really wait. So, goodbye. Thank you. Thank you. I really like your share. Bye. Bye.
