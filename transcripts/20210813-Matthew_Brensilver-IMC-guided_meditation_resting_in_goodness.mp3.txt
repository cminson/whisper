 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So welcome. It's sweet to see the names streaming through. So, happy to be with you. And that's it. Thank you. So, as you take your posture, the sense of your body remembering all the practice you've done, all the goodness you've nurtured, all the letting go and the patience, the equanimity, all the stillness, all the determination, just getting a little sense of the wholesomeness of that karmic stream. And of course, we can trace that back further, not just our life, but we're here because of the lineage of understanding, of love, of compassion. Thank you. We're beneficiaries and also will be causes for more goodness in this stream of Dhamma. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Feeling into the blessings of this path, it could have been otherwise, we could have lived a whole life, never, listening to the voices of longing within us, longing to be free. Thank you. Things get quiet, still. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Wherever you are, sound of my voice, but also the inner sounds that we usually just call thinking, Can we just make the entire soundscape one field of distinguishing so much inner sounds, outer sounds? Nausea's moments of silence. Thank you for watching! Please subscribe! Thank you for watching! Please subscribe! Thank you for watching! Please subscribe! Thank you for watching! Please subscribe!

So we relax, we surrender to the imperfection, the human condition. We find ways of giving the heart some rest because so much is asked of our heart. It's not indulgent or self-serving.
