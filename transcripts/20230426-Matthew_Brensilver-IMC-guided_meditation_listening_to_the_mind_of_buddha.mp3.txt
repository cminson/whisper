Welcome, welcome to you all.
So, um, let's, uh, let's sit.
Sit, yeah.
You
The silence beckons us.

Yeah, we, we can, uh, place our attention in a simple way with the breath, with our body, sound, the darkness behind our closed eyes.
With a phrase, a mantra, art practice.
But we don't want the mechanics of our attention to blot out the beckoning of silence.

Um, before I died, Leonard Cohen wrote a few lines of poetry referenced.
Listen to the hummingbird whose wings you cannot see.
Listen to the hummingbird, don't listen to me.
Listen to the mind of God that doesn't need to be.
Listen to the mind of God, don't listen to me.
Maybe that instruction is complete for you, maybe.
The practice is listen, listen to the mind of a Buddha.
But the emphasis is on receptivity, untrusting, trusting awareness of hearing the silence beckons us.

The movements of our mind.
Quite a bit like the body of an animal lulling.
Totally blameless.
We forgive our mind, we forgive some sorrow.
We rest, suspended in silence.
We rest, suspended in silence.
We rest, suspended in silence.
We rest, suspended in silence.
We rest, suspended in silence.
We find the reconciliation between spiritual urgency and abiding patience.

Your practice is to rest from the endlessness of our coping.
coping with the intensity of the human condition.
Just kind of give up trying to sort out all the pleasantness from the unpleasantness,
the hope from the fear, the pros and cons of me.
When we're not coping anymore, there's nothing to do but be awake.
We're not coping anymore, we're not coping anymore.
We're not coping anymore, we're not coping anymore.
We're not coping anymore.
We're not coping anymore.
We're not coping anymore.
