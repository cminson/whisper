The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org. Welcome to
happy hour everyone wherever you are in the world and whatever conditions are
arising for you right now. So for today's practice together I would like to
to share I would like to speak about and also do a guided meditation on joy,
on joy, on delight. Because yes, these are challenging times. These are of
course challenging times. We're all affected in different ways and our hearts
may be breaking, are breaking, seeing the suffering of people that we care about
around us and people that we don't even know around us. People sick, dying,
affected financially, people everywhere around us and then far away in
in different countries, in different continents, no matter who they might be,
we're all part of this human family. So besides our own suffering and pain, our
own worry, our own anxiety, the way we are affected, the way the world is
affected. So not to turn away, not to turn away at all from the pain, from the
sorrow and the challenge and yet and yet not to only give weight to the
difficulty, the pain, the sorrow, the heaviness. Also to honor, to take time to
honor joy, gladness, delight in in our lives and in the lives of others so that
we are not just honoring or bowing to to the challenge, not again not turning
away from it, but also taking opportunities to nourish ourselves, to
nourish our heart and not feel guilty about it, not have a shred of guilt
about our own joy, our own happiness balanced with the challenges of the
world. So why? Why is it important? Why do I even dare to bring in this concept of
joy and happiness and contentment if it may show, if it may, if there may be
lights or or rays of happiness and contentment and joy in the midst of all
this? And that is not to be callous, not to be unfeeling and not to be
self-centered and wrapped up in just our joy or turning away, but actually
seeing joy, happiness, contentment, delight, these wholesome qualities of the
heart as a way to support ourselves, to support our heart, to support ourselves,
to boy ourselves, give ourselves gladness so that we can be more available, so
that we can be more present, so that we can have more resilience to face, to be
with challenge and difficulty, so that we're not completely overwhelmed in the
sadness and depression and overwhelm. So by honoring, by valuing what gives us
joy, what gives, what brings delight and gladness, these wholesome, beautiful
qualities of the mind, it both allows us to be more spacious, more available, more
more, have more samatha, samadhi, stability, concentration, whatever you
want to call it, more stability, let's just call it more stability. How are my,
let our minds have more stability so that we can contain more and we can be
more available, more present for the challenges, more, more fully, our hearts
may, will not be as overwhelmed because they are, they have been rejuvenated and
and have had a refreshing drink from the fountain of gladness and joy. So as if
you were sitting under the cool shade of a tree on a hot day and having a cool
drink for a moment, gaining, settling your composure, feeling the delight and the
joy, how it can make you more available to then head back out into the heat. Because
you have had a bit of a respite. The same way, welcoming, when there is joy
available, turning the mind to what is good, what is wholesome in the heart can
be supportive in that way. So what brings us joy might be very, very simple. For
example, just as you were introducing yourselves, people from the Bay Area,
San Francisco Bay Area, Santa Cruz, from the East Coast, from Utah, middle of the
country, from Canada. As I got a sense, as I heard your beautiful voices, all of
you in this human family together in this hour coming together, the fountain of
joy, really the spark, I felt joy, delight. It's not fancy, it's just
little joy. Wow, here we are. I feel delight. Pamuja. I feel delight. Pamuja
in the word in Pali. Pamuja. I feel sense of delight or piti, joy, this
bubbliness. Ah, I am glad. I am glad. And that nourishes my heart in this moment.
As I sit here, sheltered in place, in my home in Mountain View, California, a sense
of gladness, a sense of being connected, feeling connected to you beautiful human
beings around the countries, around the world. And that gives me gladness. So
whatever might be as I lead you, there might be various suggestions in this
guided meditation in sources for gladness. And again, I want to emphasize that it is
not to be a, to be approached with a sense of self-absorption or guilt, to
really see it as what can be nourishing and serve as a resource for you, both
for yourself and your own life, as well as in the way that you support other
people, other human beings around you. So with that, I would like to ask you to
move into your meditation posture, whatever that might be for you. Settling,
settling in your chair or in your cushion. And gently, if it's comfortable for
you, closing your eyes.
Landing, landing, landing in this body. Ah, a moment of refuge. It's the simple
moment of refuge. Just sitting and breathing. Perhaps letting go formally in
this moment. Maybe in your mind's eye, bowing to thoughts, plans, memories. Perhaps even
if possible, for a moment, to worries, anxieties, and just bowing to them, say
thank you. In this moment, I'm going to take refuge, relax into the body. Take a
moment to take a few moments to nourish myself, my heart, my mind. Then as you
turn inward, as you turn, your gaze inward, feeling the connectedness, feeling
the connectedness of your body to the earth, feeling your feet on the floor,
your legs, contacting the cushion, your bottom, contacting the chair, your back,
these areas of contact. Just resting, just resting, relaxing into. As if there
were suction, tiny little suction cups under your feet, legs, your bottom, your
back, these tiny little, many, many little suction cups. Ah, feeling them, I connect,
really connect, really connect.
Really connect, land, firmly connect, firmly and yet playfully, suction cups
can be kind of playful, especially if they're tiny and numerous. Connect it.
Feeling your hands touching each other or your lap. Maybe there are many suction
cups, lots of them, connecting, feeling the connection, you're too.
Hmm.
As you feel connected, rooted,
stably contacting, stably contacting, let there be a sense of spaciousness as the
breath moves throughout your body, being received one breath at a time.
With each in-breath, bringing more awareness, alertness.
Maybe each in-breath bringing more sense of delight.
As it fills your lungs, your abdomen, your whole body.
And each out-breath, ah, relaxing.
Ah, softening, letting you land more deeply,
dropping in, more deeply as if every in-breath, you're jumping up a little bit,
jumping for joy, feeling you and each out-breath, you land more deeply into the
earth, relaxing the body,
feeling the connectedness,
the connection, the grip of the suction cups.
Ah.
Letting each breath
calm and soothe you like a lullaby.
Just tilling the soil right here for a few minutes of silence.
You
you
you
you
you
and those thoughts, memories arise. It's okay.
Maybe turning to them, noticing them, acknowledging them, with delight, with joy, that you have noticed them.
Joy and delight in your capacity to be aware, not a sense of guilt,
an admonition,
seeing them, smiling at them,
maybe gently saying, thank you, thank you, but not right now.
And turning, turning your attention, your awareness.
Ah, to the nourishing,
awareness of sitting here where you are
and being able to sit and breathe just a simple delight, the joy
of awareness in this moment.
Ah.
The awareness, this ever-persistent, present awareness,
this knowing, whether you're knowing the breath,
being breathed, whether the awareness is knowing
contact points of the body
and the earth,
whether the awareness is knowing sounds,
it's more thoughts arising than this gift of awareness,
being conscious, being aware, this mystery,
this mystery of being human.
Being a child of illusion, the illusion that is this human experience in this body.
Wow, as if you were seeing stars for the first time.
A sense of awe, mystery, the stars are inside,
this magnificent being human, that is you.
Noticing if there can be, if there is a sense of ever-so-subtle
awe or delight that accompanies a sense of awe. Wow.
And let that delight, if there is any, or awe land you more deeply into your body,
not to get heady, but to get more rooted in your first-person human experience
of knowing, sensing.
Maybe there is a sense of delight and joy that's arising.
Being aware of sounds,
either just hearing itself, this magnificent ability to hear
the joy and delight of that, or the content of the sounds for this matter in this month,
that's fine too. Where I am, I hear birds chirping outside my window.
I have a fondness for birds, it just makes me smile.
Being aware of little birdies singing, serenading.
Notice right now as you're sitting wherever you are, there's something present right now
in your environment that you're sensing brings delight, gladness, joy, contentment.
It might be sounds or it just might be that you're sitting comfortably. Maybe there's no pain
right now in your body. Yay.
Maybe you're sitting comfortably in your favorite chair when you're cushioned.
And maybe a soft blanket is around you.
A sense of contentment, maybe gratitude, delight arises.
Letting the sense of joy be held in instability, in the sense of connection
of your body, not to get too heady, not to be like a balloon that floats away in thoughts and
memories. No, grounded here in the body, breathing, the suction cups, don't forget them, they're still
attached. So let the joy, the contentment, be held in the stability of the body.
Letting the breath be the tether, the breath within the body, be the anchor.
As you notice any sense of contentment and joy.
And as I sit here connected to my body, feeling the breath moving in and out,
the sense of delight, contentment. I also hear a distant sound of children
distinctly speaking at a distance. A sense of joy, happiness for their joy.
And for this part I invite you, if there is a child who is just being a child, being happy
right now in your life, you know them, bring them to mind. Or perhaps bring the image of
one of the cute babies you might have seen recently on a sweet video.
Or a memory of a child, you know, maybe they're grown up now, but when they were babies,
children, they were so cute and they were just happy and content. They were fed, they were happy,
that's all. Just bring that to mind. The unbridled joy of children that are happy and content,
giggling with the laughter, the toddlers exploring the world. You can be creative and see what
performs for you here. Conjuring of the sense of a feeling of vicarious joy, happiness for the
happiness of a well-cared for happy child.
Cooling, giggling, whatever works in this image.
Maybe the smile and happiness of children when they get gifts, when they're young,
they love that. Children at Christmas morning. But that brings joy into your heart. It's just
unbridled joy, happiness. And if it works for you.
Maybe saying a couple of phrases of practice of Muddhita, vicarious joy.
I'll offer a couple of alternatives. I am happy for your happiness.
Or your happiness makes me happy.
Or I delight in your joy, in your fullness, fullness of your being.
See, notice in your own body, heart and mind, maybe a smile shows up on your face.
Another alternative phrase you can silently recite.
May your happiness continue, may your joy continue, may it increase, may it never end.
Or the simpler versions again.
Your happiness gives me joy. I delight in your happiness, in your laughter, in your playing.
I wish you well, I wish you more happiness and laughter.
And in the last moments of the sit, I would like to share a poem with you.
Let that wash over you. The name of the poem is A Brief for the Defense.
And it's by Jack Gilbert.
So sorrow everywhere, slaughter everywhere. If babies are not starving someplace,
they are starving somewhere else with flies in their nostrils.
But we enjoy our lives because that's what God wants. Otherwise, the mornings before summer dawn
would not be made so fine. The Bengal tiger would not be fashioned so miraculously well.
The poor women at the fountain are laughing together between their suffering,
between the suffering they have known and the awfulness of their futures.
Smiling and laughing while somebody in the village is very sick.
There is laughter every day in the terrible streets of Calcutta,
and the women laugh in the cages of Bombay. If we deny our gladness, resist our satisfaction,
we lessen the importance of their deprivation. We must risk delight.
We can do without pleasure, but not delight, not enjoyment. We must have this stubbornness
to accept our gladness in the ruthless furnace of this world. To make injustice the only measure
of our attention is to praise the devil. If the locomotive of the Lord runs us down,
we should give thanks that the end had magnitude. We must admit here, we must admit
there will be music despite everything. We stand at the prowl again of a small ship,
anchored late at night in the tiny port, looking over to the sleeping island, the waterfront,
his three shuttered cafes, and one naked light burning. To hear the faint sound of oars in
the silence as a robot comes slowly out and then goes back is truly worth all the years of sorrow
that are to come.
We can do without pleasure, but not delight,
not enjoyment. We must have this stubbornness to accept our gladness.
Thank you all.
So, I notice that we have been visited by a Zoom bomber. Let's wish them well,
that they feel the necessity to come and share challenging difficult epitaphs. Let's wish them
some goodness and ease. Hurt people hurt people, so there must be so much hurt in someone's heart
that they feel like they have to hurt others, so let's wish them well. May they be free,
may they be happy. So, I'd love to ask you, actually, what's arising for you in this moment?
Just one word maybe popping before we go into groups briefly. Just one word. What's arising
for you? Feel free to unmute yourself and speak.
Okay, not much is coming up. That's fine. It's all good. So, let's get into small groups of
three, just for a few minutes and just have some personal connection. That's one part of
these practices that are quite lovely in terms of getting together and exchanging from
people around the world who are doing this practice together with us. What's coming up for
you? And the prompt is, how are you? How are you doing right now? How was this practice for you?
What did it bring up? There's no right or wrong answer and the invitation is to support each other
by offering your full attention and awareness with kindness as the other people are speaking.
And each person will have a couple of minutes. I will put that in the Zoom. Here we go. Great,
to welcome back everyone. So, the floor is open for any reflections, any questions, comments,
complaints. So, please, raise your hand or either physically. I can't see everyone,
but if you, apparently if you press the space bar, that's one way to also raise your hand
and call on you. So, please, would love to hear from you. Your reflections, reactions.
Dunbar, please. Thank you. I loved your meditation. It was very calming, very soothing.
So, thank you. Thank you for that. It was somewhat different than other meditations that I do,
but it was very pleasant. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Yeah.
Yeah, the practice of actually, so what we did was some grounding in the body,
our idea of suction cups just came up for me and it worked for me. Did it work for anybody else?
I mean, I don't know. Yes, I see some smiling faces. You can write in the chat window if it
worked for you or it didn't. I'd be curious if anybody wants to comment on it. But for me,
just it created the sense of, oh, these, you know, I had this image of, you know, there's some,
actually, there's some animals it turns out. I said, is it the animals that walk on,
on ceilings and walls that apparently have tiny, tiny suction cups all over
their, their, their fingers and toes. And so, so that's the little image I had. And apparently,
I think I remember these, maybe they're geckos, they're green. So I have the image of all these
suction cups being tiny, little green, cute. So for me, it's like, oh, this is how I'm really
connected and rooted. So that worked for you. Please feel free to use it. Sometimes new things
come up in the Dharma anyway. Lovely. Thank you, Dhandar. Joe, and your hand is up, please.
I just wanted to say thank you so much for making this practice available to us.
And although I didn't feel, I was telling the two people I was talking to, I didn't really feel
a sense of joy because it's been a difficult time for me. But it was still, it just, it was able
to provide some stillness within me. And I really loved that poem that you wrote. I thought that was
so appropriate for what we're going through. You know, we loved it. Thank you so much for that.
Thank you, Joan. Thank you so much. And tell you what, actually, I'm going to put,
since this is Zoom and since it is possible, I'm going to put a link to that poem
in the chat window. Here we go. Let's see. There. So here you have it.
Brief for the defenses. There are many poems on this page from Jack Gilbert and
Brief for the Defense is the last one on the list. So, yeah. Yeah, great.
Barry says, Suction Cups made me think of breathing in at the nostrils. Ah, interesting.
What was that? Was that helpful for you, then, Barry?
Going to unmute you. Oh, can you just mute it here? Unmute it again.
Hmm. Not working. I see one. Okay, there we go. Sorry. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, that's the first thing that popped in my mind. I think of the breath in my nose
as being sucked at and pulled out. But yeah, I too liked the poem. I am glad you put the link
because I wasn't present for all of it. And I want to look at it again. Yeah, yeah.
I would be present. But yeah, I really like being able to connect on the small group level
because I'm always curious to find out about other people's practices. And yeah, I love the
opportunity to connect with people and find out where they are with the practice and stuff.
So yeah, thanks for saying that. Thanks for saying that for us. Yeah, of course. Thanks for
participating in that. And it is, I find it very meaningful to have the one-on-one connection in
this way. It's very unique. It's very different from having Zoom meetings, work Zoom meetings by
this feels very different, this facilitated, you know, really hearts connecting. So thanks
for mentioning that. Another thing I wanted to say actually in connection to what Dunder said
earlier about this meditation felt very different from what you're used to. I wanted to say that
besides the settling that we did at the beginning, the practice of muddhita, a vicarious joy,
which is one of the four Brahma viharas, one of the four cultivations of the heart,
is not taught that much. Either people teach metta or compassion, maybe some equanimity,
but you know, muddhita gets short-shifted. And I think muddhita is so important at this time
to support ourselves with all the Brahma viharas. Yes, there isn't metta. Of course,
there's plenty of compassion because there's plenty of suffering in the world right now.
And equanimity, we need that in order to get completely out of whack. And yeah, let's bring
some more attention to muddhita, vicarious joy, happiness for other people's happiness, or just
a sense of delight, which by the way, when muddhita is turned to ourselves, it becomes
gratitude, which is happiness for our own happiness. So it is seven o'clock and I'm going to formally
end the session. And thank you all for coming tonight and practicing together for both yourself
and to support all the beings everywhere through your practice. May all beings be well,
may all beings be free. Yeah. And after closing formally, I'm going to stay on for 10 minutes
until seven, 10. If anyone has any burning questions, the same way I would wait, I would
be in the hall for an extra 10 minutes. I'm going to offer that. So thank you,
and whoever wants to get off. See you maybe tomorrow. Bye.
