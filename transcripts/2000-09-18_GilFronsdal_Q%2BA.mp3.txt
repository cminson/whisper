 Rather than me giving a talk, I would like to try to devote the evening to more questions and answers, partly so that I could hear the kind of concerns that are on your minds and the kind of interests that you have. Also, the rest of us can hear those kinds of questions and concerns. Hopefully that way the evening can be relevant directly rather than me guessing at what's relevant. And in order to warm you up, now I've told you this is going to happen so you can think about it a little bit, I thought that I would teach you a chant, a very simple chant. And would you like to know, as in Pali, would you like to know the meaning of the chant before you chant it or after you chant it? Before, in case it's some kind of spell, this is the sentence, and nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. So that's, and the words are sabe, which means everything or all, dhamma, dhamma is the word dharma, which in this context means everything, all things. And nalam, nalam means not at all. And abhi, nayee, abhi, nayee, saya, which means kangtu or identified with. Sabe, dhamma, nalam, abhi, nayee, saya. So I'll chant it one word at a time and then you can repeat the word after me. And then once I think that we've gone through a few rounds and I think we've all kind of have it a little bit, then we'll just chant it all together. And you might think about this as you're chanting it, the meaning of it then. Nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. And see if you really believe that. And we can maybe, in our questions answered period, we can discuss those things which, those exceptions which you have come up with. Saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, saya, say sah, binn, dhamma, nalam, abhi, nevi, sah, yam, sah, yam. That's it. Thank you. You might use this chant at times when you're clinging. See if it helps. Something hold on to, yeah. There is a principle that some dharma teachers teach is that rather than letting go of everything, all your clinging, what you do is you let go of that which is less useful to cling to and cling to what is more useful. Until you realize after a while, after you do that well and you're clinging something good for a while, then after a while you realize that's kind of a problem. So you let go of that and then cling to something which is even better. And you keep clinging to something that's better and better and better until finally there's nothing left to cling to. Or you realize that clinging to nothing is really the best. So in this strategy you don't have to just feel bad about all your clinging. You just have to do it progressively better until finally you can let go. So, yes please Marty. I might have missed this introduction but in the context of this chant what is the meaning of the word dhamma? All things, things. All things. Well the sabha means all and dhamma here means things. And in this context it's anything that's a thing. How does it relate to other, I mean how does it relate to dhamma for example? I see. The other meanings of the word. So the word dhamma or dhamma in Pali has a lot of different meanings. There's one traditional Buddhist dictionary that gives something like 54 definitions for the word. One of the more common definitions that most of us might know is it means the teachings of the Buddha, the dhamma. And so there's a lot of different discourses of the Buddha. You can take Richard Henkman's class and learn about the dhamma, the direct teachings of the Buddha. A little bit more profoundly the dhamma is not just a teaching of the Buddha but the practices of the Buddha taught and the realizations that come from that practice. The kind of the insight the person has, the way the mind has changed, the realizations that come. In a different way the dhamma means some people translate dhamma just meaning nature. Some Buddhist thinkers will call it nature. Buddha Dasa is a famous Thai monk. He takes it to be the equivalent of the word God in Christianity or Judaism. And he raised a lot of eyebrows in Thailand when he equated the two. Not necessarily the same but just the equivalent kind of status in their respective religions. But some people translate it as nature, the nature of things, the natural order. Buddhism feels that there's a kind of order to life, a natural way in which life unfolds. Certain things which are naturally true, certain basic laws of life. And so dhamma is the laws, the underlying laws of reality of life. And in more traditional Hindu or Indian meaning which Buddhism fits within, dhamma can mean duty. So your dhamma is your duty or your destiny, your obligation or your, I mean probably a better English word than duty but your calling, perhaps something like that. But the word dhamma also can simply mean thing. It also means mental states. There are six sense doors in Buddhism, the ways in which we perceive the world around us or in us. And there are the five senses we know about, usually the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and the textile sense of the body. And Buddhism says that there's a sixth sense door which is that's a place of perception within you that can recognize what goes on internally, your thoughts, your feelings. So if you're thinking and you know you're thinking then the mind door is alert. All the things which the mind door knows are called dharmas, the mental things. So in some situations it's very clear dharmas means the world and mental content in a sense. But in this chance it means everything because there's absolutely no thing which is worth clinging to, including the dharmas the Buddha taught. The Buddha gave a very famous simile of the raft where he said, you don't know it? How many don't know it? The raft simile? If a person comes to a river and has to cross the river using a raft and happens to be one there on this bank of the river and the person crosses the river and gets to the other side and then continues on his or her journey and into the jungle. But rather than leaving the raft on the river, picks up the raft and puts it on her shoulders and starts walking through the jungle carrying this big raft. And the Buddha asks, is that a smart thing or not? And the right answer is, no that's not smart. Once the raft has been used to carry across the river you don't need it anymore and you should leave it behind. So in the same way the dharma that I taught, the Buddha said, is like a raft. You use it to get across the river of samsara and once you're across you leave it behind. So specifically the dharma was specifically in a sense a cure to clinging but don't cling to that please. If you cling to the medicine then it's hopeless. So don't cling to the medicine. So it's the only religion I know about that in a sense self-destructs. Yes? The Buddha evidently left, wife and house. Does he know anything specifically to say what about relationships with couples and partnerships? Yes, the Buddha gave a number of discourses that were more specifically addressed to lay people. A lot of his discourses were addressed directly to his monastics who kind of, most people hung out around him. And there are some discourses in relationship to domestic life, family life. And you very correctly used the word partnership back then. The discourse, one of them for example, he really talks about their husband and wife. And in our modern world we realize there are many more options. And he talks about the obligations of each to the other. And I don't remember what they are, I didn't memorize them. But a lot of them are just kind of common sense, kind of good decent things and offer friendship and support and confidentiality and kind of things like that. Maybe if you want, one day I can bring in that particular discourse and we can go over it a little bit. He talks about, there's a beautiful discourse where there's a Brahman, I think it's a Brahman's son. And the Brahman's had a lot of rituals that they were supposed to do. And this Brahman's son, his father had died and he had promised somehow to his father that every day he would honor the six directions. I guess it was meant to be north, east, south, west, up and down. And so he was doing the scholars rituals and he told the Buddha, I'm doing all the stuff to honor my dead father. And the Buddha said, well that's a good thing to do, but let me tell you a better way to honor the six directions, a better way to honor your father. And then each of the six directions he talks about some category of beings in life we live. Our friends and how to honor our friends, our family, it goes around, I don't remember it so well. So he does have some teachings about that. But in a sense it's more like common sense. Usual teachings he gave for lay people to help them with their lay lives were not directly connected to the path of liberation. They were more connected to the path of being happy, how to be happy, how to live a peaceful, harmonious life. Peaceful harmonious life being a different goal than liberation. And that's a very interesting, that's a very interesting, because most of us maybe want it to be the same thing. We want to be happy, we want to be peaceful. But actually the Buddha taught two different paths. And the path of Vipassana is the path of liberation. Yes? So it's been about 20 years since medicine has tried to incorporate meditation as a therapy to help just normal people that maybe suffer from stress or stress-related illnesses. And in about those 20 years it seems like there's been a lot of spin-offs of therapeutic uses of meditation and various people teaching how to make use of meditation in an average life. And since I've come to the saunhau and practiced a little bit and understood some of the content behind this type of meditation, I've been wondering what your opinion is on all these other versions of meditation. Because it seems on one hand you're entering or creating a state that should be universal. But on the other it really does seem like the content and the message of text, both the depth, quality, and result of the meditation. Very good question. So it's a very good question. I don't know if I can do justice to you, a good question, but I'll make an attempt. Generally, as you started, I reflected on that I haven't actually taken the time because it hasn't been my inclination, I think, to really formulate an opinion about people who do bring mindfulness to stress reduction and pain management and various kinds of areas in the health field. I mean, generally I have a very good opinion about it. I think it's really great. It's fantastic. It's been a lot of benefit to a lot of people. It's very powerful. Mark Abramson, who does the work at Stanford, has done a lot of really good work for a lot of people there. And other people around. There's other people in our Sangha here who have taught mindfulness-based pain and stress work outside of a Buddhist context in various settings. And it's really been dynamic. Sometimes you have actually have much more dramatic benefits in that kind of settings than you have here. Because a lot of people come here, they've kind of read maybe a lot of books, and they're kind of warmed up to the idea it generally fits into kind of somehow their worldview a little bit perhaps or something. But when they go to, the doctor sends them to a stress reduction class as part of a hospital. I mean, some of these people have never heard about meditation in their life, you know. And they've never had a spiritual thought in their whole life. And so, you know, it's such a radically new teaching. But sometimes the radicals of it can sometimes, kind of like beginner's luck, can kind of shift the person quite dramatically, very quickly. But not always in the best direction. Remember John Travis who did this work for a little while. He's a teacher who, he's going to be here not this Thursday, but the next Thursday. He's going to be a teacher or a Thursday group. He was doing his work through a hospital and was a retired policeman from Los Angeles in his class who had a lot of back pain. And one of the basic kind of instructions in this kind of work is bring your attention on the pain. And he never heard that message before. I mean, the message he heard all his life was avoid the pain at all costs. And the result was he got furious at John, really angry. And John had to deal with all this anger. I don't know if that guy stayed in the class. But anyway, it can be very dramatic and very effective, very helpful for people. I think that there can be a difference in the context. I don't know if it has to be. Because very deep awakenings, very deep experiences of awakening and realization can happen in any context at all. It's not really context dependent. It depends on a lot of different situations that kind of feed into it besides the particular class or whatever. But as one friend of mine said, enlightenment is an accident. But meditation makes you accident prone. And I think that what happens in, what can happen, I think, when there's a teaching, but what happens, I think, sometimes in stress reduction work outside of Buddhism, sometimes in Buddhism, perhaps, but is that people get the impression that it's mostly about stress reduction. It's mostly the message about coping better. And it's a kind of a therapy. And for many people, they're trying to, are not coping very well, and a lot of struggle in their life, a lot of stress. And so they are using their Buddhist practice mostly as therapy. There's nothing wrong with that at all. It's actually necessary for some people for a period of their time, of their life. But in a sense, one of the things that can happen is that they're actually developing a stronger sense of self, a stronger sense of self-identity and a stronger understanding of who they are. They might actually become a more relaxed, peaceful soldier who has war. There's all kinds of professions, and maybe arts are wholesome, or activities people do, that they get a little bit less, they just learn how to get more distressed as they do it. What the teachings of Buddhism offer, the practice of mindfulness, is a challenge that you really question very deeply some of the fundamental assumptions that you cling to, or that you operate by. And if you really want to use Buddhism to go to its full depth, there has to be this very deep questioning that goes right down to the core of your very being. And without the kind of a context, I encourage you to do that questioning, or without a container for the practice that allows you to develop a lot of concentration, so that questioning goes really deep. You're not going to be so accident-prone. So, for example, one of the things that we encourage people to do, who are very serious about the path of liberation, is to go on retreats, if they can. And retreats is one of the various things you can do to help create a stronger intensity in the experience of meditation, so that you can get down there to the very core of the foundation of your sense of self, and have the rug pulled from under you. As a spiritual discipline, meditation sometimes is very frightening. Whereas, as far as a stress reduction program, I've never heard of anyone being particularly frightened by that. Because it's great, you know, I'm calmer, I'm less relaxed, I have less pain. But when you really follow through in a very serious way as a spiritual discipline, sooner or later you're going to encounter fear, because the very central kind of core way in which you've organized yourself and organized your perception of the world is called into question. And so then you want to be in an environment that understands that fear, understands that the possibilities beyond the fear. That helps you and provides you with a protective and safe environment to go through that. And I don't know whether kind of a standard secularized version of mindfulness could offer that deeper context for that kind of deeper work. I know some of my friends who are Vipassana teachers who have also taught this mindfulness-based stress and pain reduction work, have kind of been concerned that some of the people teaching their work are doing it without any background in meditation at all. They just go to Massachusetts, they do a five week or eight week or something course, and then they set themselves up doing this kind of work. And they're probably very effective for a lot of people, but there are times when, if they don't really have personal experience of what they're teaching, and they don't know some of the challenges people go through and some of the interesting places that might open up for them, they can't really be helpful. And it might actually be a little bit dangerous. Meditation is a little bit dangerous, you know. It's risky, you know, it has a certain element of risk to it. Did you know that? Good, I'm glad you know that. Yes? Can you make a comment, if I might, about what you said about fear? What happens, in life experience, a number of times, in different levels of something happening, or something shifting inside of you, that the fear has manifested itself in anger? And that's the kind of danger that when there's not no what's going on, that can, for all of us, be dangerous. It manifests itself as a certain thing. Absolutely. So, for example, someone who's teaching, if they don't know that that's possible and all this anger comes at them, then they might actually just get angry back or do something unskillful. But hopefully someone who's well trained in teaching mindfulness or in teaching meditation will understand that sometimes the anger will be directed at them or at other things, and understand that as part of the path and know how to work with it. And the other thing that's very important is that, it's also the same thing happens in therapy, which is known by many people, is this kind of anger or frustration can build up because of the fear or the challenges that come with it, with kind of personal change. And sometimes it manifests as anger outwardly directed. And one of the things that results from that is we often will leave. We just forget that that's practice, you know, or forget, you know, they probably have better spiritual practices down in Essalyn where they have hot tubs. So I'm going to sign up for whatever's next there. So when there's a lot of frustration or a lot of difficulty or anger with a therapist or with a spiritual practice, it's useful to take it in stride and not to jump to conclusions and make decisions in the midst of the anger, but rather to somehow work with the anger and maybe talk about it, you know, if it's directed to a teacher, bring it to the teacher. And hopefully anyone who's a meditation teacher is willing to be the recipient of anger, otherwise they shouldn't be a teacher. Uh-oh. Yes. When you were talking earlier about Dhamma, you said that talking about the six sense doors and that the six awareness of the internal states, it seems like when we're meditating, that's more or less what we focus on, kind of diminishing the other senses. We're not looking, we're not listening, we're not tasting. And is that the case? And if so, what is the rationale behind focusing on that particular sense and how does that help us to reach awareness? Well, that's an interesting question. So you all heard that. I think it was loud enough. So the question is, it seems to him that in meditation we're primarily focusing on the mind door of the six senses. I mentioned the sixth one is the mind door, internal door, kind of looking inwards. And it seems like the primary door that we're looking at in meditation. And then what about the other doors? How do we relate to those? And I don't think it's quite accurate. I think there's a, we tend to heighten their awareness of the internal life, the mental life, the thoughts, the reactions, our feelings, our emotions. But just one thing we pay attention to, and some people kind of give extra attention to that because they're very interested in our inner life. Some people have never paid attention to it. It's useful to encourage them to pay attention to their inner life. Some people have never really paid attention to their thoughts before, not carefully, not really to track their thoughts, to really see in the course of a day what they're really thinking about. And that's very valuable to do. But in pure mindfulness meditation, you're not actually choosing which door you're focusing on. It's more like the image of the six doors in Buddhism is sometimes depicted in an image of a house that has five windows and a door. And so each sense is either a door or a window in this house. And my extension of this is the practice of meditation is it's a little one room little house. In the middle of that one room there's an easy chair. And you sit there in the easy chair, completely relaxed and at ease, willing to greet whatever appears in any window or through the door. And you don't really care, you don't have an agenda, you can't even control what comes up at the different doors or the windows. But you just notice what happens. So if something arises in the window of the eye, you just note seeing. When something arises in the window of hearing, you note hearing. When something arises in the window of the tactile sensations, you're aware of tactile sensations. And when something arises in the window of a thought or the window of the mind, maybe that's the door of the little house. Then you're aware of a thought arising or feeling arising or a reaction arising. And you actually don't give any preference to either direction. And some people who teach meditation, very traditional teaching, is when you do meditation you actually go either outward nor inward, in terms of your intention of what you're trying to do. You don't go out to the outer senses, you don't go inward either. You don't go either direction, you just sit in the middle of that easy chair and let the world just come to you. But it seems like the way the process is set up, we're doing this in silence, we're closing our eyes, we're not moving, so we're not only kidding him, you're just sort of in his kinesthetics. But it seems like the way it's set up, it kind of focuses you more on that internal. It definitely does with the eyes closed and all that. However, one of the things that, especially for a beginning meditator, one of the things we're encouraged to do is to pay attention to the breath. And the breathing, the sensations of breathing, belongs to the tactile world, tactile sense. I read one story of a man who went to Burma to practice, and he was told to do breath meditation, and he went to his teacher the first, second day of the retreat and said, I have all these thoughts and feelings and reactions to what's going on here, let's talk about it. And the teacher kind of set himself up and his full authority said, what goes on in your mind is none of your business. The instructions are to stay with your breath. And it can be a great relief, just stay with your breath, don't worry about that stuff. And some people get into that stuff with their mind, their thoughts, their feelings, and they're just like, it's an endless maze, you know, never get out of it. So we want to be careful not to be trapped in there either. We can talk more about it, but you're best of tune. So I think it's easy for Westerners, especially because we operate in our mind so much, to be confused when you're doing a simple noting, that instead of just noting when you place your foot in walking meditation hardness, it's a million things, gravity, etc., etc., pressure. Those are concepts, right? Right. So it seems to just get to the basic noting of what's happening is, I don't know how to actually praise it, but for me I sometimes get caught up in my concepts. And I don't even realize that I'm in concepts. But it seems like if I could just get to what is really right in front of me, it would make things a lot easier. So I've said that in a very conceptual way. You said it very well, you said it very concisely, and that's really a very, very essentially important part of mindfulness practice, is to help us to see the distinction, difference between our conceptual understanding of life, which is how most people understand life, and what's actually directly happening in our senses. Because if you start seeing the difference between those two, then you don't have to, you see there's an alternative to your concepts. And also if you see the difference between the two, you can see how your conceptual life gets born and gets created, and then you have much more control over it, and much more choice around it. And most people live most of the time in their conceptualizations. Sometimes it's in very abstract conceptualizations. And sometimes my abstract conceptualization is about myself and about you, collides with your abstract conceptualization about me and yourself. And we never meet each other. It's just like these concepts are kind of missing each other, or crashing or whatever. And part of the function of mindfulness is first to help us slow down the mind enough, comment enough, so that we're no longer living in those concepts all the time, and then give a chance to see something which is non-conceptual, the direct experience, the direct physical sense or experience. And for some people that's a great relief to know that's a possibility. Just stay with your breathing. Very matter of fact, what goes on in your mind is none of your business. Some people, that's a great relief. I don't have to fix it, I don't have to have good thoughts, I don't have to have different kind of thoughts, I don't have to have different feelings, you know, have those feelings, no thoughts, you know, it's none of my business. That's right. You don't have to be a good person. All you have to do is follow your breath. And it's a great relief, you know, let those things kind of be in the background. They're relaxed. If you put most of your attention on your breathing, and if you notice there's any more attention you can bring to your breath, just bring as much as you can to the breath in a gentle way. Everything else will calm down with time. Nancy. I once had a teacher who was for walking meditation, she would recommend on occasion that I rotate the tennis doors, just to open me more. And what do you think about that? As just a reason? I think it can be fine. I can imagine myself giving that instruction to some particular person. It seems like a good instruction to do. But I've never given... It's not happening all the time, of course. Yeah, I think it's a fine thing to do. I've never given that instruction, I think, because I have a tendency towards letting the mindfulness be choiceless, to some degree. So you don't necessarily choose which sense door you pay attention to. But if someone has a fixated personality, for example, and they start kind of being too narrow in their focus and not really aware of more parts of their life, then I think it can be very useful to ask them to open up. Actually, one place I do that for some people is... There are two general places where I encourage people to pay more extra attention if there's a need. One is in their body. People don't feel their body very much. And I tell them, you just spend some time exploring your body, do body sweeps and scans, and just do whatever you can to feel your body. And then the other is for some people to actually pay attention more through their feelings, their emotions, people who are out of touch with them, and some people are. And sometimes, actually, I encourage people to pay particular attention to their thoughts, kind of cognitive therapy, because thoughts are very powerful and very important. If you don't pay attention to them, you don't really notice a big part of how you're operating. Yes, please. You mentioned earlier, everything I've always heard about the pastana is to be in the present moment, just the way it is, and just notice things as they come up. You were also talking about the deep questioning of how you operate and stuff like that. So how do those two come together? Is that just part of the process of just meditating? That is a natural outcome of that? Or when you come out of meditation, you kind of reflect on what was going on, and that's where the question ends. Good question. So the question is, to those of you who didn't hear it, she's heard that mindfulness practice is mostly just being present in the present moment for things as they arise. And I talked about the value of very deep questioning earlier. And how does the deep questioning come together with just being present for things as they are? Different teachers will have a little bit different teachings on this. Some teachers will actually encourage you to have specific questions. And as you get quieter and more concentrated, to use your power of questioning, to really look very carefully at what's going on. Once you have the ability to be in the present moment, and the mind doesn't drift off a lot, and your concentration is stable enough, you can stay in the present, and they'll say then start looking at the different things that arise. And for example, you can start questioning, is this myself? Is this the self? And that's one line of questioning that some teachers teach, it's very powerful, you just keep looking. Where is the self? Is that the self? Is that feeling the self? You look at it carefully, and usually after a while you feel like, that doesn't qualify as the self. And so, okay, so what is it then? It must be something else. And you keep looking, and looking, and looking, and you start seeing that nothing in your experience really qualifies to be the self. Well then what? And that can be very powerful to do that. So it's a, because I'm relatively new, that's probably more advanced. Probably. Okay, because I feel like, well, if I follow the questioning, then I'm going to get into my mind more, then I'm going to go off on the trail. Right. What some, and what some teachers, some teachers don't teach questioning so much, but rather what they teach is, is, is, is just, not questioning in terms of like, with a question, but right, but it's sometimes described in the Zen tradition as always having a doubt. So whatever arises, you're not going to, you're going to pay attention to it, but you're not going to settle for it. So you're going to look more, you're going to look more closely. What is this? What is this? What is this? And so you're developing your concentration and, and mindfulness together, and you can still learn, still, and still looking more and more deeply into your experience. And, and that's another way of kind of getting underneath the veils of illusion, to the core of what's actually going on. So I like different ways. But even for some, it's relatively new. I think it can be very valuable to do some questioning. It might not be in the context of your formal meditation practice, outside of your meditation, to be, to do some reflective work, contemplative work, to use the calm you've acquired, if you've got a little bit of calm in your sitting, to use that calm as a foundation, to start reflecting a little bit about your intentions in life, your values in life, your understanding of your life, your understanding of yourself and the world around you, and start questioning it, and use that calm to, is it really so? One of the interesting things that can happen, for example, from the perspective of meditation, is that many of the things we normally value in life can have a very different perspective, very different value from the point of view of the peace or well-being that come from meditation. If you know, if you've tasted a sense of great well-being in meditation that wasn't dependent on how much of a promotion you got, what relationship you were in, what kind of financial security you had, what kind of house you lived in, what kind of car you had, all these kind of things that some people are quite preoccupied about, and they tie their happiness to. When you realize that you can have a deep sense of well-being without those things necessary, that changes sometimes your perspective on the value of those things. It doesn't say that they're invaluable necessarily, but just, oh, I know a sense of well-being is not tied to that, and maybe I won't put all my eggs in that basket then. So, doing some reflective work at the end of meditation is sometimes very useful. Yes, Elizabeth? The last one then will stop. It seems to me that teaching, you know, proves themselves again and again as being worthwhile. Kind of surprisingly so. But I was wondering if, you know, there are some teachings that you disagree with, and then if you do, how do you hold that? Like, what criteria do you use? Do you just say, oh, well, don't like that one, I'll just ignore that over there? Or do you have some criteria for something that you disagree with? Or how do you hold things? Because the teachings, I mean, they kind of build up a certain level of trust because they keep proving themselves as being worthwhile. This was a good question. So, I mean, in the teachings of the Buddha, for example. So, how do you decide which ones are worthwhile and which ones are just a bunch of baloney? And who am I to decide the teachings of the Buddha are baloney? What criteria am I going to use? You know, so, so... So, you know, so, I'm going to give you an example. Maybe, you know, there's a teaching that says that women cannot become Buddhas. Now, is that baloney? Or you bet. And, and upon which criteria are you basing that opinion on? On whose part? I see. So, so, you know, I think it's pretty dumb. But, you know, am I going to stand up in the face of all of Buddhism and say that's not true? I think so. But, but, you know, but, you know, I prefer not to have an opinion. I'd rather not even talk about or even look at that part of Buddhism because we can do quite well without it. None of my teachers ever brought up that teaching. All my Asian teachers never talked about it. It was never seem to be part of it. The only reason I knew it was part of Buddhism is because I read some old, musty ancient text that said it. And then we make it that we get upset and get, you know, but just an ancient text. So the Elizabeth question is, you know, upon what criteria do you use to decide whether some teachings are true or false? And that question was asked to the Buddha. And the Buddha gave a number of different answers to that. And he said, you have to consider this carefully. And he said, you know, if it's in very broad strokes, he said once, if it's in line with the teachings in general, then it's fine. But more specifically, he said, very interesting, a number of places, he said, if the teachings are conducive to disenchantment, the fading away of greed, hate and confusion and delusion, and true liberation, then you can be reassured that it's part of the teaching. And what he means by disenchantment is disenchantment. No longer being enchanted. Not in a nice French way, you know, which whatever, you know, it's kind of, but rather, you know, living in illusion. So if it helps you break through the illusions of your concepts and then helps you to have a fading away of your clinging, of greed and hate and confusion and all that, and leads to the experience of not clinging at all, then you can take that to be the teaching. So that was one criteria you used. And for me, what that means is that it makes the teachings very simple. And it's like kind of like the raft. You know, raft is actually, you know, it's not like an ocean liner or some fancy yacht or, you know, raft is really simple, very simple, kind of tie some pieces of wood together and you go across. You don't need a lot. The dharma doesn't require very much. It requires very little props, very little ritual, very little. In a sense, the non-clinging requires nothing at all. And in a sense, non-clinging is the deepest teachings, the deepest experience that Buddhism is pointing towards. And non-clinging requires nothing at all. So, you know, as we look, you know, are these teachings helping me not to cling? If they are, they're great. If they're helping you to cling, then be careful. I went to a, maybe I shouldn't say this just before you brought all to leave, but I get the wrong message, but when one abbot that I saw in Thailand, he told me, if you go to a monastery and you find that the teachings and practices are useful for you, then stay. If you find that they're not useful for you, leave so quickly you don't even say goodbye. Now, I disagree with that. And the reason I disagree with that is that I think that if you disagree with someone, rather than just leaving, just saying forget that, I think it's best for everyone concerned that you come and say that. You know, you said something and I don't really agree with that, that doesn't really work for me. And, you know, I'm going to go, Deslan, or whatever. I think it's really helpful. And for everyone concerned, it's respectful to do it that way. And it gives everyone a chance to kind of help clarify. Because I think everyone's a student. Teachers are students as much as students are students. And so, if we used to always walk away, then we all lose an opportunity to learn. But I like it anyway. The message was still, you know, it's very significant. If it's not helping you, that you should really then act on that and don't just be complacent. Yes? More equal than others? Buddha is kind of a little bit special. For example, a number of people now have walked on the moon, right? I don't know. Half a dozen or so people have walked on the moon. But the first person to walk on the moon is really a special person. You know, we kind of think that guy's really, you know, something amazing. And so, a Buddha is always by definition the person who discovers the Dharma for the first time. And the Buddhist cosmology says it's actually kind of a yoyo theory of the cosmos, that the worlds arise and they pass, and they arise and they pass. And our particular world system, we have Shakyamuni Buddha. So we can't be any more Buddhas now. We've had ours. But eventually, you know, the cosmonal collapse and our world system will disintegrate and then a new one will arise and then they'll have to have their own Buddha in the future. And, you know, the person who discovered it for the first time. And the teaching is that that has to have a particular gender. It's just in the next world that arises has gender. So I hope that this was useful to have the questions and answers this evening. And please remember this very important, not the chant, at least the teachings of the chant. Nothing whatsoever is worth clinging to. Thank you.
