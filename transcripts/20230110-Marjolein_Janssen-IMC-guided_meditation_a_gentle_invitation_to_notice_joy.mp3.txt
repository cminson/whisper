 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. You can start with settling into the meditation posture, finding a posture that is relaxed and also alert. Your upper body is upright as much as possible. We can tune into the body, the feeling and overall sense of the body sitting here. Not giving the feet touching the surface beneath it. And the buttocks touching the surface beneath. Just noticing the sensations, the pressure, warmth or coolness, softness or hardness. And the hands touching each other or maybe the thighs or the knees. Feeling the pressure there, warmth or coolness. And we can invite the body to relax. Maybe there will be some relaxation, of course, far as possible right now. You can tune into the mind. You can tune into the mind, noticing there's maybe a lot of thoughts spinning around, or maybe a calm and easeful energy, maybe something in between. Noticing what is here right now. Sometimes it's possible to relax the mind as well. Just by inviting it, may the mind relax. May there be some ease and relaxation in the mind. Our practice is to just be aware of whatever is most predominant in our experience. This can be the breath, bodily sensations, like pressure or discomfort, relaxation. It can be hearing. It can also be mind processes, like thinking, emotions and feelings, moods, attitudes. Just being aware whatever arises in this moment, on each moment will be different. And our attention can just follow what is happening. For this meditation we can also see if there's any joy or contentment, ease, present at times. We're starting to notice the little moments that there might be some ease, some joy, some kindness. This is a very gentle background invitation. The invitation to just notice whenever that arises, not to make things happen, just to notice. Big wanaleo, the monk, he suggests that in every moment of mindfulness there is also a subtle joy that comes with that. A subtle joy of being in the present moment. This is a very easy way to tune into a little bit of joy, this subtle joy, if it is available for us. It might be and it might not be, we can just be aware of whatever is happening with a gentle light, the invitation in the background. To notice also the wholesome, the joyful, the kind moments.

The last few minutes of the meditation, we can take some time to spread some metta, some loving kindness. We can start with some kindness towards ourselves. We do this by expressing a wish for ourselves. May I be happy. We can repeat this for ourselves, let it resonate in our hearts. May I be happy. We can spread this metta, this loving kindness towards everyone present. This Zoom room, may all of us be happy. We can even include those who might listen to this recording at a later time. May all of those be happy too. May all of us who may come include all beings everywhere. May all of us be happy. We can even include those who may listen to this recording at a later time.
