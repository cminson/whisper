So good morning everyone. 
Is volume okay? So I want to start with a statement that maybe is rather provocative and maybe controversial in a, you know, locally. 
And that is that mostly what meditation entails, or maybe entirely what it entails, is an adjustment of attitudes. 
Somehow that attitude we have sits at the center of what meditation is about. 
And if we can find the right attitude which to meditate, then meditation unfolds kind of on its own. 
Many people associate meditation with techniques, and you know, there's different techniques for meditation. 
And the sound out there is not capping anymore. 
It's turned off again. 
It's just low. 
You know, those of you out there should learn where the which is. 
Yeah. 
Let's see now. 
Or just a more volume there. 
So let's see, is that louder now? So where was I? Attitude. 
Yeah. 
So there's technique that we have about meditation. 
But techniques are useful for sure. 
Different techniques work for different people in different ways. 
But techniques are really kind of the, I don't know, almost like the carrier for the attitude or the excuse for how we work with the attitude or something. 
But if we have the right attitude, then things unfold. 
And generally I think that if we're having difficulty with our meditation, it's probably not so much, probably the main issue is our attitude. 
And it might be useful if we feel like we're meditation is not going well, we're having difficulty with it. 
It might be a good time to look at what is the attitude with which we're practicing. 
And is the attitude what is tripping us up? Is the attitude even the very source for how we interpret our experience as a difficulty? And so attitude, what is attitude? Attitude is, I think of it as the general manner or way in which we decide to speak or act or even how we think. 
It's kind of like the maybe like the mood or the general orientation that we have or the general policy that we're operating under, kind of. 
And it can be just an attitude we have in the moment, but it's not the particular thought we have or the particular thing we say or do, but rather it's kind of the background, context for it, the general orientation we have for something. 
And if we focus too much on the details of the moment, what we're saying, what we're doing, and even what we're thinking, we might be missing something more intimate, something deeper, something that's more kind of at the heart of who we are. 
And that might be the attitude, orientation, that's the soil for whatever we're saying, doing or thinking. 
So for example, someone could sit and meditate and have certain thoughts, and maybe there are thoughts about wanting something, maybe wanting ice cream. 
And so they're just having thoughts, maybe it's a hot day, it's seemingly innocent enough thought to have these thoughts about ice cream. 
But then if you look kind of behind or around or broader to the attitude or the mood or the general kind of orientation in which the soil in which those ice tears are happening, and you see there's an attitude of acquisition, of wanting, kind of an attitude of kind of, that doesn't really, that the ice cream is just one specific expression of that attitude, but that attitude could be carried around and it just gets transferred from one thing to another. 
And if you recognize the attitude of kind of the attitude or the orientation towards desire, and then relax that, there's not much fuel anymore for the ice cream thoughts. 
But if you let go of ice cream thoughts, but the fuel is still there, the attitude is still there, then you know it's just going to kind of keep coming up, keep coming up. 
I find it fascinating that it's in the dictionary that I looked up the word attitude. 
I like origins of words. 
And so my dictionary says that our English use of the word attitude had its origins in 17th century France, where they have the same word, same spelling, attitude. 
But back then in 17th century France, apparently this word was coined to express the, to refer to the positioning of a person in a piece of art. 
You know the attitude that they took in that piece of art, maybe how they were placed kind of in the, apparently. 
And I talked yesterday to one Frenchman about this, and he said, oh yeah, it's kind of like the English word posture, like the posturing, we say posturing, you know, taking a particular position and a posturing among other people. 
So it's kind of like anyway, but what I found fascinating about this etymology, a source of the word attitude, is that it was associated with art. 
And maybe our minds are works of art, or they can be works of art. 
Maybe the beauty of our mind has a lot to do with the attitude in which we live by. 
And if we can kind of really tune in and recognize the attitudes we have, not only is it helpful for meditation, but it's really helpful for the rest of our life. 
And it's helpful for creating a beautiful environment inside of ourselves, out of which comes a way to live, an orientation how to be in this world. 
So there are certainly debilitating attitudes a person can have, that if they're chronic, can build up stress, tension, kind of undermine ourselves. 
And if we don't see the attitude, because we're focusing on the details, but we don't look at the background soil or background mood that's kind of operating, then we don't understand why this kind of debilitating, undermining kind of feeling is happening, the stress is beginning happening. 
And it's very easy not to notice the general mood or the attitude that's there. 
And I can think of two reasons. 
One is that we're so focused on what we want to do. 
We're so focusing on what we think. 
And so we're blinded by the background that's kind of building those particular thoughts. 
The other is that if attitudes become chronic, like sometimes they've been there for decades even, they're so habituated into our mind stream that it's just normal. 
They're so normal we don't see them at all. 
Other people might see that we have an attitude, but for us it's just normal, it's just how it is. 
And so I've met people who have, we say sometimes in Buddhism they have an aversive personality, but where did the personality come from? Is it really genetics that they're that way? Or is it somehow an attitude that got born for whatever reason that then became chronic, became kind of infused into their character? And so it's an attitude that, and what's surprising to me to some of the people I know who kind of have these kind of aversive, strong aversive tendencies, how little they see it. 
They don't recognize it in themselves. 
Or they recognize it sometimes, but they don't really see that it's just kind of almost in the way in which they look at the world. 
Is there kind of a, they're prepared or they're looking through an aversive lens, through a kind of a resistance or a pushing back or a criticism there. 
And the, and so in meditation there are no, oh, meditation is an interesting place, I think, to study attitude. 
Because in ordinary life, sometimes there's not enough feedback for the attitudes we have. 
We can go around and have an attitude and, you know, we can walk around downtown or walking around town, you know, around and, and, you know, we're bumping into people that may be, or, you know, they don't, people don't see us that detail or they don't give us feedback or things basically work out. 
You can have an attitude about washing dishes at home, but, you know, the dishes don't speak back. 
They don't give you feedback. 
You know, like, you know, the attitude you had yesterday was better, please. 
You know, we're just focusing on doing the dishes. 
But in meditation there's a kind of a laboratory where there tends to be very quick feedback because certain attitudes don't kind of work in meditation. 
They might kind of work in daily life or we get away with in daily life. 
But in meditation it's hard to get away with things because they trigger us to lose track of the meditation. 
They kind of make us keep us agitated or they keep us distracted. 
So, you know, I could go downtown and have my ice cream thoughts and, you know, it's no one downtown even knows I'm thinking about ice cream. 
I don't really see any cost to have those thoughts, not to say innocent ordinary thought. 
And there might even be ice cream stores down there, so it's reasonable to have those thoughts. 
And so it just goes along, you know, so I don't see I have this mood that goes along with those thoughts of desire. 
Sit down to meditate and that whole mood that drive for desire and wanting and those kinds of whatever thoughts they might be, they pull me out of the present moment. 
They pull me out of, if I'm focusing on the breath, out of the breath. 
And so there's kind of a very quick feedback there. 
Oh, look at that. 
Something took me away. 
That's not what I'm trying to do. 
I didn't come to IMC in order to think about ice cream. 
I came to meditate. 
I can think about ice cream later. 
So then we let go of the ice cream thoughts and then it comes back. 
Let go of the ice cream, it comes back. 
I'm not really meditating today. 
This is probably not a good day to meditate. 
It's probably too warm or, you know, I didn't have enough coffee and, you know, maybe I'll go to Starbucks and come back. 
And we come back for a little trip, 10 minutes there and back and we sit down to meditate again, ice cream thoughts. 
And so, but if you take that as, you know, it's not really, meditation is not really working there because you're not staying present and you consider what's the attitude behind those thinking. 
And then you might see that there's certain attitude, policy, kind of mood of desiring perhaps that's there, kind of a craving that's there. 
That's what's going on. 
Let me turn around and look at that. 
So kind of to summarize what I just, this sub point I made that in daily life we can get away with attitudes. 
In meditation, if you're oriented to notice your attitude, then, and you notice where you get tripped up in meditation, you're going to, you get much quicker feedback. 
And that's one of the purposes of meditation. 
Oddly enough, one of the purposes of meditation is not to meditate well. 
Isn't that nice? For those of you who don't feel like you do it well, one of the purposes of meditation is not to do it well if you use whatever not well means as an opportunity to take a deeper look at what's going on here. 
And one of the things you can look at is what is the background mood and attitude? What's really going on at a deeper level here with me? Am I feeling insecure? Am I feeling ambitious? Am I really kind of, is my general attitude and mood one about proving myself or being a special person, delusions of grandeur? Or is my general mood one of self-deprecation? Or general mood one of feeling kind of lousy and inadequate somehow? It's not just the particular ideas, but there kind of be a feeling of kind of being heavy or, you know, kind of broken even that people might have with them. 
And then to put a question mark after whatever attitude you notice. 
What is this really true? Is this really the case that it feels that way, but what is an attitude? Is an attitude true? Is it just a construct that comes out of the mind and caused by causing conditions or may or may not really be true? Maybe it doesn't make sense to talk about attitudes as being true or false. 
Maybe it makes more sense to talk about attitudes which are useful and not useful. 
How they function for us. 
So is this a useful attitude to have? Should I carry this? Maybe you don't have to live under the weight that this is the truth. 
Who knows? But I can really see this is debilitating. 
It's not useful. 
I wanted to offer you five attitudes that are useful for meditation. 
And then I would like to ask you, after I've listed these five, if you can identify some common commonalities in these five, common denominators, things that they all have in common. 
So the first one. 
So this is for meditation, mindfulness meditation. 
It's enough to clearly recognize what is happening. 
Nothing needs to be fixed or changed. 
It's enough to clearly recognize what is happening. 
Nothing needs to be fixed or changed. 
Be patient with all that happens. 
Being in a hurry is a form of greed. 
There is nothing to prove or resist in meditation. 
Every occurrence is a time to learn something new about being peaceful. 
Towards what's happening. 
You are a valuable person. 
Your well-being is important. 
And your capacity for attention is a treasure. 
No message that you are less than beautiful is worth believing. 
Trust the awareness that flows out of stillness. 
Trust the awareness that flows out of stillness. 
So I don't know if you could track all five. 
Any suggestions about what they have in common? So if you could use the mic, that would be nice. 
Is there a mic? Here. 
They're not about doing anything. 
They're not about doing anything. 
Very nice. 
Do they all have self-compassion involved? They all seem to have self-compassion. 
Self-compassion? They all seem to relate to self-compassion. 
Very nice. 
They're adding to that self-acceptance. 
There's a self-acceptance in it. 
Very nice. 
Isn't it back there? There's a lack of pressure in each of them to become something or do something special or have a special experience. 
Great. 
Lack of pressure to become something. 
I have some special experience. 
Even special meditation experiences. 
Nice. 
I'm partly asking for help. 
I thought I learned something new today. 
So I'd love to hear more. 
Each of them has to do with becoming aware of things as they are rather than imposing a personal projection. 
Great. 
What was the word you used? Things as they are? Accepting? Knowing. 
Being aware of things that allow. 
Allowing things to be as they are. 
Isn't that fantastic? I wondered if each was mapped on to the five hindrances. 
Each one is mapped on to the five hindrances. 
That would be interesting to see. 
It seemed like they were. 
Very great. 
They all seem welcoming. 
They all seem welcoming. 
Confidence, trust, faith. 
The element of confidence and faith and trust in having those. 
Up here in the front. 
There was a certain centeredness. 
Get a little closer. 
There was a certain centeredness. 
It wasn't apathetic or not caring. 
It was engaged in a calm, centered way. 
So it wasn't passive or doing nothing. 
It was engaged in a nice, active way, but in a peaceful way. 
It is a kind of engagement. 
We're kind of doing something, right? But almost doing nothing. 
Yes. 
Everything you need is already here. 
Everything you need is already here. 
Great. 
I love that. 
This is what I wrote about the common elements. 
Some of these are repeating what some of you said. 
The common element in these five is they are calm attitudes. 
Promoting a calm, non-reactive attention. 
Including a calm, non-reactive attention to our reactivity. 
Isn't that nice? Can you manage that? Is that like juggling with too many balls? Be non-reactive to your reactivity. 
They do not involve trying to change what is happening. 
They are part of finding a useful, meditative way of being aware of what is happening. 
And then there are also attitudes we can take on which are more active. 
Like we can actively be kind or actively be compassionate. 
And we can actively be letting go. 
I chose those three in purpose because those three, kindness, compassion and letting go, are the ways of talking about what the Buddha called right attitude. 
The second factor of the Eightfold Path. 
It is usually called right intention. 
But I think it is deeper than intention. 
Intention can just be wishful thinking. 
Attitude is something deeper that we infuse ourselves with or approach that we have. 
It is not uncommon to find people translate these positive words like kindness, compassion and letting go for the right intention, right attitude. 
But in the language of the Buddha, letting go is usually translated as renunciation. 
And the kindness, the friendliness is literally non-ill will. 
The negative is used. 
And then compassion is non-cruelty or non-harmfulness. 
Dharma teachers, when they kind of read the literal words like that, how they are, non-ill will, non-cruelty, like me, are quick to say what this can mean, the negative in Pali in ancient language, implies sometimes the positive. 
Because we don't want to be left with nothing positive. 
However, I think there is something very profound about the fact that it is worded in the negative because there is something spectacularly beautiful that happens to the mind when it releases itself from its attitudes. 
And so rather than substituting ill will with kindness, there is something more profound about freeing the mind from an attitude, just opening. 
It is kind of like opening up the space, relaxing and opening and feeling how when there is a release of the attitude, when the mind is not weighed or pulled in or contracted by some kind of attitude, there is a lightness and openness and freedom that goes on there. 
And so to not only know what our attitudes are, to know when there is a nice alternative attitude to bring in that is supportive and helpful, but also to know something about the beauty of a mind which is set free, that is open, spacious, which is available for all kinds of good attitudes that might arise in the moment. 
But it is not carrying with it a policy that this is how it should be and then trying to bend oneself to that policy. 
So if the policy is to be compassionate and you carry that with you, then you have to always be figuring out how do you do this. 
Maybe the situation is not because of call for compassion, it calls for being kind or calls for something else. 
But if the mind has the ability to have been freed, then we are actually much more able to kind of adjust and adapt and hopefully do what is appropriate at a given time. 
And sometimes many times that is compassion, but it might be other things that are there. 
And sometimes what is appropriate is to keep letting go. 
Keep letting go. 
And that is one of the things that happens in meditation. 
That as meditation deepens and deepens, not only do the difficult attitudes, the debilitating ones, seeing how they shortchange us, but even healthy attitudes, good ones and ones we can celebrate in life, in deeper and deeper meditation, they get in the way of this movement towards freedom, because a free mind is not burdened or not held in check or not caught up or involved in any attitudes at all. 
It is more like, I don't know what it is like, but it is like you try out all kinds of windows for your house. 
Some are tinted red, some green, some blue. 
And you know, they are nice. 
You can see through, but it is always, you know, and then you try to get a clear one, but these days everything is all these lead-free classes, classes, a little bit of green in it. 
And then finally you just open the window. 
And then you see, right? So it is the same thing with the mind. 
You open the mind, free the mind. 
And then in that freedom there is much more of a sense of creativity, a sense of openness and a sense of wiser choice around how we want to live our lives, what attitudes we want to have as we go into things. 
We are not an automatic pilot about the attitudes we carry with us. 
We go into a new environment. 
We are not an automatic pilot, you know, that we are always showing up the same way because we have this personality, you know, this character temperament that has been built in from attitudes. 
But there is a freshness and openness to kind of just be there and see what is appropriate and what is needed. 
So this is one of the, I think, can be one of the benefits of meditation and only do we see the attitudes we carry with us if we look for that, the deeper moods or mindsets we have. 
But also we can begin finding healthier ones. 
We begin to get a sense of what it is like to not enter the world or be in the world with attitudes automatically there and to let go in a deep way, to be refreshed. 
And I think one of the benefits of meditation is the ability to know the mind, have a reference point of a mind which is not preoccupied with anything. 
And that's not an easy thing to discover. 
Most minds are always preoccupied with something. 
But to really become calm or centered or settled, or if we don't get calm or centered or settled, to have the mindfulness itself be clear enough to see the attitudes that are there and in the mindfulness to see the mindfulness self has no attitude. 
So whether we discover a mind itself that has no attitude and then have much more freedom about how we go through our lives or we discover that mindfulness that's strong and clear enough, it itself has some of these qualities you talked about of acceptance and trying to change things, you don't have an attitude towards things even though if we have attitudes, that also creates a very important reference point that changes how we enter the world and how we go about the world. 
So your mind can be a work of art. 
Guess who's the artist? Be the artist of your own mind. 
And you know who the. 
. 
. 
I don't know, maybe it's the wrong word, but the client is for your artwork. 
You know who's going to see it? Is the artist, is you. 
May you have a beautiful mind. 
So we have a few minutes. 
If you have any questions or concerns or testimonials about what I said, that would be great to hear some of your comments. 
I especially like the way that you contrasted this so-called positive attitude like compassion or something like that with the non-harming and how much more freeing it can be and the energy of non-harming. 
Great. 
Nice. 
So it seems that some attitudes are much more beneficial or helpful than others, especially relative to meditation and mindfulness. 
It's been said, for example, that meta can take one to the threshold of awakening and freedom. 
And I suppose the same might be true of compassion. 
Yeah, yeah. 
I think it's definitely some attitudes which tend to be more useful than others. 
And so sometimes if you're in doubt, choose some of the standard helpful intentions. 
Be compassionate. 
When in doubt, be kind. 
And another one is when in doubt. 
This is a wonderful Buddhist attitude that I learned through my Buddhist years of practice. 
When in doubt, bow. 
Or the equivalent. 
That's not to be literally bowing, but there's something about the appreciation, the care, the respect, the reverence, the gratitude, that is kind of expressed through bowing. 
That's quite something. 
If you're in doubt, don't know what to do. 
What if you don't know what to do about a conflict with someone? You're in the middle of a deep conflict, but you have no idea what to do. 
What if you bowed? Can mindfulness be an attitude? I kind of want to say no. 
I don't think of mindfulness. 
I don't think I think of mindfulness as an attitude. 
Mindfulness is just knowing. 
Knowing doesn't have any agendas. 
It's not trying to do anything. 
Attitude a little bit has infused with intentionality, with an agenda, with something. 
But mindfulness, we can add attentionality to mindfulness, or we can add a mood or desire or something. 
But that's extra. 
Mindfulness by itself, I don't think it is an attitude. 
So is there a no attitude attitude? Maybe. 
This is not a language game, but I think that freedom of the mind is consequential. 
And so someone's disposition, or someone's way their mind operates, or experienced a lot of the world, is through or with a mind that's free, or with the absence of clinging. 
So is that an attitude? Is it a mood, an orientation? What's the tint on an open window? It kind of doesn't quite make sense to talk about it, right? Because there's no window. 
You're not looking through the window and the window is open. 
So to talk about the tint on it doesn't. 
. 
. 
So I wonder, just being a human being with a mind, is it reasonable to have any expectation of seeing things as they really. 
. 
. 
Is there any way things really are, or is there always because I'm here observing the thing? Yes. 
Surely we have this idea, or a Buddhismist idea, that the expression seeing things as they are is very particular what it means. 
The idea of having some pure perception that really sees things as they truly are is kind of ridiculous. 
We don't have. 
. 
. 
There's so many different ways of seeing things, right? I mean, if we look at a flower, we see the flower different than the bee. 
Who's seeing it accurately? Who's seeing it as it really is? You know, if you look at a star, we see it as it really is, the best we can say, we see it as it really was. 
Long before you were born. 
So it's all kinds of. 
. 
. 
You want to start kind of analyzing seeing. 
. 
. 
But when Buddhists use the expressions seeing things as they are, it really refers to seeing the nature of the experience we're having that the experience is impermanent, the experience itself is not self, and there's certain kind of dukkha or suffering inherent in that experience. 
And so it has to do more with the quality or the nature of how we experience the world to see things as they are. 
The nature of experience in these three particular ways. 
But exactly what it is, the thing. 
You know, we have this big bell in front of me, right? But I've seen spatoons there look like this. 
And if I put it down. 
. 
. 
My teacher, and I've got teachers in Asia who had spatoons next to them, and you'd hear this big kind of. 
. 
. 
gurgling and bubbling up and kind of gargling coming out of the throat and then this big. 
. 
. 
When they get ready to deposit something into the spatoon. 
So if I had that next to me, you'd see it as it really is, you'd see it as my spatoon. 
So is it a spatoon or is it a bell? The concept of bell or spatoon, the way I experience it is changeable and impermanent and not self. 
So anyway, the idea of seeing things as they are in this Buddhist tradition has a very particular meaning. 
It's not meant to see the true physical nature of things. 
Yes, is there a mic over here? Yeah. 
Thanks, Barry. 
Well, I want to thank you because I think you've given us an invitation today. 
And I hope to accept it. 
When I first started meditating, I learned that it was to quiet the mind. 
We have a spatoon. 
I need one. 
And then to not ignore what comes up but actually look at it. 
And I think today what we were given is the invitation to go beyond that, to go deeper into what brings that on. 
And you gave us some examples of attitudes. 
And I kept looking for the right one, the key for me. 
And it just came at the end when you said, be still and I forget what. 
And let awareness flow out of that stillness? I forget. 
At the very end you said, be still and something. 
But anyway, be still. 
And so I'll be still. 
Thank you. 
Thank you for capping the talk with it for the summary. 
And I appreciate that a lot. 
So thank you all. 
And I hope that you study your attitudes. 
I hope that you become wise about the attitudes. 
And it's doing so, supports you as you go through your life. 
Thank you.
