 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Oh, here we go. Great. So, hello and welcome to Happy Hour, everyone. Lovely to be with you wherever you are in the world, practicing together. So, yeah, I'll say a couple of words and then we'll practice together and meditate together. The theme for tonight I'd like to invite us to engage with, bring to our hearts and minds the beautiful practice of gratitude. And it's really important not to approach this practice of gratitude as a should. Like, I should be grateful. Oh, God, I should be grateful. No, no, no, no, please, please don't add shoulds. It's not a practice to have any shoulds about. It's an invitation. Can I be grateful for this? Can I be grateful for this? And if the answer comes back, no, I don't feel grateful. Then don't. Don't push it. Don't push it. But it's a gentle invitation. And yet it's such an important practice in this very gentle way of not shooting. Someone said not shooting all over ourselves is because we usually look for problems in our lives. It's just the way human beings work. It's our evolutionary heritage because those who survived, those who passed on their genes, they were looking for threats in their environment, those ancestor human beings. They were looking for threats in the environment. They were not looking for those who were looking for berries, did not survive. They out survived those who were looking for threats. And so we are looking for threats. We're looking for what's not going right, what's problematic. So we need to balance. We need to balance the tendency that we all have as human beings for what's difficult. It's said, I've heard this before, you might have heard it also, that our minds are like Velcro for what's challenging and difficult. And they're like Teflon, the old days when there was a lot of Teflon for good things, for things that are good in our lives. They just don't stick to our minds. Like, oh, yeah, yeah, we get a compliment. Oh, yeah, thank you. Maybe it doesn't quite stick, the goodness. But oh, yes, what's challenging? What's wrong? What's problematic? Where we just go through it again and again and again. So Velcro, Teflon. So in order to balance, in order to balance our hearts and minds, it's helpful to turn to what is good. And when we intentionally, just ever so gently, turn to what's good and what's good could be outside, what's good could be inside. Oh, the goodness of my intention. I'm showing up. Yeah, maybe I find meditation challenging and maybe I'm a beginner, maybe I fall asleep. And yet I keep showing up. This is good. This is good. So the sense of, oh, yeah, can I be, can I appreciate? Maybe not even use the word gratitude. Maybe that's too heavy for some people. Can I appreciate? Can I appreciate that I'm showing up? And maybe the answer, yeah, I guess I can. If I step out of my sight, I can appreciate that this person who's me is showing up, even though they fall asleep all the time or judge themselves for not doing it right. Yet, yeah, there is goodness here. So internally, externally as a way to turn our minds to so much good, to so much good, not to take it for granted. So much good, really. And when we notice good, the good in our lives, then it feels like more good shows up because we're noticing the good. We're open. We're open for more goodness to appreciate, to befriend, to support, to give, to be generous. It's, it's, it's, we turn, we join, we become part of a virtual cycle. All right, I've said plenty. Let's, let's practice together. So arriving, arriving, arriving. This moment and new arrival. Arriving in this body, this moment. Let our attention connect. Our awareness. Know that we are sitting and breathing. Letting our awareness connect with the breath, the sensations of the breath in the abdomen. We're a part of the body receiving. We're receiving each breath. Letting go, letting go, letting go of plans, thoughts, entanglements for a moment. Letting go of our awareness. Letting go of our awareness. you you you you And in your invited sense of appreciation to imbue this breath as you're breathing it as it's breathing you If the answer is no it's okay just stay with the breath you you you You're noticing the sensations of the breath of your sit bones on the chair your hands touching your lap your feet or your legs on the earth Feeling grounded and bodied here just here How wonderful to just be here, even for a moment, not scattered here and there. With each breath reaffirming, rejoining. The goodness, the goodness of being alive just here, just here. A sentient being. Sensing. The breath. Sensations. And opening, opening to, opening our hearts. What is nourishing in this moment, in this body? Maybe the breath. Maybe the breath feels smooth, calming, like a lullaby. And we enjoy it with appreciation. Let yourself enjoy. Thank you. Can we open up to something else that's nourishing? Supportive in this moment? Maybe it's this chair or seat that's supporting us. Opening, opening to it, to its existence and our lives with appreciation. Maybe we're sitting. There is. Clean air to breathe. So appreciating there's air. There's air that can be breathed. Supported by the air. The air element supported by what we're sitting on. The earth element supported by worms. Maybe it's not too warm, not too cold. Yes, humans have a limited range of comfort we can survive in. So yeah, supported by a worm. Nice. Thank you. Supported by this body. So many organs functioning internally. The blood flowing. The water we drank earlier. The food we ate. Supporting us now. Stay with the appreciation. Stay with the good. Stay with appreciating goodness. You can open it up more. If your mind starts going to lack those in the world who do not have these resources right now, yes, it is true. And yet this is not the time for that practice. That is compassion practice and not the time. Bringing your mind, directing, kindly directing to stay with this practice so that you can have enough stability. Enough joy then to open up to the suffering in the world. Not to turn away forever but to have the space, to create the space, the stability, the joy. To contain more of the challenges so staying, staying with the gratitude. Feeling embodied, opening up. The goodness in your life. The relationships you're grateful for. The friendships. trait to get there â€“, Perhaps one relationship, bringing this particular person to mind with appreciation and sharing your goodwill, your metta for them, your goodwill, your appreciation. Wishing them well, appreciating them as if they were sitting right in front of you. Bring them close, your mind's eye. Wishing them well, appreciating them as if they were sitting right in front of you. And maybe opening up to other friends, relationships, family, colleagues with appreciation, feeling the abundance of your interconnectedness with so many amazing beings, alive, complex, as complex as you are. And whoever comes to your mind, you are something that you are. And you have some appreciation for them, whoever shows up. And you have some appreciation for them, whoever shows up. And you have some appreciation for them, whoever shows up. you appreciating whoever shows up and feel free if you like to open up to appreciating other aspects of your life, maybe opportunities, and also challenges, what stretches you, maybe consider something that has stretched you, challenged you recently. Can you be grateful for this too? And don't push it. But drop in the question, can I be grateful for this too? And let yourself be surprised. See what comes up. Thank you. Thank you. Can we open our hearts, maybe experiment now if you like? Imagining your heart so fast, so spacious, so spacious, your body so relaxed, your heart so spacious, so vast. And you can include everything, everything to be grateful for everything. Generous heart that receives with gratitude, goodness, challenges, opportunities, being alive in this human realm, all its ups and downs, 10,000 joys, 10,000 sorrows, with its impermanence deeply woven into the fabric of being alive. In this impermanent moment, can this heart be wide open just for a moment, experiment, receive it all, passing through, appreciating the whole catastrophe, receiving, giving gratitude with generosity, giving thanks. Practicing opening it up. You can always close it in a minute if it feels too big, too much, but just for a moment, see what it feels like if you open your heart wide, dared, dared to open it wide. Spacious, spacious as the sky, spacious as the universe, a grateful heart, as spacious as the universe itself, to include everything. Everything that has been, is, will be. The mystery of it all, beyond our understanding. That I am a part of this whole mystery. I'm a player in sentient conscious, playing my part, growing, learning, serving, giving, hurting, being hurt, gratitude for all of it. For the ways I've grown, and the ways I've yet to grow, I have yet to grow and stretch myself. Thank you. And if you find, if you meet limits of your heart, it's okay, bow to it. Be grateful for that too. Be grateful for this too. This being authentic and true. Thank you. And I'm going to go back to meditation. Meditation to a close. Can we be grateful, appreciate, or whatever showed up or didn't show up? It's okay. Appreciating that we showed up, we did not have a chance to do that. We're not attaching to outcome. Appreciating ourselves, appreciating the Sangha for showing up and supporting us, these amazing human beings who keep showing up and practicing, cultivating their hearts. Thank you. Thank you, universe. Thank you, Dharma. Thank you, Sangha community. May our goodness, may our practice serve all beings everywhere. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks, everyone. I'm grateful for your practice, for your showing up. So, I'd like to invite us to transition now to practice, to express our gratitude appreciation in small groups, in small groups. And the prompt is, the prompt, and this can be quite powerful, actually this practice, the prompt is, what are you grateful for? So, you're saying one thing, you are grateful for one thing. And then the next person will say something, and then the next person, and then you again, and it goes around and around and around. And it can be so uplifting with feeling your own joy, letting it be witnessed, as well as witnessing other people, the sense of mudita, vicarious joy arises, especially if you're feeling a little heavy at this moment in time. This is a joyous practice. It's a wonderful uplifting practice to fill our hearts with joy. So, I invite you, and then yes, going in, let's go in alphabetical order. And yeah, what brings you joy is the prompt. So, I'm creating the rooms, take care of yourselves, take care of each other again. You can also pass when your turn comes, just offering something and then letting other people have their turn. Okay. So, I've created the rooms, be kind, be gentle. And here we go, opening the rooms now. Thank you. Everybody's back. Welcome back, everyone. I see some smiles. So, yeah, this is great. I would love to hear from a couple of people, and you're also welcome to write your reflections in chat. If you just write it to me, it will be private. I won't read your name, just your reflection. If it's to everyone, then I'll read your name as well. And you can also raise your Zoom hand. And somebody's giving thumbs up. I think they're trying to raise their Zoom hand. Is this Jamie? Are you trying to? No, that's my comment. Oh, that was your comment. Thumbs up. You liked it. Okay, that's great. I love it. Very concise. Now, I want to invite you, actually, especially if you haven't spoken recently, Susan says so much to be grateful for. If you haven't spoken recently, I'd like to invite you to challenge yourself and be grateful for the opportunity and step forward. I see you, Claire. I'm just going to pause for a moment and see if we can get someone who maybe hasn't spoken for a while. Or maybe is new to happy hour. What did you discover in the small groups or in this practice? Any moments? Okay. All right. Christine and then Claire, please. Thank you, Nick. I really enjoyed this meditation tonight. You've talked about that before, making a suit like we made a suit tonight. And one of the gentlemen that was on my call, this is first time here. And it was just we all went around. And like you said, we just added a little bit to each other tonight. And it was just a lot of gratitude in my breakout room. So I'm grateful for both my people that were with me tonight and my stanga. First thing I said was I was grateful for showing up tonight and being part of all this, just exactly what was needed. So thank you so much, Nikki. And everyone. Beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing, Christine, and for your practice and showing up. Yay. So beautiful. Makes me happy. Yay, Claire, please. Hi, Nikki. I know I've said this before. First of all, I want to say thank you for this. And I've said this before, but I'd just like to sell it again through another spiritual program that I'm in. I started circulating a gratitude list with two friends on email about six or seven years ago. We do it every day. And it made such a difference in my life. And I think even just one night like this can make a huge difference. I mean, because I tend to look at everything that's wrong with my life. We all tend to. Yeah, exactly. It forces me to look at what's right. There's a lot. So there's so much that's going right. It's just it's overwhelming. Actually, it's quite lovely. Thank you, Claire. Thank you for that. And Diana, you're next. And before that, I want to read a message that came to me directly. And one of you said, I realized that a lot of my meditation practice was to observe things neutrally. It was very refreshing to observe things gratefully. Yay, beautiful. Yes. So so lots of different practices. And with the practice of with Vipassana with with with insight practice, we often try to see well, it's in some ways, it's neutral. But in some ways, we're looking at arising and passing. We're looking at things. But but with the practices of the heart with metta and with with all the Brahma Viharas, with loving kindness, with compassion, with vicarious joy, and with equanimity, there's a particular way of looking and especially with mudita and by the way, gratitude fits under vicarious joy in the in the in the four Brahma Viharas. That's where it fits. Because when you when you feel happy for someone else's happiness, it's joy for them. When you happy for you feel happy for your own blessings. Yeah, guess what? That's gratitude. Anyway, so so yes, there's a particular there's there's a beauty, there's a goodness to this practice of mudita vicarious joy turned inward. That becomes gratitude. So I'm delighted person who sent this this reflection. Yes, it's such so refreshing. It's so beautiful to and you'll just say one more thing. The path towards awakening doesn't go through just the gray zone of the things or as they are. There's a lot of joy, the Buddha was was known as the happy one and the path actually in this instruction step by step by step by step. As well as you study the suttas, you see there is joy and there's contentment and there's bliss and there is gladness all of these pamuja and and pete and and sukkah, you know, all of them, they're just laid out. They're just so so the path and then at the end is yes, nibbana awakening, but it just goes through the the mind, the heart need to go need to contain joy, need to contain all these uplifting qualities in order to be liberated. It's not a grim duty to be liberated. So anyway, thank you for that reflection. Diana. Oh, this is just really quick. We were thinking and saying that we could actually, if we had time, do this all night, the this gratitude just go around and around because what happens is keep thinking, at least for me, keep thinking of things and and it builds and it makes and and and oddball things too could come to mind and all it's just like an endless array. So it's a it's a really joyful practice. Thank you for offering this to us. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's that's lovely. And one of you reflects I had a lot of rage come up during the session. It was not about joy at all for me tonight. No problem. And that's what needed to come up. Rage, anger. So so there are conditions in the mind and the heart. And that's when you when you quieted your mind when, you know, we quiet our mind and there's just a lot of something else that needs to be attended to. Maybe that comes up or maybe or maybe the rage comes has come up perhaps because of a sense of lack or or or your various things. But it's worthwhile not to push it away and say, okay, this is, you know, it didn't work out. It's a disaster. But actually, stay curious, stay curious. Can you I know this is going to sound like a high bar, but can we even be curious or or have gratitude about the rage? Can we have gratitude that we can actually have emotions instead of just being a complete blank and not completely blank or that we have the mental facility faculties to feel rage and then when when you welcome rage with gratitude, not necessarily acting out of it. I'm not saying act out. But well, yeah, it's here. Okay. Can I be grateful for this, too? Yeah, I can have emotions. I can feel upset. Who can that be a way to then turn towards working with it and and actually cultivating gratitude. Anyway, thank you all. Thank you so much for your practice. Thank you for being here for your cultivation. May all beings be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Take good care. And I'm going to.
