So today we come to the next exercise of the discourse on the
establishment of awareness, for establishing awareness. And this is
called, sometimes it's called the six sense spheres. And it refers to being
mindful at each of the sense doors. So the six sense doors are eyes, ears, nose,
tongue, body, and its tactile abilities to know, to feel, and the mind door. So it's
as if we have an eye or an organ of perception that recognizes what we're
that we're thinking, that we have emotions, the activities of the mind. And
that organ of perception is considered one of the six senses.
And so the text itself begins with a very simple statement. It builds on it.
It says that one knows there are sight objects, things that we can see, and we
know that there's the eye. And the simple statement is the beginning of
mindfulness, a kind of certain kind of emphasis of mindfulness, which is very
much centered in the present moment in the direct experience of the senses. So
not anticipating the future or remembering the past, but right here in
the moment, so that if you're hearing, you might hear the spell. If you're
seeing, you're seeing what's in front of you in the moment that you're seeing. And
it begins with sight. Many years ago, when I was heading to, going to the
monastery, I went to the monastery, the Zen monastery at Tasahara, I was there
for a little while, and I noticed something unusual about seeing. And that
was that I could look at a tree, and I saw the tree, kind of, and I was aware of
myself looking. I was aware of the eyes kind of engaged in the process of
looking. And then I noticed that in between, maybe it's almost, what it
felt like in between, was my ideas of the tree. It was almost as if I was
painting the concept tree on top of the tree. The concept was accurate enough, so
ordinarily I would have not, not have thought twice about, you know, there's
anything more than seeing the tree. I became acutely aware of how there was an
act of conception, act of interpretation, act of projection onto the tree. And so
there was the object of seeing, the eyes that see, and something in between. And
it could be the judgments, it could be our stories we have, our ideas we have of
what's there. It could be our bias that we project onto something. And so we
don't see things directly as they are, we often see them through the filter of
something. So in mindfulness practice, it's possible to become aware of this
filter, this thing that's in between. But it begins by learning to appreciate a
simple moment of sense awareness. That, and so one of the sense stores is
seeing, and it's a wonderful exercise, a wonderful capacity to learn how to look
with quiet eyes, relaxed eyes, and to look without the agenda, without the
wanting mind looking for something, or the scared mind looking for danger,
looking how to be safe. But to have a very cool, calm, quiet eyes that gaze in a
relaxed way. And I believe in the ancient world, in the ancient Buddhist
world, they sometimes had the idea that the eyes, rather than light coming into
into the eyes, it's more like somehow the eyes go out to touch the object out
there, to grab the object. And certainly I felt sometimes with, if I'm really
intense on wanting something, or afraid of something, or curious about something,
I can almost feel like, you know, my head goes forward, the almost like my eyes
open more, and like my eyeballs are kind of like popping out a little bit to
see what's that. Or I might be straining, trying to really look at
something carefully, and minutely, and try to make sense of it. And I could
feel a strain in my eyes. One of the wonderful ways to practice mindfulness
is to have a reference point, is to learn how to let awareness of seeing be
calm, be easeful. And generally, in a relaxed, easy eyesight, the eyes, you
know, it doesn't have to be conscious even, but the eyes are slightly moving
around. The eyes are not held fixed, fixedly held eyes strain, and get
tired. But relaxed eyes are eyes that kind of, it's kind of like they float in
their, in the eye socket. And they're kind of like looking a little bit here and
there, or if you're looking at a particular object, it's kind of maybe
looking at the perimeter, looking different pieces of it, just kind of
roam, the eyes roam around. And to allow the eyes to roam gently, can release a lot
of stress, a lot of fixation in the mind. Because when the eyes roam, it's kind
of little, and kind of look at different things, it's kind of more difficult
for the mind to stay fixated on its preoccupation. And the more fixated we
are in our inner concerns or thoughts, the more the eyes tend to be held tight,
or don't have that floating feeling. And so one of the ways to do this in
mindfulness of seeing is to settle back and allow sights to come to you. Don't
go looking for anything, and see but don't look. The difference being that
looking is an active intentional act to look for something. Someone might say,
look over there, and then you look. But people don't say see over there. They
might say, what do you see? And it's not necessarily a request to go looking, but
just to, if your eyes are in that direction, what comes to your eyes, what
comes into awareness. So one of the ways to cultivate mindfulness and develop it
is that each of the six sense doors, and begin to appreciate a relaxed, quiet way
of receiving the sensations at the particular sense door, so today through
seeing. And just that is a wonderful exercise. If you're the fortunate
of maybe being a passenger in a car, for me it's even a better bus or a train.
And just let the eyes gaze out in the countryside as the scenery around you
is driving. And let the eyes just kind of be float and look and relax. And don't
hold on to anything. Don't just keep the eyes soft. When I was a
teenager, I used to get very calm looking out train windows and just looking
at things going by. So that's very nice, maybe. And then the exercise in this
exercise on the six sense doors is to know the object that we're seeing, to know
we're seeing something, to know the eyes and to do and be able to see in a
relaxed way, but then to notice one of the things that's in between. And the
particular thing that this exercise is about is to notice the knot, the K-N-O-T.
It's sometimes translated into English as the fetter, but I think the word in
Pali, I think it's better rendered as the word knot. And the fetter kind of
implies that we're fettered, we're hindered by something, which is true.
A knot means we're knotted up in it, we're entangled with it. And I myself
personally prefer the language of entanglement or being knotted up in
something. And so if I have some problem with my computer, my eyesight
is knotted up, tangled in trying to figure it out and what's going on here
and looking. And my eyes are not relaxed. I'm not just gazing at the
issue and letting some kind of quiet inner exploration try to figure it out.
I might be entangled and caught in the issue that I have. And so it's possible
to become aware that there's the object we see, there's the eyes that are
seeing, and then there's kind of in between, some of you might have more
sense that it's in the mind, behind the eyes or something, but between the two
there's the, or in addition to the two, there's the way we're knotted up. Those
things are entangled with each other. That the way that we're
looking is not relaxed and easeful, but we're looking in a way that is
caught or preoccupied or concerned with what we're looking at. And it
becomes stressful in the eyes. Eyes become locked, they get tight, they'll get tired.
They've lost this relaxed way of being. So one of the reasons to cultivate
mindfulness of seeing is to learn, develop capacity for this relaxed gaze so
that we become more sensitive to the knots when they occur. And so this is
not like an incidental exercise that the Buddha is giving, but rather it's
another perspective from which we can become aware of all the ways we get
attached. Every attachment is an attachment at
sent stores, at some particular sent store. And as we become aware of each of
the different sent stores, it's a different kind of angle to become aware
of attachment itself. So it's sometimes it's with what we see, sometimes with what
we hear, taste, smell, touch, and then the mind door is a big one. And so in
this particular exercise, Satyapetana, it's going through very carefully,
repeatedly, each of the six of these sent stores and talking about seeing the
sent store, seeing the object, now for this first one sight object, knowing the
eye that's seeing, knowing the knot that's between them. And more than that,
in the style of how this teaching goes, it's also knowing the manner in which
that knot arises, seeing it appear, and see, and then letting go of it.
And the seeing, the appearance of a knot is when it first occurs, is this
amazing vantage point where it's easier to let go. So relax seeing, noticing how
the eyes get locked in, knot it up, but noticing just as it occurs and then
letting it go. So for today, as you go about your day, next 24 hours, you might
give special attention to seeing and see what if you can learn greater ways of
looking in a relaxed way, calm looking, relaxed looking, where the eyes can kind
of look at things and study them even, but do it in a very relaxed, receptive
mode. And that as you kind of get a hang of that, maybe then you can start
noticing when the eyes are not that way, when they're locked in or straining or
something, and that is the knot. And maybe you can let go of it. So that's the
introduction to this topic of this week, the mindfulness at the six sense doors.
Thank you.
