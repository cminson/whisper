The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
I went over to Tanjef just to let people know there are about a dozen seats or so inside
if anybody wants to move inside.
And also a reminder that the Sati Center lives in the economy of Dana.
And gosh.
And there's a place near the door on the way out for checks that should be made to the Sati Center.
Yeah, Tony, let me expand.
Make sure you make the check the Sati Center, not IMC, or met the forest.
It makes the treasurer's job quite difficult if you pull around with that.
So people can move up some more and really crowd in here.
Appreciate that.
So what can I say about Tanjef?
He's one of our leading scholars and translators and providing access to large amounts of material from our tradition
that would otherwise not be available.
He's a friend of IMC and the Sati Center.
And boy, are we happy to have him today.
And I'm excited about hearing him talk about the roots of Buddhist romanticism.
That's the title.
There are copies.
We may not have enough, but those that have iPads, you can download and that would make our life easier.
I don't know, I don't see a lot of people with iPads, but if you do, you can download the Sati Center website.
Okay.
They titled this, Romance in the Buddha.
That title is not my idea.
Because it leads to all kinds of misinterpretations.
Very Magdalene of the Buddhist tradition.
We're going to be talking about the influence that the German romantics have on the way Dharma is taught in the West.
That's basically the theme.
It's going to require a little bit of history.
More history than I usually like to get involved with, but it's necessary.
So before we talk about the influence that they have on how the Dharma is taught, I'd like to give a brief sketch of what the Dharma is in the Pali Canon.
So we have something to compare with a kind of a baseline comparison.
Then we'll get into some of the changes that have been made, how they can be traced back to the romantics, who the romantics were, what they taught,
and then why their thought has been so influential.
Most of us have forgotten their names.
Someone asked you, who is Friedrich Schlegel?
And they're all Freds, by the way. Friedrich Schlegel, Friedrich Schleiermarker, Friedrich Schelling.
There's a German.
There's a German, but they're Freds.
Friedrich von Hartenberg.
Who have I forgotten?
Friedrich Ehrlern.
Most of you would say, I don't know who these are, so I've met the Germans.
But they came at a particular juncture in European thought, which has since had a huge influence.
Many intellectual historians have said that ever since their revolution in European thought, there haven't really been any revolutions.
We're still living in their mindset.
Also, there's a mistake thinking that romantics were all about being narcissistically interested in your own emotions.
And there is that element, but there's a lot more.
And it's the other parts that we're going to be getting into today.
So, but first, a brief sketch of what the Buddha taught, so we're going to have a baseline to compare what's happened to what the Buddha taught.
The Buddha said that he focused on one problem or one main question, which is the fact of suffering and then how that suffering can be put to an end.
And everything he touched on, everything he taught was related to those issues, even when he taught other issues like rebirth or things about cosmology.
It all came down to, okay, what are you doing that's causing suffering and how you can put an end to that?
That's the issue he focused on.
There are a lot of other issues that he would put aside because he said they're irrelevant.
There's no overarching system to his thought and he doesn't touch on very many metaphysical issues aside from the issue of karma and the consequences of karma.
The cause of suffering, he said, is the craving that leads to becoming.
Now, he's not saying that all desire is bad, but specifically there are certain types of desire that would lead you to take on becoming.
Not the question, of course, then, is what is becoming.
Becoming is your sense of who you are in a particular world of experience.
And this can include anything from your being, the body you have here in this physical world located right now in Redwood City.
But it can also be a psychological kind of identity in a psychological world.
If you're a coffee fanatic, you have probably figured out that the coffee is back there.
That's an important part of your world right now.
As long as your desire is focused on coffee, you are someone who desires coffee and the coffee earn is back there.
And the relevant parts of the world are the parts that get you to the coffee earn and the parts that get in the way of getting back to the coffee earn.
And your sense of identity surrounds, okay, I'm the person who wants the coffee.
I'm the person who will be happy to get that coffee.
I'm also the person who has certain abilities to get over there to the coffee earn right now.
Suppose you forget about coffee and you're starting to desire something else.
Your sense of the world will change.
Your sense of who you are will change.
And all of that is becoming.
Your sense of who you are in this world.
Now this is very important because we'll find out later that the romantics, when they define what the spiritual quest was, it's all about becoming.
So keep that in mind.
Now there is a path to the end of suffering which involves the skills to overcome these kinds of craving to let go of them.
And important, one of these skills is right view.
The opinions, they're not knowledge yet until you've gotten to the end of the path.
But the opinions you hold on to adds useful working hypothesis to get along the path.
Particularly involving what is suffering, what is the cause, how you can put an end to it.
There's a clear delineation in the Buddhist stations between right and wrong paths.
The Buddha said the wrong paths like the wrong view, wrong resolve, all the way down to wrong concentration are like trying to get milk out of a cow by squeezing the horn.
There is a very clear sense of right and wrong here.
And the right and wrong is based on basically what works and what doesn't work.
The path is motivated and maintained by a sense of heedfulness.
The sense, okay, my actions really do make a difference.
They can be very dangerous if I'm not careful, so I have to be very careful about how I act so I can act in a skillful way.
It's based on the recognition that your mind is not innately good.
It's not innately bad either.
It's got good and bad tendencies kind of mixed in together.
And you have to be very careful about which ones you act on.
The path is also motivated by a sense of what they call sanghwega.
You look around and you see the world is just full of dangers in all directions.
And you realize, okay, you've been basically trying to take on a sense of identity within any of these worlds.
And you realize that no matter what world you take on a sense of identity and it's going to involve suffering.
There's a sense of terror or awe that comes with that.
And that's one of your motivating factors.
It's got to get out.
Right, if you also involves knowing which lines of thinking or questions need to be put aside for the sake of focusing on the problem of suffering.
These include things like defining what yourself is.
Do you exist? Do you not? The Buddha said, don't ask.
That's pretty aside.
I'm not loud enough.
Yes?
I have a fuzzy cheek.
Yeah, okay, sorry.
Basically knowing which questions to put aside, like defining who yourself is and speculations about the cosmos.
In other words, questions that really think of things in terms of becoming.
Is yourself the same as the body? Is yourself different from the body? Is there no self? Is there a self?
Is the world infinite? Is the world finite? Is it eternal? Is it not eternal?
Is there some God back there who has a plan for this? Is there total chaos out there?
The Buddha says, these are the things you don't have to think about.
Think about what you're doing that's causing suffering and how you can put an end to it.
The path when you follow it leads to a transcendent goal where suffering caused by craving no longer exists.
This is the essence of the teaching.
Again, this is something to be kept in mind because a lot of romantic thought says there is no essence to anything.
But he says there is an essence to the teaching and it is something transcendent. It's outside of space, outside of time.
Totally unconditioned.
It's even beyond oneness and non-duality.
Something goes even beyond those categories because as the Buddha says,
both the sense of oneness that you can attain or a sense of non-duality you can attain are conditioned or fabricated.
Once you've achieved this, when you reach the end of suffering, your task is done.
Now the Buddha says, again, it's a final attainment you reach.
He says this cannot be found in any other tradition outside of his teaching, i.e.
if you're following the wrong view, wrong resolve, whatever, you can't find it.
Wherever there is right view and right resolve and the rest,
that is someplace where the truths will be found and this attainment will be found.
The skills involved here are culturally independent.
It doesn't depend on the fact whether you're American or Asian or African.
The fact that suffering is basically the same for everybody.
The cause is the same for everybody.
The path is going to have to be the same for everybody as well.
These teachings are not some sort of visionary's view of the cosmos or transmission from a God.
It's basically the recommendations of someone who is able to solve the problem
and wants to pass on the instructions on how you can solve the problem as well.
So you might think they're kind of a guide left behind by an expert
so you can get the same results as the Buddha God.
There's a very definite course of training involving virtue, concentration, and discernment.
And in order to make that course of training clear,
the Buddha said he taught what was called the cross-questioning of his teachings.
He wanted his teachings to be left open to the ability to ask for people to ask questions.
What does this mean? What does that mean?
He contrasts this with what he calls training and bombast.
Training and bombast is when the teachings are really beautiful,
they feel really nice to hear, they just kind of feel soothing as they go past your ear.
But if you ask people, what does this mean? You're discouraged to ask questions.
That's training and bombast. We'll get to that later.
He knew that the ability to pass on these skills was subject to the vagaries of time and civilization.
He knew it wasn't going to last forever.
So he tried to set up a community in which people could take an apprenticeship
with people who already knew the skill and could pass them on
because it's not just a matter of reading the text, but there's also the skills that you're going to learn on a personal level
where the student can question the teacher and the teacher can question the student
and can kind of observe each other's behavior.
He also set tests for judging which of the records that he passed down are accurate.
The particular teaching when you put in a practice leads to these results then that counts as a genuine teaching.
He also set down tests for deciding whether you're passing judgment or not.
Do you have the qualities to give a fair judgment of the teaching?
It's not just anybody walking in off the street.
You've got to learn how to develop concentration, discernment.
He asked two things mainly which was that you'd be observant and that you'd be honest.
Those are the two basic qualities he wanted in anyone who's going to test these teachings or test them.
He also did not view improvements in the Dharma as a positive thing.
There's that passage in the readings we've got too later where he says,
every time you make a change in the Dharma it's like putting a chink into a drum head
and after a while you put all these pegs in after there's a crack in the drum head
so you put another peg in, another crack you put another peg in
and after a while you get so there's nothing but pegs and the drum isn't going to sound like a drum anymore.
He called this improved Dharma. He said this is not going to be an improvement.
This is what's going to kill the Dharma.
The example he gave was kind of like counterfeit money.
There can be improved Dharma around and he said this is basically what causes the Dharma to pass away
in the sense that when there's only genuine money around you trust the money that you get
but if there's not genuine money, if there's counterfeit money around then you can't really do BS even about genuine money.
This causes a lot of doubt in people's minds.
So he didn't see changes as a positive thing.
So that's kind of this outline I want to give first of what the Buddha taught
and what record we have of what the Buddha taught in the Pali Canon.
Any questions about that before we go on?
Yes.
We need a walking mic.
In addition to the walking mic we've got to mention there's hearing assisted aids out there
for those who need it.
Could you give an example of a change that was happening in his time that he said?
Well there are actually two examples of monks who said I understand the Buddha's teaching to be ex
and the other monks said well no the Buddha didn't teach that at all.
They take the guy to the Buddha and even though the Buddha says no that's not what I taught
but the man says what's how I understand what you taught.
One case was that there's nothing wrong with monks having sex
and the other one is which is that your consciousness, the consciousness you have right now
goes on to another being when you're done.
It's this sort of everyday consciousness you have that passes on from one life to the next.
So it was people's interpretation of what was being said and their reinterpretation.
Well in their insistence that that was correct that they were actually seeing correctly what the Buddha was saying
and he had to say no that's not right.
What's amazing about these passages is that they get dragged in front of the Buddha
and the Buddha says no I didn't teach that and he said well this is how I understand what you taught.
There are two of the passages where the Buddha is really really harsh,
a worthless man he says, the mocha bodhisattva.
The Buddha wasn't ticked out hot, he wasn't always nice.
You can get pretty strong, there's one place where he calls David Dot a licks beetle.
You know what it means to be a licks beetle? It means if someone spits something out on the ground you lick it up.
David Dotta was not happy.
Any other quick questions before we go on?
Okay that's what the Buddha taught, the question over here.
What was the answer to the question on consciousness?
Okay when the Buddha asked him okay what consciousness are you talking about?
Basically the Buddha taught two kinds of consciousness.
There's regular consciousness of the senses and then there's what's called consciousness without surface.
And the man says, I'm talking about the first one, just regular consciousness at the six senses, this is what goes on.
As far as consciousness without surface which is basically the consciousness of Nirvana,
that doesn't get discussed in that sutra at all.
It wouldn't have been interesting if the Buddha had branched out a little bit.
So that was what the solution was there.
What? I'm sorry I have to speak up more.
What can we do? What can we do to make things louder?
Yeah there are some areas that are a little bit dead in terms of the...
You're near the jack camera, that's the problem.
Really? Okay.
Speakers don't reach there?
Okay let's turn it up a little bit and see what happens.
And also for people who are asking questions please use the microphones because people have the hearing assisted devices.
They actually rely on the microphones to hear what the question is.
And we're also recording so thank you very much.
Okay so basically what we have in the Dharma is the Buddha's recommendations on how to solve the problem of suffering.
He puts aside other issues that are irrelevant and particularly issues that are framed in the terms of becoming i.e. what your identity is
and the infinite infinity or lack of infinity etc. of the world.
And that this is a teaching that is culturally independent.
It doesn't depend on whether you're white, black, yellow, red or whatever.
Come from America, come from India, come from China or Thailand.
It's all the same teaching, it's all the same Dharma.
Okay I'm going to give you a few quotes from modern teachers now.
And the question is going to be, okay what happened?
Here's a quote.
In the Buddha's opinion, to train in staying open and curious, to train dissolving the barriers that we erect between ourselves and the world is the best use of our human lives.
Eagolessness is a flexible identity.
It manifests its inquisitiveness as adaptability, as humor, as playfulness.
It is our capacity to relax with not figuring everything out, not being at all sure about who we are or anyone else is either.
Another one.
There's an underlying unity to all things and a wise heart knows this as it knows the in and out of the breath.
They're all part of the sacred hole in which we exist and in the deepest way they are completely trustworthy.
We need not fear the energies of this world or any other.
Another quote. It is the goal of spiritual life to open to the reality that exists beyond our small sense of self.
To the gate of oneness we awaken to the ocean within us, we come to know in yet another way that the seas we swim in are not separate from all that lives.
When our identity expands to include everything, we find a peace with the dense of the world.
It is all ours and our heart is full and empty, large enough to embrace it all.
Another quote. Our job for the rest of our life is to open up to that immensity and to express it.
What happened?
Another one. It is easy to get caught in the notion that there is a goal, a state, a special place to reach in spiritual life.
When we enter the gateless gate we come to the end of seeking.
Before this in our life we may have tried many ways to find enlightenment or become something special.
Finally, when we enter the gate of eternal present and discover that we are not going anywhere.
So, what happened?
What happened is the Romantics.
I'll give you a few quotes from the German Romantics for us to get a sense of what they taught.
To romanticize the world is to make us aware of the magic, mystery and wonder of the world.
It is to educate the senses we see, to see the ordinary as extraordinary, the familiar as strange, the mundane as sacred, the finite as infinite.
Sounds like a Dharma talk, right?
Another one. The individual is not just part of the whole but an exhibition of it.
The mind, like the universe, is creative, not just receptive.
Whoever is learned to be more than himself knows that he loses little when he loses himself.
When they align themselves with the belief of personal immortality after death, the truly religious would prefer to strive to annihilate their personality and live in the one and the all.
Whereas religions chiefly to be sought were the living context of human being with the world fashions itself as feeling.
Truly religious people are tolerant of different translations of this feeling, even the hesitation of atheism.
Not to have the divine immediately present in one's feelings has always seemed to them more irreligious than such a hesitation.
To insist on one particular conception of the divine is to be true is far from religion.
Every relation of man to the infinite is religion, that is man in the entire fullness of his humanity.
Only someone who has his own religion, his own original way of looking at infinity can be an artist.
Those are some romantic ideas about religion and they sound very familiar.
The influence they came through several ways.
To us down through humanistic psychology, through the comparative study of religion and cultural studies in general.
And also ideas of a perennial philosophy, that there is a perennial core to all religions that speaks the same.
And this perennial philosophy is basically the question of what is your true identity, what is your true relationship to the cosmos.
The romantics are actually the first modernists and post-modernists.
On the one hand, they were first to grow up in the sense of an infinite universe.
They also develop a sense of irony towards all systems of thought, the way the post-moderns do.
And as I said earlier, they're not just emotional narcissists.
One of the many ironies of Buddhist romanticism is that those who denounce it are often practicing it without realizing it.
There's also a post-modern ignorance I've run up to.
People say, well how could the romantics have an influence on us because we're all post-modern.
And the problem is post-modernism is an extension of the romantic view of life.
It's up to each of us to what doesn't matter, what did the text originally mean, it's how we encounter the text, how we react to that text.
That's the important thing to focus on.
I think part of the problem is that when history becomes purely subjective, people don't take it seriously.
And they end up ignorant of their own history of seeing what's shaping it.
You know, George St. John is saying people are ignorant of history or doomed to repeat it.
This is what happens.
My program today is to show how a lot of modern dharma actually comes to the romantics that in the Buddhist terms it would be synthetic or reformed dharma.
And it would be actually better off outgrowing it.
This is a reverse to the usual dynamic.
Many times people use romantic standards to judge the dharma.
And today I'd like to look at the romantic standards and judge them by using the terms of the dharma.
The primary bad effects of romantic dharma, one, it defines the spiritual quest in terms of you finding your position vis-a-vis this infinite universe.
In other words, it keeps you in becoming and allows for no escape from becoming.
Even when you obliterate your personal identity and identify with the world as a whole, that still counts as becoming.
Secondly, it teaches heedlessness.
It teaches that you can trust your inner drives that many times they are divine, it says, and that there are no real dangers in the universe.
There's also the question of how romantic views are used to justify the way we do change the dharma.
Even when you call people's attention to the fact that the dharma has been changed, it gets justified by using romantic views of history.
Saying that every religion has to change as people change, the universe is an ongoing process.
And there's nothing that has any essential, eternal meaning or eternal identity.
So the method we're going to use today is a combination of what's called genealogy and cultural psychotherapy.
Genealogy is basically trying to trace ideas back, not to show that there is a sort of a coherent rationale to why we pick up a particular idea,
but more to see how really bizarre it is certain ideas just managed to survive.
There's a certain randomness to the way we pick up ideas from the past and carry them on.
And the purpose of this is to show that a lot of things that were many times are told to be radically new interpretations of the dharma
are actually within our culture quite reactionary.
We keep going back to old ideals that we had in Western culture and not willing to open ourselves up to what the Buddha taught.
Secondly, in terms of psychotherapy, to see what may have made sense back when the romantics were first formulated now no longer works to our advantage.
You can see there's a lot of reasons for why the romantics thought the way they did and it made sense within their context,
but when we look at our context right now, it doesn't make sense anymore.
It's the same thing as you do when you go to psychotherapist.
Ideas that you picked up when you're a child may have made sense when you're a child,
but if you carry them around into adulthood, you're going to cause problems.
So I'd like us to grow up a little bit today.
Our focus is going to be on the Pali Canon and on the Theravada teachers.
Some of these themes will also explain why Mahayana is so popular in the West,
but also it all shows you how many Mahayana doctrines have become transformed in coming to the West as well.
Ideas about Buddha nature.
What Mahayana and India said about Buddha nature is not necessarily what you hear nowadays about Buddha nature,
but that's going to be beyond the scope of what we're going to talk about today.
Also, I'm trying not to name names.
When I read a quote from a modern Buddhist teacher, please don't ask me who said that.
This is probably as a Buddhist principle.
When you're teaching the Dharma, you don't want to exalt yourself and disparage other people by name.
So you leave it out.
And secondly, what we're talking is not so much an individual issue, it's kind of a cultural syndrome
in which the teachers and the audience are all responsible in a sense.
Teachers will throw out some teachings and I've seen this happen.
When you give a particular Dharma topic that people like, you can see their eyes light up and they get interested.
And when you talk about something people don't like, you can just feel the energy in the room.
And if you're not aware of what's going on, it's very easy to want to talk about the things that people like
and what they don't like.
I may have told you the story before about a professor of behavioral psych at MIT
who had this habit of walking up and down in front of the room when he gave his lectures.
And so the students, of course, being MIT students, decided, well, let's do an experiment on the professor.
When he's in this corner, we'll look at him, we'll take notes, we'll be very intent.
And when he's in that corner over there, we'll look out the window, we'll chat with each other.
And sure enough, after two weeks, he was standing in that corner over there.
And he hadn't realized what had happened.
So it's not that we're going to be blaming the Vipassana teachers or the monks.
There are some monks in here too.
But the audiences are responsible as well.
What resonates with you, the teacher wants to teach.
So let's get started here.
First, we have to look at what they called the early Romanics and the German tradition.
It's a very small group of people.
It started out, and it's one of those interesting times in intellectual history
where some really high-powered people were all together as a group for about six years.
And playing their ideas off of one another, they really heightened the creativity of the entire group.
We're talking basically about a period from 1797 to 1803, a very short period.
These people were two of them, and at that time in Europe was the avant-garde.
Berlin and a university at the town called Jena, J-E-N-A,
which is just down to the southwest of Berlin.
It was a university where the philosopher Fichte was teaching, F-I-C-H-T-E.
Fichte was a follower of Kant.
During the period of the French Revolution, Fichte was teaching the doctrine of freedom,
the infinite freedom of the individual to shape your own sense of identity and to shape yourself in the world.
In fact, this is how you knew that you actually had a self.
It was through this ability for you to shape the environment around you.
And he talked about the almost infinite freedom that you have to take on an identity,
to posit yourself and then to posit the world around you.
This, as you can see, is a very strong sense of becoming.
And during the French Revolution, especially at the very beginning of the French Revolution,
this was very popular.
That's why it attracted a lot of more avant-garde people in Germany to Jena.
By 1797, of course, the French Revolution had become deterrent sour.
They had been the reign of terror, the guillotine.
Did you see that wonderful cartoon about the guillotine in the New Yorker?
There was this guillotine sitting in a couple's living room.
And there are two couples there.
And the woman is saying,
Who has time for that anymore?
It just sits there gathering dust.
Well, back at this time, they were still using it.
So, okay.
So the cast of characters were here.
We have here.
As I said, Friedrich Heldren, who went on to become a poet.
Friedrich Schlegel, who was a novelist and a literary critic.
Novalis, whose real name was Friedrich von Hartenberg.
But he also wrote poetry and a novel.
Friedrich Schleiermarker.
I love these names.
Who was a theologian.
And then Friedrich Schelling, who went on to become a famous philosopher.
There are two women who were very closely associated with the group.
There was Dorothea Mendelssohn-Vietzschlegel.
In Germany, when you are widowed or divorced,
and you are married, they just tack on your new husband's name to your older name.
So it gives you kind of your history,
as you are walking around carrying your history with you.
So here he is, sure she is.
Dorothea Mendelssohn-Vietzschlegel.
Here is another woman with a longer history.
Carolyn McKellis-Bremersschlegel Schelling.
If you are interested, the story,
before both of them is a really interesting story.
We will get into that later.
They practiced what they called simphilosophy.
Sim as S-Y-M.
Like a little symphony, but it was simphilosophy.
The group would get together and talk.
And sort of toss bounce ideas off one another.
And there was kind of a heightening of what they felt,
the sense of discovery they had,
as they were beginning to put together knowledge from all sorts of fields.
Dorothea herself wrote this passage.
Schlegel talked about the inner university as being a symphony of professors.
And the woman he was checking up with, Dorothea,
wrote this letter to her friend saying,
such an eternal concert of wit, poetry, art, and sciences surrounds me here,
can easily make one forget the rest of the world.
Because it was a very intense kind of avant-garde group getting together.
Their main field of study was philosophy.
Now you have to remember philosophy back in those days is not what it is now.
It wasn't just one department out of many in the university.
It was the overarching department.
This is where you took the knowledge that you gained in astronomy,
and physics, and biology, and all the other fields,
and tried to bring them together.
Kant, in addition to teaching what we regard as philosophy,
also taught math, science, anthropology, lots of different subjects.
And his duty was to bring everything together in one coherent body of knowledge.
Now the problems that they were facing at that time,
the big number one problem came from new discoveries in astronomy.
You've probably heard of William Herschel.
He was the astronomer who discovered the planet Uranus.
But he was even more influential in his view of the cosmos as a whole.
And to give you an idea of the fact that his discoveries had on intellectual history,
one of his main articles that he wrote on what he was seeing
as he was looking through his telescope appeared in 1789,
the same year as the French Revolution.
In 1788, Kant had written his critique of practical reason.
And at the end of the book he talks about the sense of wonder that comes
as you go out and look up in the nighttime sky and you see sublime order.
Everything is just so huge and so enormous,
but at the same time you sense behind it there's this very orderly rule of what's happening.
Everything follows the laws of physics that Newton discovered.
Eleven years later, Scholarmarker, in writing one of his books,
he says, you look up at the nighttime sky and you see chaos.
And this is the symbol for the infinite.
So what happened?
Herschel had written this paper in 1789,
and here's an account of it in one of the books written on this topic.
Herschel's crucial observation was that some galaxies were evidently older
and more evolved than others.
In Herschel said, we are unable to judge the relative age, maturity,
or climax of a sidereal system from the disposition of its component parts.
In other words, you look at it and you can tell how old it is.
Nebula and starcrusters are in effect like species of plants, he said,
at various stages of growth and decay.
Youth and age are comparative expressions,
and an oak of a certain age may be called young while a contemporary shrub
is already on the verge of its decay.
In other words, when you look at the age of galaxies,
we're talking about huge spans of time.
Now, he was the one who proposed that we live in an infinite universe,
and Earth is just on the little arm of the Milky Way.
He actually figured out where we were in the Milky Way by looking at the sky.
He and his sister, Caroline, were at the forefront of astronomy at the time.
In the same way that Copernicus moved the center of the universe from the Earth to the Sun,
Herschel came along and said, there ain't no center.
It's infinite. It's huge, and we're just part of one galaxy.
There are many galaxies out there.
And the time frame is required to think of it.
It got galaxy forming and going into the solution.
We're talking about millions and millions and millions of years.
It wasn't 6,000 years.
The way that later people had calculated the Bible.
We're talking huge amounts of time.
The fundamental force at work was gravity.
Gradually, over time, compressing nebulous gas into huge, bright galactic systems
and eventually condensing into individual stars.
So that, for instance, a cluster of nebula which is very gradually more compressed
and bright towards the middle may be in the perfection of its growth,
while another type of cluster is showing more equal compression
or distribution of individual stars might be looked at as very aged
or drawing towards a period of change or dissolution.
And Herschel goes on.
To continue the similarly borrowed from the vegetable kingdom,
the heavens are now seen to be resemble a luxuriant garden
which contains the greatest variety of productions in different flourishing beds.
We can extend the range of our experience of them to an immense duration.
In a garden, we may live successively to witness the germination,
blooming, foliage, fecundity, fading and withering and corruption of a plant.
Just so the universe presented is a various number of specimens
selected from every stage through which the plant passes in the course of its existence
but brought at once to our eyes and viewed in one particular moment from the Earth.
In other words, we can see galaxies at all different stages of life.
Now this blew people's minds.
There's another astronomer who was writing letters to his people said,
astronomy has enlarged the sphere of our conceptions and opened to us a universe without bounds,
for the human imagination is lost.
Surrounded by infinite space and swallowed up by an immensity of being,
man seems but as a drop of water in the ocean,
even confounded with a general mess.
But from this situation, perplexing as it is,
he endeavors to extricate himself and by looking abroad into nature,
employs the power she has bestowed upon him in investigating her works.
Notice there's no mention of God but this is just nature.
Nature is infinite.
Prior to this time, the only infinite thing that was admitted in Western thought was God.
Now the universe is infinite.
That's one problem right there.
In a universe with no center,
we were just living in one tiny little speck,
one little speck out of many little specks out there.
And the whole question of what does your life mean in the face of all this?
It became a big issue.
How are you going to relate in this?
What has meaning, what has no meaning?
Another problem that had come from philosophy at that time,
which was the view of the mechanical universe.
Live in a universe where everything operates according to Newton's laws.
Does this mean that you operate according to Newton's laws?
Does your body operate according to Newton's laws?
If so, how do you have any free will?
And there were two basic pictures of this.
There was Victor who drew on Kant.
He basically says,
we have this knowledge of our freedom.
No matter what science tells us,
we have the knowledge that we are free to act.
And that our lives do have meaning.
And it's by asserting that belief that we actually do create meaning for ourselves.
This of course requires a leap of faith.
How is it that you can do this in a universe that's mechanical?
And he just says, you just have to make that assumption that you can.
That was one.
On the other side was Spinoza.
She said God and the universe are the same thing.
What we experience as material reality
and what we experience as mental reality are actually just two sides of the same thing.
In other words, everything going through your brain now is basically a chemical reaction.
You see it from one side,
but a scientist looking in would see it from the other side,
but it's the same thing.
There's no difference between the two, just a point of view.
And in a universe like that, there's no free will at all.
Because everything has to follow the laws of physics.
And all you're doing is just kind of experiencing from one side.
The laws of physics says I appear to consciousness.
So from Victor's side, there is the striving of free will.
And on Spinoza's side, the attitude he counsels is a patient acceptance of determinism.
Of course, there's a question of how are you free to be even to accept if everything is determined?
But that's beside the point.
It calls into question the status of what they call teleology.
And what's the purpose of this? Where is this going?
And Victor says human history is all about the exertion of freedom.
The more as human history progresses, the more freedom you can push yourself, the better.
For Spinoza, he says we can't even conceive of it, but there's a point to this.
It just follows its laws in its own way.
Do these questions sound familiar?
These are the questions that the Romanics were faced with.
So the problem of infinite universe, the question of how can you be free in a universe where everything follows mechanical laws?
And then finally, there was the question of politics and economics.
In Germany, this was particularly an issue because in some of the Ducci's...
How do you pronounce that word? Ducci, I guess?
They were still living by medieval orders.
And in others, they were much more modern. Frederick the Great had modernized everything around Berlin
basically to maximize the revenue because it was expensive to be a monarch in the 18th century.
You have to put on big parties, you have to have a big palace.
Where are you going to get the money? You tax the people.
How are you going to tax the people most efficiently?
You have tax surveyors. Basically, you rationalize the economy.
So people were suffering both from medieval places and also from the modern world
where everything is more rationalized.
Here we can begin to see the postmodern side for some of the Romanics.
They were saying, this is crazy, this modern world.
They just kind of squeezed money out of us.
So, given that on the one hand you had these problems in Germany
and then there was the French Revolution, which raised the issue of what extent can you actually reform society
and find freedom.
In the beginning of the French Revolution,
Schelling and some of his friends at Holdren went out and they planted a tree and they danced around it
in celebration of the French Revolution.
And then later on they said, whoops.
Maybe we don't have the freedom we thought we did.
So that raises the question.
Between Fichte and Spinoza, is there a determinism to things that we just can't change
or do we have the right to exert our will?
So those are the questions they faced.
And their solutions came from a grab bag of 18th century philosophy, literature, science, religion.
And they all ascended on that issue of, I said, what are called theology.
What's the purpose of all this? Where is it going?
Part of it they grabbed the image from Herschel where he described the universe as an organism.
It's like a plant. It grows through certain stages.
There's birth, development, maturity, and then decay.
In fact, someone once said that that article that I quoted from,
Herschel converted his astronomy from being a mechanical science to being a life science.
We're studying the life cycle of stars, the life cycle of galaxies and so forth.
So what is this issue of teleology?
That ties into two big issues from the 18th century, which is biology and aesthetics.
Now to us, biology is one thing, aesthetics is something very far apart.
But back in the 18th century they were put together in a few minutes, so see why.
From biology and physics came knowledge about electromagnetism.
The fact that matter is not inert, it actually has energy.
Prior to that time they felt matter has to be inert, it's dead, and the only way anything's going to move
is if some conscious agent pushes it.
Now they said, hey, wait a minute, matter has electric energy.
It has magnetism. There are forces in matter.
What it does, it dissolves the boundary between mind and matter.
Matter has force, mind has force. Maybe it's the same force.
Maybe you had already been raised.
And as far as organisms, they were beginning to realize that in an organism, causality doesn't just go one way.
There are different parts of the body that are going to have an influence on other parts of the body,
which then in turn influence the first part.
There's an interplay between cause and effect, with one part of your body giving signals to another part,
and that part of the body giving signals back.
So they begin to see causality doesn't just go one way, there's something called organic causality.
The definition of an organism is something that is organized for the purpose of continued survival,
but it has a purpose.
This interplay of causes actually does have a purpose.
That's actually what defines an organism.
There's also an interplay between the organism and its environment.
You give a stimulus and the organism responds.
And in responding, it's going to change the environment, which then creates another stimulus that comes back.
So we're talking beginning to talk about feedback loops.
And secondly, the organism goes through stages of development.
It's heading someplace toward its goal.
You can see where this line of thinking is heading.
We don't live in an organic universe.
Excuse me, we don't live in a mechanical universe.
In an organic one, Herschel had said the universe is like a big plant.
This is what plants are like.
There's actually an interplay of forces.
So it's more organic.
As far as aesthetics, I don't know if we're ever going to get to the end of this.
I'll try to make it really simple.
You've probably heard of John Locke.
John Locke was basically saying we don't have any ideas that we didn't pick up from our senses.
And then we reflect on what we picked up from the senses and we try to make sense of the world.
He had a student whom we probably don't know.
We never study him in philosophy or anything else.
He's called the Earl of Shaftesbury.
This was the person he was tutoring.
The very first person to give a non-religious response to Locke,
which is that we don't have any ideas, but we do have certain innate qualities in the mind.
And one of them is that if you see a moral act, it is beautiful.
We're inspired by a moral act.
There's a sense of the beauty of that morality.
And that sensitivity to morality means that we're able to see the whole of a situation
and to see how that act fits beautifully into the whole.
So that human being as a member of society, if you do something really selfish,
it looks ugly because it doesn't promote the whole of which you were a part.
Shaftesbury was really big on interconnectedness.
In the fact that you are part of this whole,
your moral acts are things that further the whole and further yourself at the same time.
And he made the distinction between systems, which are organic,
in the sense that they are oriented toward an end.
Different things come together for a purpose,
rather than a random collection of what he called aggregates.
Just as an aside, this is where we get the word aggregate for the five aggregates.
So you begin to see, can you see the connection now between biology,
the theory of an organism and aesthetics?
There was a whole here and the parts act together to further the whole in an aesthetic system.
Throughout the 18th century, people in England,
as Shaftesbury didn't have much of an influence,
but in Germany, when he was translating in German, it hit Germany big.
A lot of philosophers picked up on this.
They liked to pick up on the idea that a beauty of an object
where all the parts fit together in the whole.
There's a unity in the diversity.
This is a really good symbol for the universe,
because the universe is nice and aesthetically whole.
It gives us knowledge of the perfection of God's cosmos.
There was also an interest, revival of interest in the 18th century in Plato,
and particularly Plato of the Symposium and the Phaedrus.
In the Symposium, Plato taught that your love for beauty
is an expression of your desire to return to something eternal.
All love, even aro-sexual desire, has basically a holy component to it.
They're talking about sacred sexuality.
They're talking about Plato.
First you have the desire for a beautiful body,
and then from that you begin to see beautiful things in nature.
That leads you to, what is the source of all beauty?
It sort of becomes more and more spiritual as your sense of beauty develops.
When we talk about platonic relationships,
it's not what Plato thought about platonic relationships.
The other part of Plato that they really picked up on was from the Phaedrus,
which is that when an artist has inspiration, it comes from a divine origin.
There's some God out there that acts within you that inspires you to create an artistic piece.
Aesthetics talks about the wholeness of things
and how the different parts fit into it for a particular purpose.
This is how aesthetics and biology come together.
Burke, an English thinker at the time, threw a monkey wrench into this.
He said there are two types of aesthetic experiences.
One is the sense of the beautiful and the other is the sense of sublime.
The beautiful is something, there's an object, you can see the proportion of its elements,
and everything feels nice and well proportioned, fits together nicely.
The sublime is something that's so big that you cannot get any sense of order particularly,
or a sense of how the pieces fit together, because it's too big to comprehend.
But it's overwhelming.
And the sense of sublime is really important.
It's what motivated our national park system,
because when they were talking about things in nature that were sublime,
they talked about canyons, waterfalls, mountains,
and for a long time that was the only national parks we had, canyons, waterfalls, mountains.
It wasn't until 1933 that we had a swamp.
That was some people's attitude towards the national parks that changed.
But in the beginning it was any part of nature that was just really overwhelming,
let's set it aside as a national park, so people can have a sense of the sublimity of the Grand Canyon,
the waterfalls in Yosemite, and whatnot.
Kant, built on Burke, when he talked about beauty.
On the one hand, beauty in its normal sense of something that's beautifully proportioned,
where all the parts fit together.
He said, this is a symbol of morality,
and the sublime gives you an intimation of a transcendent order and a transcendent purpose to all these things.
These are just symbols and intimations.
They don't prove anything, but they do give you this sort of aesthetic sense.
He also wanted to say that this aesthetic sense is what unifies the split between your pure reason,
which tells you that everything is mechanical,
and your practical reason, which tells you that you have free will.
He says, there's no proof that either side is right,
but when you go out and you sense the beauty of a natural object,
especially when you sense sublimity and nature,
it gives you the sense that there's something bigger out there that really holds all of this together.
You can't quite comprehend what it is, but you know it's there, since it's there.
Schiller, built on Kant, by talking about beauty as the appearance of freedom.
Freedom for him was not so much self-determination,
whereas it's balancing the different parts of your personality.
In other words, you're free because you have these drives,
you have these physical drives, but you also have intellectual drives, you have moral drives,
and they're usually in conflict, but he says you can find some way of bringing unity to them.
That's a beautiful act, but at the same time, that's how you can express your freedom.
Unlike Victor, he didn't say you had total freedom,
but you do have the freedom, giving that you have conflicting drives,
that you have the freedom to learn how to bring a balance to them.
That's how you accept it.
So, freedom becomes less a matter of self-determination,
but it's a matter of trying to bring balance and wholeness to yourself.
He talked about something called the play drive.
We have physical drives and we have moral drives,
and we put them together in the play drive.
This is not a drive in your computer.
You have this desire to want to be free enough to play.
When you're playing around, it's not totally arbitrary.
There are certain rules to the games you play, but there's no compulsion,
and it's in this state of mind where there's a sense of order, but there's no compulsion.
That's where you find freedom, and that's also where you find beauty.
Now, he's more interested in developing what he calls,
he says this sense of being able to step back from your drives and see them,
that's what he calls the aesthetic condition.
When people can get into that condition, then we can start having a society
where people can actually live together.
Up to that point, you're just being driven by your drives,
but when we can step back, we begin to see,
oh, it would be good if we could all fit together and work together.
We'd be able to increase not only the happiness of the whole,
but also the happiness of each individual person.
So, it's interesting, he says it's your aesthetic sense that makes society possible.
For him, art should not be teaching, it shouldn't be moralizing
in the sense that it teaches specific moral duties to you,
but it should be moral in the sense that it gives you a sense
that you really do have this freedom of willing, you should exercise it.
That's what art really does.
That's the good thing that art does.
Now, this kind of education that comes from art,
he says don't expect that the government is going to provide it.
Schiller himself had a really bad experience in school.
He had this duck and don, the duke, where he grew up, where he got his school,
had been frustrated because he couldn't really govern the little duchy that he was in charge of,
because they had a parliament.
So, he focused all his energy on governing this school that he had set up,
and it was a very militarized school.
You know, Schiller, he probably knows Schiller from Beethoven's 9th,
and he wrote the poem that Beethoven sent to him.
Can you imagine one of your poems being sent to Beethoven's 9th?
Unfortunately, Schiller didn't live to see that.
For him, the only role that he wanted at the state was to reorder the economy,
so people would have enough time and leisure to have an aesthetic sense.
Because he said, when you're working hard, and especially when you're working in society,
as he saw it then, this is one of the past eras where the romantics are quite modern.
He says, look at the division of labor.
No one can take pride in craftsmanship anymore.
They begin to have the cottage industry where, you know,
you do one part of it, and then the guy comes along, takes one part of what you've worked on,
and hands it to somebody else to do the next step.
So, it was the beginning of the assembly line.
You were living in an assembly line thing, and there was no place where people could have
an aesthetic sense that they had completed something.
He said, this is a very fragmenting experience.
But he wanted the state to be able to reorder the economy,
so people would have that sense of craftsmanship,
and also have the sense of time, enough time and leisure,
so they could have the development of what he called the aesthetic condition.
The ultimate art was not so much a thing that you created,
but you yourself became your work of art.
You're what he called the beautiful soul,
someone who was able to balance all the drives that you have,
both physical drives and your intellectual drives,
into something where your inclination to do the right thing
was really in line with the right thing.
He talked about two types of moral action.
There's the moral action that has grace,
in which your inclination tells you to do this,
and the moral law also tells you, your reason tells you,
this is what you should do.
There's a nice movement together, and that kind of act he said is graceful.
There are also acts, what he called acts of dignity,
where your inclinations tell you one thing,
your reason tells you something else.
And you do the moral thing.
It's not easy, but you do it.
That act, he says, has dignity.
I must admit, of all the people I've been studying recently,
I really like Schiller a lot.
He's got a lot of interesting insights.
Okay, so the shift in aesthetics and Schiller
goes away from the contemplation of art or nature
to the aesthetics of artistic creation.
What is it like to create a work of art,
particularly how do you make yourself into a work of art?
This comes largely from his medical background.
He was one of the early students
of what was called philosophical medicine.
Which is the belief that when you're treating an illness,
it's not just a matter of treating the body,
you've got to look at the mind.
Because a lot of the causes of disease come from the mind,
you've got to treat them together.
And so his sense of creating the sense of the wholeness
of the individual was important for him.
Now, bear with me for a few more minutes,
and I'll finish this list.
Okay.
It was at this time also that the history of art was being developed.
There was a man named Johann Winckelmann,
who studied Greek art.
He was the person who got people onto the idea
that the Greeks actually were better than the Romans
in terms of art.
And when he talked about Greek art,
he didn't talk about individual artists.
He talked about how to understand art
in the sense of the development of artistic styles.
He basically invented art history.
There was a certain style that would develop.
There's the early, middle, late version of the society style.
And it was important to see it in the context
of the culture that the art was created in.
And art developed, these styles developed organically.
In the same way that the universe develops organically.
He influenced a man named Hereter,
who said, you should actually see all intellectual activity this way.
Everything that a person thinks or does
should be seen as a kind of art.
And there are going to be developments of styles
that develop organically and go through time.
And he said, wouldn't it be wonderful,
instead of just studying a book,
we could study the author of the book
and see how that author was influenced by other people
and had an influence on other people behind him.
Now for us, we say, hey,
that's what we can read about in our universities all the time.
But for him, it was an unrealized ideal.
In this intellectual activity as art,
he also saw, in particular, religion as an art.
People respond to their sense of the divine
and appreciate texts.
And your sophistication as a human being
was that you would be able to appreciate texts
from all different religions from all different times.
It gives you a sense of the infinite.
The divine is working its way through everybody in every culture.
Religion is, the texts are especially well seen as poetry.
You develop them.
Each text is kind of an artistic expression.
The romantic expression is the best.
And what you should do if you want to develop maturity
is you want to develop an infinite taste.
So you can appreciate the creative force in the universe
as it expresses itself in all cultures changing over time.
Okay.
Okay.
Two more sources of thought for the romantics.
We hear the word romantic and the question is,
what's romantic about them?
I mean, they were having affairs.
Of those five people I just named,
four were having affairs at one time.
And three of them were adulterous.
And they glorified it.
One of them actually, Schlagel wrote a novel
based on his adulterous affair.
Glorifying that because he and this woman loved each other
truly their love was more holy than the fact that she was married.
And then another one who was also in the midst of an adulterous affair
wrote some letters to his friends saying that this is a really holy novel.
Because there is that side of the romantics.
But the whole idea of what we call romantic truth
comes from the word Roman,
which in German and French means novel.
You want to look at your life as a novel.
And the kinds of things you can say in a novel
are very different from what you can say in a philosophy class.
We'll get into this a little bit later.
The thing about novels is that
up to that time when you studied how to write literature
everybody went back to Aristotle.
And Aristotle would tell you how to write lyric poetry,
he would tell you how to write dramatic poetry.
Aristotle didn't know anything about novels
because they didn't exist in the ancient world.
And so you had this brand new art form
that was free to create its own rules.
So that's what they were doing at the time.
And then finally there was the influence of what's called pietism
in which in England was Methodism.
Which was based on the idea that it doesn't matter how you understand God
what matters is that you have the right feelings about God.
The right feeling relationship in which you turn over your will to God.
ANA actually came from pietism.
The idea that if you're going to solve your addiction
you've got to turn over your will to a higher power.
This basically was a pietist belief.
It didn't matter how you conceived of this higher power
as long as you had the right relationship.
The reason this came about was because in the 17th century
there had been the Thirty Years War
where the Catholics and the Protestants all killed each other off
over questions, via minor questions of theology.
And a lot of people were saying, this is crazy.
It doesn't matter how you conceive.
Is God really there on the bread
or is He not there on the bread in the wine?
What's important is that you do have the right relationship to God
in terms of feeling.
And so all of these were the sources for the Romantic thought.
Can we stop for a minute and ask you how many questions
about the sources that they're drawing on?
Otherwise you're going to get dazed.
So we have biology which talks about organic unity, organic causality.
We have aesthetics which talks about looking at the unity that holds diversity
and also particularly about the sense of the sublime which is this beauty
that goes beyond just proportion,
but the sense that there's some order to the sublime.
I have a question.
So with Herschel and all of them,
what was the view of the church or religion to their philosophies?
It was hard to argue against Herschel because he had the telescope.
The church had a lot less power in that those days
because after all, the church had really lost a lot of face
with those 30 years' war.
And this was a time when people were saying,
let's get free of the influence of the church.
We tend to think of the Romantics as being the authors of Let's Go By Our Feelings,
but that actually came a couple of generations earlier.
And Herschel was operating in that time
when people were beginning to shed a lot of what the church did.
So the church didn't have the authority it used to have.
And in fact, you had some clergymen with telescopes at this point.
This is when the Vatican actually set up its observatory.
They felt we can't beat them, join them.
Question?
So between Burke and Schiller, I missed the 45-second Kant summary.
Could you just repeat that one?
This is what intellectual history is like. If it's 1030, it's Kant.
Kant's main contribution to all this was his sense that it's the sublime
that gives us our religious sense, that there was something bigger out there.
Because when you're dealing in an infinite universe, it's sublime.
It's not just a nice, neat little thing like the solar system,
but we're talking about bigger issues.
And so for him, it's in our sense of the sublime
that our sense of religion is going to be found.
That's his contribution to what the Roman...
That's what the Roman is picked out in Kant.
Question?
And the dichotomy between perfect freedom and Spinoza's view,
was Spinoza totally kicked out of the picture?
He ended up being reinterpreted by Hereter.
Because the story behind this is fascinating, but I'll try to keep it short.
There was someone who revealed that in a famous Enlightenment figure named Lessing,
in the last months of his life, he revealed to this guy that he really was a Spinozist at heart.
Now, up to that time, Spinoza was a bad word in Europe, because they saw him as an atheist.
Hereter, though, immediately jumped on this and said,
maybe there's more to Spinoza than we thought, but what he did was,
instead of God as this substance, he reinterpreted Spinoza and said,
God is this infinite force, and God is moving through the universe.
And Spinoza was a mechanist in terms of his physics.
Hereter replaced that with an organic sense,
that there's this organic movement through history that's not known through reason,
but it's known through your aesthetic sense.
So Spinoza was saved, but totally transformed by this idea that there was this infinite force
acting through the universe, and of course, we're part of the universe.
And so that means the forces coming up within us are actually part of the divine force.
So instead of knowing God through your reason, as Spinoza told you,
he said, you know it through this artistic creative force that's coming up within you.
So that's how you salvage Spinoza by transforming him.
Spinoza wasn't around to tell him they was that.
No, well, I mean, this is what intellectual history is all about.
You're not around when they take your thought.
I mean, they did the same with all kinds of people, you know?
Changed it around.
Back and back, everyone?
I'm just wondering about the practice element of these romantic people.
Because I can feel that there's this bliss feeling.
Is the idea to kind of do what you can to maintain that blissful state?
Okay, well, we're going to talk about this in a minute,
which is basically their idea that the artistic creative moment is,
it's best explained by the organic metaphor in which you are taking in the influence from your environment
and then expressing it.
But for them, you want to be open to the infinitude of your environment.
The more open you are to the infinitude and also to the infinite change that's going on,
the better your expression of it.
So it's a lot about expression of this.
Yeah, because after all, it's the force that animates the universe
that's coming up through in your creative force as well.
They also said you can't rest on your laurels.
In other words, your creative force yesterday may not be the way you express the creative force today.
So you're constantly evolving.
So you don't hang on to your artistic creations from yesterday.
It also means that your sense of how you express your love today is not the same as how you expressed your love yesterday
and how you express it tomorrow, maybe something else.
In fact, I was looking at a video recently.
I'm trying to revive my French because I have to teach in French next year.
And I heard this guy saying, this is what dependent core rising is all about.
Who I loved yesterday, how I loved yesterday.
I'm not responsible for yesterday.
I'm responsible for right now.
So let's enjoy the right now.
And then tomorrow, we may have another right now.
See where this is going?
Thank you.
You said earlier something like, and I covered a lot of information.
So I'll get a lot of what I say wrong, but I think it was the organic.
You were speaking about organic thought, organic movement, how different parts were moving towards a purpose or a cause.
Something like that, you said.
Moving toward an end.
But I don't know if it was intentional or not.
You didn't say what that end was.
And because that fits into many other things, you said, as well as probably where we're going today.
And I'm curious.
There's etiology to this.
Where that was headed.
What is that end?
Well, each organism has its particular purpose, like you to survive and to reproduce before you die.
And then there's a question of how this particular organism fits in with the species that it's part of,
and how that species fits into the whole of the world.
Now, some people said, well, obviously God has some good purpose, so it's all going for a good end.
But then that becomes a question, just the general framework that an organism works toward an end.
If you view the universe as an organism, there must be some end to which it's going.
And the different romantics had different ideas about what that end was, but they all shared the same idea.
It's going someplace.
And either you can understand where it's going or you can just kind of intuit,
well, I don't know where it's going, but I know I'm part of this movement,
so whatever creative force is coming up through me must be the creative force that's leading to that end.
So again, it's either way you can trust something about this that it's all okay,
even though it's too big to put your head around.
There's a huge element of trust here, which again goes against what the Buddha talked about,
heedfulness, i.e. you can't trust everything that's coming up inside you.
So that's where this is headed.
Anything else?
Okay, so what did the romantics make out of this?
Okay, with the idea that everything is force, matter has force, the mind has force, we're all one.
We're all part of a large organism.
The oneness of being is the given that they said, okay, Spinoza said, okay, the universe is their one thing.
We're part of that universe. They picked that much up from Spinoza.
Here they rejected Fictus saying the universe is out there, we're in here and we're fighting.
They picked up Spinoza. We're all part of this one large being.
We've lost our sense of oneness, though.
And so we live in dualities.
These dualities are artificial, and so the spiritual quest is to get rid of those dualities.
They decided they could combine Spinoza and Ficta to explain the role of freedom of a finite person in an infinite universe,
but here the universe is organic.
The fact that it's not mechanical and organically organic is what allows them to say, well, there is some exercise of freedom.
And here they take freedom in Schiller's sense, and not that you have absolute freedom to shape yourself,
but you do have the freedom to decide which of your drives you're going to follow and which ones you're not.
And so you can try to find a sense of whole.
So as I said earlier, that the infinite is now an attribute not of God but of the cosmos.
And as I mentioned just now, they replace the impersonal determinism of Spinoza with the vitalism of Herod and Schiller,
which is the idea that there is a force moving through the universe.
And this force is organic and it's expressive.
The highest expression of it is when you can actually express.
You know, atoms can't express much, but animals can express more.
They can actually call to another.
Human beings can express more than animals.
They have a development of all of this same force.
Okay, the universe is constantly evolving.
It's going to an unknown end that nevertheless can be trusted to be good, because after all, it's God, right?
God's got to trust God.
So they rejected duality on that level, on the level of freedom.
They rejected duality of distinction between things in the world.
And it was basically seen at three levels.
One is that you reject the duality of human nature, your mind and body, and your reason, your sensibility are all parts of the same thing.
It's not like your reason goes against your emotions, but they should work together.
It's not like your mind and your body are separate.
They should be working together because they actually are a part of one.
They also rejected the duality between subject and object.
When you're looking at something outside, that is nothing really different from what's inside here.
They're all part of the same reality.
Subject and object here can be between you and nature as a whole, and also you and other human beings.
We're all part of a oneness.
Art is a kind of education that helps overcome any sense of duality we have.
It unifies society through love and art.
Those are the two things that unify society.
And you unify yourself with nature by your feelings expressed through poetry.
So again, it's the arts here that are going to bring about the unity that we're looking for.
So the basic proposition is oneness with all nature, a sense of being part of nature's ever-evolving purpose, is an immediate aesthetic intuition.
In other words, when you open yourself up in a very receptive, you will sense this oneness.
You will sense this power coming through you.
So putting your mind in a very receptive state.
And then from that receptive state, there will be a creation of something.
That's your work of art.
For them, the big issue, the big religious issue, is how to understand your relationship to the universe as a whole.
Okay, now that's a question of being. Who are you and what's the universe? How do you understand that relationship?
So you can see here, this is one area where the Romantics really were going against what the Buddha was teaching, because they're glorifying becoming.
We're looking for a heightened state of becoming in which you have a sense of oneness with the universe.
Now the question, how is this relationship to be understood?
Three of the Romantics we're talking about.
Novalis, Herlder, and Shegel talked about as an interplay between creative forces within and without you.
Both the inner bringing the outer toward completion and the outer bringing the inner.
In other words, you become a more complete person as you allow the infinite universe to act on you.
As you grow, and you do this not only by going out in nature and just kind of commuting with nature.
They also said, you know, if you want to understand how the universe is evolving, study history.
And not just German history or European history, world history.
They were beginning to have some sense of what was going on.
There was a world outside of Europe, and that the thought of the world outside of Europe really mattered.
It was good to know.
Now these creative forces, because they are constantly evolving, there's no rules that you can take from anybody in the past.
So the rules, each expression treats free to follow its own rules.
Expression must always be followed by a new openness, because the universe is constantly evolving.
So as I said, you know, what you felt about the universe yesterday may not be true about what you feel about it today.
So we have to learn how to develop this state of openness to the forces acting through you.
So we have new ways of expressing it.
Now the different thinkers had specific ways of looking at this.
And here I'll ask for your indulgence for a minute.
Novalis, I'll give you a little thing on Novalis. Novalis was the one who died young.
He was the one who was engaged to this young woman. She died before the age of 15.
Imagine being engaged before you're 15.
But she died, and he spent a lot of time at her tombstone.
Finally got re-engaged, and before he got married, died of tuberculosis.
I mean, typical romantic poet, okay?
He said, there's this process of the interplay between the forces.
On the one hand, you have to appropriate the world out there.
I mean, in other words, there are parts of the world that you have to make follow your will,
so that the world is no longer alien to you.
But at the same time, you have to alienate yourself.
In other words, you try to conform yourself to the object outside.
You know, you see the sky. He wrote lots of, a whole series of poems called Hymns to the Night,
which he goes off and talks about how great it is to be out there in the darkness with the stars.
And he talks about the universe you see up there in the rehearsals terms.
There's this infinite number of worlds out there.
Apparently he went to her, the woman's tombstone, at night,
in which you conform to what you sense outside there
and just try to channel that sense of what you're feeling.
He called this a state of the unconditioned.
Well, you're totally open. This is how they define unconditioned.
In other words, you are totally open to the influences out there.
And in doing so, and then you re-appropriate the rest of the world out there,
each side gets created and extended by this process of the interplay.
In other words, you're bringing the world to perfection
at the same time the world is bringing you to perfection,
as you create more and more sensitive art.
You can know yourself only by embodying and manifesting your activity
with things that you have some creative control over.
But at the same time, you have to become part of something bigger than you are
in order to do this.
So there's an interplay between the inner and the outer here.
In what he called self-alienation,
this process of being totally open to things bigger than yourself.
He said, it's the source of all self-abasement,
but it's also just the opposite.
It is the basis of all self-elevation.
This is the highest philosophical truth.
In other words, developing that sense of openness
that allows you to express.
Schelling, who was the one member of this group who was not a poet,
he tried to articulate a scientific basis for this interaction
between you and the cosmos as a whole.
He wrote about three or four different philosophies in the course of his career.
He'd have these huge systems that would say,
this is what makes sense of all of reality.
And then three years later he said, whoops, no, try it again.
He kept doing that for a long time.
But he made some interesting comments.
He had a huge influence on Emerson, which we'll get to later.
And he based all this idea on artistic creativity,
on a basic biology, the connection between what they called irritability,
the fact that you would be sensitive to something and then you would respond.
And then another term that used for it was sensibility
and that your response actually came from, you're trying to make sense
of these outside forces acting on you and to do an intelligent response.
So it's not just random response like material things,
but there is some plan to how you respond.
So he tried to find the source of all this in biology.
And his thought, the whole question of freedom,
came to me less and less than the idea that you had any choice.
Because you are finite, and this is where he's falling more and more back into Spinoza,
he said the finite is nothing unless it is part of the infinite.
And so you have to learn to see all of your activities as the totality of nature acting through you.
So freedom becomes not freedom of choice, but freedom of self-expression.
That plays a huge role in our society right now.
I don't care if I have choices or not, but I want to express what I feel.
Shelling was trying to give a philosophical basis for this.
So how is this sense of oneness and purpose best expressed?
Shelling in his particular case tried to create a system.
And all the rest said, you know, given the fact that everything is evolving all the time,
no system can contain us.
All you have are just flashes of insight, flashes of inspiration.
And so they're best created in different ways.
Heraldoran said, the best way to create all this, to express it, is through novels and poetry.
And you might choose a particular philosophy based on your stage of emotional development.
You're going through a bad period. You don't like yourself.
I can't help myself. This is the force of the universe acting through me.
At other times when you're being more creative in your life and things are going better,
then you start believing more in free will.
It's easy to make fun of this, but for him the whole idea is that there is no one system to contain things,
but different systems will express what you need at that particular stage in life.
They actually gave an astronomical image for this.
He says, the course of a planet, as it goes around the sun, is an ellipse.
It doesn't have just one center. It has two centers.
And sometimes you'll tend more towards the center of freedom, and other times you'll tend more to the center
of the outside forces acting in you, based on your stage of development.
Now, talking about stages of development, they don't talk about that in philosophy,
but you can talk about it in novels.
In fact, that's the ideal place.
Philosophies, he said, are tested by being lived,
and a novel is the best picture of how people actually live their lives.
He wrote a novel called Empyrean, and this is one of the statements in the novel.
Just as Jupiter's eagle heard the song of the muses, so I listened to the wonderful infinite tone within me.
It goes on to claim that the beauty of the one and all is not something that you have believed or think about,
but one has seen, he has seen and come to know it.
Now, if you stand up in a philosophy class and make that claim, nobody's going to talk to you out
and they've run you over to the English department.
But if you say that in a novel, it can be very convincing.
You get to trust the character, you empathize with the character,
and you say, yeah, I understand, I resonate with that.
So that's one way you express this sense of oneness and purpose of life,
is through novels and poetry.
Novalas, the other poet, said, openness should be cultivated
by what he called romanticizing the commonplace.
That quote I gave you earlier about romanticizing was from him.
And your response is to what he called live authentically.
Have you heard that word, having an authentic life or having an authentic response?
Novalas was the one who came up with that meaning of the word.
And again, the primary form is through novels and poetry.
Here's a quote from Novalas.
Romanticizing is nothing other than a qualitative raising to a higher power
by giving a higher meaning to the ordinary, a mysterious appearance to the ordinary.
The dignity of the unacquainted to that which we are acquainted,
the mere appearance of infinity to the finite, I romanticize them.
The opposite of being a Philistine, which means to sustain a mechanical repetition of your everyday habits,
is to be an authentic person, someone living outside the commonplace,
someone who has subjectively transformed the commonplace into something magical.
Here's a quote about Novalas.
Novalas came to conceive the central issue of our temporal existence is that of authenticity.
How to be true to ourselves is the kind of open-ended, temporal-existing creatures we are.
And how to be true to the fact that the choices we make about who we are,
best themselves choices based, or excuse me, who we are and to be,
are themselves choices based on fully contingent matters that are not only themselves,
not objects of choice, but it's very nature is necessarily obscured from our view.
In other words, we're not free to shape ourselves.
Only freedom is to take what lies beyond us and to fashion something out of it
that we can give a heightened reality to.
As he said, life must not be a novel that is given to us, but one that is made by us.
In other words, go out and make your life into a novel by romanticizing it,
bringing it to a heightened sense of the reality around you and having an authentic response.
As for trying to develop a philosophical system, he said, this is pathology.
You're trying to create a sense of being secure in this infinite universe
which is really beyond you because it's constantly changing.
You can trust it, but there's no ground on which you can base it.
Have you heard other Dharma teachers say this?
Yes, okay. They got it from Novalas whether they knew it or not.
Okay, now for Schlegel.
We're going to get anywhere this morning.
He basically said, openness is to be cultivated through a two-fold study,
one of interrelation, i.e. your sense of the infinite that you have in the present moment,
and the study of world history so you can see the general trend of progressive life.
He said, this gives you a broader basis for expressing your inner freedom
because you have a bigger sense of things than you would otherwise.
He also talked a lot about what he called romantic irony,
which was that the sense you know that you look at other people in another area of time
and you see, okay, their thought made sense in their time.
And you begin to wonder about, okay, the things that I see now, they are true for me,
but maybe they make sense to me only because I have limited patience in my own time,
which I don't know about, and therefore you always have to step back from your creation
and not totally identify with it.
In other words, you're never really, you're committed to something,
but at the same time you step outside of it and say, well, this is only bound by time.
So he called this a sense of romantic irony. We call it postmodernism.
But he had that same sense right from the early on.
He was a master of what was called the philosophical fragment.
He wrote a journal that was full of just little passages,
long, maybe a sentence or two, and his idea of the ideal fragment was that it would contain dualities
within it so that nothing was really settled ever,
but your thought was constantly moving on, moving on.
He took literally Novalis' recommendation to make his life into a novel.
He had an adulterous affair with Dorothy of Vite, Mendelssohn Vite.
He was the daughter of a famous philosopher in the 18th century.
He scandalized Berlin.
He didn't even scandalize him even more because he wrote a novel about it.
It was great, and he basically said,
he'd give a Platonic explanation to this in the sense that his love for her was his quest for spiritual truth.
Because his love was true and her love was true,
it was more holy than the matrimony by which she was bound to her husband.
So that's what happens when you live your life as a novel.
And his expression, he said,
basically his idea was that you would have an expression of this universal truth that you felt,
but then tomorrow you'd have to take an ironic stance to what you said yesterday,
because you were constantly evolving.
The member of the group that finally brought all of this into religion was a man named Schlauermacher.
He, by the way, became a friend of Schlegel at the time Schlegel was writing that novel.
And he wrote a number of reviews, you know, extolling Schlegels,
the holiness of Schlegel's view of holy love.
Well, turn out Schlauermacher was having an adulterous affair of his own at the time.
Imagine a theologian.
Schlauermacher is called the father of liberal theology.
He said, you know, this sense of being an artist,
open yourself to the infinite and expressing something out of it,
that's the religious experience.
You open yourself to the infinitude of God,
and then you will have this creative response that comes out of that.
So he defined religion as what he called the sensibility and taste for the infinite.
Something is always immediate and individual.
It requires an open passive acceptance that then precedes your creative or expressive response.
It dies when we try to grasp at the response, either our own response or that of others.
If you worship the Bible, you are worshiping a mausoleum of religion.
It was once a living expression of religion, but now it's just a book.
For true religion, you have to go back to your individual inspiration.
He said that we should see the individuality of religion.
Each person has his or her own religious expression,
and all traditions in which this sensibility and taste for the infinite thrives,
they're all valid religions.
But it's got that requirement.
You have to have that taste for the infinite.
That's what religion is all about.
Now, he probably wouldn't have counted, probably can,
in his having a taste for the infinite,
which is where some of this falls apart.
Just read you a few quotes from Schleiermacher.
Religion's assets is neither thinking nor acting, but intuition and feeling.
It wishes to intuit the universe,
as devoutly to overhear the universe's own manifestations and actions,
longs to be grasped and filled by the universe's immediate influence
in childlike passivity.
Religion wishes to see the infinite, its imprint,
and its manifestation in humanity,
no less than in all their individual and finite forms.
Religion also lives its whole life in nature,
but in the infinite nature of totality, the one and all.
Remember, he's living in this infinite universe now.
However, everything, including man, may press on,
or tarry within this internal ferment of individual forms and beings.
Religion wishes to intuit and to divine this in detail.
Intuition is and always remains something individual set apart,
the immediate perception and nothing more.
To bind it and to incorporate it into a whole
is once more the business not of sense, but of abstract thought.
The same is true of religion.
It stops with the immediate experiences of the existence
and actions of the universe, with the individual intuitions and feelings.
Each of these is a self-contained work without connections
and with others or dependence upon them.
It knows nothing about derivation and connection,
in other words, connection with one thought to the next.
For among all things religion can encounter,
that is why its innermost nature opposes.
Not only an individual factor, D, that one would call original at first,
but everything in religion is immediate and true for itself.
In other words, you can't judge it.
When you have persuaded another person to join you
in drawing the image of the Big Dipper onto the blue background of the worlds,
does he not nevertheless remain free to conceive the adjacent worlds
and contours that are immediately different from yours?
In other words, you look up at the sky, you see one thing,
you can tell me, you see the Big Dipper, yes,
but I can see other things as well.
This infinite chaos, where of course every point represents a world,
is actually the most suitable and highest symbol of religion.
Individual persons may have their own arrangement
and their own rubrics for arranging their religious intuitions,
and the particular can thereby neither win nor lose.
The other members of the circle picked up their religious ideas from Shalara Mark.
He joined the circle a little late,
but then immediately they started writing about religion as well.
Some of the ideas that they added, heralded and added the idea
that all religion is in its essence poetic,
in the sense that you're trying to express this relationship with the infinite,
the infinite is trying to express this relationship to the infinite.
It can never fully do that because every expression is finite.
So what's the best expression?
He says mythology, in which things stand for other things.
There's some kind of a symbolic relationship,
but we can't really express this in philosophical terms.
So it's myth and poetry is what religion is all about.
Schlegel called for a study of religion within the limits of art.
This is a take-off on Kant saying,
you want to study religion within the limits of reason alone.
Schlegel said, let's study within the limits of art.
You pay attention to the combination of the infinite
and symbolic forms whose symbolism consisted
in that which by everywhere the appearance of the finite
is placed in relation to the truth of the eternal
and is in this manner precisely dissolved therein.
The infinitude of the human spirit,
the divinity of all natural things,
and the humanity of the gods,
should remain the great eternal theme of this study.
He also had a postmodern take on this.
Our understanding of this, of course, is a myth of its own.
But it's the best myth that is for a related human progress.
So, how to summarize all this before we break for lunch.
What they're basically saying is,
there's a total individuality in religious experience
and there's no outside human religious authority.
Your experience of the event is your experience of the event.
Nobody can tell you anything different.
But there is a need for religious expression
and the ways it expressed follow certain laws.
And these laws are this.
What is the basic religious question?
In other words, okay, your relationship to the infinite.
That's the question.
It's a question in terms of becoming.
The Buddha would have thrown that question out.
Then, nothing, what is the status of religious texts?
They're basically poetry and mythology.
And what are the laws of the development of religious thought?
Okay, religions have to develop like an organism.
They have their beginnings, they have their maturity,
and then they have their end.
And religions all have to be,
we have to accept that this is how religions develop.
So, there are no eternal truths.
There are no universal truths,
aside from the truth that everybody's free.
But everybody is free to express their relationship with the infinite.
That's the issue for them.
That's what the religious issue is.
Do you have any questions on that?
Yes?
Mike?
I'm going to start with a quick question.
What was the word you said Novalis used,
the term of the unconditioned?
Do you know that German was used?
In Dinglichite, something like that.
I remember that he has one phrase where he says,
we search for the unconditioned and all we find are things.
And the word dingna is unconditioned.
Say the word again that you said before.
I think it's undinglichite.
Yeah, dingna is condition, but dingna is also thing.
He was playing on words.
I guess the other question I had,
you talked about this idea of the novel as we were creating our lives.
If what we think about our lives today is different
than what happens the next day and so forth,
is there a sense that we're learning something
or is there any kind of coherence?
Well, it's going to be coherent as you express it.
But then tomorrow you may have a new sense of the coherence.
And then they may have a new sense of the coherence.
So their novels, if you ever read any novels in these guys,
they're pretty formless.
Aside from Lucinda where there's a beginning and a middle and an end,
but with Herldron, he wrote Hyperion.
And I was, you know, someone said,
if you're looking for a plot, there ain't any.
But it's all these really fascinating contemplations
of the meaning of life and that kind of thing.
Herldron is really interesting.
I was talking to Peter Dale Scott just the other day.
And he was saying in the past two or three centuries,
he's one of the two or three top poets in his estimation.
And I read some of his poetry and it's very, very strange
and it's very beautiful.
He was the one who went crazy at the age 35.
This is a bad sign.
Yes, okay, okay, question.
Behind you to the left, yeah.
Were any of these romantics pointing to something?
Okay, their idea of pointing was that, you know,
we don't really know where this is going,
but we can trust that it's going in a good direction.
Their idea was that human society is going to be developing
greater and greater freedom.
And that there are, you know, occasional setbacks,
but the general move for that was to more and more society
should be able to express itself in greater and greater freedom.
And it's typical with young romantics is that as they got older,
the ones who survived got conservative.
In fact, they all ended up repudiating most of what they had said earlier on.
Question down here.
Well, I'm just flashing back to something that happened
when I was an undergraduate at Penn.
There was this guy who hung around campus who was very popular
with the students, even though he was kind of crazy.
He had obviously been well-educated at one time
and then something had happened to make him mentally disabled,
but he clearly had at one point been very knowledgeable and educated.
We called him the professor.
And I remember he would always say these wise sayings
that were sort of weird but sort of on target.
And I was, he just stopped me once and he asked me,
where are you going?
And I said, well, I'm going to a lecture on the Romantic poets.
And he said, well, I've read some of the Romantic poets.
I noticed a lot of them died young.
So I say, as a gentleman and a scholar to you,
be Romantic, but be Romantic objectively.
Hello.
My understanding is that in the Polly tradition,
there's a distinction between perfect and not perfect.
And it's seeming that the Romantics are saying
that that distinction is either unimportant
or that the imperfect is perfect in some way.
Let's change it from perfect to skillful and unskillful.
And there's a belief in the Buddhist tradition
that certain things are unskillful across the board.
And certain things are skillful across the board.
Whereas the Romantics say there are no across-the-board rules.
Again, what is the proper expression of your sense of the infinite
today may be different from what you thought yesterday
and what you're going to feel tomorrow.
And nobody's really in a position to say that you're wrong.
So it's very different.
Just the follow-up.
So also the idea that now is perfect,
there's no goal to remove that.
They did have a goal.
And they said that your sense of the now
is always going to be limited by the fact that you are finite.
And as an artist, you want to be able to open yourself up
more and more and more to the infinite
so that you get a better and better sense of what the now is.
But there is no overarching,
because the now is always in the sense of movement.
So there's no static,
no stable kind of perfection
or stable kind of way of expressing that
or understanding that.
And as a finite being, there's always going to be limitation.
You're never going to achieve complete oneness.
It's going to be a little bit outside of your reach.
But you have to keep striving.
That's their take.
There's no end to this.
Question?
So much of you mentioned this already,
but one thought that I had was that
there's, since every expression of,
or one's relationship to the infinite is totally personal,
that the way to realize that would also be totally personal.
So there are no methods either.
There's no method.
Well, the only method they have is, as I said,
trying to be more and more sensitive
and study world history.
The history of other religions,
history of other cultures and that kind of thing.
So it gives you a larger sense of what the human enterprise is all about.
That's about it.
Emerson, before we break for lunch,
one of the reasons we were influenced by the Romanics
is because Emerson really picked up on this.
And we think of Emerson as being kind of the quintessentially
American thinker, American poet.
And his contemporaries were all saying,
what are you bringing this German stuff in for?
They knew where it came from.
It came from this crowd.
What else can I say?
And Emerson really ran with the idea that
nobody can judge anybody else's religious inspiration.
There are no objective standards,
and there's no method.
It all becomes a matter of art.
And your judgment lies with any artistic judgment.
It's you judge what you like and other people will judge what they like.
And nobody can say anybody's wrong.
Question over here.
Where's the nearest mic?
There's one over there.
Testing.
As you were speaking and as you were discussing these different people,
one of the issues that I think is a big one in our society
at present time is defining our terms,
or even lack thereof.
Some terms that seem to have a fairly clear definition
even 40 years ago, such as conservative or liberal,
are now very, very amorthous and very confusing.
So when we discuss philosophers from two or three hundred years ago,
I'm wondering how close to understanding what they were trying to define
or express we are coming.
So I'm wondering is that a question that has arisen for you,
and if so, how have you dealt with it?
Again, as I said earlier, a lot of people have pointed out that certain terms
have not changed that much since then in Western philosophy,
like the idea of living an authentic life.
That's carried on throughout the sense of what artistic creation is all about,
that art is a judgment of art.
Kant was the person who basically said your standards of artistic perfection
are totally subjective, and that's an idea that's carried on quite a long ways.
We're still living in an infinite universe.
Our sense of whether the universe is organic or mechanical,
that goes back and forth from generation to generation.
But it's amazing how much has actually stayed the same.
I mean, you look at these people's pictures and they look very different.
At least they weren't wearing little wigs or anything by that point.
They'd stopped wearing the wigs, but in that sense there may be some differences.
But there's an awful lot here that actually has stayed the same.
Particularly this idea that religion is an art form.
This is what liberal theology is all about.
This is what liberal religious thought is all about.
There's more kind of an individual art form that each person has the right to choose,
and nobody else can judge them as to the expression of their religion.
But there are no objective standards in religion.
What do you mean by the word art?
Can you have the mic?
Even the word art.
You could talk to 100 people today or 100 years ago and get 100 different definitions.
I don't think it's that different.
What was new about them was that they had admitted the novel as an art form.
And we still recognize that as an art form.
And their ideas of novel.
They didn't have to have a plot as long as they talked about expression of character.
Okay, well that's a definition right there, expression of character.
Question in the back.
Working?
More a comment that I studied a lot of cultural history.
That this period in history, turn of the 19th century, 18th,
was formed the idea of what we still hold as what a person is.
Before that Mozart wore periwigs, Beethoven wore a suit like we wear,
and we're still stuck with that.
That's the thesis of today's talk.
But the whole question of what a person is,
nowadays you see people modeling their lives on reality TV shows.
Or just what they see on TV in general.
And here people are modeling their lives on the novel.
So there's that element of difference.
When they say art imitates life, life imitates art.
Facebook like expression, privacy is no longer an issue.
It's self-expression.
Question over here?
Excuse my confusion here.
I think I have a couple of questions within all this.
It seems to me what you've presented is a long continuing paradigm,
this western paradigm, the romantic paradigm.
So this afternoon's thesis then,
is it that that paradigm is attempting to absorb Buddhism
and work with it versus actually those who want to take Buddhism
and explore the actual end of suffering
and the confusion in, for example, picking a teacher or the path
and how to assess is this exactly what the Buddha said
or is this being confused with this whole romantic issue?
The question of course comes up.
There are going to have to be some changes
as things come to a different society.
What changes change the essence and what changes don't affect the essence?
That tends to get blurred in this
because the romantics say there's no essence to anything.
So just one follow-up question then.
At the beginning of the talk, you gave several, you read several pieces.
Some of those sounded as if they had a lot of Mahayana, Vajrayana.
There's a lot of parallels between some aspects of Mahayana and the romantic thought.
That's one of the reasons why Mahayana is so popular in the West
because you read that and it sounds like they're talking about the same thing we're talking about.
You can put a question mark next to that too.
I've told the story, I think.
I know if you've told it here about a friend of mine who was teaching English and Korean
and she'd taken pictures of American life to show to her students over there.
One series of pictures was in a Howard Johnson's restaurant.
They were hippies sitting at the counter and the kids were saying,
oh my gosh, this is so foreign.
We're talking Korea in the 1970s.
And they finally got, she had this one dispenser that was on the counter
and she said, can you figure out what this dispenser is for?
And they saw it and she said their eyes lit up and they all said, chopsticks.
And she said, no, straws.
And so we do the same thing. We read certain concepts in the Mahayana.
They said, wow, that sounds really familiar.
And so they would go for it.
And in Tera Vada, the fit is further apart.
But we still managed to say, ah, chopsticks.
So one last follow-up question then.
The Mahayana Vajrayana Zen developed from India through these different paths,
mixing with different cultures.
How much of those Buddhist religions, as you kind of mentioned,
how much of those actually are accurate according to what the Buddha taught?
That's a topic for another weekend.
I guess just the sense of those cultures mixed, as our culture is mixing.
Every culture is full of individuals.
And different individuals make the mix different.
So are we actually taking those mixtures and saying it's Buddhism
when in fact it isn't what the Buddha taught?
One more question.
I just wanted to get a little more of a sense of the place of ethics.
It sounded like it was really about aesthetics.
And was there any other place of ethics in those views?
Well, in Schiller you have a very definite sense that aesthetics is about living the moral life.
And you have very clear ideas of what the moral life was.
The romantics, they were kind of like the hippies of...
I mean, you see, out of the five, four were having extramarital affairs.
Three of them were adulterous affairs.
So that doesn't give you much of an inspiring example in terms of ethics.
So this is one of the reasons why ethics gets pushed off to the side and all this.
It's more this aesthetic sense of wholeness and sensitivity and then creative expression.
So let's break for lunch and we'll meet again at one.
