 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello friends, hello and greetings from Mountain View, California, and see you at Ohlone Land. Hope you are well in this moment in time and delighted to continue our exploration together. This week, the important practice of why speech that we engage with every day, externally and internally. And today we'll explore two of the invitations or directions that the Buddha gives us about why speech. Given that there are six I want to explore and we have five days, so today we're going to do two. And the two today are, is it beneficial? Is it connected to the goal of the path or is it idle chatter? So we're going to actually bring all of those together in one and the other one, is it kind? Is it kind? So is it beneficial? Is it kind? We will begin with exploring that, exploring these in our inner speech, in our inner practice, and then we'll explore them with our metta. Let's begin. Let's land in our bodies. Let's arrive in this moment in time. Letting there be a sense of uprightness in the body. Upright but not uptight. A sense of uprightness of integrity. Connecting with your values. Why am I here? Why am I sitting? Practicing in this moment in time. Answer that for yourself. And after connecting with your intention, setting your intention for this period of practice with kindness. Directing, turning your awareness inward to the body. Sensations of the feet and the earth stabilizing, grounding. Sensations of your sit bones, your bottom of the cushion, the chair. Your hands on your lap, these touch points. Help them ground you. Connecting with the breath. And the abdomen, the lower part of the body, so that there's a sense of grounding settling. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Connecting, becoming aware. Aware of the sensations of the breath and the body. Calm and settle. And then when thoughts arise, the inner speech arises. Let us know not to be entangled with or absorbed with but just to know. Is this inner speech beneficial? Is it connected with the goal of the path? Is it connected with my intention in this moment? Is it beneficial to me? Beneficial defined in that way? Is it beneficial, connected to the goal of the path in this moment? Or is it idle chatter? Simply getting to know and if you decide it's idle chatter, can you be kind and maybe smilingly, smilingly let go? And also noticing the tone of this inner speech. Is it kind? Is it spoken with a mind of loving kindness towards yourself, towards others? Shining the light of awareness, of mindfulness on our inner speech. And then when you've seen, when the heart has known, has seen with mindfulness, then release, let go. Let the breath, the sensations of the breath in the body be primary, settling, calming, centering. Thank you. Thank you................................................................... you you you you you you andOSS we turn the Let there be kindness. The heart, the mind of loving kindness, stores yourself. Or having showed up or having practiced as best as you were able to, without attachment to outcome in a particular way, you've done your best. Letting go of any self-judgment. Let there be appreciation for yourself and others, this wonderful Sangha, other practitioners who support you by their showing up, by their practice. Collectively, let us all recognize the goodness co-create it here and offer a share, this goodness, this merit, to all beings everywhere. May our turning towards goodness, this goodness serve not just myself but all beings everywhere in ways I cannot imagine. May all beings be safe from harm, inner and outer harm, be happy, enjoy us, be healthy as much as possible, and have ease in their lives. Especially those in challenging circumstances around the world right now, natural disasters, wars. May all beings, especially those, be free from suffering. May all beings be well, may all beings be free, including ourselves.
