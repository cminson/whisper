The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, hello everyone and welcome to this period of meditation. And one of the ways
that meditation can unfold, develop over time, is through appreciating some of the
beneficial states, beneficial ways of being, that come with meditation. And
sometimes in doing this appreciation, it's maybe keep the bar low, keep it
maybe in micromoments of beneficial states. Because as we appreciate these
beneficial states, that validates them, it makes room for them, it supports them
to grow more, and they can last more than just a micromoment. Maybe they last three
or four, or even who knows, maybe even a second or two. So the idea of appreciating
something, and one of the things to appreciate, is the moments the mind is
not preoccupied. And I think meditators sooner or later will begin being
sensitive, aware of how much thinking goes on in the mind, and how much our
attention is pulled into that world. Sometimes people are swept away in their
thoughts, and or they have something they're really churning on, or
ruminating about, and you know it just seems like the most natural thing in
the world to be thinking about it. Even for about the present moment, there's a
continual commentary about it that just seems like the most natural thing, but
it's a kind of preoccupation of the mind. The mind is occupied with thoughts, and
some people, because they identify with their thinking, well this idea there's
nothing wrong with thinking. This is who I am, and I should be free to think
whatever I want to think, it's important. And certainly those are, you know, it's
a fine attitude to have in and of itself, but it doesn't really support the
deepening of meditation, the deeper beneficial ways that meditation can
improve our lives, benefit us, free us. And it seems so important to begin being
sensitive to the difference between being preoccupied and the mind being, I don't
know, unoccupied is the right word, but the mind being ready, receptive, that it's
getting to be malleable and soft, that it's here. And this transition in a
period of meditation from being preoccupied to being here, now I'm
present. And a kind of being present that doesn't require thoughts to tell us
that. There's a knowing I'm here, that's there before we have a thought, oh I'm
here. And so to appreciate having arrived, appreciate an awareness that's here for a
micro moment without being preoccupied, available to be aware, available to sense,
to feel, to be present for, what is actually here. Now in this moment, sometimes
it is called arriving, we finally arrive in the present moment with our
attention. Rather than attention being swept up in or directed to or utilized by
all kinds of concerns and preoccupations. An unoccupied mind is not a blank mind
or a lazy mind, it's like a glass, a window, which has finally been cleaned. And
now we can see. And the preoccupations interfere with that seeing. So assuming a
meditation posture, and if your eyes are still open, maybe lowering your gaze, and
then gently closing your eyes.
And gently paying careful attention to the body and what's happening in your
body. Take a few long, slow, deep breaths. Maybe the deep inhale is kind of like
saying hello, body. Connecting, being present. And then letting the breathing
return to normal. And continue for a few months while, while you breathe in and
breathing out, feel your whole body, the whole breath body, relaxing as you
exhale. Noticing that while you're being present for the body breathing, is it
also a pull into the world of thoughts, ideas, preoccupations. And what's it like
to have both. An intention to be with your body breathing. And a mind wants to be
with concerns.
Underneath the minds, concerns, preoccupations, is there mental tension,
pressure to think. And if there is, as you exhale, relaxing the mind, letting the
mind spread out wide and still.
Taking a few moments to acknowledge any thoughts and concerns you have.
And by acknowledging them, maybe they can be put aside for now. So you can settle
more into your meditation, more into him and embodied connection to the present
moment.
And even if it's the smallest degree of being present for here and now, see if
you can appreciate the attention you have.
Appreciate the micro moments of un preoccupied attention to being here and
your breathing, your body in your experience.
And by acknowledging them, maybe they can be put aside for now.

If you give your awareness and tension attention over to breathing your body, it's
almost like giving it life, animating it. Instead of animating, energizing the
thinking, the preoccupation.

To be un preoccupied is a matter of degrees. It's not all or nothing.
Appreciate the degree to which your mind is less preoccupied, more here, in your experience.

As we come to the end of the sitting, to turn our attention now out to the world, there's
a difference between being available for others with our attention, our hearts, our
care to be available, versus advancing on people, asserting ourselves.
Being available rather than asserting, being available is to be un preoccupied, to be unbiased,
not to meet with judgments and preconceived ideas.
We learned in meditation about being unpreoccupied, but available, receptive, is invaluable for
how to be with others, to be available, not in some passive, withdrawn way, but available
to respond kindly, generously, lovingly, delightfully, respectfully, to be available,
to wish people well, rather than caught up in our reactions.
We are coming from our goodwill.
On this day, may the people that I encounter or know about, may they be well, may they
be happy.
On this day, the people who I will be encountering or knowing about, may they be safe.
On this day, the people that I'll have contact with or know about, may they be peaceful.
On this day, may the people who I think about or meet, may they be free.
And on this day, may I be available to have this goodwill, well-wishing for the people
that I become aware of.
May everyone we have encountered or think about or learn about today, may they be well.
Thank you.
