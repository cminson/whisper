 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.audiodarma.org. Hello everyone. Warm greetings from Redwood City at I.M.C. We are discussing the Discourse on the Four Foundations for Awareness and developing awareness on different areas of our life. The topic for today is developing awareness on the feeling tones of our experience, the ways in which things can be experienced as pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant or unpleasant. At this point, in the sattipatana, this point in the text we're following, the emphasis is not the pleasure or the pain of pleasant and unpleasant, but rather the inconstant nature in which these sensations appear. How they come, they persist, they go, they appear, they disappear. It's not just the sensations, but also the dance of this inconstancy also has to do with how we perceive them. Our perception is not constant. We're aware of the pain in the knee and then we hear a sound outside. Our attention for a moment is not with the pain or reduced with the pain. Then we have a thought of something and then we're back to the pain. It might seem like whenever we're paying attention to it, the pain is there in the knee. But in fact, the perception of it is varied and changing. If the attention is very close to the pain, we might see that it itself is made up of component sensations that are dancing and may be intense. Same thing with joy. So it isn't that we have to understand them. These pleasant and unpleasant experiences we have is only being inconstant, but it's the inconstant nature of them, the way in which they come and go, that becomes a foundation for being in the present moment, awakening awareness in the present moment. As an alternative to being reactive to them or caught in them or distracted and away from them, whatever it might be. So maybe that can be a little bit of meditation this morning. So to assume a upright, alert meditation posture and lowering your gaze of your eyes 45 degrees to the floor and relaxing the gaze, looking at nothing in particular, a loose focus, and then gently, if it's nice, close the eyes. And then having the attention in your torso, in your chest, ribcage, taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. Deep in-breaths and extended relaxation as you exhale. Relaxation where you settle in to your body and your seat. Maybe breathe deeply a couple of more times and as you exhale, relax into the contact of your body against the chair, your cushion, your bed, wherever you are. Letting the breathing return to normal. And maybe also to relax further, the exhale, the normal exhale, softening in the body, relaxing into your body more. And then centering yourself on the body breathing. Wherever you're easiest or nicest for you to be aware of the breathing in the body, enter into that part of your body to feel and sense the experience of breathing. And if there is any experience, any feeling, sense of peace or calm as you breathe, let that register in your body. Maybe there's a part of the exhale that feels peaceful or calm or the end of the exhale. Or maybe it's the beginning of the inhale. Relaxing the thinking muscle, relaxing the thinking mind. So the thinking mind moves towards greater peace or calm, tapping into the mind's ability to be at ease. Relaxing the thinking muscle, relaxing the feeling of the breath. Relaxing the thinking muscle, relaxing the feeling of the breath. And as you feel your breathing, the body breathing, notice if there's any pleasant or unpleasant sensations. Maybe a different parts of the cycle of breathing. And allow those sensations be felt and known peacefully. Seeing they're coming and going as you breathe in and as you breathe out. And it might be the pleasantness might be very mild. The unpleasantness might be very mild. Maybe it's a feeling of comfort and discomfort in the breathing. See if you can be untroubled by pleasant and unpleasant and rather breathe with it, feel it in the breathing, ride along. With it rising and passing of strengthening and weakening of pleasant and unpleasant as you breathe. Relaxing the thinking muscle, relaxing the feeling of the breath. Relaxing the feeling of the breath. Relaxing the feeling of the breath. Relaxing the feeling of the breath. The ancient analogy for the sensations of pleasant and unpleasant pleasure and discomfort is a vast peaceful lake. Imagine being at a lake that's peaceful, calm, relaxed, very still surface. And a gentle rain begins and a little drops on the surface of the lake. Those are likened to the sensations that come and go. Rippling briefly in the calmness of the mind.
