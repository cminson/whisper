 In the world of Buddhist psychology, the teachings of Buddhist psychology, they teach that in order to get really well concentrated with the mind, there's something like 35 or 38 different mental functionings or factors that come into play. Now don't get discouraged by that. You don't have to know all of those or even engage all of those, but it's interesting that so many different things come into play to get activated in order for this process to develop and happen. Two of the ones that are important, among the many I've talked about so far, are what's called the initial application of mind, the initial application of attention, and then the sustained application of attention. That's kind of technical language, but first applying yourself to the object concentration like the breath. Okay, I'm going to apply myself. Then once you're there, sustaining the attention, hanging in there. It's two different mental qualities or factors, the initial attention and the sustained attention. Some people are really good at one and not at the other. Some people are really good at, okay, I can connect to the breath, but as soon as they connect to the breath, the mind's ready to go off again, something else. They kind of drift away very quickly. Some people don't have the ability to really, even their motivation or they strength something to really make the initial application. Some people, once they get there, finally, can stay there, but they have just trouble getting there. If they do wander away, it takes a long time to come back. Both qualities are needed. It might be a little bit interesting for you to give you some images or some analogies for these two factors of the mind. One is one of polishing the bowl, which I gave you. There's a placing the cloth on the bowl and then there's the rubbing of it. If you rub too hard, I'm probably not good for the bowl, I don't know. But if you rub too lightly, nothing happens. You have to have just the right pressure. You have to keep it there. If you kind of lose contact with the bowl and you keep rubbing the cloth, nothing happens. You have to maintain the connection. Another image is that of a bird taking off for flight. You've seen these big ducks or goose or something and they're pretty clumsy. They're getting off the water, running along the water. They're flapping like crazy. But once they are up and get lifted, they can soar and they can let their arms out and just let the updrafts carry them. The initial application is the effort it takes to be there, arrive there, and then they're hanging in there. There's a standing attention said to be like the bird which has caught the updraft and you're kind of soaring. The last one is that of a bee. A bee approaches a flower, is the application of attention. Once it's near the flower, it begins circling the flower. It stays right there. The flower is smelling. I don't know what they do flying around it. The analogy is given is they fly around the flower. It's going towards the breath and then once you're there at the breath, it's staying in its environment. It's staying with it, being present for it, studying it, being with it. So hanging in there. It takes a lot of wisdom to hang in there. Wisdom that it's important to do, it's useful. That it's worthwhile to let go of the other concerns you might have, temporarily at least while you're doing this particular thing. It takes a lot of wisdom about how to be patient and forgiving and accepting of how difficult it is. It takes a lot of understanding about the tricks the mind has, about how it gets tricked and gets pulled away into other things or into judgments or into aversions or criticisms or into lethargy or resistance or doubt that might arise. So it requires some monitoring of all this, what's going on. You can't just kind of lock onto the breath and think that's it. You have to kind of put the attention there and then begin monitoring to see what is it that's supportive and helpful to kind of corral. Is that right? To corral? What if cowboys are gathering all the cattle up? Did they corral them? Before they put them in the corral, right? They're kind of hurting them together? Maybe they're hurting them together? So you begin to kind of lovingly, hurting together all the different factors of your mind, you know, to get them all lined up and kind of engaged in the same thing. Do you like that? Sometimes I say that trying to get the kids ready for the school in the morning is like, you know, I guess other people have said this too, but you know, it's hurting cats. Sometimes our mind is like trying to hurt cats. So a little bit, some comments about that meditation session. Anybody, what did you notice? What did you learn about your mind and how it functions and how to engage it and how to relax it and get a balance of these different factors? Is there anything you learn there, anybody? If you don't mind using them. I noticed that I would tend to lose focus on the out breath as the out breath would finish, that it started to get boring. And the in breath is more interesting. And so I tend to go wandering somewhere like in the middle of the out breath. Great. That's a great thing to notice. It's really important and useful with the breath meditation is to notice in the whole cycle of breathing in and breathing out, is your attention even throughout or does it waver at some point? And some people's wavers at the end of the out breath, sometimes people at the end breath, some people in between, they get kind of lost between the transition. Some people, the breath gets kind of vague. Some parts or sometimes there's a little number of different kinds of interesting things can happen in our relationship or where we connect to different points in that cycle of in out, in out. You might not initially, if you're kind of new to all this and kind of just getting your bearings, it might be hard to notice that. But as you start getting settling into the concentration, then you probably start getting, your breath starts getting slower, more relaxed, a little bit more. And you start noticing a little bit your relationship to the different parts of the breath. And if there's some part of the breath where you tend to not be so connected, or it's kind of vague and not so clear to the mind, that's where you're most likely to have the mind wander off into thought. A idle mind gets in trouble. So if the idle mind is, so you don't have something that it's connected to, then the mind drifts off and you'll find something else to do. And so if you notice a pattern and part of the cycle in the breath, it's always the out breath, you wander away or the out breath that's as vague, then you might think it could give yourself a little extra effort, a little oomph to get over that hump, to get through that out breath to stay there connected, a little strength there at that point. And you can relax in the in breath, for example, a little bit more. I also found the monitoring really helpful. It helped me also notice that when I tended to start to wander when the breath, when like the rhythm of the breath would become uncomfortable, or there'd be like a tightness in my throat, or I could feel my brow getting really tight, that when I started, that when I get uncomfortable, that my, I'm less motivated to want to stay with it. I'm not sure if the right thing is to kind of, kind of trudge through that uncomfortableness or to stop and try and, or to stop watching the breath and, and to more try and like breathe in such a way to bring that comfort back. I think that in different circumstances, either one is, one of the other might be the appropriate thing. And you could always try to, it could be a symptom of just trying too hard, for example, and you just need to relax. And maybe by just kind of trying to relax the breath, you kind of relax. So you could experiment with kind of coming back, finding a comfortable breath again. But if it keeps reoccurring, then maybe something else you need to understand and look at. And sometimes if there's something uncomfortable happening, you have to just be patient with it. This process is not always comfortable. So sometimes when it's uncomfortable, part of it is just persistence and patience and hanging in there, even when it's uncomfortable. And as long as you can stay there, you're developing that concentration. Another thing is that if there's some kind of difficulty that's arising, sometimes you need to understand what that is. And so if you let go of it or change your state too quickly, you might not understand why it's there in the first place. So you might, you know, so you have a number of options and hopefully you're going to meditate long enough that you can try the different options out different times. Thank you. Anybody else want to say something? Yes, please. I just noticed that applying a little bit of effort to keeping my mind on track made a very big difference for me. Was it very different than you? Yeah, very big difference for me. I remember the first week you had said you had mentioned letting go. And I guess I was really hung up on that and was really trying to let go and hope that it would all just come effortlessly. But applying a little bit of effort made a big difference. And sometimes you have to apply a lot of effort. I mean, sometimes the mind is like a wild Bronco. I mean, you know, some of you have noticed that already. And, you know, if you're going to stay on the Bronco, you have to, you know, you have to put in a lot of effort. And it's appropriate sometimes to put a lot of effort and to really stay there when, you know, you have to kind of meet the energy of the mind with the mind sometimes. Sometimes it's more useful to relax in the Bronco. Sometimes it's really, okay, I'm going to hang on there. Some people who associate meditation so strongly with just relaxing and letting go, that they don't feel like it's not okay to kind of really try hard, you really, you know, engage. Occasionally, it's really useful to engage very, very like a Bronco, you know, until it's tamed or while snelling in or something. So part of all this is learning a variety of skills, a variety of different approaches, and then learning, learning to use it in different ways, use different approaches, use it to begin getting a sense of what's useful in different times. There's not a one approach fits all situations kind of thing. So you're learning, you're learning a series of skills, you're learning skills, how to work with different things, just like a someone working with wood. They say someone's carving wood. You don't just learn one thing about wood, just carve away. You have to learn the different kinds of wood, different kinds of densities and strengths, require a different kind of put strength of pushing and chipping or whatever, or different knots, you have to work around it, you have to kind of work with what you have and the different techniques and tools, you know, to do the concentration. Sometimes with effort, the more, more scattered the mind is in a sense, the more effort we have to make at times. At some point, as the concentration develops, it's said that the, or the effort becomes effortless. And there's a wonderful way in which it switches from being effortful effort to being effortless effort. But because at some point it can be effortless, doesn't mean that you jump the gun. And so it was supposed to be effortless, I'm just going to sit here and let something happen, you know, you have to kind of get that running start, you know, the bird has to flap its wings enough to get up there to get the, you know, to get the updraft. And then it's effortless in a sense, right? So don't try to be, you know, don't try to get the updraft when you're still standing on the ground. Anybody else? Yes. It took me a long time to stop flapping to at the end. And it was helpful about the rubbing of the breath. Then I got to a place where it was like I was the breath. I mean, it was so pleasurable. But then I wanted more of that. And of course, then it went away. And then at the end, as you were coming out, that I was back in that place, and I didn't want to come back out. And I thought, well, somehow, it feels really good. But somehow, I didn't think that I was doing it right, meaning that now I wanted, I mean, I was like wanting to stay in that place and trying to, I mean, I wasn't even breathing. The end of the breath went away. I couldn't, I couldn't, I wasn't in touch with even an end to the breath. It was so... Did the in-breath come back again at some point? Well, at some point, my mind said, where did it go? And I took a breath, you know, and then I, I mean, it was more, I didn't know where the breath went. It just seemed like it was forever. I'm sure it was just short, but it felt like it was just, just kept going. I've had the experience where when I was new to meditation, relatively new, nearly years of the breath kind of going out with the out-breath and just going and going and going and going. And then, oh, I've got to die. You got to breathe. And eventually I learned that in that kind of stopping of the breath, you don't die. So, you know, you can actually, it's okay to go with it. You're not going to die. You know, the breath, the breath slow down dramatically in concentrated states. And a strong enough concentration, you don't need a lot of oxygen. We talked about that last week, right? You don't need a lot of oxygen. No, we didn't talk about that. Anyway, when the mind is really concentrated, strongly concentrated, it seems like that the metabolism or the oxygen, you know, the mind doesn't need, the brain uses a lot of oxygen normally with all its thinking and worrying and everything. And it seems when the mind gets really concentrated and still, you don't think it needs as much. And so you don't need to breathe as much. And so sometimes the breath gets really subtle. And sometimes it seems like it disappears entirely. So if that happens in meditation, don't worry. Now, the thing about the pleasure happens sometimes in meditation and take it as a good sign. Not everyone's going to experience pleasure when they get concentrated. So don't, that doesn't have to be the measure for your concentration. But when it does happen, wanting it and getting excited about it by it can pop you out of it. But wanting doesn't have to pop you out about it. So rather than rejecting all wanting, saying, oh, wanting is bad, that having desire is bad, which sometimes a Buddhist kind of problem, we can be all desire is bad. There are different kinds of desires. And so it's okay to want to develop the pleasure, the enjoyment and actually let it become stronger. That can be an appropriate desire. You just have to know how to hold that desire in the right way so it's not greedy. So there isn't kind of expectation or ambition or kind of clinging around it. But so it's kind of more open-ended and relaxed and it would be nice, you know, if you're not Christian, but if you're Christian, you can say God willing, Dharma willing or something. And then with that desire, you can actually start working that pleasure and letting it become more strengthening and developing it, beginning to suffuse your body, spread it through your body, that pleasure. So it's kind of extends out into your body more and more fully. So just because a desire this time screwed you up, don't reject all desire. It means you have to kind of refine your desire so it's a healthier kind. Yes, please. I'm relatively new to meditating only about a year and this last week I've noticed in trying the concentration practice, I can go about five, ten minutes and then I think I go to sleep. I don't fall over, but my mind, I don't recall anything I've been thinking about except maybe my brain was spinning little stories and nonsense and you know there's not any emotion there. It's just so I think I need something to activate my brain. So a few things about that. One is that some people are associating concentration. Concentration by itself is a relaxing factor of the mind. So if all you did was concentrate, you would actually get really tranquil and eventually go to sleep. So you can't only rely on concentration. You have to also have these arousing factors together with it so you can keep a good balance of energy. Some people have such a strong association with meditation, or some people have such a strong need for relaxation in their life. They're so worked up that they're pushing the relaxation factor when they're doing meditation and for a while they're getting a lot of benefits. It's really great. I'm getting more relaxed. It's great. But then at some point they go over that cross that line where they don't actually need to get more relaxed until they can get more energized at the same time. You can get more deeply relaxed in deep concentration than you can in ordinary states of mind. So your deepest states of relaxation will happen in concentration. However, if you are only trying to relax without having the energetic aspects also there, you won't reach the full capacity for relaxation. Does that make sense what I'm saying? To follow people? So if you want to go as far as you can in getting relaxed, make sure you're properly alert. So that could be. That's one possibility. Another possibility that's somewhat connected to that is that you're sleeping. Maybe you're sleep deprived. Or maybe you've overworked at work or kind of overstressed. So as you begin relaxing, you could actually go further, but because you're going relaxing, there's such a strong need for sleep that that takes over at some point. Another situation that happens is that concentration practice as we begin disengaging ourselves with our normal mental preoccupations and thoughts, the surface chatter of our mind. The surface chatter of our mind kind of functions as a lid on the pot and the popcorn. So if you take the lid off, sometimes the popcorn goes flying out. Sometimes all the stuff shows itself. You can reveal itself. And so sometimes as the surface chatter dives away, the material that's beneath there is troubling for the mind. And so one of the protective mechanisms the mind has is to go asleep. And it's like babies. They're overstimulated. The environment will go asleep as a protection. So adults have that capacity of meditation sometimes. And that could also be something. If something's about happening, that you'd rather go sleep and look at this. I don't know which of these it is for you to kind of figure out for yourself, but if you know there's a pattern after five or ten minutes this happens, be particularly alert just before it starts happening to see if you can start noticing what is actually happening. You can discover for yourself what is happening if you're paying enough attention. You might have to do that you might have to do it a dozen times before you begin teasing apart and noticing, oh that's what's happening. Now I now I can see what it's like just before that this happens. And when I can see that cue, then next time I'll know what to do so I don't cross that line. Makes sense? Last one here please. Just a very obvious observation that if you know already that you're sleepy, what I found out is I cannot do a concentration practice in a state of real sleepiness. It just doesn't happen. And so I learned I have to do this at a different time of day. Okay that's very wise. So doing a different time of day when you're not sleepy. I think it's best when you're doing concentration practice to don't rely on the concentration practice to take care of relaxing your everyday stress. Rather try to create an environment just before you meditate so that you're sufficiently relaxed. You go for a walk, have some tea, kind of make some space in your life. So you come to the meditation a little bit more relaxed. But also choose a time of day where the various factors are most supportive of you. So when you're alert if you can. Some people find it best early in the morning, some people other times. Some people don't have much choice when they do it because they're working when they're most alert. And you know at a job so they have to do it other times. But what you said in some monasteries, in Asia sometimes, Buddhist monasteries, they have these really intense retreats sometimes where you get very little sleep. And sometimes it's four hours a night of sleep for days, weeks, and an end. And sometimes you'll be at nights where you don't go to sleep at all. And I know I've heard in Korean and Zen monasteries sometimes they go seven days without anybody sleeping. So normally that's kind of problematic because there's all kinds of problems. Because our cosas can happen and all that. But in order to manage, first of all, when you go on long retreats your sleep needs drop just like your oxygen thing drops. And some people, it depends a little bit on person to person, varies. But I found that on long retreats I do really well on four and a half hours a night. And so I can just do that for weeks and weeks on end, four and a half hours. And after I did a three month retreat and went to visit my wife, my girlfriend, and after a couple of days out of the retreat I think I slept five and a half hours or six hours and I woke up and said something's wrong. I'm sleeping too much. I'm sleeping too much. She thought that was crazy. And some people will go down to two hours a night. And some people will go even less for periods of time. And it's quite, there's no psychosis, it's quite, because you don't need to sleep so much. But in the zen korean thing, when you're kind of sleep deprived, in order to survive in that kind of environment you have to arouse a tremendous zeal or strength of effort that with the strength, with the concentration is coupled with so much energy, so much effort in applying that that's what keeps you focused and present and capable. So, the mind has a tremendous capacity to arouse itself. Jack Cornfield's teacher, when he had a lot of sleepiness in meditation, told him to go sleep, to go meditate on the edge of a well. Or a friend of mine who had trouble sleeping, he went and got some kind of bowl that somehow would fit on top of his head and then fit in and then filled the bowl with marbles. And he sat there, because he thought that if he fell asleep in the marbles fell on the meditation hall floor, he would get so embarrassed that everybody would hear that it would keep him awake. You don't have to go through those extremes, but it's possible to arouse oneself, you know. So, everyone has difficulty with concentration at some point. Some people have more than others. I want to emphasize last time, same thing I want to emphasize from last time, some people get tremendous benefit from trying to develop concentration, but who never get concentrated. So, just because you have trouble getting concentrated, it doesn't mean that it's not beneficial for you to try or to be engaged in that process of doing it. Everyone has a different way of going through this process, a different way of the benefits. If you hear stories from one person who talks about, wow, I had this tremendous bliss and you haven't had that ever, there's no need to compare yourself or be concerned. Each person has their own way and your job is to monitor and be content with your way and see what you can learn, what you can explore, and what's helpful for you in this whole process. As you're monitoring yourself, you also start noticing what happens to you. If you do start getting concentrated, what some of the physical and mental symptoms are of developing concentration. There are shifts that happen. Some of the shifts might be, for example, you feel the body gets lighter or the mind starts to get lighter, both in terms of weight, occasionally in terms of actually color light. Like the mind gets a bit clearer or lighter, lights up in some ways, the visual field lights up. Sometimes the opposite happens, whereas people get concentrated, they feel heavier. Some people, as they get concentrated, feel warmer, warmer in their hands or warmer in their body. I've had the situation of meditating in a cold room and had so much heat coming off that I had to just peel off my shirts, my sweater, my shirts, and down to my t-shirt. It was just kind of like a furnace. As soon as I entered meditation, I got cold so fast, I fell back on again. Sometimes people actually get cold when they get concentrated. Sometimes I've seen people cover, I've done that also, cover myself with blankets when I get concentrated because somehow there's not enough inner heat being. So there are different symptoms, different manifestations of this. Sometimes there's tingling all over the skin that can happen. Sometimes aches and pains can surface as you get concentrated. As the body relaxes, the surface tensions and the body relax, the deeper tensions that are usually hidden show themselves. Those deeper tensions, people will say, oh my meditation practice is going backwards because now I'm so tense. It's not that you're getting tenser, it's that you're actually getting more relaxed, but the deeper underlying tension is showing itself. You know that, oh I'm getting tense, good, it's working. That can happen, right? There can be changes in your breathing pattern as you get concentrated. So one of the things you can engage with and monitor is how your breathing changes. Does it slow down? Does it get more faint? Does it move a little bit where your center of gravity is for breathing? Sometimes I'll feel it in my belly at first, and then as I get more concentrated, this center of gravity where I feel my breath changes up to my center of my chest. Occasionally people have other symptoms like the eyes will water or sometimes they'll get a lot of saliva temporarily. Sometimes people will see colors or images arise. It's best to not get involved in those colors and images. Just continue with the breath, continue with your object of concentration, but just know that happens sometimes. Maybe it's take it as a cheerleader. Yes, you're on track, but don't pay attention to me. Occasionally people will have sensory distortions when they get concentrated. And again, they're getting concentrated. Perceptional distortions, I mean, kind of things. I understand it this way, that perceptions are seldom pure perceptions, but perceptions are usually involved a fair degree of conceptualization. So if I see someone here and I see you as a man, I mean, that's a concept concept. And it's pretty innocent because I think you are, but it's still a concept going on that's applying to seeing this form and shape there. As the mind gets relaxed, the conceptualization of the mind begins to relax also. But there's sometimes a transition period where we're still receiving sensory input, but the creation of the sensory input into a perception, into a concept, is still, the mind's still trying to do it, but it'll do it in little bit kind of odd ways. And it isn't that you're hallucinating. It's more like suddenly someone's sitting there and you start, your body suddenly feels amazingly squat. Like you feel something, or your neck or your body feels suddenly so long, you feel like you're going to touch the ceiling and you have to open your eyes and make sure that nothing's changed. Or your hands get really big or small or something, that kind of little distortions happen. And so that's also a sign that you get concentrated. It'll pass with time. There are other things that can happen as you get concentrated, but this is probably enough for now. But in other words, one of the things you study, or just being relaxed, just feeling relaxed and calm and tranquil is a nice symptom of it all. Sometimes feeling clearer, greater clarity arises. So as you monitor and study this, you kind of notice the changes, how things change. And as you notice the changes, the more you can notice the changes, the more it actually helps you to find your way in the future into concentrated states. Oh, this is the way. This is what's helpful. This is what I did to get to there. This is what is required. So there's a lot of learning that happens with concentration. So it's not a dumb thing. Just hold your mind like that and everything's going to follow. There was a lot of information given today. Let yourself take in what you take in, and just keep doing the practice. And some of it will be useful, some of it won't be useful, some of it you'll remember in 10 years. Oh, now it's useful. But it's your engagement with a process that's really going to be the primary teacher for you, the teaching for you, and what you'll learn from your own experience. So the requirements from the class is sitting every day for 45 minutes. Sitting in the class doesn't count. You can make up for it tomorrow if you need to make up some extra time. 45 minutes doesn't have to be all at one time, but it could be three 15-minute sessions. In fact, if you're new to all this, it might be better for you to do short periods rather than one long period. And memorizing the metasuta, the meninga discourse, or say it differently. Engage in the process of trying to memorize it in a serious, sincere way. Whether you memorize it or not, that's, you know, I don't know, different people have different abilities. It doesn't matter if you succeed in it, it matters that you try. Even if you just memorize one's line, that's all you can do. That's beneficial and helpful in this process of learning. If you have memorized the sutra, then notice that if you don't keep it up, if you don't do it, practice it regularly, you'll lose it probably. So you have to maintain it. Same with meditation, you have to do it every day, the continuity is really important. And if you've memorized it, it might be nice for you to recite it silently or out loud before every sitting, both to get you into a nice mood and also to begin that process of concentrating the mind. Next week, I'm going to talk about the obstacles to concentration for all the rest of you who need that, all of us. Understanding the obstacles, the difficulties of getting concentrated is a really important part of the process of learning how to get concentrated. So that's for next week. Is it okay? Thank you very much.
