The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, good morning everyone.
So, this is the beginning of the week on the second to last exercise in the
Buddha's discourse on establishing awareness.
And it is the Seven Factors of Awakening.
And there's nothing in this exercise that talks about making these factors arise.
It's more recognizing they're there and then maintaining them.
So, the seven are mindfulness.
Usually the second one is called investigation, and tomorrow we'll talk about it some.
So, mindfulness, investigation, effort, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity.
And these are considered to be the crown jewel of Buddhist practice sometimes.
Because they come when practice begins to mature and develop.
When there starts to become kind of an inner momentum or naturalness of the qualities of the practice
living in us and coming forth and flowing through us in a certain way.
This is not an easy thing to experience.
For beginners, it's not so easy.
Sometimes it takes a long time of practice to begin to, these things get awakened.
And as they become awake, they're present and they support us.
So, remember, this is the second to last exercise.
It's the 12th exercise of 13 exercises in this discourse we have.
And I'd like to understand that the others provide the foundation.
We're kind of building momentum, developing, learning how to be mindful in the body and feelings and the mind.
And as learning happens and as the muscle of attention becomes stronger,
muscle of being in the present moment becomes stronger,
then we find ourselves that these things begin to arise.
And the first one that arises, or the first one that's talked about, is sati or mindfulness itself.
And as I said, the text doesn't say, you know, now practice mindfulness.
Now apply yourself more to being mindful.
But it says, basically it says, notice that there is mindfulness there.
And so the question is, what is mindfulness here?
And I prefer to translate the word sati as awareness.
And what we're doing is we're establishing awareness.
We're abiding in it, we're dwelling in it.
We are not doing awareness.
Nowhere in the Buddha's teachings does the Buddha say, do awareness.
Awareness itself is not a verb of something that we actively do,
but something that we establish or allow for, we abide in.
And that's kind of in the very beginning of the text, if you remember long at the start,
it talks about abiding, observing the four foundations.
So the city of abiding in something, knowing it's there,
in this very simple way.
So in that Nass meditation, I talked about the effortless quality of attention.
There's certainly attention that can take effort,
and sometimes that's useful to apply.
But sometimes there's a kind of effort that is effortless.
If you are just kind of minding your own business,
and suddenly a loud bird nearby whistles,
the first hearing of that bird just appears without any effort on your part.
If I'm sitting outside, and just as I was saying this,
I felt cold going through my thighs,
and that cold was effortless that it appeared, that knowing of it, it's just there.
It called attention to itself, and my mind knew it,
and I'm pretty equanimous and content to be here,
and it was not a problem to just know it.
And so then, so it began appreciating as practice deepens,
as certain moments of practice, of meditation practice, or other times,
as it continues and matures, there'll be times when we can tune into this effortless quality of attention.
And it might take some little gentle effort to let go enough to allow that to be there,
but with time, it becomes kind of maybe the backdrop, or it becomes the foundation,
it becomes the support for how we go through our lives,
because there's a kind of a constant awareness of present moment experience as we live it.
We don't get lost in our thoughts, we don't get lost in conversations,
we don't get lost in the work we're doing, we can do it wholeheartedly,
but there's a sense of feeling and knowing that seems almost like effortless,
that, oh, I'm here, this is where I'm present for,
it's almost like being present for a feeling of presence, some people might say,
ever-present presence, ever-present kind of awareness, attention.
And why this is useful as we develop awareness is that it's an awareness that doesn't automatically
come with attachment, with greed or clinging, with ill-will, with aversion,
with pushing things away.
Things are just allowed to be there without us being for or against them.
We don't have to accept them, and we don't have to condone them,
we don't have to criticize them.
The awareness in and of itself is not involved in being for or against,
it's not involved with needing to accept it or needing to reject it,
it's just there with the experience.
To practice acceptance is an extra step.
This allowing things to appear in the mind effortlessly might be evaluated
and thought as a kind of acceptance practice, but there's no acceptance being done.
It's just things arise in awareness, and here we are.
To do that with the breathing at the same time is part of the art of this that's possible to do.
And I'd like to give you, if I can, on this format of the video here,
I'd like to try to show you something.
If this finger of mine is my breathing, breathing in and breathing out,
and then one way of being aware of it, if my other hand is my mind,
and so the idea of focusing on the breathing, really being there with it,
and the mind comes and it really closes down, focuses, and it gets kind of tight,
it bears down, it focuses on it all together this way.
Now that's fine, it can be done, and it's possible to get very focused and concentrated this way.
That is very kind of nice.
In other ways, not to make any effort in the mind like that,
keep the mind relaxed and open, soft, and just kind of available.
And now I'm sitting outside, so I feel, when I do that,
I start feeling the wind and the palm of my hand, the back of my hand,
the cold in different places, it's kind of nice.
And then gently, I bring these two together.
This is the breathing, and this is the, you know, this is the hand,
open hand is the awareness, and I bring them together so that the breathing
and the softest part of the hand, the most sensitive part of the hand,
are in touch with each other.
And now I'm really feeling intimately the breathing,
and the world around me begins to fall away, disappear, recede,
because the breathing becomes the only thing I'm aware of,
but the breathing is known effortlessly.
The coming and going, the rhythm, the different sensations are known effortlessly.
There might be a tendency to want to do something again,
I have to stay there, I have to stay, not lose it,
and the mind begins to tighten up again and hold on.
But the idea here, when you come to this part of the Seven Factors of Awakening,
is for Sati to be awareness, to be less and less work,
and more and more arresting and abiding in awareness,
and then in that abiding, letting things be known effortlessly.
And if there is any work at this stage of practice,
it's to remember to do this.
Remember to do this.
Because it's not easy to be this way, there has to be some momentum in the mind.
Don't try to do it if it's not easy.
Rather, be very content, even to go back to the very beginning of Sati Ptana.
Go back just to the simplicity of practicing breath meditation.
The first four steps of this whole enterprise of Sati Ptana
is to really know, experience, know your breathing,
recognize the experiences of breathing,
and that takes a little bit more effort.
Then as you know it, know and recognize your whole body,
and then relax your body.
And that's how it begins.
Always go back to do that.
That's a fantastic practice in its own right.
And it leads to where we're going here with the seven factors of awakening.
So if you're not there yet in the seven factors, don't worry about it.
It's not important for you then.
But as the momentum builds,
then you'll see that there will be an effortless awareness that arises
that can hold things peacefully, hold things openly and clearly.
And this is a gift.
This is one of the great gifts of practice.
And it sets a stage for the other seven factors of awakening.
And tomorrow I'll talk about investigation,
which sounds like a lot of work,
but is also meant to have an effortless quality to it.
And how does that work?
That's what I'll talk about.
So thank you.
And I delight in being here outdoors at Spirit Rock doing this with you all of you.
And I see there's a note there, a chat about having an interactive session
at the end of this week.
Yeah, it's possible we can do that.
I'll look at my calendar and see.
I'm here at Spirit Rock through Wednesday.
So tomorrow and the next day we'll do it this way
in these rolling hills of Marin County.
And then Thursday and Friday I'll be back at IMC.
And so thank you all very, very much.
And I look forward to being here with you tomorrow.
