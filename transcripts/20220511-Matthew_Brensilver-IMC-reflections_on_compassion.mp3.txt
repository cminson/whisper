So, dukkha, suffering is both everywhere and super obvious, but it's also kind of shocking that there is suffering, there's something shocking, startling about that, at least startling to our nervous system.
And when there is some hard moment, find there's a part of me that can like barely believe it, you know, like of course I know I've contemplated dukkha a lot, right, but there's a little part of some naive part of my mind is like how is this happening, you know, and we can have that
sense of like, how did the universe conspire to do this to me, this moment, and it might be just like some small ache, you know.
Hala Aliyan, poet, psychologist and poet, wrote a kind of grief poem, this is, I think it was published in September or October of 2020.
So, pandemic, George Floyd election, staggering amount of dukkha, and one of the lines in that poem was the patients who come to me, swarmed with misery and astonishment, their hearts like newborns after the first needle.
Hearts like newborns after the first needle, dukkha can feel like that.
The Buddha asked that we comprehend suffering, that we comprehend suffering.
I somehow like that translation, comprehend suffering.
The act, really, of comprehending suffering highlights the necessity of love.
Sometimes I feel like, yeah, the first noble truth that there is dukkha contains the next three in a way to really comprehend suffering.
That is to know the necessity of love, of compassion.
Otherwise, we just kind of armor up and try to make the first noble truth vanish or we crumble, collapse.
So, the alternatives, when I think about it, the alternatives to love really are something like hate and apathy, those are the alternatives.
And so, while we have some details to work out, no doubt, the path is actually pretty clear.
Compassion is love in the face of dukkha, the wish that it be alleviated.
And part of compassion is coming to a more nuanced understanding of our own suffering.
We first comprehend our own suffering.
And so often, without training, we basically misdiagnose our own suffering.
You know, it's just like people are trained, a doctor, whatever trained in differential diagnosis or something.
And we have to train in diagnosing our own suffering too, because our habit is to embrace monocausal models, like single cause.
This is what's doing it.
This is the source of my suffering.
And the Buddhist psychology invites us into a much more complex map of causality.
It's almost never just this.
Our mind gets seduced into that, but as we practice more, we start to appreciate the complexity of causality.
So we're not highlighting just this, you know.
We have that fantasy, if I could just pull that one thread, the whole thing unravels, but our dukkha is a testament not to one thing, but kind of to everything.
And if we have the wrong diagnosis, we can issue the wrong treatment.
So often, we want to control our suffering rather than understand it.
And compassion makes us patient in our understanding, makes us patient in our understanding of suffering.
The compassion, the love of which I'm speaking, it's not a kind of enmeshed love.
It's not emotional contagion.
In that first phase of taking in the suffering of another, kind of the willingness to grieve with them.
We're not, it's not this pure emotional kind of contagion.
And my conditioning around love is a kind of enmeshed model or something.
It's like your pain is my pain is your pain.
And love and space are somehow intention rather than space affording room for love.
So I've found that the suffering, the suffering of loved ones spins me, spins me in particular ways.
And my words may be some, you know, might masquerade as compassion, but what they really testify to is the, my intolerance of their pain.
Yeah.
And so it's somehow wanting to quickly manage dukkha.
And it makes sense that, you know, as children, like the suffering of a parent or caretaker or someone, it's like an existential threat, you know.
And at some level growing up, all of us, all of us want the adult to be fully enlightened, you know, to be free of suffering.
To be a kind of master of samsara.
And that is not so.
And, and so maybe, maybe some of that sense of threat, the threat of the suffering of the other encodes some fear as we grow up.
We have our own families, commitments, loved ones, that the suffering of the other spins us, but compassion is not a kind of insistence that someone change.
It's even an insistence that someone stop suffering. It can feel that way.
But then we just need to issue our own heart love. It is, compassion is love in the face of suffering.
And the monk Machi Ricard and brain scientist Tonya Singer, they were doing some, you know, kind of study where, where he was in the scanner doing compassion practice and she's sort of, you know, this kind of exceptional being.
Okay, what's this person's brain like and
and she saw, she saw that kind of brain activity and she asked them afterwards like what were you doing, you know, is the brain activations, you know, looked quite different to what she expected.
She expected the kind of some of the familiar nodes that light up with when, when people are in a state of empathy.
The kind of brain regions that you would see activated when you experimentally you know a loved one is getting an electric shock or something like that.
And in empathy where we're feeling the grief of the others pain and that's hard, but compassion might use that as a seed for generating our commitment but that's not the last word.
It then this kind of turning of the heart to love to actually enjoying in a subtle way enjoying.
Thich Nhat Hanh said true love never makes you suffer. Compassion is a form of true love and love doesn't hurt clinging for sure hurts controlling for sure.
But love doesn't this kind of love.
So we recognize without without compassion, the path can feel almost sometimes like greed more and more happiness is peace for me.
And we we center this commitment to the welfare of others.
And we develop our own compassionate motivations by knowing suffering intimately and awareness in every day we can do this, the pain of pain, the pain of change, the pain of the disjointedness of samsara.
And as we start to release our own pain to comprehend dukkha to become more and more free.
The pain of the world doesn't so much resonate with our wounds but with our heart.
Our compassion is is vitalized our own healing energizes this kind of care makes it more urgent because we know suffering so vividly so intimately start to wish more and more naturally that it be alleviated.
And others and body speech in mind follows.
Secretly you have to fall in love with sentient beings.
Pick up whatever is useful and leave the rest behind. I would never say the same thing to each of you.
And so it's your job to decode the beneficial from what can be left behind.
Every once in a while I have this moment with my webcam knowing you're behind it.
Having one of those now. Okay.
