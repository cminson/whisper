The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Welcome again.
So what is the kind of effort that is the most supportive in our meditation practice?
What is the kind of effort required for relaxation?
Often these two can feel kind of on opposite ends of the spectrum and our ideas about what
it is to make effort often involves a lot of tightness, a lot of forcing, a lot of straining,
clenched focus. And yet you may find that this just stirs up our body and mind. And this kind
of effort is often simply rooted in the unwholesome qualities of wanting or craving and aversion
we're not liking. We're not liking how agitated our minds are, so we're making a trying hard,
making a hard effort to settle. You may notice this just increases the agitation. So what
is the most supportive kind of effort for our practice? And can we trust that this more
relaxed kind of effort is actually sowing the seeds that give rise to greater and greater
ease and well-being? So often we are orienting from a paradigm of control, of needing to
make something happen, that if we aren't controlling what's happening, aren't trying
hard to make something happen, then maybe nothing will happen. But one of the things
that one of the central insights or understandings that the Buddha had was around the conditions
that support the arising of happiness. There are a number of stories in the discourses
of the Buddha, a number of images and analogies that the Buddha gave for the unfolding of
the path and what truly supports the unfolding of the path. One of these is the image of
a hen with a clutch of eggs. He says that this hen may have a strong wish, may my chicks
hatch safely, but if she doesn't sit on the eggs to keep them warm and incubated, then
they won't hatch safely. On the other hand, if she does sit on the eggs to keep them warm
and incubated, then she doesn't even need to have a strong wish that they will hatch
safely, because the conditions she is putting in place, the conditions that naturally give
rise to the eggs being able to hatch safely. In another sutta, the Buddha says that when
we are acting in alignment with non-harming, when we are acting with ethical integrity,
that one need not make a wish, may I have no regrets. It is natural that for one who
is acting in integrity, in alignment with non-harming, with non-greed, with renunciation,
with generosity, it's natural that one will have no regrets. For one with no regrets,
one need not make a wish, may joy arise, may I be happy. It's natural for one who has
no regrets to experience joy and happiness. And this continues in the deepening and development
of the practice, for one who experiences joy and happiness, one need not make a wish, may
my body and mind become tranquil. It is only natural that for one with experiencing joy
and happiness, that their body and mind become tranquil. And for one whose body and mind
are tranquil, one need not make a wish, may I be immersed in samadhi. It is only natural
that for one whose body and mind are tranquil, that one will become immersed in samadhi. Samadhi
is this moment-to-moment awareness of experience, this moment-to-moment receiving and availability
to experience. And he says that for one who is immersed in samadhi, one need not make
a wish, may knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be arise. Because it
is only natural that for one who is immersed in samadhi, that knowledge and vision of things
as they have come to be will arise. This is pointing to the process, the natural process
of the arising of insight, the arising of understanding. This arises naturally when we are available
to experience in a sustained way. And that is what samadhi makes possible, this sustained
contact and intimacy with moment-to-moment experience. It is natural that when those
conditions are in place, that understanding will arise. One need not strive for or make
a wish, may understanding arise. When the conditions are in place, it will arise naturally.
And also in the story that the image that the Buddha gives of the hen and her clutch
of eggs, he also says that likewise, for a practitioner, one need not have a wish, may
my mind become liberated. If one is committed to the development of the practice, their
mind will become liberated. And on the other hand, if one is not committed to the development
of the practice, no matter how strongly one wishes, may my mind become liberated. If
there isn't the commitment to developing the practice, it will not happen. It is just
a lawful process, a lawful process. So how much are we trying to make something happen
that is kind of trying to force the hand of a natural process? Or how much are we simply
engaging in the path, engaging in the practice in a way that sows those seeds that will sprout
and ripen into the fruits of liberation? We can explore, oh, what is the level of effort
or striving? What is the kind of effort or striving? Is it trying to make something happen?
Or is it this beautiful commitment, this beautiful ardency, this unwavering availability to experience?
Side Autegenia will often talk about being relaxed relentlessly. What is it to be relaxed
relentlessly? Maybe this is the kind of effort, this is the kind of engagement that is the
most fruitful, the most onward leading. In fact, it takes some present moment awareness,
it takes mindfulness to fully relax, to fully know when we are relaxed. Without awareness
without mindfulness, we can't see the subtle ways in which we contract and hold tension
or extra effort. What if the practice is something more like relaxing continuously, relaxing
relentlessly, rather than focusing hard or not letting go of the present moment or something
like this? Maybe there can be more of a trusting and resting back, a trusting in the process
and being available to the process more than trying to make something happen. This is an
important thing to feel into and to start to refine, oh, how am I engaging in the practice?
What's the level of effort here? Is it adding extra stress and tension? Or is the effort,
does it have a quality of trust, of faith, of maybe even getting out of the way and letting
something happen, being available for something to happen? In the metasuta, the Buddha describes
some of the instructions or the qualities, the ways of being for those who know the path
of peace. Part of this is, he says, may they be contented and easily satisfied, not proud
and demanding in nature. What is it to be contented and easily satisfied and not demanding
as we are engaging in our mindfulness practice with commitment, with ardency in an unwavering
way? There can be this balance between this unwavering commitment, this really resting
our heart on the practice, really being available and also not demanding that anything happen,
being content with how it is, being easily satisfied. Where is this middle way for you
in your practice? In the Satipatanasuta, the Buddha uses the word over and over, abiding.
One abides, alert, mindful, aware. Abiding fills this quality of this unwavering being-with
experience, an unwavering presence. Abiding isn't a strained or forceful kind of quality,
but you can feel the steadiness, the relentless presence of abiding, of the availability of
abiding that isn't a forcing, a pushing, a pulling. Often, the image of a snow globe
is used. If you're holding a snow globe in your hand, it can only get so still, and yet
when you put it down, take your hand off of it and let it settle on its own, the water
and the snowflakes will settle to complete rest eventually. And when we do sit to practice,
we meet our conditioning. And so we may know, we may really know on some level that to relax,
to be available, to be curious, to be not demanding is the more skillful or perhaps
the more easeful, supportive way of practicing. And yet, when we sit and observe our minds,
we are observing these deep-seated habits and patterns that have been operating for
decades. And of course, we are going to observe trying to make something happen. We are going
to notice our minds struggling and trying hard, over-efforting. And this is not bad news.
This is actually the beauty of the practice is that meeting any experience, any experience
can be the object of wholesome cultivation, of wholesome and skillful practice. So when
we're seeing that our minds are clinging, are struggling, are trying hard to make something
happen or trying to get rid of what's happening, of course, of course, this is what our minds
have been conditioned to do. Can we recognize this as another natural process of the mind?
Can we include this? Can we meet it with kindness, with compassion? Oh, it's hard being human.
Yeah, this mind is holding on and can't let go. Maybe that recognition of the out-of-control
nature of our minds can be a support for a softening, a tenderizing of the heart. Can
we even be not demanding that our minds be not demanding when we want them to be? These
patterns are deeply conditioned. I'd like to read a story. This is not from the Buddha's
discourses. This is from a children's book. This is from the book series called Frog and
Toad. So it begins, frog was in his garden. Toad came walking by. What a fine garden you
have frog, he said. Yes, said frog, it is very nice. But it was hard work. I wish I had
a garden, said Toad. Here are some flower seeds. Plant them in the ground, said frog,
and soon you will have a garden. I'll soon, asked Toad. Quite soon, said frog. Toad ran
home. He planted the flower seeds. Now seeds, said Toad, start growing. Toad walked up and
down a few times. The seeds did not start to grow. Toad put his head close to the ground
and said loudly, now seeds, start growing. Toad looked at the ground again. The seeds
did not start to grow. Toad put his head very close to the ground and shouted, now seeds,
start growing. Frog came running up the path. What's all this noise, he asked. My seeds
will not grow, said Toad. You are shouting too much, said frog. These poor seeds are
afraid to grow. My seeds are afraid to grow, asked Toad. Of course, said frog. Leave them
alone for a few days. Let the sun shine on them. Let the rain fall on them. Soon your
seeds will start to grow. That night, Toad looked out his window. Drat, said Toad, my
seeds have not started to grow. They must be afraid of the dark. Toad went out to his
garden with some candles. I will read the seeds a story, said Toad. Then they will not
be afraid. Toad read a long story to his seeds. All the next day, Toad sang songs to his seeds.
And all the next day, Toad read poems to his seeds. And all the next day, Toad played music
for his seeds. Toad looked at the ground. The seeds still did not start to grow. What shall
I do? cried Toad. These must be the most frightened seeds in the world. Then Toad felt very tired,
and he fell asleep. Toad, Toad, wake up, said frog. Look at your garden. Toad looked at
his garden. Little green plants were coming up out of the ground. At last, shouted Toad,
my seeds have stopped being afraid to grow. And now you will have a nice garden, too,
said frog. Yes, said Toad, but you were right, frog. It was very hard work. How much are we
putting at our seeds? Or growing impatient that they haven't started to sprout? It's just not as
a seeing something to judge as bad, but oh, seeing where there is room for refinement, a room for
a recalibration of effort. Can we plant the seeds? Can we water them and allow the sun to shine on
them? And trust in this natural process, this lawful process, that when the conditions are in
place for the seeds to sprout and grow, that they will. And that any effort that we make beyond
planting and watering and putting in place the conditions that support the process is not necessary,
and maybe is just extra tension, extra trying on our part. And we may even find that when we
stop trying to make something happen, that that is when the practice starts to unfold and deepen in
a new way, in a way that is guided by more by the energy of the Dhamma than by personal effort. So,
I offer these reflections and thoughts about the practice and about the process of the unfolding
of the practice. And I would love to hear from you all what you've noticed in your own experience
around what kind of effort is most supportive. Maybe you've learned through discovering what
kinds of effort actually cause more stress or don't support a natural settling and unfolding of
the practice. And again, this is good news. We kind of have to go through doing it in the least
optimal way and we learn from that. Oh, this is not quite it. It's good news to be seeing that.
The more and more we go through that and the more and more we become aware of that,
the more we learn the way to engage that is more aligned, that is more supportive. I'll just end
with this. I'm just remembering that Saita Utejnaya will often say, instead of trying to get it right,
our practice is to be available to noticing how it's actually happening, what our minds are
actually doing, including letting our minds make quote mistakes, letting our minds get
caught in struggle because that's how the learning process unfolds. The more we get to know the
nature of stress and what causes stress, the more our minds naturally release those causes.
So, I invite any reflections from your own practice, any comments, questions. Please feel
free to unmute or raise your hand, whatever is easiest. Yeah, Marianne.
Great talk today about relaxing. I was thinking about that this morning. I was trying to solve
something and I noticed how contracted I get when I'm trying to figure it out in the mind with all
the multiple options, none of which are factual or just speculation, and I'm winding myself up.
I know from experience, the sooner I'm willing to let it go and relax, eventually an answer will
come. That's one answer and perfect. It doesn't come with 36 options. So, this relaxing relentlessly,
I love that slogan. Liz Powell one time said something, relax and receive. And I noticed
when I'm more open and receptive, the guidance will come rather than this spinning to get the
perfect right answer to be good enough. Yeah, great talk. Thank you. Thank you very much for
that reflection. Yeah. Beautiful. Hi. Hi. Hi. All right. I've got my phone. I'm not very good at
doing this, but yeah, I just really enjoyed your talk also. And I've just been realizing
just in the last few weeks or whatever, I even was clenching my jaw. I have to go to the dentist
today. I broke a tooth out or whatever, but it was like my priority is not on my practice. My
priority has been, okay, I got this thing that's going on. That is my priority. And I'll get to
the practice later when things settle down. And I'm just wondering if I can hear from you about
how to, I mean, if they can both be together, I feel like, oh, I've got to get this thing done.
It's like, I don't have time to, you know, have this mindfulness thing and it slows me down.
And I was just hearing you, I thought, God, I just, you know, my life is so much better.
And if I would just slow down a little bit, be more mindful, you'd save time in the long run.
But yeah, I really, really also enjoyed your talk. Thank you.
Thank you. Yeah, thank you for the comment. And yeah, it's important to see
the kind of the momentum of our minds and the momentum of this sense of, oh, I need to put all
of my attention on the things that I need to do. And it sounds like you already know,
just from what you said, that it is possible to do all of those things with kind of a natural just
being with your experience, just being with what it's like to be doing those things.
They don't even need to slow down outwardly. Like you can be, you know, running around and
working very quickly. And sometimes when there's a relaxed kind of being with that process that
can support there being kind of a sense of an inner stability in the midst of fast, maybe even
chaotic engagement or surroundings. And in terms of, you know, we will find our commitment kind of
coming and going, our sense of whether the practice is our priority, is that the center,
that will kind of come and go. And I just encourage you to be curious about, oh, what is going on when
the practice feels like it kind of like the interest in the practice falls to the wayside.
Maybe you can just be curious about, oh, what are the kind of the states, maybe the emotions,
maybe the qualities of the heart and mind that are present when that happens. And then also
those times when, oh, yeah, the importance of the practice really comes to the fore in the heart.
And then just recognize, oh, what does that feel like? And I'd just encourage a gentle exploration
of getting to know that and making room for it to be however it is. Not, as Andrea sometimes says,
you know, not wanting to practice is a perfectly fine thing to be aware of. So we can be, yeah,
just make room for all of that and just be curious about the process. Yeah, thank you.
This is such a basic thing, but I'm glad that a practice came up. I'm
a newly retired and learning, I had a learning about relaxing just in general, the shift from
the constant push, and I was still doing the push even though I didn't need to do it energetically.
So there's a relaxing, which shifted everything. I was able to, I'm now able to enjoy the time that
I have, and yet I haven't found the ideal time to practice that I don't have that struggle.
So my attachment to how I would like my day to flow. And I just can't, but if I go in the morning,
then I'm eating breakfast too late or I'm losing sleep. If I go in the evening, then I risk not
doing it or it messes up the rhythm with my partner. There's just, there's no time in the
day I want to suck. I just feel that and I'm being with it and I'm trying to be gentle and
like, oh, and yet, I mean, it's only been a few days or times that I've missed practicing, but
I feel like it's getting time to not miss practice anymore, because I know what happens when I
miss practice, when I don't practice, but eventually the benefits start to wane. So I don't know how
to do that. I don't know with this effort. It was so great. You talked about that, sitting on the
clutch of eggs, but when is the good time where I'm not going to feel that, I can feel a gentleness
about it and not kind of like, okay, Jan, you got to sit right now, feeling.
Right, right. Yeah, thanks for the comment. Yeah, paradoxically,
part of the practice is learning to open to and to be kind of not demanding of even our minds kind
of struggle and protest and not liking how it is. And there's such a learning in, you know,
it sounds like in what you're describing, there's already such a learning and oh,
this is the nature of the mind. There is no perfect satisfying,
easeful time. It's like we so often cannot arrange the world to conform to our kind of ideal
preferences. And so how are we when the conditions don't feel quite ideal?
Yeah, when the conditions don't feel ideal, that's really where the practice is. And
I would encourage being really available to what that experience is for you.
Just being very, very kind. Can we paradoxically be kind and gentle with our hearts when they're
being harsh, when they're struggling, when they're not liking?
It's opening to this truth of kind of the way that both the world is, which is kind of out
of our control and never quite permanently satisfying all of our wants and preferences.
And then learning from our relationship to that. Learning from our relationship to that.
Can we be available to, oh, what is it like to be with this, you know, feeling the conflict here of
sacrificing something for something else that feels important? Like what happens inside there
around that? And I'm curious what that's like for you. Yeah.
Yeah, I can feel a shift, Aryan, hearing you speak even though you didn't say exactly these words.
But if I approach this with the love of the Dharma, if I go, oh, wow, there's this thing that you love,
how can we support you? And that's a lot like sitting on the clutch of eggs, you know,
you just, it's more of a mother, you know. So how can I support you in investing, I guess,
I'm just trying to think of the right gentle word, investing in this practice that means so much
to you and that you love so much. Beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah. I heard in
your description and now again, even more, like how important, how much you know the fruit and
benefit of the practice and how important that is. Yeah. Yeah. And let that love be the guide.
And yeah, beautiful, beautiful. Thank you.
you
Maybe while we're seeing if there are any other comments or questions, just want to add
that, yeah, again, we really can't expect to have our minds be some way that we maybe even
we really know is a skilful way to be. It took years, years of being with the mind struggling
in the practice, the mind trying hard to do the practice to be aware in a very over-efforting,
tight way. It took years of being with that in my own practice for the learning to start to unfold
and ripen that gave rise to a new way of being, a new way of being with experience, of being in
this practice. And so even when that is what's happening, if we can meet that and be available
for that, can trust that we are actually putting the conditions in place for that to soften
and for patterns that lead to greater and greater happiness and ease to unfold, to ripen in the
future. So wherever we are, just meeting that exactly as it is, that is skilful practice.
I just want to underline that again. It's a long road in the suttas. Even some of the Buddha's
foremost disciples, like Anuruddha, was one of the Buddha's chief disciples, fully awakened
Arahant with penetrating wisdom and compassion. In the suttas, it took him 17 years of full-time,
committed practice as a monastic, complete renunciate to have a real opening and breakthrough
in his practice. But it does happen. It's lawful. It does happen. You can trust that.
Yeah. Any final comments or reflections?
Well, thank you all very much. It's lovely, lovely to be with you, to practice with you,
and to discuss the Dharma with you. And may the goodness of our practice and our time together
ripple out and be of benefit to all beings everywhere. May all beings everywhere be free from suffering.
