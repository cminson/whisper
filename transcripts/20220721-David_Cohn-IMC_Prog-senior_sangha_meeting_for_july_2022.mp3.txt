 I see a lot of warm, familiar faces and some new faces. So welcome all of you. So I hope what I talk about now makes sense to you. I just want to say a few things about this. This is something that's been inspiring to me lately. I've talked about it a little in small groups. A couple of weeks ago I called a woman who took care of us when we were little. Her name is Ruth. And Ruth has always been extremely religious. She's a minister. She's been a minister I think since she's been in her 20s. And religion is everything for her. And her husband is a minister. She's 92 years old now. And he's 99. And she loves to hear him preach. I wish my wife would like to hear me preach. Anyhow, she says he preaches to her every day. And she loves to take in his preaching. So knowing she's so religious I asked her, Ruth, do you pray a lot? And I knew the answer. Oh yes, David, I pray all the time. And I said, what do you pray? And she said, oh, I just say, I'm here God. That's it. I'm here God. And that just moved me so much what that means. And I know that means everything to her. She's got terrible pain, arthritis. But she's a very joyous and loving person, happy, laughing. I'm here God. For her, God is her refuge. God is out there. And she wants God to see her, to know her. I'm here God. Just know me. See me. That's enough. And this knowing and this seeing that's being held in God's omniscience, it heals everything in her. So she's okay. And what moves me particularly, I love all of that, but what particularly moves me is, what does that mean for us Buddhists? We don't believe in a God out there. But we do believe in a Buddha in here. We believe in something in us that knows us, that sees us, that holds us. Buddha is our refuge. I take refuge in this. Well, I use the word awareness. That's just something that I, it could be mindfulness or presence or just natural abiding. And this awareness, it's so close. It's so near to us. It's so immediate, direct, simple. I mean, are you aware right now? You're aware. You're awake when you woke up this morning. And unless you get lost in dreams and thoughts and imaginings, you'll be aware. Simply aware, not a big deal or a huge deal all day long until you go to sleep again at night. And you will know all day long, you will know, well, the Buddha named eight consciousnesses, you will know what you see, you'll know what you hear, you'll know what you taste when you're eating, you know all day sensations, what you touch. You know the thoughts, the thoughts that know I'm seeing, I'm hearing, and just aimless, blah, blah, blah. That's the sixth one. And the seventh one is the me, me, me consciousness. The afflictions, you know the afflictions, you know when you're feeling low self-esteem, the pain of that. Or when you're feeling anger, or fear, or doubt, or pride, I'm so great. When you're feeling all of these selfing, self-referential things. And when we, so the healing part of this is, when we know that peace, the seventh consciousness, we can just hold it in the purity and open accommodating awareness, like a sight, like a sound, like a sensation, like thinking. The only thing that we need to do is recognize the awareness, recognize that not only is there the fear, but there's the awareness, there's the knowing, the clarity that's holding the fear. Without bias, without prejudice, you know, for awareness it's okay. Fear is okay, sights are okay, it's nonpartisan, it's equally accommodating, equally accepting. If this is our refuge, we're safe here. As Julian of Norwich said, all is well and all shall be well. And all manner of things, all manner of things shall be well. Sights, sounds, tastes, touch, thinking, afflictions. And just by the way, the eighth consciousness is called the storehouse consciousness. It's the alaya vinyana that holds all of our karma and seeds that are waiting to sprout when the conditions provoke them. But that kind of determines our attitude. So it holds that too. It holds drowsiness, no problem with drowsiness, as long as we're not lost in drowsiness. It's like, this is so familiar to us, it's so close, yet we miss it. Like it's the air we breathe, this awareness. It's like a fish swims in water, but it doesn't know it's in water. A bird flies in the sky, but it doesn't know the atmosphere that it's in. It's, God, we live in this awareness. All we need to do is recognize it. This safe place, this place of love. This is love that Juliane, by the way, she was a, you know, she was an ascetic nun, she was a saint. She lived alone in a cell until the day she died. And this love was enough for her. This awareness was enough for her. She didn't need praise, reputation, success, material things. Just love was all she needed. Awareness is what we call it, perhaps. And she said, about that, hold on to this, what she said, first of all, for there is a force of love moving through the universe and you that holds us fast. This holds us fast and never lets us go. It's always there. Hold on to this and you will know and understand love more and more. You will not know or learn anything else. There's nothing else to know, ever. So I hope that makes sense to you. It's what we can live with, what we can be, you know, all through our lives and take refuge in all through our lives. No matter what happens, no matter what we lose, we'll never lose this. Our best friend. So let's just try this for a few minutes in meditation. So if you could assume a straight but relaxed posture. Take a couple of deep breaths and drop your thinking mind down into the body. Be down to the feet, the farthest place from the thinking mind. Be aware of the feet and relax the entire body and the calves, the thighs, your seat on your chair or in your cushion. And be aware of the small of your back and the lower back. Maybe let your back energy, let you rise a little bit. And be aware of the breath, the end rising and the falling of the belly of the diaphragm, relaxing your shoulders. And the arms, upper arms, lower arms, hands. And notice the changing sensations in the hands, the palms of the hands, the fingers. Changing, changing, oh, from microsecond to microsecond. This body is changing. There's no solid, stable, permanent self in this body. And relax and be aware of the neck and the throat. And relax the fleshy parts in the face. And relax the brain. And then widen their perspective and be aware of the entire body, relaxing the entire body. And notice you're holding this body and awareness. What about trying to make any effort whatsoever? Just be. Just natural. Just be yourself. There's nothing you need to do. You don't need to get a better state of mind. You don't need to get rid of what you may have considered not a good state of mind. Just let it be. You're safe here. You're free here. If we don't fight with what's happening, or try to improve what's happening, we're safe, we're content, we're finally home. As TS Eliot wrote, at the end of all our exploring or striving, we'll be just to arrive at where we started and know it again for the first time. You may hear some sounds. You may feel sensations of the body. You may see sights behind your eyelids, flickering shadows. There may be thoughts. There may be afflictions. Awareness accepts them all. In a way, awareness loves them all, embraces them all, welcomes them all. And they keep changing. The fear, like a wave, arises from the ocean of being. But it's still just water. So we're comfortable. We are water, and we're comfortable allowing it to rise to multiswaves and dissolve whenever it's ready. The waves keep rising and falling, and rising and falling. But what does not rise and fall is this steady, peaceful, warm embrace of this knowing mind, this benevolent, innate awareness, which is who we are. All is well, and all shall be well. And all manner of things shall be well. Okay. Thank you. How was that? Okay. Any questions or comments before we go into discussion? Okay. Well, we have, let's say, how about 22 minutes or something? Yeah, so Joe has put the questions that were in the chat to discuss. But, you know, when you begin the, when you get into your group, you might just check with each other. What's, how are you and what's inspiring you these days? It might be kind of nice just to kind of get to know each other. And the first question is, what do you want? What is your deepest desire? What do you really want? Do you want to be a big success at our age? Do you want beauty, wealth, a new car? Do you want everybody to think you're great? No. What do you want? What do you really want? So that's a good question, I think. And kind of an indicator about that is, like, why do you meditate? Why do you come here? Why do you study the Buddhist teachings and try to put them, you know, into your life, try to have them be a guide for you? What do you want from all that? So those are a couple of questions, and then there are some others. How were your little groups or small groups? Did you have nice discussions? Did you? Yeah. Anything that you would please share? Go ahead. Yeah. Hi, this is Catherine again. This is my first time at this group. And I had a wonderful time in our small group and really appreciated meeting Karen and Fran. And we talked about how we all wanted a good heart and to have kindness in how we say and do things. And we also talked about Kaliyana Mitta groups. And I was saying, and I guess we were saying that we all found too much guided meditation to be counterproductive to meditation, because it's like, you know, getting directions, getting directions and going into a trance. And then when you don't have it, there's nothing. And so I try to avoid guided meditations, basically. And that makes my practice work better. And so I'm looking for more of a circle of meditators and just to start meetings with having silent meditation works better for me. Good. Thank you for listening. Anyone else? Nikki. Hi. Yes, please. Well, we stumbled into a profound spot in our little group this morning. And one of the persons started out by saying, well, I'm just not sure that I can bring very much to this group this morning and then proceeded to walk us into this place of tender depth and made it possible for us to stay in that vulnerable place and examine loss a bit. And it was a surprise, a beautiful surprise. And I thank them, all three of them. Wonderful. Beautiful. Thank you. Someone else. How was it for you and your small group? I'm going to borrow your phrase. I love that place of tender depth because I feel like our group was exactly the same. It's always amazing to me with a 20 minute clock and the way it ticks down in the corner of the screen. But people immediately go to this place of sharing, I guess, because our topics are what is really important. These are things in our lives and in our Dharma practice and how it's woven together. That is just astonishing to me every single time. And so, like you, I thank everyone in my group where we just learn from each other. I feel inspired by each other. I share these things of great value and the troubles that everyone faces as part of life. But again, how the Dharma interweaves with these challenges in life. Thanks to everyone behind the scenes who brings us together. Much appreciated. Thank you, Keene. Anyone else? Okay, well, thank you. And let's take if we could just take a 10 minute break and be back by five after twelve. That's a little less than 10 minutes. But, you know, Robert is going to be coming next week and he's Mr. Love. He's got some wonderful things to say about love, I'm sure. And then Fiona too. So to make space for them. Try to come back at five after. Okay. The last coming up four years now, a dear friend from IMC had connected me with an app on my new smartphone called Insight Timer and it has been a wonderful support for me and daily practice since this time. And part of it. Everyone, I guess we're all back now. Later. I didn't see that I wasn't back. So, it's nice to be here with all of you and I think I know most of you, but for those of you who I don't know, my name is Robert Cusick and I also come to these senior things on a regular basis and have with David and Fiona since the beginning. How many years have we been doing this now? A few in any in in any event. Well be six months before the pandemic. Wow. So, yeah, we've been we've been together as a group for quite a while. So it's a delight to be here. Unlike a lot of you who are privileged enough to be retired. I'm still working full time. So I'm in meetings on Thursday mornings. Generally, they take me a little bit later and that's why I come in late. It's not out of any sense of a lack of respect for for participating in this. So it's a delight to be here and I, I understand that David kicked us off with sort of turning our. Oh, Robert, could you unmute starting. Robert could yeah. Yes, I'm so sorry. I have no idea what's going on with my zoom here today. So, I, what I was saying is I understand that David kicked us off this morning with turning our attention towards love as a topic in general. So, with that in mind, I think I'll just begin my portion here with a really beautiful little short poem by Hafiz called the, the sun never sets, and I may have shared it with this group before but it's lovely and it's worth hearing again. So the title of it is the sun never sets and have he says, even after all this time. The sun never says to the earth, you owe me. Look what happens with a love like that. It lights up the whole sky. So, maybe, just maybe hearing those words sort of make something stir inside of you. When I was just reading it it was like, I just felt my heart sort of leap a little bit. And that quality that feeling that feeling of love is, is close to us as the nearest moment, the next breath, the, the intention to pause enough to feel into our experience. It's not like we make this love happen. It's, we just simply receive it, we notice it. We let the embodied sense of it be known. This is, love is known in awareness in this way. So, the practices in, in Buddhism and in many wisdom traditions and religions, the practices to cultivate an awareness and an appreciation for the embodied experience of love and kindness and compassion are, you know, they're really focuses of attention. They're wholesome, wholesome endeavors and wholesome practices. And in the practice of Buddhism, at least, and maybe in, in all of these other religions as well, these practices are a way of sort of tapping into awareness and directing awareness, specifically just to be aware of the specifically directing awareness. And in the cases of, of these Brahma Vihara practices like love and kindness and, and compassion, and focusing on those for the purposes of this, you know, this. I hope it will be a conversation at a certain point. But these are practices that have the, an intent that's very sort of uplifting and buoyant and, and there's a feeling of like a boundlessness or an unconditionality about these qualities. And one of the ways that you can sort of tap into that feeling is that when you start to just feel into the actual embodied experience like that movement of love that jumped in me when I read the words look what happens with a love like that it lights up the sky. In that moment, I'm free of self referential narratives and stories that have me at the center of this experience. It's just the experience, the actual experience of compassion, or the actual experience of love. So, so it's, this is one of the giveaways of it there. The story of self isn't, isn't front and center there may still be self in there but it's not front and center. And, and these are qualities that are free from ill will, and they're free from aversion towards others, or towards ourselves they're free from judging and comparing and wanting things to be the way we want them to be and if they're not the way we want them to be then we're happy and sometimes we, you know, we do things that are not as skillful as they could be. So, these are uplifted buoyant sort of unconditional qualities these things, they have these qualities to them, and they're free from self referential boundaries or stories or narratives. And they're also free from ill will and aversion towards others, and, and that goes for the ill will and aversion that we direct towards ourselves. And so these practices are they connect us to really beautiful sublime states that are grounded in our own ability to relate to ourselves and to relate to others and consider it healthy kind intended ways with care with consideration with respect for one another, and for ourselves, it's really important that we see that, you know, we can offer the same kindness and goodness, good wishes for ourselves, as we can for other people. So for a lot of people it's easier to give these qualities out than it is to receive these qualities for ourselves. And we can do this not only when we're meditating, not only when we're sitting in formal meditation or we're on a retreat or we're at a, you know, a meditation set, but right in the midst of our lives and the ebb and flow of the messiness and of all the circumstances that make up our daily life experience. So, loving kindness and compassion are qualities that sort of are built into our, are programmed into our DNA, they're innate. And at the same time, they're qualities that we can talk about that we can, we can cultivate their qualities that can be taught their qualities that can be learned their qualities that can be modeled. So, so for instance with empathy, all children are born empathetic, but if empathy isn't modeled for them in their home. It doesn't develop and, and they don't learn to be empathic with one another, just automatically, it's something that's there, the seeds are there, but the modeling and the demonstration and the treatment by others, the empathic treatment by their parents and their environments will, will have a tremendous impact. So, these are qualities that are innate, but they can also be cultivated, they can also be learned. And these Brahma, the Hara qualities of metta and karuna, they don't rest upon us like creating these states or manufacturing emotional states. So, let me try to explain what I mean. And what I'm pointing to here. These practices aren't about imposing an ideal of wishing everyone to be free from suffering, or liking and loving everyone all the time. They are about that, but that's not, that's not the essence of it. They're also very very specific practices for us to learn how to meet the moment of our experience, the actual moment to moment experience that we're having, or how to meet that, or how to meet our attitude towards whatever is happening in the moment, including the actual way we feel about it, the actual felt sense that we have in our body, the sensations that we have in our body without aversion, without ill will. So, I want to, I want to emphasize that again because this is something that's obvious but isn't always clear. And it wasn't clear to me in the early years of my practice. I didn't under, I, maybe I would have figured it out if I had thought about it but I never thought about it and, and so I didn't figure it out. But these practices are, as I said earlier, ways that we can meet the moment of our experience without ill will. They're free of ill will. This is one of the ways that you can know when you're really in the zone of meta or compassion. So, ill will shows up in, you know, negative mind states, but negative mind states are as natural and as normal as positive mind states. It's the way that we relate to those states that has a direct effect on our immediate and long term experience. So, negative mind states, positive mind states, it's all, you know, one or the other, it doesn't make any difference what it is. It's the way that we're in relationship to it. So if we're in relationship to a negative mind state or a positive mind state with aversion or with clinging, you know, I, this is great. I love it. I want more of it. And I'm clinging to it. It also impacts not just my immediate but my long term experience. So, so negative states also create in our mind a kind of tension, just like clinging to positive states creates this quality of tension in our mind. And when this tension, when we, when we recognize or feel this tension in our mind, the body, there's a mind body connection and we feel it in our body. And, and it generally has an unpleasant Veda not associated with it, pleasant unpleasant neither pleasant or unpleasant. Well, negative mind states or, or positive mind states that we're clinging to will have this unpleasant Veda not associated with it as well. And this is, if it's clinging, this is the aversion of not wanting. That's basically what we're feeling. So, when we learn just to feel the feeling just that it as it is as a, like a sensory experience or a sensation that's just happening it arises and it abides for a while. And then, obviously, it, it passes and something else shows up. So, when we can feel the feeling for what it is, a sensation rather than reifying it and giving it an identity about who we think we are. We can begin to relax, we can begin to allow the feeling to be there, because it is there, we can allow it to just be there without resisting it. You know, it might not feel well, nice, but it's just, it is what it is and it's not permanent. And we can allow it to pass through us without holding on or pushing it away or turning it into an aspect of who we think we are. And this kind of mind state of non aversion frees up the intent of our mind and allows us to return to the natural state of kindness and compassion. And we can feel what that's like, we can feel the release, we can feel the letting go. So I want to repeat that. This mind state of non aversion frees up the intent of our mind and it allows us to return to our natural state of kindness, of compassion, of love. When we're in an aversive reaction, whether we're clinging to something or we're resisting and pushing something away, this natural state of love that David was talking about earlier, this quality is not available to us because we're not aware of it. We've lost it in our awareness. But when we begin to notice what it's like when we're in this natural state, we see that we're not manufacturing this state, we're simply creating conditions where this state can be known. And we can learn to support ourselves in feeling the feelings we're experiencing, but letting them flow through us without hooking us. That means we can let something that doesn't feel necessarily good, we can just acknowledge this doesn't feel good, but we don't hold on to it. We can be with it. Our relationship to it has more space around it. So this is one of the ways that we can use mindfulness practice. It allows us to recognize these beautiful qualities for what they are. So, as I started this a few minutes ago, I just reflection I'm going to end it with our friend Hafiz. Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth, you owe me. Look what happens with a love like that. It lights up the whole sky. There is nothing in that poem about Hafiz's ego. And there is nothing in that poem that has even a twinge of aversiveness or resistance to it. Look what happens with a love like that. It lights up the whole sky. And that is your natural state, my friends. May we all have the good fortune and the intention to live from that place and to share that kind of a world with one another. And I think that the world is in such a state of turmoil today that it's easy to get lost in the concocting of what lesser minds bring to the stage. So, what I'd like to do is I'd just like to pop you into a breakout room for just maybe about, let's, Joe, can you put them into breakout rooms of like three, so that everybody has just a chance to maybe look at one of the promises. Look at one of the prompts that I want you to look at. And I think Joe has put them or is going to put them into chat. The prompt is how do you know when you're happy? Where in your body is happiness most easily known? This wish to be happy, this feels a certain way and trust your body there. So, where in your body is it most easily known? And then is knowing happiness or stress for you connected to an inner bodily sense? When you're happy, does your body let you know you're happy? When you're troubled, does your body let you know you're troubled? Is that something I just reflect on that a little bit and you can answer either one of those or talk about it. Either one of those or anything else about this topic that you want to. And let's, Joe, bring them back by about, let's see, at Fiona wants about 15 minutes. So, let's come back just a little bit before a quarter to the, is that enough time, Fiona, for you? You know, that's, you know, I can do this. This is a beautiful subject, Robert. So, give people time to, in their groups. Okay, so let's go in until a quarter to the hour and we'll come out then. And then I'll take one or two comments and then we'll turn it over to Fiona. So, are there breakout rooms set up? Not yet. Not yet. It's a different size. So, I was re-computing the rooms. Okay. All right. So, maybe bring them back a little bit before a quarter to the hour because then we can have time for one or two comments when they come back. Are the prompts clear, everybody? Thumbs up or thumbs down? Yep. Good. I'm seeing thumbs up. Good. Welcome back. Hello. Hi, Steven. And Stuart. And Joe. Here you come. And Frida's back. I thought you left Frida. Yeah. Good. Okay. I think everybody is pretty much back. And if, when you do come back, if you can turn your cameras on so that we know, that I know that you're here. So, we just really have just about two minutes or so. And I'd like to be able to give Fiona time to, she's going to share a few thoughts and words with you. But I'd like to hear from anybody who wants to share about one of those prompts or anything else that might have come up for you in the little talk that I just gave. And I know that there's people burning with the desire to say something. So please don't be shy. We're with friends here. What a quiet group this morning. Oh, I'm always burning to talk so I'm going to jump in. Yeah, we just have. It's funny because that amount of time to discuss the topic. I mean it's just makes us chuckle. But we did it. And there is so much wisdom in, in the group I think it's just such it's very nourishing I mean the whole gathering is nourishing but when we sit and look at a question together I'm just astonished at how much I learned. So, that's my brief summary but much gratitude. That's your brief summary. Well your brief summary is certainly worth sharing. I appreciate that. Yeah, in these moments, you know, sometimes we think we need a long time to reflect on something. And, and that's luxurious and wonderful, and sometimes, in just a short few minutes we can tap into things in, in a completely authentic in, and sometimes even in a profound way so even a short, a short period of time I'm sorry that the breakout room was as brief as it was but we're, we're limited by time. So, thank you for your comments, and I wish you all the very best, and I am happy now to pass the baton to my beloved friend and dear colleague Fiona. Let's just take a minute. So, zoomed back in and out of groups just just be quiet for a few minutes. Settle in the body, right here. So earlier, I had shared, you know, my experience with daily practice over the last four years now after many years of practice, but not daily practice was really encouraged in the last few years to do this, you know, practices really such deep appreciation. And it's been supported by this app on the phone that my son gave me called insight timer. Well, one of the side gifts of this little technological gizmo is often some inspiring quotes come through. And this morning I read one that fit so smoothly with this talk that David shared earlier. The teaching and the concept of looking at awareness and awareness, putting the two words of awareness and love together. And I would like to share this as a teacher, not specifically in the Buddhist tradition and I shared something first couple months ago I believe her name is Joan Tollefson. Meditation we discover is the very nature and the natural activity of awareness. Having made this discovery, we may still enjoy sitting quietly doing nothing formally or informally. I certainly do. But we also recognize that we can never truly leave meditation. Our whole life now is meditation. Emotions, thoughts, states of mind, bodily sensations all come and go. But awareness remains as the immovable space, the light in which it all arises and passes away. This light is really all there is. And reading this right now, that image of the light, which with Robert's poem by Hafeez. I wanted to share a little story that this just happened a week ago. I was watching my mind, I was traveling up several miles to a, I shared this that small group, a shredding event at a facility in a city. I had to go quite a drive. And I had never been to the spot before and I looked on the map and the facility was at juvenile Hall in San Mateo County. Well I had never been there. Well I can do this. And I drove up to this, you know, very imposing building. And there was this contraction. There was contraction about, can I find the place, then, oh, this place. A sense of intimidation and alienation from this very imposing building. And then the long line, a way through to shred and feeling a sense of relief. And I was like, oh, I get to shred this and it was taken care of. But also, what I was shredding was my, all the documents from my parents' trust and all that that I took care of a decade ago. Somehow, letting that go. So there was this connection with family. And I had a sense of slight contraction over where I was, where this place was. And as I was waiting in this long line across the parking lot, I saw these signs like you see at parks, you know, that describe, you know, what you're looking at or whatever. And I thought, well, this is interesting in this parking lot to juvenile Hall. And as I was driving out, I thought, I'll take a minute. I just want to walk over and see. What I wanted to acknowledge was that my awareness was open enough between the emotion of letting go of this family event, my parents passing and their trust, and my, my contraction around where I was. I walked over to the sign and I saw was called the Phoenix Garden, and I was reading. This was a garden started years ago on the place where the old juvenile Hall was apparently a structure of concrete and wire, and it had been taken down this new edifice was built. And what they wanted people there this vision to create life where there had been great suffering and great difficulty. I was so inspired. And I walked over. There was another sign. And it said it was the stones of love. And I looked down I took a picture not very good. All the people who worked on this garden who lost loved ones during the pandemic, or whatever, had written their names on stone, a little stones and made this big heart of remembrance in love. And I looked over, there's juvenile Hall. And here's this place. You know, nurturing life, nurturing what's beautiful. The volunteer director came over and said, Oh, please visit the labyrinth. We've, we've made a labyrinth for mindfulness to walk in the lavender out in the sky. And I, why I struck me is that I was so thankful that my awareness was big enough to see something and open up and see it, it held everything, the shredding juvenile Hall, and this beautiful intention to nurture life and healing and love. And David was saying earlier, you know, awareness holds everything. It's whether we're open. Or whether I'm open, it can relax and open up to what is here, not just where I'm holding on or pushing away. And I think in this time of life, you know, there's things that are beautiful in our experience, things that are challenging. Just be able to open up and hold it all and not have to say, Oh, this is my joy, or this is my pain. This is just joy. This is pain. It's here. And I can hold it. And I, I really deeply want to share my appreciation for your all being here for this beautiful teachings from David and Robert and you're sharing with an open heart. This time we can maybe really cultivate a relaxation of our hearts and minds to open up to this life, this day. So, thank you all. So David, if you'd like to share some merit. So by the power of this compassionate practice, the sun shining, shining on the earth without any obstacle, any hindrance, not expecting anything back, just shining by the power of this compassionate practice, this loving awareness. May all suffering be transformed into peace. You're suffering. All suffering. In the hearts of all beings be open. And their wisdom. Radiate from within. Compassion. The radiation of awareness. Thank you all. It's been just wonderful to see you all and be with you all and really appreciate, really appreciate your presence. Thank you. Everyone. So nice to see you and be with you. Next month. Thank you. Goodbye. Be nice to everyone. Be nice. Okay. Thank you.
