The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
It's a pleasure to be here with you. My name is Mae Elliott and I will be
leading these 7 a.m. sittings each day. So over the next five days I'll be going
over the foundational vipassana meditation instructions as they're
typically taught in the West. So we'll start with breath today, talk about
mindfulness of breathing, then we'll talk about tomorrow, the body, Wednesday,
emotions, Thursday we'll talk about thinking, and then Friday open awareness
practice. So I'll say more about this series once we finish the meditation, once
we're in the dharmet, and I give you some context for this. As I mentioned, the
focus of today's meditation will be the breath, and that's going to be our
primary anchor for the meditation. So for some people, the breath doesn't work
very well as their primary anchor, and if you're one of those people that's
totally fine, some people prefer a sense of the bodily posture, like a global
sense of the body. Some people take the sense of sound, hearing for their anchor,
that's all fine, and just for the sake of simplifying the instructions, I'll be
offering directions specifically on the breath as a primary anchor. So that's
what I'll be I'll be talking most about and do what works for you. So let's start
our meditation with a stable upright posture. We can gently close the eyes, have
your hands on your lap or your knees, it's fine to be sitting, standing, or lying
down, whatever posture works best for your meditation. So as we start, let's take
three deep breaths together, inhaling, and exhaling, inhaling, and exhaling, and
again. Now allowing the breath to take up a normal rhythm in this practice, we're
not tampering with the breath or trying to change it in any way, just being with
it as it is, and allow it to happen naturally.
And as we settle into the body, it can help to have some uprightness in the
posture. If you're sitting to have a straight spine, we can think of lengthening
the spine as though we're putting just a little bit of extra space between each
vertebrae, making the neck a little bit longer. And then from that upright stable
posture, allowing everything else to relax, allowing the skin, flesh, the muscles
to drape on the scaffolding of the bones,
softening the forehead and the temples, relaxing the jaw,
softening the shoulders, releasing the belly,
loosening the hips,
and allowing any extra tension to flow out through the legs and the feet,
and arriving here,
As we start this sitting together, I invite you to connect with the breath where you
feel it most predominantly. For some people, the sensations clearest at the nostrils.
For some, it's in the rise and fall of the chest. And for others, it's in the expansion of the belly.
So go ahead and take a moment and connect with where you feel the breath most predominantly.
You can go ahead and allow the mind to settle on that sensation, allowing that area where
you feel the breath most predominantly to be your primary anchor. So you are collecting
the mind around that sensation, into that sensation. When you find that the mind has
wandered, gently and kindly slide right back to the breath, right back to this predominant sensation.
So no problem if the mind thinks, you just don't follow its content. We don't actually engage in
the narrative it's telling us. We just come right back to the breath. No need to judge ourselves
for thinking or reject the thinking. We're just releasing it with a really light touch.
Thoughts fall to the background and the breath is in the foreground. As soon as you notice that
you've been thinking, you're actually back in the present. So there's no need for reprimand.
Already back here. Breathing in and breathing out.
Releasing any preoccupations to come into the
breath. Entering the breath and not just the idea of the breath, but the felt experience of the breath.
Feeling it through the language of sensation. And I'll offer some ways to be curious about the
breath to get to know it. Kind of like we are welcoming an old friend that we haven't seen
for a long time. Sitting down with great curiosity to get to know them, to get to know who they are
now. So can we get to know the breath with that curiosity and friendliness? Can we sense
whether the breath is textured? What's the texture of the breath? Is it smooth or silky?
Is it staccato or rough? Sensing the texture of the breath.
What's the shape of the breath?
What's the shape of the breath? Does it billow widely with a big inhale? Or is it thin and narrow?
What's the shape of the breath?
Maybe the breath starts thin and narrow and then it widens as the chest expands.
What's the temperature of the breath?
Is it warm or cool?
Does the temperature change when shifting from an inhale to an exhale?
Maybe the inhale is cool and the exhale is warm.
And how do you know it's warm or cool? What's the sensation telling you that?
Maybe getting to know temperature with a little more interest.
Maybe getting to know the breath.
Paying attention now to the length of the breath.
Breath short or long.
Maybe the inhale longer than the exhale or the other way around.
Breath short or long.
Breath short or long.
Are you feeling the breath most predominantly in the right lung or the left lung?
Or do you both feel evenly?
As we explore the breath, remember that we're not tampering with it in any way.
We're not trying to make it deeper or longer or smoother or warmer or cooler.
Just noticing what's happening.
No need to make the present moment any different than it is.
Many of us tend to notice the breath in the front of our body, maybe in the rise and fall of the chest or the belly.
We can do the sensations on our face by our nose.
We can also tune into the way the breath affects our back body.
We can see the rise and fall of the breath in the back.
Can the breath be sensed in the rise and fall of the shoulders?
Maybe there's a subtle lift and release as you breathe.
Can you notice the moment an in-breath starts?
Staying connected to the breath from the moment it starts through the length of the inhale.
Can you notice the top of the inhale when the breath is finished bringing air in?
Can you feel the complete release of the exhale?
Again, the moment the inhale starts.
This can be a great way to stay with the breath, ensuring we notice the breath starts, the inhale starts, and the point that the inhale turns to an exhale, the complete exhale, the end of the exhale.
Ensuring we notice these transition moments shifting from inhale to exhale again.
Often the mind wanders in the pause between breaths.
Can we catch those moments, those transition moments, then bring our curiosity to the breath in between and on your own now, not allow yourself to see what your mind is interested in with the breath.
Maybe noticing the texture, maybe the shape or the temperature, maybe the length.
Continuing with the breath in whatever way works for you.
You may find it helpful to make a mental note, very light mental label, when breathing in, you might note in.
When reading out, out, or you might try rising, falling as your notes.
The note can help us keep connected, help us stay connected to the present, gives the mind something to do, naming the experience as it happens.
If you do note the breath, make sure that the note is light.
The majority of the attention is in the body sensing, and the note is very light and faint.
The note is very light and faint.
The note is very light and faint.
The note is very light and faint.
The note is very light and faint.
The note is very light and faint.
The note is very light and faint.
As we come to the end of our sitting together, taking a moment to feel the goodness of this practice.
Some gratitude for having this time to take care of the heart and the mind.
May all beings be happy, healthy, safe and free from suffering.
Thank you.
