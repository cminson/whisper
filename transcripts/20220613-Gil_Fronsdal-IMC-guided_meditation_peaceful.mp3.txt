 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Good morning, my friends, and happy to be here with you again. And I've been on retreat for the last week and I'm surprised to find myself sitting here with that feeling that there are many words for the moment. So, but feeling peaceful, feeling content, happy. So we can begin. And to, then I'll say something, once we're settled a little bit, I'll offer orientation, a question for the practice. So, to allow yourself to become quiet. To let your body become quiet. Or if quiet is not possible, let your body become quieter than it is. The quieting of the body. And a quieting of your eyes. Maybe if your eyes are open, let them gaze down. Or whatever direction the eyes are most relaxed. Soft eyes. And to maybe gently close your eyes. And to gently quiet your mind. Or quieting. Maybe a reminder that now not much is needed. But to sit here quietly, peacefully. And if the breath breathing is a refuge for you, become aware of your breathing. Aware of the movements in your body as you breathe. Then quietly, slowly, comfortably take a deeper breath. Not too deep, just so it's nice. Take a few deep breaths. And as you exhale, a settling in your body. A releasing into your body. Releasing into your body. And letting your breathing return to normal. And a quiet, gentle scanning of your body. To find the places of holding and tension. That as you exhale, you can soften and quiet. As you exhale, maybe quieting the thinking mind. Maybe first by letting your thinking become slower. A bit more relaxed. And gently, if you're going to be thinking, think about your breathing, your body. Think about the here and now, your direct experience. Think about the here and now, your direct experience. Think about it in very simple manner. Just thoughts of recognition. This is an in-breath. This is an itch. This is a sound. This is a sound. This is a sound. This is a sound. And might there be some even small hints of being peaceful. A peacefulness that is underneath or outside of whatever agitation there might be. A peace which is not opposed to anything. A peace which you can hold everything. A peace which you can hold everything. A peace which you can hold everything. A peace which you can hold everything. And then as we continue this meditation, you might ask yourself the following question. Maybe ask yourself this question three or four times in the time we have here. What is happening right now that if you recognize, you can be more peaceful about? What needs to be recognized here and now so that you could be more peaceful about it? Maybe more accepting of it. Maybe more accepting of yourself as you are. What needs to be recognized so it can be held in the context of peace, non-conflict? What needs to be recognized so it can be held in the context of peace, non-conflict? What needs to be recognized so it can be held in the context of peace, non-conflict? What needs to be recognized so it can be held in the context of peace, non-conflict? What needs to be recognized so it can be held in the context of peace, non-conflict?

What needs to be recognized so it can be held in the context of peace, non-conflict? What needs to be recognized so it can be held in the context of peace, non-conflict? What needs to be recognized so it can be held in the context of peace, non-conflict? For sitting here, meditating. For sitting here, meditating. What needs to be accepted? So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So some degree of peace provides the atmosphere for whatever is happening. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. So you can sit more calmly, peacefully. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, tapping into whatever calm or peace there might be here, might be around any agitation there is. And see if in your mind's eye you can gaze upon the world peacefully, kindly. Gaze upon the world with a vision, with a high sight that can see the world peacefully, calmly. There are places in the world where there is peace, there is calmness. Gazing upon the world kindly. Love everyone. What might you learn from meditation practice in holding everything peacefully that might help you to love everyone? Or to love a vast expanse of human beings, looking upon them kindly? May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be happy. May all beings live in peaceful circumstances. May all beings have a peaceful heart. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free. May all beings be peaceful.
