So before I give the talk, before I forget, I want to mention that tomorrow, Friday, after our morning meditation and teaching at 7. 
45 California time, we can have a community meeting. 
Those would like to stay and we'll do it on Zoom like we have in the past. 
Though I usually leave the YouTube on in case there's people who don't want to go on YouTube on Zoom and they can participate a little bit just listening. 
And so if you'd like to be part of that, I'll post later today the link for the Zoom meeting and it'll be on the What's New section of IMC's website and also IMC's calendar and I'll also put it on the chat tomorrow as well. 
And there'll be a password needed to get into the site and the password will be metta, M-E-T-T-A, the Polly word for kindness. 
And we'll maybe do it for 45 minutes or so and maybe we'll do a breakout group so that you can meet each other a little bit, talk, and I'll be available for questions and things like that. 
So finding our way in this challenging world, finding our way with the personal challenges we have and with our minds and all that. 
And one of the things we're navigating and working against, working with, is the navigating the terrain of happiness and suffering. 
And in Buddhists talk a lot about suffering, it's a big word for some people. 
Some people who come new to Buddhism are a little disturbed by how often we talk about suffering because suffering just seems like such a monumental thing. 
But we use the term in a wide way. 
But one of the ways I'd like to use it today, happiness and suffering, is something that's deeper than contentment, deeper than gladness, deeper than joy. 
But that happiness is something that's deeply personal. 
And that the opposite of that, suffering, is also something deeply personal. 
That some of the greatest suffering that people experience is when they've been a real personal violation, whether it's a physical violation against your body or whether it's been a violation against some deep sense of trust or deep violation about who you are as a person or in a relationship to others. 
I remember many years ago that a friend of mine had her car broken into and she felt like it was such a deep violation somehow that car represented so much more than just a car. 
And so our sense of safety and place in this world, our sense of belonging, and it is a very personal issue. 
And to have this sense of belonging, have sense of connection to the world, or our sense of meaning, personal meaning and purpose, have a sense of, even our sense of worth, our personal value, somehow dismissed or destroyed or threatened can cause a lot of suffering. 
It isn't just a simple suffering that I have a flat tire and I came late to an important meeting. 
It's something that's deeply personal and with that it's, you know, we can stay, can have deep conditioning factors within us. 
On the corollary, there's the same for happiness. 
It's not this happiness that, oh, now I fixed the car, the tire, and that's great. 
I'm not stuck here anymore and I think I'll get to the meeting on time. 
That's nice and certainly can be happy around that. 
But by the time you get to the meeting, you've forgotten about the tire and what happened there. 
But the happiness, the real sukkha, the Pali word, the real happiness of the dharma is something very personal that touches something very deep within us, a fullness and is overlapsed with a deep feeling of sense of belonging or meaning or purpose, overlaps with a sense of worth and value that is full, the sense of personal confidence. 
And so there's a fullness, there's a depth to it. 
Some people might take exceptions to my use, my repeated use of the word personal today. 
I do it a little bit to be, to, because it's something that Buddhists don't tend to use, to really kind of challenge you to look deep or into yourself into a fullness. 
And of course there's a little common teaching in Buddhism not to take things personally. 
And I understand this to mean it's the taking. 
It's the appropriation of things and saying this is who I am. 
The act of defining ourselves by something, the act of proving ourselves or building up the self, building up this edifice of ego that we have, which keeps us in some way superficial. 
The happiness of, of, of Sukha, this happiness of the Dharma is something that's full or deeper than anything that you could take personally or assume to be or define yourself by. 
It's not about definitions. 
It's more like being so comfortable with yourselves that you, well, you don't need to be defined by anything. 
You don't need to prove yourself towards anyone. 
You have nothing to fear because it's so deep. 
The personal is so deep. 
It's kind of like we tap into that some depth inside of peace, of well-being, of personal, personalness that can't be touched, can't be hurt. 
No matter what other people do to us, maybe this is a place that is a reservoir of well-being. 
So it's very personal. 
Now in terms of, so part of the theme of today this week is the pendulum that there is a kind of happiness and suffering that live in relationship to each other and set up one and it almost, it's almost like a preparing the ground for the other to come back and forth. 
And that's when we take things personally in a superficial way. 
We take things personally by some appropriated identity or definition that is not really who we are. 
So for example, if I define myself by being a YouTube producer, producing shows for YouTube or whatever, and then the technology works well for a few months like it has lately, I could feel really happy about myself. 
But when somehow I forget to push the right buttons, then the happiness that comes from the praise I get from others and the delight others have with my great capacity on YouTube plummets. 
And then I feel miserable because I forgot to push the right buttons. 
And so then I feel unhappy and I suffer. 
And so that pendulum, that happiness and suffering is dependent on these kind of superficial things and fragile things is really because reality is always changing, it sets up for crashing and building yourself up again. 
So finding a way with the superficial will keep us superficial. 
The Dharma practice is to connect something deep, something that's not defined by these superficial things or it's not influenced or affected by what happens. 
It's not affected by what other people think about us, believe it or not. 
It's not affected by whether we're successful or failure in the things that we do. 
We do things sincerely, honestly, and some succeed and some fail. 
But the depth of our being, where we really reside and live inside, where we're comfortable with ourselves, that is not, you know, touched, that stays intact. 
And so to not know the depth of and be comfortable and resolved and healed in the depth of us can leave that depth in a place that there's a lot of suffering. 
But if we heal it and work with it and relax and open and deeply in it, in this deep personal place where we can find peace and home and trust and refuge, it's not exactly a pendulum anymore, it's abides by itself. 
And if it falls away, it doesn't necessarily go into despair or deep suffering. 
But deep suffering is there if we take things personally. 
Deep suffering is not there if we are personal, if we abide and rest in that which is deep and full and complete inside of ourselves. 
And so in Buddhism we're quite fond of talking about not-self. 
And one way to bring these two things together I'm talking about today and not-self is that when we are so personal, so at home, so resting what's most personal, most intimate, most full that flows from within us, it's so full, it's so complete, it's so that there's no tendency or desire to define a self out of it, to find a self in it, to want a self in it, to hold on to a self there. 
The kind of idea of me, myself, and mine, those kinds of concerns just fall away. 
Just as maybe someone who's involved in wonderful play or wonderful sport or wonderful playing of music, they can get lost in what they're doing. 
We say lost, completely absorbed in what they're doing. 
And I just feel so complete and good to be there. 
And there doesn't occur to them while they're doing the activity, the usual thoughts about myself and me, myself and mine. 
So the same way we meditate or in the Dharma, this deep personal place where we can find comfort, belonging, healing, happiness, well-being, if we really can learn to be there and trust it and allow ourselves to get quiet enough to really be absorbed in it, there's no movement in the mind, no tendency of the mind for me, myself, and mine. 
From the point of view of the surface where we think a lot about me, myself, and mine, and we live in that world of me, myself, and mine, that they might, when I say these things, might immediately come, but I am me and there are things that are mine. 
So from the logic of that more superficial world, yes. 
And maybe what I'm saying doesn't make sense. 
But that superficial world, that's the world where the pendulum of suffering and happiness live in relationship to each other. 
And we kind of get trapped in the pendulum. 
You can swing back and forth maybe and it never ends. 
But the depth of who we are, the depth of well-being, the peace of the dharma that's within us, the dharma. 
And so when you become yourself fully in this personal way, then it said, then the dharma becomes itself. 
When you are yourself, the dharma is the dharma. 
You are the dharma, then. 
So thank you and look forward to coming back tomorrow and having our meeting in 24 hours. 
So thank you.
