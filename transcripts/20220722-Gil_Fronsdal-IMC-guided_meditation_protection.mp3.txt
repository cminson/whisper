 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Welcome. And at the moment my wish in welcoming you is certainly welcome you to this meditation and it ascends to IMC online. But I would like really to welcome you to yourself, that when we sit down to meditate, ideally we welcome ourselves. We offer a welcome to however we are at the moment. Sometimes we're a stranger to ourselves, sometimes we know ourselves all too well, sometimes we come in all kinds of moods. It's like a stranger or a neighbor who you never know to come knocking on your door and they have a need and you welcome them in. And so are you. Meditation is a time to welcome yourself in. And when we meditate, there is a healthy or an unhealthy fear. There is helpful and unhelpful fear. There's fear that pulls us away from the present moment. There's fear that in which we freeze or get lost. There's fear which keeps us apart from our experience of the moment. There's also the fear that keeps us in the present. There's a fear that keeps us close to a sense of peace, non-conflict, ease or calm. And that is the fear of losing that. The fear of losing our balance, losing our peace, losing our well-being. Because that's a worthwhile fear to have because two ways. When we lose our well-being, our balance, then we're much more likely to create more problems for ourselves, more stress. When we protect our peace, if there's some fear like that, like don't lose that, it's dangerous to lose this peace, dangerous to lose myself, dangerous to lose my welcome to myself and really be present here. That fear might encourage us to let go of the other fears that take us away. That fear leads us, maybe motivates us to protect our mindfulness, our presence, our being here. And in doing that, the secondary is protecting our practice, protecting our inner well-being. If there's fear connected to that, a protective fear, that hopefully won't be stressful because it's pointing you back to that place of the absence of stress. It's the protection, it's the safeguard, it's the fear that points us back where there is no fear because we know it's dangerous to lose it. So here we are, welcome. And to gently close your eyes. And what do you welcome? What is happening with you right now? That you can open your door and welcome in. This is what's happening. And you are the welcomeer. If you're distressed, you're not the distress. You welcome the distress. If you're calm, you are not the calm. You welcome it. Whatever there is, welcome it here in this body, this mind. Feeling and sensing how you are. And then within this body, allowing yourself to take a few deeper breaths. As you inhale, feel a fuller, maybe stronger connection to what is here for you, how you are, what you're feeling. In a longer exhale than usual, let go, relax, soften the body. Here, inhale is almost like a welcome. Here, let me feel you. Let me recognize what's happening. And exhaling, settling in, relaxing into the middle of it. Letting your breathing become normal. And still on the exhale, soften, relax wherever you can in your body, even if it's micro muscles. Let there be a gentle movement of relaxation throughout the body. Sometimes in particular spots, sometimes the whole body. Almost as if you're relaxing into how you are. Relaxing into what you welcome here now. And then continue as you exhale to relax a bit. But let the welcomeer relax. That part of you that knows, that feels, that recognizes what's happening. Let that relax so that your awareness, your mindfulness has no fear in it. No hesitation. Relax the witnesser, the welcomeer, the awareness of it all. Relax. And then sitting here so far, is there something about how you are? Some inner sense of balance or calm or peace? Inner sense of openness and welcoming, something that's appropriate to protect. It's appropriate, there's a healthy concern, maybe fear, of drifting away from being connected to yourself, being present here. There's a danger in drifting away from whatever degree of calm or presence, here there is. Maybe there's a way of being motivated by that fear, that concern, to love and stay close to. That place within where there's a sense of well-being, or the place within where there could be a sense of well-being. Stay close. Stay close to the place that's safe inside. Stay close to the place that's safe inside. And through these minutes of meditation, have you come to a time, a place where you have a clear sense that there's something here to protect, to nourish, to support, to safeguard you, some sense of well-being or clarity or calm. And maybe there's a healthy concern, fear, that motivates you to stay close to that well-being, not to lose it. And as we come to the end of the sitting, perhaps you can consider whether there's a healthy fear that is the fear of losing our respect and love and care for others, even losing it temporarily or having it be eclipsed by other feelings. The fear of losing a kind regard of others. And maybe this is worth protecting. Maybe there's never an occasion to be mean or hostile or unfriendly. And so to fear going in those directions and that fear to be motivating, to stay close to your kindness, your friendliness, where maybe it's meaningful for you to wish well on others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
