Greetings, everyone. Greetings, friends. All right, let's try this. Greetings, Nikki Murgafore, and I joined this virtual space from Mountain View, California, on Seated O'Lonely Land, and... There. Okay. Sorry about that. I also have an iPad going, and it was not silenced. Yay! There we go. Technical problems. So, hello again. Hello again. As I was saying, I'm happy to be supporting the Sangha sitting together this week as Gil travels, and hope you are well. Hope you are well, and this week, I'm delighted. I'm looking forward to sharing teachings on one of the path factors. And the path factor, that's very important, and we engage with every day, even if we don't get the chance to formally sit and meditate, but we always engage with speech, so, why speech or right speech. I'll say much more about it in the Dharamat, but that is the theme for this week, and a very important theme. So, let's just begin. Let's just begin and meditate together. Ahh! Arriving. Arriving and landing. Landing in our bodies. In this moment in time. Arriving together. And letting go. Letting go of whatever has come before. Maybe dreams or getting ready for sitting or period of different time zones, whatever has happened. Letting go also of the future of the plans for the day. You can pick them up later. Tell them you will pick them up later. Thank you. But not now. Giving our hearts fully, completely. This practice in this moment. Noticing if there is tension anywhere in the body. And if there is, kindly, gently, caressingly. Let it be released. Softened. Relaxed. Really taking the time to befriend this body in this moment in time. And inviting. Inviting these areas to release, to relax. Really taking time. Not rushing to the next thing, but really taking our time. Lovingly. Lovingly with the body. Thank you. Letting the breath be received. And the abdomen and the whole body, all the areas where there might be tightness or holding. Let the breath be life giving, relaxing, soothing. Thank you. And if there's any internal noting or conversation or speech really in general, notice the tone Notice the quality of it. Is it kind? Is it gentle or harsh? Is internal speech? Let there be kindness towards yourself. Let there be kindness towards yourself. Let there be kindness towards yourself. Let there be kindness towards yourself. Let there be kindness towards yourself. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Notice what qualities present in the mind and heart. Calm, restless, bored, happy, sad. How does it show up in the body? And we make space for everything, whatever is present. Relax, release, make space for everything to arise, stay for a while, pass. It's all okay, all okay. Such is the nature of being human in this moment, including it all, a full catastrophe. With heart, with expansiveness, patience and wisdom. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And as we approach the end of the sitting, Noticing what's present. And celebrating any more goodness that's present. Gratitude, calm, spaciousness. Kindness, wisdom, the beautiful qualities of the heart. If there are challenges, challenging emotions, present, the mind and the heart, it's okay bringing some kindness to them. Bringing some kindness to them. And letting go of any judgment or expectation for what this period should have been, must have been, didn't happen. Let all that go, not necessary. You showed up. Yay. That's all that matters. Appreciating yourself and the whole Sangha. Further support. And together offering our goodness to all beings everywhere. May all beings everywhere. Be safe, happy, healthy and happy. May all beings, including ourselves, be free. Thanks everyone for your practice.
