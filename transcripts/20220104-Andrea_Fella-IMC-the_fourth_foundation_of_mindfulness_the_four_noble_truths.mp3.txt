So we've been exploring the Four Noble Truths. I mean I'm sorry the Four
the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, the Fourth Foundation of Mindful, the
Four Foundations of Mindfulness in the Eightfold Path, Wise Mindfulness. So this
this conversation has been going on for a long time. And over the last few weeks
we've been exploring a particular set in the in the Fourth Foundation, the
exploration of the Seven Factors of Awakening. And last week I feel like we
kind of came to the end of that one. So we're moving on now to the next list in
the Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness, the Four Noble Truths, the exploration of the
Four Noble Truths in present moment experience. But again just a little bit
of context of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Satipatanasuta, and the
Fourth, the Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness. So the Four Foundations of
Mindfulness, the teachings of the Satipatanasuta is really the kind of
key meditation instructions in the suttas about how to be mindful of our
present moment experience. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are the body
and that's the first the first foundation. And I think it's there's an
encouragement in a way to begin with what's most obvious in our experience.
Body's experience, body sensation, you know what's happening in our physical
being is one of the easiest places to begin to connect with our present
moment experience. And so that's that's a foundation for mindfulness in the
present moment. We establish our attention on that that side of our experience, that
aspect of our experience. The second foundation, the foundation of feeling
tone of whether experience is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, begins to move
into a subtler realm of experience. It begins to to move into mental experience
actually. You know sometimes we might think about feeling whether something's
pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral as being connected to as being physical at
times when we have something happen in our body. We cut ourselves with the
knife or we fall down and bruise our knee. The unpleasantness there may feel
physical. But the understanding in the Buddhist psychology is that is a mental
phenomenon. Whether something is experienced as pleasant or unpleasant is mental.
It's created by the mind. And actually I understand that modern-day neuroscience
agrees with this. That our what is pleasant and unpleasant experience is
constructed in a very rudimentary place in our brains. So the the notion of
pleasant, unpleasant is beginning to touch into the recognition of a mental
aspect of experience. But often an area that may be easier to connect to in a
way especially in the realm of physical experience. And so you know we start with
the body, the first foundation, the body experience. And then we may begin to be
able to touch into the feeling tone whether a bodily experience is pleasant
unpleasant or neutral. And then we might also begin to recognize that our mental
experience, our thoughts, our moods, our ideas also have that feeling tone. So
happiness feels pleasant and anger unpleasant. And so we may we may begin to
taste that in our experience. And then the Buddha encourages us, the teachings
encourages us to move to beyond just pleasant and unpleasant to notice some
particular qualities in the mind. In particular, the presence and absence of
greed, aversion, and delusion. This is the third foundation looking at qualities
of mind. The presence and absence of greed, aversion, and delusion. And the
presence and absence of a deepening of our ability to be stable in the present
moment. To kind of the recognition of the stability of the mind. The exploration
of awareness of being concentrated or not concentrated. So these three first
foundations, these first three foundations I kind of understand as being an
encouragement to get familiar in the present moment with the whole like of
all of our human experience. Learn how to stabilize mindfulness with whatever is
arising in the present moment. We can also understand these as these
instructions, the first foundation of body, the second of feeling, the third of
looking at these qualities in the mind as being exercises to direct the attention
to. We can look at the Satipatanasuta in that way. And we can also look at it as
being whatever is arising in this present moment, whatever is like most
obvious. That can be found, like if the most obvious thing is a pressure in
the body, then that is the first foundation. We're noticing
the physicality of that pressure, the elemental nature of that experience. What
might be most obvious is a happiness, the absence of greed, the absence of a
version, kind of a delight in mind. That's in the third foundation, noticing
that quality of mind. And so we don't necessarily have to think about choosing a
particular foundation. We can just open, as I was describing in the guided
meditation, just open to what's most obvious and be aware of it as an
experience in the present moment, the body, a feeling, a mental experience. So
really, these three foundations encourages us to establish or study
our minds with whatever's happening in the present moment. The fourth
foundation of mindfulness is an encouragement in a way, I think, to
look at our experience from the perspectives of the Buddha's teachings
of Dharma. Because there are five lists in the fourth foundation, all Dharma
lists that are an encouragement to look at our experience from the perspective
of the hindrances, the five aggregates, the six sense bases, the seven factors of
awakening, and the four noble truths. And so the the instructions in the Satyapatana
Sutta say something like one understands experience as the experience or
phenomena, the Holly term for this fourth foundation, Dhamma Nupasana. The word
Dhamma having multiple meanings in the Suttas, one of the meanings is the
Buddha's teaching. Another meaning is simply phenomena, just experience. And so
the the fourth foundation, mindfulness of Dhamma can be understood from these two
perspectives, you know, just the arising of phenomenon. And in the framework or
through the framework of these Dharma lists. And so each one says, you know, how
does one understand phenomena as phenomena in terms of the hindrances? How
does one understand phenomena as phenomena in terms of the seven factors
of awakening? And the, you know, in any moment of experience, the the the
instructions in each of those, just those two lists, let's just look at those two
lists in the moment, in this moment. In the instructions, the encouragement is to
notice the presence or absence of the hindrances. So is anxiety arising or is
it not arising? In any moment of experience, one of those will be true. And so
we can we can orient our kind of like the looking at experience, whatever's
arising in the present moment, we can understand whether there is restlessness
arising or not arising. Salath and Torpa arising or not arising, ill will
arising or not arising, doubt arising or not arising. And so this is this is
looking at experience from that perspective or from through that
framework, seeing experience in terms of the hindrances. With the seven seven
factors of awakening, it kind of gets flipped around that we are kind of
oriented towards seeing some of the wholesome qualities, noticing the
arising of the the presence or absence of mindfulness itself, of energy, of
rapture, of tranquility, of concentration, of equanimity. Are they present or absent?
And again, in any moment of experience, one of these two will be true. Either
there will be the presence of equanimity or there won't be the presence of
equanimity. And so whatever's happening in experience, we can see experience in
the moment in terms of the seven factors of awakening. So that's that's kind of
the the way, a way, let's say, of understanding what this fourth foundation
is, is to begin to understand experience through these Dharma perspectives. So
the last Dharma perspective offered in the in the fourth foundation is the
Four Noble Truths. So the teaching for this one, again, it's how does one
understand phenomena in terms of the Four Noble Truths? And the instructions go
something like this, one understands as it actually is, this is suffering, this is
dukkha, one understands as it actually is, this is the arising of dukkha, or this
is the origin of dukkha. One understands as it actually is, this is the ending of
dukkha, and one understands as it actually is, this is the way or the path
leading to the ending of dukkha. So I'm sure you recognize those as related to
the Four Noble Truths, the Four Noble Truths sometimes stated as the truth
of suffering, the truth of the cause, of the the origin of suffering, the truth of
the ending of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the ending of
suffering. That is the way it's kind of framed in the first discourse, the
famous first discourse of the setting of the wheel of the Dharma in motion.
What is the truth of suffering? What is the truth of, so the Buddha
explores these questions in that. So the first noble truth, the truth of
suffering, the second noble truth, the truth of the arising or the origin of
suffering. That framing of the Four Noble Truths makes it sound like something
just to understand. You know, it's like it makes it almost sound like, okay, so I
need to study this, I need to understand what the truth of suffering is, and that
is a place to begin our exploration of the Four Noble Truths. We do need to
understand the concepts that the Buddha taught, what he meant by suffering even,
what he meant by the arising of suffering and the ending of suffering, and
what he meant by the path leading to the ending of suffering. We do need to
understand that. And this, the series that we've been doing, you know, the series
that we've been exploring on this Tuesday morning for a very long time has
been exploring that very question. What are these Four Noble Truths? And in this
last, you know, many weeks we've been exploring what is the Eightfold
Path, and right now looking at what is the right mindfulness aspect of the
Eightfold Path, that's where we are in this exploration of
understanding these Four Noble Truths from a conceptual level. In this teaching, in
the Satipatanasuta, the instruction is to understand as it actually is, this is
suffering, this is dukkha. This is an encouragement to recognize in present
moment experience, the experience of dukkha, the experience of the arising of
dukkha, the experience of the ending of dukkha, and the experience of the path
leading to the ending of dukkha. So what does that mean? So the language is
encouraging us to know in the present moment, it's not just understand it as
the concept, the language is definitely this, understands as it actually is,
yattabhuta is the word for as it actually is, as it has come to be, and this
is this is connected with the understanding in the present moment, the
arising of experience in the present moment, that word is really pointing to
the momentary experience of the present moment. So understanding in the present
moment these four aspects, and again as with the other frameworks in the Fourth
Foundation, any moment of experience, one of these four will be arising or will
be present. There will either be the experience of dukkha, it's arising, it's
ending, or there will be some aspect of the path being cultivated, being
practiced or cultivated. It can get even more subtle than that, I think, and I'll
touch on that in just a moment, in a way, well I'll just touch on that in a
moment. So this kind of seeing them in the moment understanding of this
perspective, this is dukkha, this is the arising of dukkha, this is the ending of
dukkha, this way of seeing over and over again in the suthas, this way of seeing
as pointed to as being freedom, as being the ending of suffering, and I think in a
way this may be why it's the last list in our Fourth Foundation of Mindfulness.
This is the whole direction that the Buddhist teachings point to is
understanding suffering, understanding the arising of suffering, understanding the
ending of suffering, not conceptually but experientially. This is seeing that freeze
the mind. There's multiple ways in which it's stated, it's interesting, it's not
always using this term dukkha in this framework. So the
framework, this is dukkha. I'm going to replace the word dukkha with X. I'm a
mathematician by training, so that comes naturally to me. So this is X, this is the
arising of X, this is the ending of X, this is the way leading to the ending of
X. There's a lot of different words the suthas put in in place of X,
including clinging, for instance, just one of the many that it puts in there. So
this is clinging, this is the arising of clinging, this is the ending of clinging,
this is the way leading to the ending of clinging. It also includes in there just
the simple kind of experience of a sight, a sound, like this is the arising of a
sense experience. It includes the the five aggregates. This is the arising of
feeling or perception. This is feeling or perception, this is the
arising of feeling or perception, this is the ending of feeling or perception,
this is the way leading to the ending of feeling or perception. So this kind of
seeing with any experience, this kind of seeing will free the mind.
So there are different definitions of the word dukkha in the teachings, different ways that
this word can be understood. And so I want to talk about two in particular. One is the way I
think we normally think about dukkha. We often, the word dukkha is translated as suffering.
And the way we think about suffering is like something that's really hard, you know,
experience that's painful, a lot of tension going on, stress. So that's one way that it's
understood. In this way, in this definition, suffering is present when craving is arising.
When greed, aversion, and delusion are arising, and they are present, the mind is in a state of
suffering. Now we may or may not notice that. I mean, I know from my own experience, especially in
my early days, the kind of shock that when I began to recognize that being angry was actually painful,
you know, that it was that it was that that kind of quality in the mind was
really painful to this, to this being in the moment, painful to this being.
So we don't always recognize the suffering of these states of greed, aversion, and delusion.
But the understanding in the Buddhist psychology is that when they are arising in the mind, the mind
is kind of trapped in a net. It is stuck. It's in a sticky ball of a mess. And so when that
is arising, that is, that is suffering. That is one way to understand dukkha. And so from that
perspective, the instruction of that of that definition of dukkha, the instruction in this
fourth foundation, understanding this is dukkha. That instruction encourages us to get to know
this is greed, this is aversion, this is delusion. This is the experience of anger. This is the
experience of confusion or frustration or doubt. This is the experience of reactivity in the mind.
This is the experience of dullness in the mind. So that when when that those kinds of when greed,
aversion, and delusion are present, we are encouraged to notice them and that that is the
that is the way this instruction could be understood with that definition of dukkha.
Just understanding greed, aversion, delusion present in the mind. The second instruction,
what this is the arising of greed, aversion, and delusion, that that can be understood
just as seeing it coming into being, you know, seeing the mind kind of heading there,
or it can be understood and kind of seeing what's the kind of seed or trigger for that
greed aversion or delusion. Both are useful. Just seeing because there's two ways, you know,
again, there's there's multiple ways these teachings can be understood. This phrase, the
phrase of the second noble truth, the origin or the arising, the word in Pali is samudaya.
So samudaya can be understood as simply an arising, just the arising of
an experience. So just, you know, a sound arises, it's like that's an arising.
Or we might understand it as being like what is like the thing or the thing that's kind of
in the flow of experience that's leading to that arising. So the origin of or the cause of
sometimes that word samudaya is translated in that way. And so for instance, we might recognize that
this aversion is arising independence on a belief in the mind, an idea, or something like that.
And so we see a connection, we see a causal relationship. So that might be again, how we
understand the second noble truth is seeing in the moment of how the mind is heading towards
something. The third, the ending of seeing the ending of might be might can just be
understanding or seeing the with the continuity of mindfulness, we might begin to see
aversion pass away or greed pass away or delusion pass away. We see that it ends, we might see that
happen. And that also very powerful experience directly in the present moment.
All three of these are very powerful to see, to understand in the present moment, oh, this is
dukkha. This is aversion. This is a happening in the present moment. Or to see or understand,
this is how that aversion arises. Very powerful. The mind can in seeing that just let it go.
And then see the ending of that aversion and feel the peace, the ease that comes with that ending
of that aversion. And we also, the fourth understanding, the fourth insight or recognition
is, you know, it might be that while we are noticing, for instance, or seeing,
aware of an aversion, we may begin to see that, you know, we're not seeing it's arising
necessarily, we're not seeing it's passing away, we understand that it's dukkha. And with that
understanding, we kind of have the sense, I'm on the path. This is the way. This is what will help.
This is, this will support the mind. My mind is going in many different directions right now.
I'm trying to decide which thread to pick up on. I think what I'll do, I'll stick with
my original plan of talking about the two definitions of dukkha. So that first definition
of dukkha is seeing or in the moment understanding the presence, absence of dukkha in terms of
the greed aversion and delusion, that definition of dukkha being the presence of greed aversion
and delusion. And what's the way leading to the ending of greed aversion and delusion?
That's being on the eightfold path, having the view that it's useful to look at our experience
in the present moment. The second way that dukkha is understood in the in the suttas
is much more generally than as some kind of stress or suffering, the English word that we use,
but it is as the understanding of unreliability, unsatisfactoriness.
So this understanding of the word dukkha
refers to every single thing that we experience.
Whether greed aversion and delusion are arising or not,
experience is unreliable because it is impermanent. There's nothing in our experience that lasts,
actually nothing that lasts for more than a split second.
And because of that, there is nothing that is reliable as a place to say,
yep, this is where I can be happy forever. There's nothing in our human arising experience
that is a place to land where we can say, yep, that's going to do it for me.
Our experience is not reliable in terms of being able to provide that lasting happiness.
Experience itself is not reliable.
From this perspective, the instructions in the sattipatanasuta, this is dukkha,
refers to any moment of experience. Understanding the unreliable nature of experience,
it's almost like as a corollary of understanding the impermanent nature of experience.
We really understand the impermanent nature of experience. We know it's unreliable.
All experience is unreliable. That is a way to understand the insight of that
instruction or a way to understand what that instruction is pointing to,
the kind of seeing that instruction is pointing to.
This is unreliable. That's a hard thing to both to grasp and to open to.
The vulnerability, the uncertainty that that kind of opens us to feels very unstable,
feels very unwelcome, let's say. It is that very unwelcomeness that creates the craving
that we want something to be reliable. The deep paradox that the Buddha found is that's very
craving for something to be reliable that is in the way of the lasting happiness,
of a lasting happiness, of a lasting happiness that doesn't come from demanding anything be
reliable, but aligning with the truth of unreliability.
There's a phrase in one of my favorite
sutas that just points to kind of this place. Let's see if I can pull it up.
I've got a piece of it, but I want to get the bigger context.
I can't quite get the whole thing, but what I will do is this one piece of it,
which the instruction or the understanding that's pointed to is
all that's arising is only unreliable experience arising, and all that is ceasing,
all that is ending, that too is just unreliable experience ending.
All that's happening is unreliable experience arising and ceasing.
For me, at certain points in my practice, that phrase has arisen in my mind, and it's like,
oh yeah, there's something really freeing about that understanding. The mind just
doesn't cling and doesn't crave it to be any different. It's just unreliable experience
arising. Why would I want to hold on to that? It's just unreliable experience ceasing. Why would I
want to mourn that? It's just unreliable experience arising and ceasing. That really, to me, feels
like the encouragement of this instruction in the fourth foundation around dukkha when dukkha is
understood from this perspective, just the unreliable nature of experience. This is unreliable
experience. Just replace dukkha there, the translation dukkha, with the word unreliable.
This is unreliable experience. This is the arising of unreliable experience.
This is the ending of unreliable experience, and this is the way leading to understanding the
ending of unreliable experience. And again, there's a freedom in there. It sounds potentially a little
odd that freedom, that kind of seeing, can be so freeing. But it is. I can tell you that. That
kind of seeing is very freeing. Those are some thoughts about this instruction in the fourth
foundation. I want to see if there's any comments or reflections or questions about what I've shared.
Yeah, Fred. You're still muted.
One of the things that I'm curious about is the sequence of the last two truths.
The first two seem to fall in a logical sequence. I'm curious about
why cessation is talked about before the, if you will, the method of getting there.
So there's a couple of ways to explore this. This is a great question, and I think it's
one that has come up many times over the last 2,600 years. There's a lot to say about this.
I'll try to keep it fairly succinct. Two key pieces, two ways to explore this. One is
kind of the traditional way is that, in a way, the framework of the Four Noble Truths is expressed
almost as a medical model. In the medical model, you've got first, what's the diagnosis?
So duke, that's a diagnosis. And then the second is what's making that happen? So the second one
is the cause of duke. The third is, is it possible to cure this? Basically, the question. So that
question gets answered. And then the fourth is, yes, it is possible. And here's the prescription.
So if you go to a doctor, it's like first they diagnose, then they look for the cause, and then
is there a cure? So that question, the third noble truth is, is there a cure? Yes, there's a cure.
Okay, what is the cure? So that's one way to understand that progression. Another way is,
there's actually three that I'll explore here if I've got time. So the second way is to look at
cause and effect relationship between the first and second noble truths and the third and fourth
noble truths. So in the first two noble truths, duke is kind of the statement. And the second
one is, what's the cause or what leads to duke? So what's the thing that's leading in the direction
of duke? So the second one being kind of the impulse in the direction of the first. And again,
in the third and fourth, so the third one is the ending of duke. And the fourth is, well,
what the, how do we get there? So there's a congruence between the causality in a causality
model. There's a congruence between the second one kind of heading in the direction of the first
and the fourth one heading in the direction of the third. So there's a congruence in that.
Another way to look at this, which I particularly like this one, it's unconventional, I would say,
but the first noble, what can happen in the unfolding of our path is, we see a suffering,
we see something, we see the experience of duke. And with enough continuity of mindfulness,
we begin to understand how that comes into being. Often that's the second thing we'll see. It's like
first thing we notice is, yeah, blah, this doesn't feel good. And then as the mindfulness gets a
little more continuous, we actually might see, well, what's going on there? How is that coming
into being? So we see something of the arising. And as mindfulness gets even more continuous,
we might see it end. So those three are kind of, you know, as mindfulness gets stronger,
those three are kind of the progression of the experience. Now, we don't get into that progression
without having the path to begin us. So we have to have that path to begin us in the first place.
So how do we understand the fourth noble truth as following that third? And this is where I kind
of like this image, the image of a path. So the path, you know, we're following a path, we're
following people that have trod this path before, we've had to have people talk about it, you know,
we've had to, you know, get to know what, you know, what the teachings are in order to see these first
three. And so now, after we've seen these three, we are also really on that path. We are treading
the path and keeping it open for others to follow. So that's the fourth. Each of these four noble
truths has an action associated with it. We understand suffering, abandon the cause of suffering,
abandon the arising of suffering or what leads to the arising of suffering. We realize the ending
of suffering, and we develop the path leading to the ending of suffering. So the development of the
path is both occurring at the beginning, you know, we have to have that at the beginning.
But also, the development of the path is ongoing as we continue to practice, as we,
you know, land and actually understand something, we're doing a much better job of developing the
path for people who are coming behind us on the path. And so that's another way of understanding
that. But yes, we definitely have to, I think the fourth noble truth, at least some level of
intellectual understanding has to precede even beginning to step on the path. So yeah, and the
whole framework of the four noble truths as a whole kind of both begins and ends with the
eightfold path. So right view the first element of the eightfold path. I hope you can still hear me
so right view the first element of the eightfold path is basically understand the four noble
truths and understand the path, you know, understand how we how we practice. So right view is kind of
a first starting with an intellectual understanding of the path. And so, you know, right view includes
the eightfold path includes understanding the eightfold path is needed to get anywhere. So right at
the beginning of the four noble truths is you're right at the beginning of the eightfold path is
this right view. And and then the the the for the so right view it includes like the understanding
of the four noble truths also. And so the right the four the eightfold path begins with the four
noble truths. And the eightfold path ends the four it just kind of circles around. So yes,
we do have to begin it. There's another teaching about wisdom that points to three levels of
wisdom, the wisdom of reading, taking in information and concepts, the wisdom that comes
through reflection and the wisdom that comes through direct understanding. And so we need
the eightfold path at all three of those levels. So there's there's a way in which it does have to
begin our practice. But it's there's also a deeper understanding that comes at the end of our practice.
So it's it's it's like a deepening of the the layers of understanding of of all of these
teachings. So that's a great question. Some of what you've said for me takes me to Stephen
bachelor and his idea of he may my understanding is he maintains that there was an earlier
understanding of the four noble truths and that there was that they were four noble tasks.
But well, that is that is in the suit is directly those those four actions, the tasks
associated with the four noble truths. That is absolutely in the suit is there's no question
about that. The the framework of the four noble truths leading one to the other like that,
that understanding that I just talked about is from Stephen bachelor, you know, that that is his
his model of how, you know, we progress from one to the other of the four noble truths. So that is
his teaching there. And I that that his analogy of the path, you know, being cultivated once we've
kind of completed the task of understanding suffering, that Stevens, yeah.
