Occasionally in my role as a teacher at the San Francisco Zen Center, I'm asked to facilitate
a mediation.
Maybe it's a shocking idea to some of you that Zen students would actually have difficulty
with each other.
But it does happen.
The mediation process we use, which I think is not particular just to us, we have the
two people sit down and then we say, okay, please say how it is for you.
And please listen as thoroughly and deeply and completely as you can.
This person says what has happened caused them pain, difficulty, upset.
And we say, okay, could you repeat back in summary, but in detail what you heard.
Then this person says, yeah, that's most of it.
You forgot this little detail, but when you slam the door, okay.
Okay now, could you tell this person how that experience, that whole thing was for you.
And then this person speaks and this person listens.
And then they repeat back.
And then usually it goes back and forth.
Sometimes surprisingly not so many times.
You know, we tend to think, oh, when two people have issues with each other, well, they're
going to talk all night.
Now it's more like each person has something to say that they want to be heard.
And they have to both find a way to say it and then experience it being heard.
And then of course, the other person has something to say that they want to be heard.
And this happens.
And sometimes not all the time as they talk the realization, oh, and that's how it was
for you.
That was your experience.
That was what was coming up for you.
And that was how you experienced my response to it.
And then sometimes marvelously when it goes well, you can just watch the two people soften.
You know, it's like the tension, the electricity that they had, they brought into the room
and as they had sitting facing each other, it softens and there's empathy.
There's understanding, there's connection.
And sometimes it goes really well and they actually hug and, you know, and somehow this
process of separation has brought an intimacy, a connection, a warmth.
And then you can think, what a great job I did as a mediator.
And then sometimes it doesn't go like that.
One person hears the other person's truth and you can watch and notice it didn't quite
soften them.
And they repeat it back and they forget quite a bit of it because the interesting thing
is if you're busy retelling yourself your side of the story, you can't hear the other
side of the story.
You're too busy.
And then it's like, oh, I didn't hear what you said or there is a difficulty accepting
it and you can almost hear it in the tone of the voice.
You can hear that it was harder for them to stay in contact and repeat back.
And then usually they get to a place it's more like, well, okay, you know, I guess that's
okay.
And maybe they shake hands, you know, I've got to shake hands at least.
This, the influence, the potency of connection and openness and empathy, you know, and how
it's stimulated by attention, you know.
You listen deeply, you know.
And in a way, this is the process of awareness, you know.
And in a way, we are telling ourselves a story when we're responding, when we're emulating,
when we're going into something, some commentary or some way that our thinking is coming forth
like that.
Can we listen deeply?
And it's very interesting mediation.
In my experience, with this kind of mediation in particular, it's not like, okay, your five
points are these.
Okay, now, watch your, how are you going to refute or argue either each one of these.
You know, it's not legal, it doesn't have legal linear process.
It's not a discussion about the accuracy and the rationality of each point.
It moves more into how these details, subjective as they may be, how they're held in the disposition,
the emotional quality of it.
And often, when you watch, this is what the person wants to have acknowledged, you know.
And you're telling me that that was really hurtful for you when I did that.
Yes, it was, it was really hurtful.
I didn't know that.
Everything gets acknowledged and softened, you know, and then very interestingly, in
the process of awareness, attending deeply to our own experience, something similar can
happen, you know, and something similar that we can feel a shift.
It's not because we figured out some issue in our life, you know.
It's not because we went through the particulars and sorted them all out, you know, made it
to do list in our head and said, this strategy will take care of everything.
You know, it's the deep listening, the connecting and how those, that particular experience
has become entwined with a disposition, feelings, memories, images in our being.
And yet, before the two people talk and touch and engage, the story about it and the feelings
that support the story are paramount.
It's like the most important thing about the whole thing, and in a way this is about our
life too, you know, and then we engage awareness and we face this interesting challenge and
opportunity to meet deeply what's happening for us.
Believe it or not, that is my intro to today's Paramita, which is very effort, diligence,
persistence, energy.
It's like in the mediation, the energy is invested in hurt and the story about hurt
and the emotions that arise from hurt.
And in the connecting, it's like there's a shift and the energy shifts, you know.
Sometimes when you're with two people and the difference and the intensity is very
strong, you can literally feel the charge.
You can feel it in the tone of the voice.
And then when it shifts, you know, oh, really, you can feel the softness.
And just as in our medit, in our awareness, you know, of course we have ways that we
come at being fully present, you know, this is the nature of our practice.
And yet these techniques, these strategies take us so far, you know, at a certain point
we give over to now, we give over to the experience.
And I would hope this image, especially if there's something persistent coming up for
you, you know, it's not unusual when we settle, we unsettle, you know, we start to have more
awareness and more contact and guess what, there's space for unavailability for things
that are difficult for us.
Can we listen deeply?
You know, you might think, well, if I listen to that story, it'll go on forever.
You know, you might, well, if two people sit down and they have animosity towards each
other, they're going to talk forever, if they don't listen pretty much, they'll talk forever,
you know, they'll keep saying the same thing, the same way we do in our own mental processes.
Something occurs to me that we will keep saying it until we fully hear it.
It's like we're saying to ourselves, you know, you haven't quite listened.
I'm going to say it again.
And let's see if you hear it this time.
Nope, you didn't.
I'll wait a few minutes and then I'll say it again.
And so one aspect of virya, the persistence, the diligence, you know, this is the nature
of karmic life.
And this karmic life grooves into our being, its patterns.
And those patterns create the tendency for repetition.
We repeat.
And so we come to be present, to be open, to be available, to not have an agenda.
And the urgencies of our karmic life haven't agreed to it.
They have a story to tell, and they want an audience.
And if you're not listening, they'll repeat it, maybe louder.
So this kind of patient diligence, you know, this aspect of virya, you know, like, okay,
notice, experience, release, breathe in, or breathe out, wherever you are in the cycle.
So it's very helpful to have a constancy of engagement.
And it's helpful within that constancy of engagement that it has these qualities.
If it's harsh and demanding, part of you is going to rebel.
It's going to start thinking, what if I was in Hawaii on the beach, you know, catching
some beautiful waves, or just lying there, not a single part of my body hurting.
If we make the environment of awareness unattractive, guess what, it's going to diminish our
inclination to stay within that.
So we hold these kinds of images that I'm trying to present, and, you know, we all have
our own version of what quickens our intention.
I will engage like this.
And I mean it, I'm sincere.
And then, hopefully, skillfully, that links to engagement in the body and the breath.
Because as we start to move into experiencing, just the thought is not sufficient.
As the sensations and the feelings arise, they will have more authority than just an
idea.
So we bring our intention into our body.
We bring the diligence into our physicality and into our breath.
It's like it helps to ground us, to root us, to create that basis.
And they're both wonderful guides.
Because if you treat your body roughly, it will complain.
When the body, let me show you a little exercise, if you put your fingers up like this and just
lightly touch them, and then close your eyes.
And just as best you can, become aware of the contact between your fingers.
And see, can you reduce it to where they're just barely touching, but you can still have
an experience of touch.
And then with your eyes closed still, move your fingers about half inch apart.
And then with your eyes still closed, slowly and deliberately bring them back to that delicate
Okay, you can open your eyes, put your fingers down.
So I hope you could feel in that, that when we bring a certain kind of gentle attention
to the sensation of touch, it enlivens.
Some things stimulated and enlivened.
The yogic part of posture is to discover this way of being in the body.
That there's like an energy, an energy that responds to attention.
There's an energy that responds to contact.
And then there's a way in which this energy responds right in the medium of our emotions,
our understandings, you know, when we hear the other person say something that's meaningful
for us, that's relevant.
It's evocative of our emotions and they can soften and open and it's, you know, as we
say, our heart opens, you know, so in this medium and then in another medium, in the
very medium of just tactile touch in the sensation in the body.
And that brought to my mind, I hope this will make, maybe I don't want it to make sense,
but maybe it'll give you a feeling, and God we can now wrote this poem and the image
he's using is, reteach each thing its loveliness.
The bud stands for all things, even for those that don't flower.
For everything flowers from within of self-blessing, but sometimes it's necessary to reteach a
thing its loveliness, to put a hand on its brow of the flower and retell it in words
and in touch, it is lovely, until it flowers again from within of self-blessing.
So can we in the midst of the turmoil of our habituated responses that are rising for us,
that have become embodied, that have worn their grooves in our mind, that have become
patterned habits of our emotions?
Can we, with our intention, can we, with the breath, with returning to physical sensation,
can we start to embody this generous sentiment, that we're here to listen and attend deeply
to the workings of the self, to the workings of others, to the signs, the sights, the smells,
the tastes, the touch?
It's like each time we come to sit, you know, it's so easy and tempting to have a strategy
for sitting, okay, here's what I do, and it has a certain mechanical dimension to it,
and then we're just boring ourselves, you know, we sort of do it because it's boring
or something in its mechanical nature doesn't touch our heart.
Each time we sit down, can the vow of practice, can we remember it?
Now, why is this worthy of a week of my life given all the other things?
Why is this worthy of this physical discomfort?
It's like we're inviting, not just tender touch, but we're inviting an effort, a commitment,
an involvement that's inviting immersion, you know?
And part of this, you know, we can think about it like this now, and you know, this is helpful
when we find, you know, these are my words, hopefully you'll find your words.
And but more interestingly, hopefully you'll find your feelings, you know, you'll find
the sentiment that evokes, that stirs up, when we're enthusiastic, it's an interesting
kind of energy, you know?
When we're doing it because we should do it, it's like, we could tell you all great stories
about why it's a good thing to do, but we should be doing it.
And the challenge for us is to get in touch with ourselves more intimately.
Not that we always can, you know, this is just the truth of practice.
But then, what we have drawn in through the continuity of practice can be a resource,
you know, is you start to align the body with the breath, with the heart, with the mind.
It's like, oh yeah, right, you know, start to reconnect.
Can we breathe in a way that reconnects the vow?
Can we breathe in a way that's compassionate, that's patient, that doesn't need to cling
to a fixed outcome?
In the process of video, you know, in some ways it's foolish to think that the persistence,
the commitment, the diligence are just extra, you know?
I would say our habit energy is too strong, you know?
It's too compelling, the hurt that we want to say and have listened to is too urgent.
So this persistence, okay, let's sit again, you know, let's start over, let's rediscover.
And it's interesting, just as in mediation, you know, part of the magic of mediation is
two people come in and you look at them and you think, but these two people are friends,
you know?
They've been friends for years, they like each other.
And, and then when they reconnect, you know, the shift and the energy flows into intimacy
and connectedness.
Why are our stories so urgent?
Because we care.
You know, why do we upset each other so much?
Because we care.
It's not that our experience lacks curing, it's just that protective mechanism in a
version has arisen.
So we sit and when that comes forth, it's like, oh, this is today's teacher.
This can be a lesson in how pain and difficulty turns into a version.
This can be a lesson in how survival, protection is about contraction, you know?
And this is in our body, in our emotions, in our attitudes, in our recounting of life
stories.
And the wonderful aspect of practice, and sometimes the amazement of practice is when
we open to it, you think, oh, and then if you want to hear everything that's wrong with
my life, I'll be talking forever.
When it opens, something supportive comes forth.
Maybe as Galway Kanel says, we reteach each thing its loveliness with self-blessing.
We offer compassion and patience.
And the energy flows into different phenomena.
And difficult as it is to persevere with skillful effort in the midst of mental and emotional,
it's also similar in the midst of physical difficulty.
The request is to make contact and to soften into immersion in the experience.
And that's difficult when the experience is painful.
And there's a physical aversion to pain, we contract, and the breath can be our ally.
Can the body swell and receive the inhale?
In the body release with the exhale, like a sigh, and we study this breath after breath.
Sometimes we study it on our cushion, and then sometimes when we're walking, when there's
more spacious ease in the body, can we discover the subtle yoga of breath?
How it can open, release, stimulate?
How it can infuse the body with the vitality that helps it to be experienced more like
a field of energy than just anatomical parts?
Not to say we set that as a goal, can it offer us something about the disposition of listening
deeply to physicality?
Can it teach us something about how the breath and the body can be an ally and a foundation
for the complexities that can arise in the human condition?
And they do, and they will.
In the second half of Galway Canell's poem, so he takes this beautiful abstract notion,
the bud stands for everything, even for those things that don't flower, for everything flowers
from within of self-blessing, though sometimes it's necessary to reteach a thing its loveliness,
to put a hand on its brow of the flower and retell it in words and in touch.
It is lovely, until it flowers again from within of self-blessing.
And then the image he uses is of a pig, as St. Francis put his hand on the creased forehead
of the sow and told her in words and in touch blessings of earth on the sow.
The sow began remembering all down her thick length from the earthen snout all the way
through the fodder and the slabs to the spiritual curl of the tail.
From the heart spining this spiked out from the spine down through the great broken heart
to the sheer blue milk and dreaminess, spurting and shuddering from the fourteen tits into
the fourteen mouths, sucking and blowing beneath them, the long perfect loveliness of the
sow.
Can our vow, can our intention touch us?
Can it let something in us grant permission to who we are and what we are and how we are?
The process of attention, awareness, so interesting the factors and this one.
Kind of some practices, the diligence, the persistence is what creates the energy.
You keep applying with vigor, the Siam root is virya, you keep applying with vigor and
that's the intimacy of connection and there's energy.
And then that energy facilitates this more open awareness.
With this approach, if softening and accepting the myriad manifestations of karmic life,
then awareness is invited in and compassion and patience seem like, well how else would
you respond to suffering, what else makes sense?
And then the energy part of it can start to become evident.
We can start to see when a story arises and you give it attention and energy, it becomes
more energized, it becomes more real.
It becomes more evocative of emotions and associated thoughts and memories.
And then rather than try to squelch that or wrestle control of it, can we just see, can
we soften the drive, the way it's being involved in?
Can we breathe the whole story in like we breathe in the breath?
Can we release with the exhale?
Providing ourselves permission not to be held in that pain.
Can we listen deeply to the story?
Can we listen deeply to its somatic aspect too?
So it's not a rejection, it's more awareness and energy goes to noticing awareness of the
story then goes into the story.
When the energy goes to awareness rather than into the story, the story doesn't become
so real.
It becomes more the play of the moment.
It becomes less about there and then and more about, hmm, look at what's arising.
And when there's awareness of the story, it's almost like we can see the story, feel the
intensity of it, the character of it, and then we can watch.
We can watch the difference.
Sometimes inside the story, the story is reality.
Sometimes awareness of the story and the story is just part of the tapestry of now.
It's just another attribute of the mandala of this moment.
And when there's awareness in the body and the breath, it supports this meeting, the
arising thought with awareness.
And almost all of us need to mess around with this process.
Almost all of us need to turn it into an issue of control or whatever else we want to do
with it, or try too hard or whatever we want to do, sort of find this persistent but gentle
approach.
Do that too, you allow yourself to be in learning mode, okay?
Oh, I got all cut up in that for the last however many minutes.
It was like I went into a waking dream.
And sometimes you come out of it and you feel depleted.
It's like I was sitting there and I was doing pretty good.
And then I went into that troublesome story and now my body's kind of heavy and achy and
I was thinking I might leave the retreat.
It's not really working.
And I want it to be dinner time.
I'm fed up sitting, you know, and just can we watch that as an energy play, you know?
When the awareness is in the body, it sustains the body, it can sustain a disposition of
engagement.
And when it leaks out, they can leak out too.
And what do you do?
You start over.
It's just the play of practice.
That's how it is, you know?
You start over, if you can just start over with another breath, fine.
If you need to do some walking meditation, fine.
If you're really depleted, maybe you need to take a nap.
But let it all be a teacher.
Let it all teach you skillfulness with working with yourself.
Okay, this is how it is for me.
This is how to work with me.
And looking at it in the context of energy, you know, it helps us to not be so committed
to the usual way of relating to the story, you know?
Now, it's not to say, oh, well, our stories are just a kind of nonsense.
No, they're not nonsense.
They're very...
They're how our life comes into being, you know?
Their urgency, their repetition is because they are significant within our being.
But this way of seeing them from a different perspective can offer something.
It can offer a different way to relate.
And the energy can...
The energy can start to flow.
And the kind of a deep-receded need to hold the world, the world according to me, in place,
to confirm it and affirm it, it loosens up.
It's like when awareness is strong, the need for it to be a certain way starts to soften.
Just watch those moments while you feel present.
And notice that there can be less need for it to be a certain way.
You're just walking and you don't need to get anywhere, you know?
You're lined up for a meal and you don't need to get there quickly.
It's just, okay.
I'll get to the head of the line when I get to the head of the line.
Those moments are instructive.
Those moments teach us the experience of liberation.
It's not that we make up great ideas about them.
It's that we soak them in.
This is the joy of practice.
Somehow, in the midst of all our stuff, we do have our moments.
And for that, I have another poem, which I'm sure some of you know.
Billy Collins' Aimless Love.
And if you haven't heard it before, well, I think you're in for a treat.
This morning, as I walked along the lakeshore, I fell in love with a ren.
And later in the day, with a mouse, the cat had dropped onto the dining room table.
And in the shadows of the autumn evening, I fell for a seamstress still at her machine
in the tailor's window.
And later, for a bowl of broth, steam rising like smoke from a naval battle.
This is the best kind of love, I thought, without recompense, without gifts or unkind
words, without suspicion or silence on the telephone.
The love of a chestnut, the jazz cap, and one hand on the wheel.
No lust, no slam of the door, the love of a miniature orange tree.
Clean white shirt, hot evening shower, the highway that cuts across Florida.
No waiting, no huffiness, no rancor, just a twinge every now and then for the ren who
had built her nest on a low branch overhanging there out with water.
And for the dead mouse, still dressed in its light brown suit.
But my heart is always propped up in the field on its tripod, ready for the next arrow.
After I carried the mouse by the teal to a pile of leaves in the woods, I find myself
standing at the bathroom silk, gazing down affectionately at the soap.
So patient and soluble, so at home in its pale green soap dish.
I could feel myself falling again as I felt its turning in my wet hands and caught the
scent of lavender and stone.
So practice isn't all awful, you don't have to be suffering to be practicing.
So especially, you know, now we're in the throes of the retreat.
It's okay to fall in love with the scent of the rain, the person so diligently and mindfully
putting out the food, the Buddha had in the corner of the walking meditation room, the
collective silence and stillness as we patiently stand in line to eat.
Here's that too.
And it's the joy of practice.
It's the energy of practice.
It's where in the meeting the animosity falls and something deeply connects.
Thank you.
