Starting by just allowing yourself to take in how you are in this moment. 
How's the body? Love yourself. 
Love yourself. 
Love yourself. 
What's the moods, what are the moods, the feelings, the emotions present? Is there vegetation or some ease? It's kind of in a general sense. 
You're acknowledging how you are. 
I'm exploring the possibility of opening to that without judgment. 
Without either resisting or holding on. 
This is how it is right now. 
How does it affect you to open to that, open to how it is right now? Sometimes that very peace, just remembering. 
It is possible to open to how things are in this moment. 
Sometimes that can shift the mind. 
And so I'm just kind of curious about that. 
And then we can remember what supports our capacity to be present. 
What conditions help us to open. 
And one of the key conditions that helps us to open and be present is relaxation. 
So remembering that, be inclining towards allowing a relaxation of body. 
Sometimes we can consciously scan through the body and see if there can be some conscious relaxation of places that are held in tightness. 
Often what happens is that as we scan and notice an area that's tight, often we weren't so conscious of it before, and simply becoming conscious of it, there can be a natural movement in the direction of relaxation. 
And this exploration around relaxation is using awareness to help reveal things we might not have noticed, tension we might not have noticed. 
And that may support a movement towards relaxation. 
And maybe too, the mind can relax and soften. 
As the body relaxes, it supports a mental relaxation. 
As the body and mind do relax, perhaps, this supporting more possibility of being aware, this very natural capacity of mind to be present. 
What is awareness aware of? We can explore what is already happening, what is being received, exploring this possibility of receptive awareness rather than looking for something to be aware of. 
Awareness will already be aware of something, so what is that? Having ourselves step out of the control of deciding and see what is naturally being known in this moment. 
This may be body sensation. 
Often that's an area that is very obvious. 
Another way to look at this question, what is obvious right now? Maybe sounds, maybe moods or emotions, thoughts. 
It also might be something kind of contained in a specific, a particular area of the body, for instance, might pull the attention. 
A particular sound might pull the attention. 
But sometimes what we're aware of is something more diffuse, less specific, more of a sense of being here. 
Maybe a broader sense of the body and sound together. 
Maybe a sense of how you are, whether there's agitation or ease. 
So opening to the possibility that what is obvious in this moment may have a variety of characteristics. 
Maybe for a time the attention will be connecting to the breath or a body sensation, and then it might shift to something more diffuse. 
And then it might shift back to a sound or a thought. 
And you open to just receive the next experience. 
That's obvious. 
Exploring, allowing that without judgment, resistance, or holding on. 
Curious. 
Remembering that this is a human being experiencing this. 
This is human experience. 
Conditioned by past experience, by how you are in this moment. 
Conditioned and folding. 
Curious about. 
This life in this moment. 
The only thing we ever have. 
The only thing we ever have. 
The only thing we ever have. 
The only thing we ever have. 
The only thing we ever have.
