 So we're getting near the end of a series of talks that I've been giving on Sunday morning on the five hindrances. And today we'll explore the hindrance of restlessness and anxiety, restlessness and regret, restlessness and worry. And for those of you who haven't been coming, the word hindrances is a translation of a Pali word called nivarana, which literally means to cover over. And it's that which covers over many things, but some of the wholesome qualities, beautiful qualities of the mind, the qualities, for example, primarily covers over our ability to stay present. And so it's very hard to stay present in a clear, direct way when these coverings are there. It also covers over our ability to act wisely in the present moment, to act with compassion and wisdom and the other kind of beautiful qualities of the mind. So a big part of Buddhist practice is learning to recognize these coverings, see them when they're operating, and then learn how to negotiate ourselves with them or work with them so that they no longer cover us, cover over this potential of the heart or the mind. And so they're often called hindrances, so that which hinder the practice, hinder the capacity to get into some deep meditative experience. They hinder all kinds of beautiful capacities of the mind and the heart. And there are five of them, it's actually seven, but they're under five categories. And the first two are paired, desire and ill will, and kind of like opposites. And then the next two are also paired. And the heavy wonderful term sloth and torpor is the one, you know, one side of the pair. And the other side is what restlessness and anxiety. And so kind of being drained of energy, not being able to apply oneself, not having the ability to do anything, is contrasted with, in some ways, being overexcited, over agitated. And so then also it's not very useful state to be in because in the agitated state, the restless state, there's often confusion, there's often an inability to make decisions, there's often an inability to settle on anything and be focused to really see what's going on. When we're sloth and torpor, the same kind of inabilities are there also, but they're because we're being drained of energy. So they're kind of paired. Sometimes these sloth, torpor, restlessness, anxiety are a result of some problem with we have with desire and ill will. Frustrated desire can sometimes lead to feeling discouraged or feeling lethargic or feeling, you know, slothful. Sometimes frustrated desire can lead to restlessness and anxiety. Same thing with ill will. It will, you know, when the front, when ill will is frustrated or somehow, you know, has a deleterious effect on our system, it can lead to sloth or can lead to restlessness. For some people, sloth and restlessness are strategies for how to respond to challenges in daily life, in our lives. There's some deep personal psychological challenges or social challenges and people have trouble being present for it. Sometimes the response as a way of maybe protect ourselves or avoid it, sometimes it's to shut off, shut down, sloth and sometimes it's to get overly excited and restless and kind of run around like, you know, like a, I don't know what, like when an image is given in text is like a rat trapped in a cage. I don't know what the rats look like trapped in a cage, but I think the idea is that they're kind of running around like running and running, running, they'll get anywhere and they can never settle down. So in this fourth hindrance, we're talking about two terms. One is we're talking about restlessness and the other anxiety. I'm not sure what the best translation should be. The first one, restlessness, the Pali word is udacha. And udacha means comes from a root like to tremble or to shake. So it can be agitated to be restless. And it's said that this restlessness udacha is present in the mind whenever the mind is caught up in some unskillful tendency or activity, whenever the mind is involved in some activity, mental activity, which is unhealthy for oneself or for others. There's some degree of restlessness in that mind. It's also said that restlessness can be very gross and it all can be very subtle. And in its subtle forms, it takes being fully enlightened to become free of the tendency to restlessness entirely. So those of you who are not fully enlightened here today, you should be able to find somewhere in your psyche something that you can relate to this talk. Because somewhere you have the tendency to have to restlessness in your psyche. In deep meditation, the mind can be very still, very concentrated, very focused. And it still becomes an issue of the mind getting restless. But it's very, very subtle, very small movements. It's more like you're very, very still in meditation. It's kind of like you're on this razor's edge almost, you're very still and focused in there. And then ever so slightly, the mind kind of slips off that edge, slips off. They can go either direction, go in the direction of what's called sinking mind, where the mind gets kind of dull. Or it can go in the direction of what's sometimes called rising mind, excited mind, where the mind gets excited. For example, it's not so uncommon for people to fall or move into very deep states sometimes, interesting states of meditation, very concentrated states. I've never had that before. Wow, this is cool. They get excited and they pop out of it. And it's also common enough when mind gets very calm and concentrated, that a certain little bit of complacency can sit in, laziness can sit in. And it's very easy for the mind to drift off into thoughts, into pleasant thoughts. And the mind, it kind of falls into kind of a stupor. And so a very important task of meditators, even very good meditators, is to stay very attentive to this movement of sinking and restless mind, agitated mind or excited mind, and to track it so that you can stay right on that middle point of staying balanced and be able to go forward. So restless is an issue for both people who never meditated, and for people who are actually quite good at meditation. It's always going to be there until they say a person gets fully awakened, fully liberated. People who are new to meditation will sometimes occasionally report how dramatic their restlessness is. And I've known people who, it was like the rodeo. The first time they sat down to meditate, they'd never sit still in their life. And they never sat still in such a way that they got to see what was coursing through their body and their minds. Because if you're always moving and acting and doing, you don't really have to confront yourself and meet yourself. But if you really sit still sometimes, you kind of suddenly all this energy doesn't have an outlet in a sense, and so you get to see it, you know, right up front, right close up. And sometimes it's really like the rodeo. I've known people who've broken into sweats, sometimes gotten nauseous, sometimes gotten up and run away. Because it's so dramatic, the meeting of themselves, this restlessness and anxiety, this agitation that might be there, that's hidden, often hidden. Sometimes people have much easier time in the beginning of meditation practice. Sooner or later, I think some kind of restlessness will set in, agitation will set in. I've sat certainly sat with my share of restlessness and agitation in meditation. And it sometimes takes a form of, you feel as energy in my legs, I just feel like I want to bolt, you know, just like anything, you know, or just rising energy is kind of like, it's almost like a tension that rises up. Sometimes I can feel like a lot of energy coursing through the body, just kind of like movements and tightening and tension and tensing and just kind of impulses moving through the body a lot. Sometimes it feels like kind of a shakiness, vulnerability, kind of being feeling kind of shaky, and not really able to settle and relax because this shakiness is agitation. Some of you probably know the feeling of having too much caffeine. If you have too much caffeine, then you sit down to meditate, then you probably be visited by restlessness or this agitation that can be there. Interestingly enough, the effect that caffeine, the agitation that caffeine can have on the body and the system might not show itself for meditator when the meditation is somewhat coarse, when their mind is somewhat, you know, busy. But as the mind gets more and more quiet in meditation, it becomes more and more obvious that there's kind of an edge of restlessness or agitation that caffeine tends to create. And so sometimes on retreats, people who drink caffeine will stop it for the retreat because they find that it gets in the way of being able to drop further down some deeper level of stillness and calm. One of the interesting qualities of restlessness or agitation is that it can camouflage itself. Because often restlessness is kind of focusing, it can't at times focus on something we're concerned about, something we're worried about, something that we're agitated about, something we're trying to solve, something that's frustrating us, something we feel we were responsible for, we're not taken care of properly. There's many things that can make the mind kind of agitate. And as long as we're focusing on the thoughts that are responsible thoughts that are the focus of the agitation, it's very hard to get the system to settle unless we can think unless we can solve the thoughts, solve the problems, right? That's the holy grail of the mind. I mean, just if I think about this long enough, I'm sure I can solve this. And we'll think about it for days and months and years. And it's kind of a dead end, a certain degree. So at some point, what we have to do is learn to turn away from the thought. It can be a very hard movement to learn to focus away from what we're thinking about. You don't necessarily have to stop thinking about it. But there's this art of turning the energy or the interest away from what we're thinking about to what's happening in the immediate presence right now. And with restless and agitation, it can feel uncomfortable. One of the responses to discomfort is to try to run away, try to get away from it, or try to attack it. In other words, to get restless over again. There can be a kind of self-perpetuating cycles around restlessness. It's uncomfortable. We touch it, we recoil, we get more restless. So part of the art, and certainly meditation, is to come back at times and learn how to sit still with our own restlessness and agitation. Very important quality of practice. And then let it hide itself by always focusing externally. So that's the first word in this fourth hindrance, the udacha. The other half is called kukacha. And this is a little different quality. In the ancient texts, it's referred to as hindrance of regret. And this is when our, so in the ancient texts, the assumption there is the only reason the person would feel this feeling, kukacha, regret, is if you did something morally off. So you have something to be ashamed of or embarrassed of. You wouldn't want some, you know, Dalai Lama comes in and you say, oh, by the way, I recently lied to my best friend. You want to tell that to Dalai Lama. You'd rather not. You have better things to talk about. You don't have to admit that. So behavior which causes the mind to be agitated or restless because it feels regret, kind of cut up in that regret. Many years ago, I remember doing something that could be considered ethical. And it certainly was something I didn't want other people to know about. And I went on a retreat. And the first days of the retreat were awful because, you know, it was those thoughts and feelings are right there and worry, what am I going to do? And people are going to notice and what am I going to say? And what's going to happen to me? And so that was the kind of being visited by the covering, this hindrance of regret. There's a different kind of here, kind of regret or agitation that can maybe be related to Kukacha. And that is anxiety about ourself, our ego, our egotism, our self definition. Most of us have very, most human beings are tremendously preoccupied with their sense of self, who they are, who they are in relation to other people, who they're not. I'm not going to tell that to someone or let me tell you this about me so that you know who I really am. Really what the spin we're doing. We're great politicians. And we're kind of always giving spins about ourselves. We're very concerned about ourselves. And that concern around self and self identity is one of the sources of anxiety and restlessness. And that can be seen sometimes again in very deep meditation, very, very advanced meditators. It's that very little, it doesn't feel like restlessness anymore, but it's a very kind of slippery little kind of concern for oneself or identifying with oneself. Oh, I am so concentrated right now. Just that little innocent statement. I'm so concentrated right now. You know, if you just say, I'm concentrated, that's probably safe. But if you say, I am so concentrated, then you can be caught. Gotcha. Right? And there's kind of, the mind is no longer in that rater's edge, a balanced place, but rather has been caught by something and has gone off. And for some meditators, it's when they can let go of using the word eye around what's the good things happening to them in meditation, that a certain level of restlessness or anxiety falls away and the mind can get stiller. So in the classic discussion about the five hindrances, it describes how a person practices with these hindrances, with these coverings when they appear. The assumption is they're going to appear to all of us until the mind gets concentrated enough that the mind is kind of stronger than the power of these forces. So it's something most meditators have to work with and learn about. And what I recommend is that all meditators be eager to learn about them. So rather than being discouraged when they appear, say, oh, great. There it is. I was told it would come and there it came. And I get to learn to work with this. Now, how do I work with this? How do I learn to develop the skills and the strength to work with this? A different attitude might be, oh, shoot, this is a drag. I just ignore that part of my life. Or I'm just really bad or something. And I think I'll watch television instead. There are skillful and unskillful ways of responding to the appearance of the hindrances. And the skillful one is to be interested and be respectful and begin engaging with them in a way that begins overcoming their hindering quality. The first line that we emphasize in our insight tradition is simply mindfulness, knowing that it's there, recognizing it's there. And I think of mindfulness as I think of kind of some of these hindrances as being like a maze. And you go into this maze and there's no out in this maze, but you think there is one. So you go into this maze and you go endlessly around kind of searching around the corners, going this way and that way. But mindfulness is like learning somehow to lift yourself up above the top of the wall of the maze so you get a panoramic view of the top. You see it all. So you lift it out of it and you have this overview of the whole situation rather than being mired into the middle of it, lost in it. So you're going to have to so we try to pull ourselves out of the mire, pull ourselves out of the maze so we can get an overview and see it. And having an overview, having that strength of mind to see rather than being lost in is one of the very important strengths we're developing in this practice. And that takes not so easy to do. So it takes a while to learn how to do that. With restlessness, one of the most useful ways of doing this, I've found, is to feel the restlessness physically. And just kind of let the body be the container of all that impulses and energy. And sit there and be committed to not moving. And sometimes you might break out in the sweat because it's so strong it feels like the rodeo. And you sit there and just feel it all. Imagine it's a ping pong ball or something and it's moving inside and going this way and that way. And just feeling it in the body takes away that little extra agitation that comes with the mind thinking it has to fix it and solve the problem. Maybe you don't have to solve it and fix it. All you have to do is feel it physically and the body will take care of it, will help it to unwind in its own time. So just let the body feel it. It also can be very empowering for some people to learn they have the ability to ride it out. They don't have to be swayed by it or caught by it or pushed around by it, forced to act in the world because of it. But they can just sit with it and get the upper hand. If it's a regret that's going on, then perhaps we need to look more carefully at what's going on in the mind. And not just be present in the body, but look at the beliefs, the thoughts that are generating, the memories that are generating that kind of mental regret that's going on. So the classic instructions, the first thing it says is just notice it's there. The second thing it says is notice when it's not there. And in our tradition, we emphasize so much paying attention to what's present that we probably don't say enough. Pay attention when something's not there. It's not saying the same thing as pay attention to all the things which are not present. It's saying there's some usefulness of paying attention, noticing when you're not being caught by hindrance. So if one hindrance, say that restlessness is a really common hindrance for you, then notice those times in the day when it's not there. And not just notice it kind of in the abstract, but really get a felt sense of what it's like to be without the restless or the regret. Physically, emotionally, heart-felling in the mind. Really get to know what it's like. Because that knowledge, that kind of almost physical knowledge of what it's like to be still or calm or peaceful is very nourishing for the psyche. It helps and informs the psyche what's possible. And it's just a very useful thing to do. But it's also useful for the next three instructions on how to work with these hindrances. So today's restlessness. So the next thing to do is to notice what is it that prompted the arising of the restlessness or the regret. So there's a kind of using our, I don't know if analytical abilities is the right word, but using our abilities to reflect, to look at, to analyze a little bit. What is it that happened here that caused this to arise? It's a little bit sometimes going back into the past, a few minutes perhaps or an hour or a little bit in the past. What is it that happened that's caused this to happen, to cause this restlessness to be there? That's what the Buddha said, you should do that. It's not necessarily the same thing as psychoanalysis going back to your childhood. Your early causes, but just kind of in the immediacy. What is it that caused that? And perhaps you lie to a friend and you've noticed the next hour you had all this regret. So my behavior an hour ago was the condition for this restlessness arising, this regret arising. So to see that and to begin understanding what are the reasons for the arising of restlessness and anxiety, restlessness, agitation, regret. Now to leave it as something you take for granted, it's there because of causes and conditions. And we begin to become aware of what those causes and conditions are. It's very useful because then you can start doing something about it. More than just bring mindfulness to it, you can actually change your behavior. You can stop lying or stop drinking caffeine or do whatever it is that's causing this hindering quality. So that gives us some empowerment, some control over our lives that's more than just bringing mindfulness, just changing our experience, changing what we do. And there's a whole slew of things that prompt restlessness and regret. But you might look carefully at your sense of self, self-definition. The way you define yourself and want to define yourself affects the degree to which you're restless or agitated. You might also look at the role of desire or ill will, your attachments or your fears in this. To take a very honest and direct look at the nature of your desiring. What do you really desire? What's going on? And how are you caught by your desires? And what's the relationship between having desires and getting agitated? So you see that connection. The next thing that the meditator needs to do or can do in the instruction is to understand what it takes to abandon or let go of this hindrance. And again, this is a little bit different than just being mindful of it. Sometimes mindfulness by itself is enough to free ourselves from the hindering quality. But sometimes it's not, it stays. So you can look, what can I do to abandon this quality that's keeping me from being present, that keeps spinning me out, spinning me out with the restless and agitation? And again, there might be a whole slew of things a person might do. Sometimes they're more meditative. Sometimes they can be more non-meditative. Sometimes getting more exercise is helpful. I've noticed sometimes if I don't get into exercise during the day, there's a kind of, I wouldn't call it agitation or restlessness, but kind of energized state that I have sometimes when I try to go to sleep at night. A little bit harder to fall asleep. But if I get exercise, then when I go to sleep at night, it seems like it's a lot easier. I kind of feel the effect of lack of exercise. So maybe it's external. Maybe you need to get more exercise or more activity. But what does it take to abandon or let go of these? If Genesis, if you see in what prompted it, you'll have a better sense of what it takes to let to abandon it. You see it prompted by desire. Maybe the issue is not abandoning restlessness. The issue is abandoning desire or attachment to certain things. Or ill will. If we're angry, maybe anger is what's keeping us restless. We have to take a very honest look at the anger and learn what do we have to let go of there? What do you have to diminish there? Sometimes bringing up opposite qualities to the restlessness and the regret as antidotes can help balance it out and smooth it out. One of the classic ones is doing some kind of concentration practice like loving kindness practice. Another is to... The opposite of restlessness is usually seen to be stillness or calm. To tune into that part of your being which is calm or still. Even though most of you might be restless, to begin appreciating and valuing calm and stillness and tuning into it. Sometimes I can get a sense I might feel somewhat restless but around me just in the perimeter just outside the boundaries of my body I could feel it's really still. I don't know if everybody else has that sense but it doesn't seem to be much happening there. So it's kind of stillness it's all around me. And sometimes I'll tune into that stillness that seems to be all around me. And that stillness then will be a very soft kind of almost loving container for what's going on inside. And that tends to kind of then soften what's happening inside in a nice way for me. Some people will find an inner stillness deep inside that's the core of their being and that informs the restlessness and kind of helps it to settle into quiet. One of the classic antidotes for restlessness and regret is happiness. And it said that you cannot be happy and restless at the same time. Or you cannot be happy and regretful at the same time. So to bring in some kind of happiness into the system. So you know it can be many things bringing some kind of happiness. Because I knew I was giving this talk this morning when I first sat down to meditate with all of you I was a little bit restless. I don't think because of the talk but I just you know just come down here for my kids and all stuff. I said oh happiness is the antidote to restlessness. So I thought about all you sitting here. This is a phenomenal thing. This is really great to have you all sitting together all these people here. This is make make it made me happy. And sure enough I felt more settled as soon as I thought about that happiness. Brought up that happiness. So be mindful of the hindrance when it's there. Be mindful of what it's like when it's not there. Study a little bit what prompted the hindrance to arise. Study what it takes to abandon the hindrance like oh but if you can. And then the fifth approach is when a hindrance is not there then avoid prompting it in the future. So you have to know that it's not there and then you have to know yourself well enough to know that certain things tend to prompt you to be restless. So you know I think I better avoid that. I've noticed that every time I stole from my friends it made me kind of restless. It took me a while to learn this out learn this but I finally learned it after about 12 times. I think that I don't this restless is not very helpful for me. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to learn how to meditate to be really present. It has a high enough value for me in my life that I really want to see what it's like to be really present and concentrated. I think I need to change my life a little bit so that I don't come to my meditation so restless. So I think I better make some changes here. I think I better stop stealing because if I keep stealing I just can't get into the meditation the way that I you know it's meant to do. So there is this kind of prioritization that goes on in spiritual life or kind of understanding the trade-offs and being willing sometimes to put aside or abandon or let go of certain things that are going to interfere with our interest our intention to develop a spiritual life. There is a kind of trade-off and some people think they can have it all. Steal and develop meditation like you know you can't do that and there might be other things you can't do and you have to decide for yourself or explore for yourself. What is it that interferes with your ability what gets in the way with your ability to develop a useful deep still concentrated focus? You're really here and present. So I'd like to end with a short story of the story from the Buddha's enlightenment. And that's kind of you know my version of the story. The Buddha spent some six years wandering around India as an ascetic. He left the palace, his palace life, in order to pursue a spiritual life. And the spiritual lives that were available from India at that time were the ones that he pursued the common routes and one of the most common ones that he pursued was the ascetic route and he did that for many years until he realized that it was a dead end. It wasn't going to take him anywhere. And so he stopped that and he said what am I going to do now? I've done all the major things that people the past have been available to me and I haven't found my peace. And then he remembered a story, remembered it at a memory of when he was six years old. And it was a spring day and his father was officiating over the royal, the ritual plowing, first plowing of the season in the spring. And all the people are out in the fields with the ritual plow and they're plowing. And the six-year-old Buddha was left underneath the rose apple tree, the edge of the field, just by himself. People had left him alone. And I imagine that he was kind of as a child of the royalty. He wasn't left alone that much. So he was left alone in the shade of his tree. And he just sat upright and in the way that sometimes children can do, I dropped into a very deep state of peace and a state of well-being. So when he was 35 he remembered that event and he said oh perhaps something about that child-like openness. When I just sat there without trying to engage in any kind of special kind of spiritual practice, just try to be very open and present in a very relaxed way. Maybe that's the way forward for me. So he tried that and I call it kind of a child-like openness. He was going to sit and meditate with a child-like openness to whatever was going on. Just open, ready to be receptive, undefended, no agendas, not trying to manipulate or do anything with experience, but just here open. Now someone who's been an ascetic for six years and been repressing and pushing down, denying themselves for that long, is going to have a rebound effect from those six years. And one of the first things that happened to the Buddha when he kind of sat with that child-like openness was he was besieged by what's called Mara. All these psychic forces that had been repressed for all these years, desire and fear and hunger and thirst and you know and you know a whole bunch of stuff came. And he had to deal with all these very strong forces. And it's kind of like taking the lid off and all this Pandora's box was pouring out. But as a 35 year old, who'd been trained as a warrior, who'd done years of spiritual practice, he combined that child-like openness with an adult-like stability. And he stayed rooted and focused and grounded in the present moment here without moving, unwavering, unwilling to let greed, desire, anger, fear somehow push him this way or that way, agitate him, catch him, move him. He sat still. And so it's that combination of child-like openness and adult-like stability that then allowed the Buddha to become enlightened that night that he sat under the Bodhi tree. So the city of stability is a very important part of Buddhist meditation practice. A kind of unwavering stability, a rooted stability. And restlessness and anxiety, restlessness and regret are what makes it very difficult to have that stability. But to learn to have that stability, to learn to have that anchoring in the present moment allows us then to have a productive child-like openness to our experience also. So that combination I think works really well together. So those are my thoughts today about the hindrance, the fourth hindrance.
