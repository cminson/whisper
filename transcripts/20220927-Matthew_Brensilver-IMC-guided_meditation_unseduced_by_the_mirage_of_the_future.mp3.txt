 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good morning. It's morning. Good morning to you all. It's sweet to see the names. I know a lot of these names. You all are YouTube chat famous at this point. Yeah, very sweet. Okay, let's do that whole meditation thing. So, just sense in what you think you're supposed to do when you start meditating. Anyways, you force yourself into a kind of slot of one kind or another. Let's just see how natural we can be in these first couple minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We can be trying to prove something to ourselves, to the teacher, to the Buddha, to someone. But you don't have to prove anything in your practice. Thank you. And so we relax, truly relax. And if tension remains, we let it remain. But we relax the energy that turns us into a project, the energy that turns us into the project manager. We sit together. And maybe it's skillful to highlight some phenomena with the attentional spotlight, breath, body, sound, darkness behind your closed eyes. But we attend, not in a kind of brittle way, not attempting to prove anything to ourselves, we attend knowing that the ingredients of waking up are more present. And we might imagine. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To try and prove something to ourself, to another, entails that we fixate ourself. We subtly image in a sense of who we are, of a kind of trajectory of where it's all going. What will be when we get there, or what we will be if we don't. We kind of sandwich ourself in time, the dizziness of time. But we don't have to prove anything. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is the Unsaduced by the Mirage of the Future. It's true the future is coming, but it never comes exactly in the form we imagine. We never arrive in that moment. When it does come, we realize that wanting is always different than getting. And so we say, enough. This is good enough, safe enough. We surrender into the bottomlessness of the present. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Phenomena, many are egoically titillating. But we don't need to spin out into the outer orbits of egoic machinations. If we can just absorb the body blow of phenomena, just this, pleasant and pleasant. It can just stay. Resting back in the openness of awareness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
