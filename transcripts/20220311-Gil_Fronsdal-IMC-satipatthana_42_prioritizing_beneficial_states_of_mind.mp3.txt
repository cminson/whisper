The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
Hello and warm greetings for our time together here with the practice of
mindfulness. As the practice of Satipatana, the practice of mindfulness
deepens, there becomes a shift that arises because we develop a reference
point that tends to be very different from how life is usually lived.
In daily life it's very easy for the mind to be racing around in
thoughts to be pushed around by our feelings, desires, aversions. To have
mind thinking can have stress connected to it. It could have unethical
thoughts, inclinations, all kinds of things that can be that are not
necessarily for our own well-being. And some way or other we learn through
meditation, not some way, but as we deepen in the practice, a reference point
of a mind that's possible to be peaceful, a mind that's possible to be
spacious, non-reactive, that feels harmonious, that feels like a valuable
place to come home to, to rest in, to be with. A mind that is not stressed, not
pushed around by the emotions and desires and aversions we have, but the
mind that can see it all, recognize it in a way that's does not cause by any of
it. A mind that doesn't cling to anything, but sees everything. And when we have
that reference point, when we see that difference, then we know something that's
valuable. We know what direction to go. We know where to rest the mind, or what to
prioritize in the mind. That to go back to picking up the resentments that we were
simmering about, or the fantasies we were kind of lost in, is a diminishment, or as
not the best place for ourselves to rest in, we know something better. It's not to
be just necessarily dismissive or, or aversive towards certain states of
mind, but it's just we know something better. If you're walking down the road
on a rainy day, and there's a puddle of mud ahead with your clean new shoes, we
know that it's probably a little bit nicer to keep the shoes clean. And so we
walk around the puddle and don't get mud on it. It's that simple. So as we sit
today, and today we'll just most sit now and I finish speaking in silence, but see
if you can find, either through memory or through some hints or some clear
connection, a reference point for a state of mind that is beneficial, is valuable
to rest in. A state of mind where thinking does not become obsessive.
Thinking becomes calm and quiet. Maybe even thinking becomes unnecessary, because
there's a state of peacefulness, or ease, or calm, or openness, clarity, non-reactivity.
That state of rest for the mind. So whatever it might be for you, some reference
point, and keep that reference point close by. Kind of lean into that place.
Support that. Allow it to grow. And as you're breathing perhaps, breathe with
that reference point. And as you do so, two things might happen. One is that you
might, that reference point, that place, that reference state of mind, might grow
and develop and help the mind become more at home and settled in calm. And the
other thing that might happen is that you can't do it, but you begin to see
clearly what it is you're doing that maybe interferes with, or is the
direction that's going, something that's going the different direction. You learn
about your tendencies of mind and habits of mind. And as you learn about
yourself, things that are taking you away from that reference point, and no need
to be upset, no need to be critical, learn the art of seeing that clearly,
peacefully. So with that, I propose that today we'll just sit quietly with no
preparation. You've heard a lot of me for these months, and we'll sit quietly
and then I'll say the final words of dedication at the end.
Thank you.

And then as we come to the end of this sitting, if you look back at the last minutes of the sitting, what states of mind
have been prioritized by your mind or by yourself?
has a mind been in charge and taking you down the highways and byways of thoughts, ideas,
reactions? Or have you taken charge in remembering to relax into a beneficial state,
staying in touch with, staying in contact with, a place of peacefulness or calm or openness,
a state of mind which is not centered on thoughts, but rather is open at ease.
What switch has your mind prioritized? And might it have been possible for you
to have more prioritized tuning in, being attuned to the place where the mind is peaceful?
And one of the advantages of doing this is that the peaceful mind is the mind through
which it's easier to have non-reactive goodwill, a love which is generous but not needy,
a compassion which cares but is not troubled. So as we come to the end of this sitting,
with whatever love you have that's generous, compassion you have that cares but is not
troubled, whatever goodwill you have that is easy and peaceful, to dedicate the benefits from this
sitting, the learnings from this sitting, the reference points that we've learned,
to dedicate it for the welfare and happiness of others, to wish and hope that whatever we
gain is shared with others, shared with the whole world. So it's not only us that benefits,
but through us the world benefits. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe.
May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may we have a state of mind
from which we can contribute to that as a possibility. Thank you.
