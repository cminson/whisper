The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Settle yourself in and make yourself comfortable.
It's okay to move if that's helpful during meditation.
And letting go of all the words, the written ones, the spoken ones, the heard.
And just settling in.
Perhaps remember or evoke the sense of a person or a being who's easy for you,
spring's joy has brought benefit.
Or a being that inspires you in some way.
Picture them or imagine them nearby.
And tap into your appreciation for them.
Any warmth, caring, gratitude, love.
Notice those feelings in your heart and your body.
Allowing any warm feelings to grow.
And allowing your awareness to expand through your whole body.
From your face to your feet.
Notice and acknowledge the range of feelings that are there.
Giving preference, though, to noticing lightness, tenderness, joyfulness or warmth.
See if, like your breath, those feelings can expand.
Perhaps even riding on the breath.
Throughout the whole body, heart-centered belly everywhere.
Perhaps you might allow an intention for loving-kindness
to emerge from the movement of the breath itself.
For the deepest places of you, your core.
Letting breath and intention together or separately.
Move through your being like a bellows.
Radiating.
Blowing through every organ, every muscle, every cell of your body.
Out through your nose or mouth or heart or even skin.
Allow the rhythm, the intention of kindness to grow.
Lift off of that being.
Let it live inside of you.
Imagine it like the clarion call of a trumpet or the gentleness of a summer breeze.
Moving through the body, mind and heart.
And when you're ready, aiming that love, that kindness, that warmth, straight out in front of you.
Allowing it.
The sound of a bugle.
The power of wind.
Suffusing everything in its path.
And gathering it back in.
Allowing it to blow, to move, to fuse out through your back behind you.
If you like, you can clarify it with phrases or words.
You know them by now.
But you don't have to.
Only if it helps.
Be well, safe, ease, joy.
Letting the rhythm grow, the rhythm of kindness.
Now shifting directions again.
Sending kindness to your left.
Allowing it to pervade, resonate.
Blow through and around everything in its path.
Allowing it to move through the mind and heart.
Shifting now to the other side.
The bellows of your kindness.
Shifting now to the other side.
Shifting now to the other side.
Now letting that area of loving kindness expand to all around you, above and below all sides.
Filling every part of your being, allowing it to fill the room as far as you want it to go.
Nothing left out.
You're floating in a huge bubble of love and kindness and warmth.
Allow it to expand out to and through all beings.
Near and far, known and unknown, seen and unseen.
And let go and bask.
Relax, soften into the moment.
Receiving your whole experience.
Allowing it to move through the mind and heart.
And as we close this meditation, perhaps reflect,
we resonate with one another's sorrows, difficulties and joy.
Because we're interconnected by this wish, all beings want to be happy, avoid suffering,
be at ease and content.
By opening our hearts, we transform ourselves and every life we touch in some immeasurable way.
We appreciate your generosity in cultivating an open heart.
