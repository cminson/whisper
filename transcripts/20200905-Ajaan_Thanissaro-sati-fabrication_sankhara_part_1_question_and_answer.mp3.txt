Tanajan, there's a question here. 
So you said that the fabrications can be seen in the context of the first, second as well as the fourth noble truth. 
So in context of the first noble truth, we have to see how do we see the different fabrications. 
Are we to divide them into the five aggregate groups or should we see them in some other way? How are we to comprehend them? You can do them either in terms of the five aggregates or in terms of those three fabrications. 
Both of the frameworks are useful. 
But you know give me an example. 
What are you suffering about? So normally when we think of the first noble truth, I think most common for people at least is the second second aggregate which is feeling. 
So most people feel pain. 
So the feeling of pain is what normally is associated with suffering. 
But I'm thinking maybe the form aggregate might be births which is listed. 
But it's not normally thought of as suffering. 
Anyway, it's still something that one should one has to train oneself to see it as suffering. 
And then maybe some sort of bodily pains that are to be seen as bodily fabrications that are coming under the first noble truth. 
How do we see that? How am I supposed to divide out my experience to find out okay this comes under the first noble truth? Okay for example you have a pain. 
Now there's some pains where you don't suffer from them. 
Right? For example someone's giving you a really deep massage and it's painful. 
Oh it feels good. 
Even though it's painful. 
But because you know there's you have a perception that this is going to be good for you. 
Whereas with other pains you have a perception okay this is this is you know creating this is going to kill me. 
This is what happens when you're meditating you know and your leg goes numb and your mind starts engaging and you know this is I'm going to go get paralyzed and we'll be able to walk properly. 
This is going to be bad for my health. 
I mean you can create all kinds of suffering around that simple fact of physical pain. 
Because when the Buddha is talking about the pain and the first noble truth it's more mental pain as opposed to physical pain. 
And then you want to analyze it into okay is there a physical component here? What about my perception around that pain? That John Mahabuha has very good questions he should ask herself you know does this pain have a shape? Does this pain have an intention? You ask yourself you know what are the perceptions I have around this pain? Why is this correct? Why is there a bridge between the physical pain and the mental pain? And it began to realize that perception seems to be the big instigator. 
If you can perceive you know that your awareness is one thing and the physical pain is something separate then there is no mental suffering. 
So perception would it be right to say that perception is the one thing that can help that is that is required correct perception or skillful perception is the one that required for comprehension. 
I'll give you an example. 
I was in Singapore one time and I was taken to a Chinese doctor who was going to treat my back and I had he couldn't speak English I couldn't speak Chinese I had no idea what treatment he was planning. 
And so I had me lie down in my stomach and he started rubbing oil into my back which felt nice to begin with and then he started rubbing more and more strongly until my skin got very raw and then he took these bamboo poles that he'd cut into little wists and started beating on me and I had no idea how much longer this is going to last. 
And the first thought that went through my mind was okay what bad karma have I done? And then I figured wait a minute I've got I've got to deal with this so I don't suffer from it and I began to realize that if I saw the pain as going away as soon as I was sensitive to it in other words instead of thinking of the pain coming at me I saw the pain going away. 
It's like sitting in the backseat of a station wagon facing back and as soon as something comes into the range of your vision it's already going away. 
Now if I could see the pain is going away then it was okay. 
I was able to I was I didn't suffer from the treatment. 
Okay but other kinds of pains and other kinds of fabrications are there which are probably also falling under the first noble truth but I don't know if we can actually deal with them in that same way. 
For example births like we birth is is a I think maybe I would class it under form fabrication but it seems like it's not something we can do much about we're born except that possibly we may be able to correct or maybe control the course in which we may be born in future lifetimes or maybe stop the process and at all to completely in case we have the ability but it seems like that's completely outside our control. 
Okay well the fact of birth may be outside of control but the question of whether you're going to suffer from it or not that's that's in your power. 
It's the again the perceptions you have around this. 
I see so you're still saying that mom and dad why did you force life on me? Why did you make me be born? I see and then mom and dad just saying you wanted to be born. 
You were the one who came in. 
So it would still but I was thinking maybe it would be it would be that one should actually use the fourth noble truths to train the train the fabrication such so that the birth is in a different place or better place or something is that is that you you can do that but you've also got to you're dealing with the fact that you're already born in this lifetime and use the fourth noble truth in order to make the best use out of that birth. 
Okay okay okay all right okay thank you. 
Ken you have your hand erased go ahead. 
Okay hello Tana John. 
Hello. 
I have a two-part question for you related to Ajahn Lee having your rights to his students not to look at the content of the labels but the act of the mind's labeling so my question is from a solid level of concentration I'm having trouble seeing what precedes the mind going out to its object in other words seeing the fabricated nature of the intention just to give an example when I'm sitting in the morning and I hear a car go by it's like instantaneous car or whatever sound I have to hear and I don't know whether I need to go to a that's a question of going to a more you know a higher level of concentration to really be able to slow things down but wonder if you have any thoughts about how to see that that that fabricated intention involved with that. 
Okay it's the best place to see this is going to be in the concentration but as your you reach a point sometimes where you realize so you have a choice between staying in one level of concentration and going to a deeper one and though there'll be a choice at that point it's the the advantage of doing this with in concentration is the things to get slowed down but they're more focused and once you're able to see that you know the moment where you're deciding okay I'm gonna drop this and go to something else and you can do it consciously this is why the Buddha talks about being very conscious about going from one level to another because sometimes we just slip okay and we're not paying my careful attention with them I just it settles down willy-nilly wherever it's gonna go okay okay whereas the Buddha saying if you're more conscious about the different steps then it's gonna be easier to see those steps as you as you do with regular sensory experience okay okay okay that's very helpful the second part of my question from a solid level of concentration I can see the allure and the drawbacks of the labeling the stress the subtle stress that's involved and from the drawbacks that they that the act of labeling is not worth it and beginning to experience I say beginning to experience a feeling of disenchantment with it but it feels like a huge step from moving from the disenchantment to dispassion says cessation just keep doing it okay get used to it because part of it is also that if it's when you really see the allure and you see how stupid the allure is that's when you're like oh okay okay okay okay thank you Olivia go ahead unmute yeah thank you for your talk so there was something intriguing about this concept of we're going to have the five aggregates and craving right now and so there might be some that are more skillful than others and I've been experiencing a lot of craving for meditation craving for renunciation and it seems hypocritical like it's I recognize that this process of craving and yet it's to remove craving but I wondered if you could speak a little bit more about how to discern when there is when it is this kind of a skillful motion versus the mind sort of co-opting mental state I'm craving and craving for the path is perfectly fine in other words it's it's the only way you're going to get out of your other cravings is to start craving something better and so you don't feel don't feel hypocritical about it just realize good as the word himself said all things skillful and unskillful are rooted in desire and so you want to be able to encourage this the skillful desires because you realize this is this is going to lead us something that really will be good for my long-term welfare and happiness and you what you you want to encourage that now it's only after you've started mastering some of these things that you can start saying well these things have their drawbacks as well I want something better that's when you move on so you crave the path as much as you want and don't feel hypocritical about it and then there will be some natural point where letting go of the raft or right any stage of the raft will right yeah looks like you know there's that far aside cartoon where you know the cows are standing around eating grass and one of them jerks their head up wait a minute this is grass we've been eating grass as long as grass tastes good keep on eating the grass and then somebody realize hey well this is grass and you move on thank you I don't thank you so much in the beginning you mentioned the raw material for fabrication is past actions so I kind of took it as a that's probably the fundamental level that's where the causality is but sometimes if for me to in my practice understand fabrication deliberately are there anything that you would suggest in grasping the origination of these fabrications okay in terms of your raw material you're going to be pretty much getting what you know you don't have much choice over the raw material that's being presented and so you want to look for the origination in the present moment it's okay what what is my desire right now what am I looking for how is my desire shaped by my intentions how is my desire shaped by my perceptions are my perceptions setting me so setting me up for something unskillful or kind of should I change the perceptions I mean this is one of the reasons why it's good to read in in accounting because the word it gives you so many alternative perceptions for looking at things you understand a particular situation in light of one perception say what I mean I've been holding on to this perception it has no relationship to reality or at least it's very you know it's getting it's making me do something unskillful I should change my perception around this so there's a deliberate yeah there's a deliberate intentionality there isn't right right right yeah I see Maria also can you hear me yes okay try to find you oh you see me now I'm just checking to see if something that I'm doing matches what you just taught us so one of the things that I do is I try to observe in myself if ill will or judgment some negative state mind state is coming up in me and if I notice that that's happening that's a flag to me that I have wrong view that I'm looking at the situation with a destructive point of view and so that flag is a it's a flag to me that feeling of hostility or negativity towards the person or anger that's a flag to me that I have the wrong point of view and I need to raise my level of consciousness and and challenge my perspective on the situation to have a more objective compassionate point of view and when I can do that then I can recognize what would be a better point of view to see this situation from and it helps helps me let go of the anger and the hostility right now what you're trying to describe the right right yeah that my view is what's creating the perception so I have to change the perception by choosing a different point of view right and you can you can play with the different perceptions or different thought fabrications you think think of it in terms of fabrication what would be a good perception what would be a good line of thought around this I know some people say well this doesn't the same so artificial I said well the whole process of fabrication is artificial to begin with it's just that some fabrications are more habitual they seem more natural as a result but we can step back and come up with new ways of fabricating around the situation that are just as true and actually more beneficial so the way that I look at that is that my point of view is often very self-absorbed and a small and myopic and just my personal Maria Balsamo point of view and when I recognize this is happening within me I can ask myself the question what would a wiser more objective divine being how would they see this situation I asked myself that question I often get a different answer than my point of view and I try to adopt their point of view like what would the Buddha think of this how the Buddha might see the other person perhaps that person is the politician they know more about that politician than than I do they might know more about the state of what they know than I do so that helps me recognize that my point of view is so narrow and small and then I try to get a broader point of view a more objective wiser point of view yeah yeah here this is where it's helpful the Buddha has a concept because we call safeguarding the truth where you ask us I mean these things that I believe on the basis of what do I believe them you know if there's hearsay reports I mean most most of the internet is 99% hearsay you hear something and if and it fits with a view that you already have again that's not necessarily proof that it's true there's an analogy that that seems to make sense to you again that's not proof so you realize a lot of the things that I that I really believe are true I may not have a really solid foundation for that so it helps to sort of pry you loose a little bit to begin with and secondly you're saying if an arhat we're looking at this situation the arhat would not be suffering so I have seen not looking at the sit with the same eyes as an arhat how would an arhat look at this and that and then you're so good there must be a way to be in this situation and not suffer I say Jeff and Arita morning John I'd like to clarify for myself just what you've said and the other participants have been saying I'll start with you this comment if you don't question that you're eating grass you're going to continue to eat grass right right so would it be safe to say if we're following the Buddha's path and we're feeling some kind of stress we're still eating some grass that's the starting point yeah and then so from the point where I am to at least stream enter I need to be evaluating then what are my perceptions how are my perceptions continually putting me in this suffering and so it was my question so where is the focal point of any moment where's the compass of that directional that this is causing me suffering like I don't know stream entry yet so I need to to navigate through it's still me doing the fabricating yeah so I somehow have an evaluation that this would be better you know X would be better than Y or Y would be better than X so without getting caught up in the the overall identity that's me how am I knowing that I'm heading in the direction of this is a better choice you know why is a better choice than X versus I'm just circulating through my identity well you have to ask yourself in which what state of mind would would inspire you to take one choice over another if you can clearly see that there's it would be anger or it would be lust or some unskillful mental state that would incline you to choose X over Y it's okay I better I better avoid X now if you can't see any distention between the two then you basically flip a coin and then try it out try out one of the others and see what the results will be so presumably I'm you know generosity is solid virtuous solid I'm meditating so then the choices through the day would would then become which do I think would be an even more skillful and beneficial course of action right right really subtle I'm gonna go read some down more I'm gonna meditate a bit more something like that so then another question with that is you mentioned that the Buddha the Buddha said if you're defining yourself you're limiting yourself is he speaking of limiting ourselves is another form of identity that's we'll get us into the be the craving becoming cycle is he asking us to see where where we can step out of those identities but to what like or or where are how to know a more subtle limiting identity versus a course that one it's kind of plays into how do I know that that I am headed in the direct you know the correct direction I've been traveling a while it seems pretty good but nothing's really I'm not seeing any subtler shifts okay with the Buddha wants you to focus more on your actions and on the question of identity just put the question of identity aside as much as possible the only identity that you need in order to practice is the identity one that I am capable of doing this too I'm the one who's responsible for my choices I'm responsible I'm capable and yes I do want a higher level of happiness I want a more secure level of happiness that's those are the only aspects of identity that you that he really recommends and anything beyond that he's just just don't think and don't think thing in terms of question of your identity yes so much as well this course of action that I want to do what are the results going to be focus more and more on your actions than on your sense of energy on your sense of who Jeff is you might look at that article that just came out on Dhamma talks is called clinging on the end of clinging okay yeah yeah I mean which which talks about how the Buddha of the various forms of clinging the Buddha's has no cling to habits and practices just cling to skillful habits cling to skillful practices as your main as your main source of clinging as you're on the path there was another question but I'm going to set it up okay fine apology tana John so the next thing that I'm asking about is fabrication in the context of the second noble truth you did mention that this is fabrication occurs in three contexts sort of first noble truth I asked earlier but I'm now thinking in context of the second noble truth again normally the way I think is okay what kind of cravings do I have are these sensual cravings or are these cravings for taking on an identity but I'm not very sure if it is even necessary for me to divide it up because the Buddha does say one should know the diversity in in fabrication so I'm kind of wondering how I would even think about the diversity in fabrication in the context of second noble truth or do I even need to do that okay here you're more you're more interested again in the question of what is a skillful desire as opposed to what is an unskillful desire okay okay okay so so skillful desire to meditate to maybe do walking meditation that's a skillful desire but to do say something else that may be very wrong to do maybe like killing or something that kind of thing is an unskillful desire okay and in terms of the fourth noble truth I think I understand that the whole path is a fabrication right but the question there that I had is of those it seems like the verbal fabrication seems to be coming first if I'm not wrong instead of bodily fabrication it seems like the verbal because the Buddha seems to put right speech first and also in terms of concentration the first thing that comes is directed thought and evaluation so it seems that verbal fabrication comes first and then the other things follow along is that right yeah I mean right view is basically for a verbal fabrication right result is a verbal fabrication okay okay thank you Pradeep thank you thank you for offering this very much appreciated my question is regarding the element of subjective value value judgment that you spoke of and the element of the time slowing down and I'm trying to understand if the deeper one is going in one's concentration practice is it a sensible way to think of this as the deeper you are in concentration the quicker and more deeply in your mind you are able to learn and cultivate a specific way of fabricating a particular state that you want to cultivate be that love or beauty or compassion and the reason why I'm asking this is let us say that one is in the context in in the wider life where it's harder to access a skillful state of fabrication then it is it probably better to not practice a lot of concentration in the first place because you might be wiring yourself in a more unskillful way is that okay my attitude generally is except for people who are psychotic more more more concentration is better okay because you're you're getting quicker at seeing things are going on in the mind you know sometimes you hear that people say that you know they've done studies that show that the mind the brain has made a decision before you're consciously aware of the fact that the decision has been made and that that's the argument that you know that basically that the brain is kind of a slower part slower brain is faster than you are basically and I found that when you do concentration practice you were actually speeding up your ability to see when those decisions are being made and that's that's all to the good because you want to you want to catch those decisions while they're being made rather than after the fact yeah okay that makes that makes sense I guess the clearer you get the quicker your subjective value judgments would catch any any wrong direction that you were going in and then right just shortens the feedback loop okay super helpful thank you cuz there's a there's a tendency of the mind to make a decision then pretend it didn't make it yeah we had it we had a dog back in the monastery in Thailand who in the evening would when the monks were having the things that are allowable for monks to eat would come and sit at you sit at our feet and and if we if we didn't offer anything to it it was scratch scratch your leg and then you look down and it would look away pretend pretend that it hadn't scratched your leg and I saw my them that's the human mind is so much like that beautiful thank you Pritvi during the day can you hear me sorry during the day when you some of your actions are when one of your actions is appreciated or you notice that others like I'm finding it keep coming to your awareness during later in the day how to handle this one or is it when you're acting itself we have to look care look further you're looking for any appreciation and cut there or is there any way you can control that one okay you have to be able to see these things in real time as much as you can so that you can catch yourself you know when what your reaction is what your reasoning is before a particular for a particular action and the more quickly you can see that the more you understand okay this is why I chose that action when it went away it was not my best interest and you can check and then you understand it a lot more easily because if you try to go back and reconstruct the event again your your your perceptions may be getting in the way your self-image may be getting in the way there are lots of things that prevent you from actually seeing it in you know as it actually was so you want to see it in real time as much as you can and how to not get take pride from it when you keep acting skillfully or when people appreciate and don't get pride from it how to do that because you said you could you ask the question again I couldn't quite hear you if people appreciate then automatically the pride is coming and how to stop that pride coming ah we have to ask yourself these people they're praising me what do they want out of me that was always a John Fuen's message just watch out for the people who are praising you they want something out of you thank you I don't see more blue hands I'm just curious if there's anyone who is raising your physical hand in zoom and you can do that too there's a blue hand okay so much Michelle please go ahead you can unmute okay thank you that's my son's name that's confusing he has so many zoom classes my question is a lot of my suffer I feel it's from one is from desire and some is from compassion for example I have a very difficult diagnosed that I'm trying to control my emotion I might not live long and I'll show my son is five-year-old so I was trying to think oh maybe it's a good thing for him right so as a young age that was good big challenge so I'm trying to like get away from this maybe a fabricated truth that being a good parent means with him you see what I'm getting at so you can speak more so please okay okay this is where you have to tell yourself that it's not necessarily the number of years you're with him it's the quality of the instruction and quality of the training you give him and so you want to make sure that you embody good values and you teach them good values and you'll be able to remember that so you know however much time you have I mean in some ways you're lucky that you realize the time is limited so you got you have the impetus to want to make make the most of it to teach them good values about being an honest person being a good person you're trusting in his trusting in his best intentions and always doing it always doing you know what trying to always do the skillful thing and noise develop goodwill and compassion for others then if it turns out that you know that the diagnosis is correct that you don't have that much time with him you know that's that's that would be his memory of you that the good things that you taught him because I mean and speaking in terms of that you know the number of years that's the best that any parent can do for a child any of this is good values to the child so it's suffering okay when it's coming from compassion I think a compassion that's like I think I appreciate my parent were being able to be with me while grow up so I felt sad that he might not like aside my own decide of being a good parent to be with someone and also on the other side is thinking oh he will visit I feel sad because of compassion right so yeah I don't know like the compassion cause suffer but so this is the suffer good like and it's the clinging you know I cling to live that's why I try to take care of myself better so it is kind of craving good if I don't cling I don't you like if I feel oh this is fine he's gonna be fine and you know it's a good challenge for him anyway and then I feel this sort of become cold like you know so this everything's very conflicted in my case in this case that breaks perfect sense that you should do what you can and only stay alive as long as you can but isn't the main point of Buddhist teaching at least in the tradition that I was surrounded was in in China is to like don't don't cling for life right like life is all emptiness you know like these are these whole things fake you know it's not fake I mean the suffering is gonna be real yeah you should tell us okay I want to make the most of my relationship with my son and so you know whatever I can do we know within the realms of what's for its virtuous I'm willing to do that in order to stay alive to help the son but you're also have to have part of the mind it says okay if it happens I have to go I have to learn how to be okay with that too this is when the Buddha teaches the Brahma for hearts it's not just equanimity there's good will compassion empathetic joy equanimity you develop all four you don't say well equanimity is the highest so I'll just go for the highest you have to have all four so you've got good will for your son you've got compassion for your son you're happy to see him happy to see him happy but then there's equanimity that this is what every parent has to develop whether without a diagnosis like yours which is okay that there will come a time when we have to part ways and at that way if the time comes I have to be okay with that you know otherwise you're gonna start just hovering around your son after you die right yep that's very helpful and we had a there was a woman student of my teacher after after my teacher died she she had raised two sons after the second son was born the husband left her so she had to raise the sons alone and the first son was bright athletic personable good-looking you know the ideal son and the second son was kind of dumpy and you know born your guy and it was the first son who was killed got a motorcycle accident one time and and it was killed within 10 minutes after he left the house and she started having a sense that the son was still hanging around the house little signs here and there and so she came to me one time she said kind of keep the body at the monastery because there's a belief in Thailand as long as the body has not been cremated the spirit has that's kind of a locus and the spirit will still hang around I said please let the boy go it's a miserable life to be hanging around like this and so she finally agreed to have the cremation and then that was the end of the signs that the spirit was still hanging around so when the time comes to go he said okay I've got to go there it says no there's something better for me to do and learn how to be okay with that but in the meantime you know for out of good will and compassion for your son you know get whatever medical treatment you need that you think that will that would be helpful should I prepare my son to like how do I like yeah I don't know should I prepare my son to get ready for this well to whatever extent you feel that the diagnosis is true yes you should let the son know that your mommy may not be around all the time but these are things mommy wants you to understand to hold on to even when mommy's not around okay any last questions before we stop for the stop the morning session yes Tom John you have a question regarding the simile of the archer wonder if you could clarify something the straw mound the straw man or mound of clay is that the first John I'm being able to see and constantly stress and the first time what is the straw man so that you can go on and hire John is it's unclear to me okay the straw man is not the important part it's the skill is not firing firing rapid shots counted accurately accurately and also doing in quick succession and piercing great masses that's the important part okay so then then you can go on and use that and your concentration right that ability okay right that would be something like that thank you Michael thank you I just wanted to share one of the models that works for me very well in my meditation practice over the course of the years has been particularly when examining talking about fabrications and understanding them is because we're all inculcated and you know there are so many so social cultural ways that we have been mentally constructed the house actually as a model works for me during my meditation to actually be able to see exactly how my mental confabulations are actually put together and it's a good it's a house basically and I look at the construction of the house and see whether or not when I am able to identify the pieces that actually construct the house whether they're actually well constructed or not and if they're not then I remove them and I wind up disassembling the house that I originally got to perceive and construct something that's much more valuable and equanimous okay thank you okay one last question all right hi Tenogen hi oh I had a bit of a fall on like being a parent and kids and being attached to your kids your friends or teachers or whoever does that make it it seems like there's so much suffering that like you can't help it like it just happens but there's there's so much pain that like the one is saying that suffering comes from those who are dear it's really really true right right well this is this is this is my equanimity is the hardest thing for parents to develop and also the most necessary I know and it doesn't get easier as the kids get older I know I know 80 year old people we know with 40 50 year old children and they still you know it's they still see the child as it was that that little lump that was first born yeah we can't quite hear you Bob I should put a headset on now we can hear you though it's hard it's hard to work on but something that's really necessary to work on and then you think like in this life I'm a parent but maybe I wasn't before or maybe the next life not well you've been parent I don't know how many times yeah we've been all of it right right but yeah like certain people like you know you say like my daughter is asking me like you know why is the board you know was a born here I'm like you chose to be born here you know the best of it yeah it seems like monks can be so free they can go off as people practicing they just let go of those connections and focus on their practice but other of us are okay well just just just work on it realizing that every relationship is gonna have to end at some point and so in the meantime what good can you give the other person so that their memory of your relationship will be a good memory and it will have had a good long-term effect on them right that's the best thing that's the best thing yeah okay well break for a couple hours we'll meet back here at two o'clock our time and we'll see you in the next video.
