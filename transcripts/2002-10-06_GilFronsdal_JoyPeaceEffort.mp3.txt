 So the idea of being reminded now of temple cleaning and monastery cleaning that I did in Asia kind of evokes for me the atmosphere of peace that for me was very prevalent in these centers and these institutions in the Japanese monasteries and Thai temples monasteries and Burmese and they were kind of permeated kind of often with the feeling of peace. Even sometimes the town or the village area around was chaotic and noisy. There was a feeling of kind of serenity and settledness in the monastery itself. And some of it of course I think had to do with people meditating there a lot and the meditation bringing an element of calm and peace. But I think it's more than just a meditation. I think that the whole focus of Dharma practice is one that's helping people to free themselves of their agitation, their inner conflicts, outer conflicts and to settle the mind, the feverish mind that we can have sometimes and help us find how to live with a heart and mind which is peaceful at ease. And I think it's not so easy to find that. It's easy enough to kind of go and spend a day at the beach and feel it. But to find sometimes but sometimes it's not. But to actually have a practice that engages with our inner life, with our mind, our hearts, with the conflicts that might be there, the fears that might be there, the difficulties that might be there, the memories that might be there and find some way to be with them, work with them that brings us to some kind of peace. And not just any kind of peace ultimately but ultimately maybe some very profound lasting sense of inner well-being and peace no matter what is going on around us. So yesterday I did a class here, a day-long class on the Dhammapada. The Dhammapada is a text which is often quite loved by Buddhists of Southeast Asia and now around the world. It's an anthology of poems that were gathered together that somehow express the Dharma or at least the who ever compiled it expressed kind of their sense of the Dharma or their vision of the Dharma. It could be argued that it's kind of a little bit of a one-sided view of Dharma practice but often Dharma expressions are one-sided because they're often being offered as a balance to something. And I'm very fond of the idea that in Vipassana practice traditionally we're looking at five different factors that need to come into balance. And that's faith, some confidence, some heartfelt involvement with the practice, energy or efforting, endeavoring, some kind of endeavoring. You can't just read a menu or recipe. I guess some people find satisfaction reading a recipe but you have to cook at some point otherwise you'll starve. You have to put the effort in. And then the third is mindfulness. The fourth is concentration or relaxation, some kind of sense of inner integration of the mind and heart that lets us be centered on ourselves. And the fifth is wisdom. And so different times we might focus on these different elements and give a talk on one or the other. Demapada in some sense has a flavor of two of these, I think. It has a flavor of endeavoring, of energy and effort and it has a flavor of concentration in sense of peace and relaxation of being centered. And then it has a third flavor which is not in this particular list of joy, of delight. And these three things is kind of what I want to focus on today a little bit, mostly by reading from this text, Demapada. And hopefully you'll enjoy it. If you've never read the Demapada, then you're being introduced to what's considered by many people one of the great religious classics, pieces of religious literature coming out of the world. And over and over again in the text you find an emphasis on joy and delight. And there's some expectation of those people engaged in practice, engaged in the Dharma, would come to find joy and delight in it. There's a wonderful line in the text talking about where the word for delight or joy has the same pronunciation as the word for joy. Joy, delight, the same one as the word for to drink. And so there's this expression where it says those who drink the Dharma or those who delight in the Dharma. And I like it that both meanings are there because to delight is the same thing as to drink. It's kind of to quench your thirst, but also it's something very physical. It's kind of like you enter into it or something you actually tangible quality that you take into yourself or enter yourself or is kind of a physical event within you. Not just an abstract thing, you know, of the mind and ideas and inspiration, but something very kind of of the body in a sense to be drinking, to drink, to delight in the Dharma. There's one verse in the Dhammapada that goes, if by giving up a limited happiness, one could see an abundant happiness, a wise person would renounce the limited happiness to behold the abundant one. So you have this idea of if you see a difference between a kind of minor form of happiness in your life and you see the possibilities of great happiness, wouldn't if you're a wise, wouldn't you then choose the bigger one, the larger one that which brings you greater joy and satisfaction in your life. And I know in my own life I can very easily pursue something for all kinds of reasons that only has kind of limited joy and delight for me or satisfaction or peace or contentment or whatever it might be. And sometimes I can sacrifice a greater sense of peace, delight, ease in my life in the pursuit of something which doesn't, you know, it's certainly worthwhile to pursue, but doesn't give me a kind of deeper sense of satisfaction. And here it's suggestion is that a wise person would not do that. Buddha in saying this, I would suggest, is saying that Dharma practice is something that provides a very great sense of joy and delight, not directly, as some of you know. Sometimes it can provide you with the opposite because what you're encountering when you practice Dharma is yourself. And sometimes we have to wrestle with ourselves, or we face our demons and facing our demons is not always easy. But ultimately there's, there's with time, I think it's a tremendous sense of joy, satisfaction that comes from nothing else, for knowing that you're really being honest and facing the truth. I think it's a story I've told of one of my early Zen teachers, that he was captivated by Zen practice himself as a young man. When he sat in Zen meditation, which sitting, I think maybe he was really kind of a gung-ho kind of guy, maybe he was sitting full lotus and sitting upright or whatever, and not moving for 40 minutes. And he said he had, the first time he sat there was excruciatingly painful. But it was the first time in his life he felt he was real, that he really had contact with something real. He was so much living in his head, and in fantasies and ideas and ambitions and all that, that he really felt he never really had contact directly with life itself. And his vehicle to that contact was through that pain. I'm not recommending that. But part of the joy of Dharma practice is a contact with what's real. And that could be, you know, it doesn't have to be painful of course. But to be able to leave the world of our fantasies and conflicts. So to be able to pursue an abundant happiness. A monk, a monastic, who with a peaceful mind, for a monastic with a peaceful mind, who enters an empty dwelling and clearly sees the Dharma, there is superhuman joy. The idea of entering an empty dwelling, both as literal, and that is often a place to meditate, is a place that's uncluttered and very little things to distract you. Just entering a peaceful, quiet, empty dwelling to meditate. But also at symbolic value, of meaning entering a kind of inner sense of dwelling, kind of dwelling with a mind. With a mind which is not cut up in all the worldly concerns you'll be cut up in. Not that those worldly concerns shouldn't be pursued and be engaged in, but the mind is not caught by them. When I went to set my longest retreat in Asia, in Burma, I set an eight month retreat, an eighth month of silence. And as I was sitting there during this long period of time, after some time, I recognized how often thoughts of my life I left in America, the people I knew, the work I had done, my status in relation to other people, my concerns with other people, my friends back home, what they thought of me. And I kept cropping up in my mind. And my mind was cluttered with all these things that are now an ocean away. And it wasn't like I thought it was bad to have some of these concerns, but I thought it was unfortunate to have a mind which was captive by it. Captivated by them. That it was kind of pulling me around. I kept going there and being obsessed by these kinds of concerns. And I made a vow to myself that I wouldn't go back to America or to that environment until my mind was free to preoccupation with them. So I have in a sense an empty mind. The mind is capable of not being preoccupied. So a monastic with a peaceful mind, and clearly sees the Dharma there is superhuman joy. It's a very powerful expression, superhuman joy. But some joy, Dharma joy is for people who haven't experienced it, a very deep joy of meditation. It's really something, it's really incomparable to any kind of joy that, at least I had experienced until that time. Even the great joy of personal success, or the great joy of being in a loving relationship, or the great joy of looking at a sunset, there's all these great joys that I had experienced. Even the great kind of rapture that can come with sexual pleasure didn't compare with the deep joy or delight or happiness that I experienced in deep meditation. And the beautiful thing about it is that it's so closely connected to being at peace. There are forms of joy which are quite almost agitating. But the deep joy of Dharma practice has this very deep peaceful quality, stillness as part of it. And so you find in the Dhammapada a lot of discussion about people being at peace. The practitioner is finding peace and being calm. And finding a kind of peace where inner peace that's really stable, has a kind of inner stability to it, where the person is not going to be pushed around, knocked around by what happens around them in their life. So for example, Mara is the personification of all the kind of forces of temptation in the world. So becoming a person who will not be overpowered by Mara like a stone mountain unmoved by the wind. So they end up being a stone mountain, solid, stable, this big triangular base. The wind blows and just doesn't move. That's contrasted to being like a weak tree bent in the wind. It's having this inner peace that will provide that. Another image of someone who has this deep peace and calm is for someone who no flood will overwhelm. Through effort, vigilance, restraint and self-control, the wise person can become an island. No flood will overcome. The flood of passion, the floods of craving, of hate. I had a friend of mine recently who was going through a very bitter divorce. And he went off and did some Dharma practice and tried to get some inner stability and calm and arise from loving kindness. And he said, oh good, I have it made now. I can go back and be non-reactive and just deal with this. And I think he was back home for about 12 hours before it all erupted again in a terrible way. That just made the whole thing worse. He was overwhelmed by the floods. Virtuous people always let go, always practice letting go of things. At least the inner life lets go. They don't prattle about pleasures and desires. What does prattles mean? I mean I wrote that, I translated this. But it has a different connotation than talk, right? If I said don't talk about pleasures and desires, he said what's wrong with talking about it? But don't prattle. It's worse than chatting, isn't it? It goes on and on. Do you want to be around somebody who prattles about pleasures and desires? Touched by happiness and then by suffering. Who isn't touched by happiness and suffering from time to time? The sage shows no sign of being elated or depressed. So it isn't that you're supposed to, you know, so whatever happens to you, there's kind of a peace, an inner peace of stability. That good things, bad things, difficult things, joyful things happen. And it doesn't affect your moods. You go up and down, get depressed with how things are. The beautiful story of the same teacher of mine who found as a young man his pain in Zen meditation, so captivating and propelled him into a career as a Zen practitioner and then a teacher, tells also as a young man being so inspired by Zen stories. And one story that really inspired him was the one of, I think it was Hakowin. Or anyway, I think it was Hakowin's being an old little village priest in Japan who was a priest, you know, he was an older guy, older man living in the village and in his temple and a neighboring teenage girl or a girl in the village got pregnant. And the parents were furious, you know, how could you have gotten pregnant? And they said, you have to tell us who the father is. And she didn't want to say who her lover was. I don't know for what reasons, but she didn't want to say. So she blamed the village priest. The village priest is the father. And so the father of the teenage girl went then to the priest and said, how could this be? And you did this and here you have to take care of the baby and you're the father and all that. And the village priest monk said, oh, is that so? They took the baby and then took good care of the baby as he could, loving care and just offered all this. And after some days or some weeks, the girl was so distraught about the baby being gone and what she had done. And so she went to the father and said, you know, I have to tell you who the real father is. Maybe if I tell you, you let us kind of get married or whatever, let's bring the baby back. So she told and the father then was so embarrassed or so distraught about what he had done to the village priest, blaming him for something he hadn't done. And so he went and apologized and asked for the baby back. And the village priest, oh, is that so? So this idea of not being, you know, here you're being blamed for something terrible. The monk is supposed to be celibate and probably his whole reputation is being challenged here and not being elated or depressed by this. Just, oh, OK, he's accepted that. One more thing. I don't know how wise the priest was, but in that story. But, you know, the gist of the story, I think you can certain level of equanimity. You know, there can be there can be unwise letting go and equanimity. I'm not saying this story was, but, you know, I'm sorry if I tell my stories. Only so many things happen in my life, you know, I have a small repertoire of things to talk about. But when I when I was 20, I I was a hippie hitchhiking around the country with this girlfriend of mine and we were visiting communes and. And, you know, it's like being cool. And I had this attitude of just everything was fine. Everything's fine, man. Nothing was going to bother me. Whatever happened is, you know, was fine. And so I was kind of this way for a while. And then and then my girlfriend lost her flashlight somewhere. I think we forgot at someplace, you know, last place we'd been and or whatever. And my attitude was, oh, it's all cool. It's all fine. And she was furious with me. Again, because she thought it was. And I think in some ways, justifiably so, because I think being kind of relaxed and letting go and not being caught up or, you know, afraid or not being agitated or by, you know, something like losing your flashlight or whatever. Doesn't have to translate to not going looking for it. You know, so I would just like, just let it go. You know, just let's just go on. But you could be relaxed and at ease, but still, OK, you lost your flashlight to help you go look for it. So the idea of being calm. Another another. Oh, let's go. Another expression of this kind of being a common piece that's pairs in the Dhammapada is someone for whom there is no fever. And we use the expression in English, right? When you're filled with fever, fever of anger or the fever of lust, the mind is agitated in some way. So to have no fever in the mind, the mind is settled and calm. The senses calmed. The senses calmed like horses well tamed by a cheer you tear. Calm in mind, speech and action and released through right understanding. Such a person is fully at peace to be at peace. But here's another one, you know, kind of like the priest. This is ancient. This is an ancient truth. This is not just for today. They people find fault in one who sits silently. They find fault in one who speaks a lot. They find fault in one who speaks in moderation. No one in this world is not found at fault. So watch out. If you expect to go through life and have no one ever criticize you for anything at all. You're going to suffer. There has been, there is no, and there will be no person who is only criticized or only praised. So if that's the case, don't let praise and criticism be the cause for you to get agitated. Very powerful expressions here sometimes. Cut down, cut down attachment to yourself. As you would in autumn, pluck a lily with your hand. Pluck it off very quickly, going to snap it off its stem. So snap off, cut off attachment to yourself. As you would in autumn, pluck a lily with your hand. Cultivate the path to peace. And the nirvana taught by the well-gone one. Even though dharma practice can bring a lot of happiness and joy, you shouldn't be attached to it. When desire flows, pleasure arises in people. Attached to happiness, seeking enjoyment, they undergo birth and old age. That further suffering comes with being attached to your happiness, even dharma happiness. But they who delight in calming their thoughts, who are always mindful and always cultivate a focus on the unpleasant, this refers to Buddhist practice of using unpleasant or the unbeautiful or the foul aspects of life as an antidote for attachment. If you're attached to beautiful things or physical bodies, other people's bodies, then you focus on the unpleasant as an antidote so the mind can be at peace and cool. So you find yourself in the fever of sexual passion and sometimes it's nice and sometimes it's just a drag. Then they have this practice focusing on unpleasant. Delight in calming their thoughts are always mindful and they're the ones who will make an end to craving. They are the ones who will cut Mara's bonds. Peaceful in body, peaceful in speech, the monastic, he was peaceful and well concentrated and who has rejected the world's bait is called one at peace. Rejected the world's bait. Today walking here on a driveway, there was a Sunday chronicle that was laying there waiting to be picked up. It was wrapped in an advertisement, which often is, I guess, when it's delivered. It was an advertisement for target. Because you know, because it has a target, target. It doesn't have to say anything, just see the target and everyone knows what that means. All it said on this whole big front side of the paper was, inwardly happy. So I was glad to see that inward happiness has now become a marketing device. And so the world's bait, you know, advertisement, that's bait. I mean, that's the whole point of it. People pay a lot of money to try to bait you. It's all around us. Someone's trying to bait us. If they weren't trying to do it, they wouldn't pay all those money. They're trying to get your attention. So the world's bait, are you susceptible to advertisement? None of you, I know, of course. No one wants to admit it, of course. But the world, and of course there's a lot more other things besides advertisement that gets our attention. They were hooked and the mind gets agitated. Peaceful in body, peaceful in speech, the monastic who is peaceful and well concentrated and who has rejected the world's bait is called one at peace. The person who is calm and at peace is also one who is happy, this kind of deep dharma happiness. It's also someone who, who in the tradition has said, you can't quite, I don't know if I understand them as the right thing, but, let me read you the poem and then you see if we can make sense of it. As with birds in the sky, it is hard to trace the path of those who do not hoard, who are judicious with their food and whose field is freedom. As with birds in the sky, it is hard to trace the tracks of those whose attachments are destroyed, who are unattached to food and whose field is freedom. So somehow the idea is that when you're really free, when you really have deep peace, that you can't track that person, you can't trace the person. Often we understand a person or can see someone when we're seeing as their attachments the things that drive them. And someone who is deeply at peace is not reactive, there's no reactivity by which to understand them. You can't track them or trace them or see them by how they react to the world. They leave no traces. When they speak and when they talk, when they act in the world, there's no traces for what they do. So for example, if I... I can't think of a good example. If I saw that Chronicle, Sunday Chronicle, we don't get the Sunday paper in our house anymore, but I could walk down there and see the Sunday Chronicle and... Oh, Chronicle, I need to get that. It's really important to have the Sunday paper every day. And I come here and I sit and meditate and I kind of sit the whole meditation thinking about how important it is. And after all, I get these great advertisements as part of it. And so I've been caught by that. And so there's a trace in my mind of that. Not simply I was caught once, but there's a continuation through time of that desire. And that desire then leaves a trace in my body. Or if I get angry, you know, I can be angry and be clean, it's done with once and for all. But it can leave a trace. The anger lingers in some ways, in my muscles perhaps or in my psyche in some way. There's a trace there. Someone who, for whom is at peace, there's no traces in that way. There's no reactivity that lingers for them. And so when you encounter that person, it's kind of like encountering a person for the first time. Perhaps there's no traces of any reactivity towards you from the past. They're seeing you as if they're new for the first time. And that's kind of, you know, my ideal in a sense when I meet with people in interviews is, you know, I think it's best to meet people as if I've never met them before. Of course, I have, many people. Maybe that's the wrong way of saying it, but to try to really meet the person as if I'm seeing the person for the first time. Because people change and there's new, you know, I don't want to have the old ideas of who they are getting in the way of who they might be at that particular moment. And so, you know, to really meet them fresh and new and not have traces in my mind of who I think they are. I don't know if all that makes sense. Did it make some sense? So the flavor of the Dhammapada is a flavor of joy, delight. It's a flavor of peace. I think the flavor of peace comes across stronger in the text, peace. The other flavor that comes across in the text is endeavoring, making effort. And it comes through probably more strongly than the others. That someone who's involved, for this text that people compile this, someone engaging in Dhammapad practice is really making effort, endeavoring really seriously and earnestly. And it's not a complacent approach to spiritual life. It's not about just resting in some kind of dharma. And for nothing else, it can be making serious endeavors, whatever effort it takes, to find that peace or to safeguard, protect that peace. You know, all of you, I suspect, have some familiarity with some degree of being at peace or being calm. At least in relationship to how you can be. Right? You know, less agitation than usual. A very interesting question, spiritual question to ask yourselves, when you're in a state of relative calm or peace, is when you start losing that, why are you sacrificing it? For what are you willing to sacrifice your inner happiness or inner peace? And really grapple with this. I really encourage you to look at this and question this and ask this over and over again. And use that transition from some state of calm and peace to not having it, and asking, why am I sacrificing this? Why is it more important, when I think I'm doing now, than my state of peace and happiness that I have? So you can try this as you leave here, today. Perhaps you stay somewhat calm from being here in the morning, until you get in your car. And you might notice that as you drive your car, the agitation or the speediness or the tension, some kind of tension built up, might not be much, but some, then you can ask yourself, why am I sacrificing my peace now? For what? To get home quickly? Is it important enough to get home quickly, or you get to your next event quickly? Is that important enough to sacrifice your inner peace and well-being? Are you that unimportant, that your own well-being can be sacrificed for getting fast home? And I know for myself sometimes I can feel this tension in my body as I drive a little bit faster than I should. Why do that? So that principle can be applied in all kinds of situations. For what? So to make serious endeavors, efforts at this kind of investigation, to really be engaged in it. There is no spiritual life, I would argue, without some kind of effort. The topic of effort is a big topic. Maybe next week I can talk about effort. But it's, you know, without some kind of making some effort. Once we talk about effort, we also talk about choices we have to make. You have to make a choice to make an effort. Choose one thing or another, certainly a choice to make this kind of effort over, not making effort, or a different kind of effort. If you leave here now, and you do some exercise, I told you, you have to make a choice to make that exercise, as you drive, or whatever, when you notice. And that choice has to be before making the effort. One of the key choices, or evaluations, that goes into our choices, that's in the back of the Dhammapada, this early Buddhist tradition, is the dichotomy between whether something works or it doesn't work. Does it work in helping you become more peaceful, or does it not work? Does it work in making you more happy or not? Does it work in making you more concentrated, or more loving, or more compassionate, or does it not? Very, very simple dichotomy. Does it work or it doesn't work? It's such a basic human concern. Does it work or does it not work? This kind of dichotomy is something we expect in our lives. And what you find in Dhammapada is this logic, in some form or other, does it work or doesn't work? This dichotomy between two choices appears over and over again in the text, between being virtuous and being unvirtuous, between being agitated or being calm, between being caught by the world or free of the world, to be lazy or being diligent, having your senses unguarded, to guarding one's senses, protecting oneself, safeguarding oneself at the senses, to be truthful or to be not truthful. And very simple dichotomies appear in the text. And the one that I'm least comfortable with in the text, that is probably the most common dichotomy in the whole Dhammapada, is that between the fool and the wise person, over and over again. It talks about the fool and the wise person. So if you have these two dichotomies, what works and doesn't work, the fool as one follows what doesn't work, and the wise person is the one that follows what works. And the way I'm uncomfortable with it is now suddenly we're talking about people. And it seems very limiting to put people in one camp or the other. We're all a little bit of both, aren't we? We both have both aspects in it. It seems like a big gray area. And there might be foolish behavior we do and wise behavior we do, but to actually categorize someone this way or that way makes people a little bit uncomfortable. I'm going to read this text over and over again that says, you know, the fool and the wise person. But I think there is ways in which we act foolishly. I think, you know, that it could be said that perhaps that if you leave here today and you decide to rush to go to your next event, and that rushing makes you much more tense than you were, that could be said to be foolish behavior. A wise behavior would be somehow to safeguard your inner well-being, your calm. If it's really important to get somewhere quickly, then do it quickly in a way that preserves your inner sense of well-being. You can't really sacrifice that for anything. So... I'll end with reading four verses from Dhammapada. And some of these things I'm talking about today are playing out in these verses. The emphasis on dichotomies, choices we make, delight and joy, peace. The word peace doesn't appear when I'm about to say it. It does appear. All we experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind. Speak or act with a corrupted mind, and suffering follows, as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of the ox. All we experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind. Speak or act with a peaceful mind, and happiness follows, like a shadow that never leaves. The centrality of the role of the mind, of ourselves, how we act, the intentions and quality of our mind, taking responsibility for our mind, interactions, is all embedded in this little verse here. Our mind is central. If anything qualifies as the beginning of the Buddhist scriptures, it's these two verses. And many people have commented on how that contrasts with the beginning of the Christian Jewish Bible, where the focus is on God being at the beginning. And here for Buddhists, it's the mind that's the beginning. You yourself are the beginning of the spiritual life. All we experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind. Speak or act with a corrupted mind, suffering follows, as the wagon wheel follows the hoof of the ox. This burdensome ox, heavy ox, working so hard, carrying this painful burden in the back. The burden follows so directly and so tangibly, so heavily. All we experience is preceded by mind, led by mind, made by mind. Speak or act with a peaceful mind, and happiness follows, like a shadow that never leaves. Shadow has no weight. It has no traces. It doesn't cause any damage. It's very light, the wonderful light and joy of peace that just follows lightly, no burden. And then the emphasis on effort. Vigilance is the path to the deathless, the deathless being the deepest state of peace that's available, deepest dimension of peace that's available in the present moment, the peaceful dimension of your consciousness, of your awareness, that's present right now. It's here, actually. A peaceful dimension. It's called the deathless. In English, maybe we would say the timeless, the timeless present. Really, in the timeless, it's the people's come out, very peaceful, calm, timeless moment. The ancient Buddhists called this the deathless. Vigilance is the path to the deathless. Negligence the path to death. The vigilant do not die. The negligent are as if already dead. Knowing this distinction, vigilant sages rejoice in vigilance, delighting in the field of the noble ones. Absorbed in meditation, persevering, constantly energetic, those steadfast ones touch nirvana, the ultimate rest from toil. I love that last verse. The contrast between making all this effort, hopefully it's peaceful effort, but making all this effort, leading to a goal where toil, and toil being this kind of burdensome effort, tiring, an exhausting effort of life that we sometimes find ourselves in, is put to rest. Do not give yourself up to negligence. Do not be devoted to sensual pleasure. The one who is vigilant, absorbed in meditation, attains abundant happiness. So you've been introduced to the Dhammapada, an ancient text, a famous piece of world literature. And I hope, my hope in reading these verses and talking about it, that to some degree you've been able to touch for yourself, be inspired for yourself, in your capacity to be happy, your capacity to be peaceful, and your beautiful capacity to make the effort for that purpose. May it work for you. Thank you.
