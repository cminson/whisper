The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Good morning everyone on YouTube. My name is Niki Margafori and
this morning for the Sunday morning talk,
I'm subbing for Gail. Gail is teaching a retreat this morning.
And also I'd like to make a couple of announcements.
One is that the next two Sunday morning
sits and talks will be on Zoom and
the address will be available on the IMC calendar.
And Max Erdstein and Matthew Brensilver will be teaching the next two weeks.
And the other announcement I would like to make is that Gail will be giving a talk
tomorrow at the Monday evening sit to address the current events around
racism, black lives matter, and police brutality.
So with that, I'd like to invite us to sit together.
And I'll do a lightly guided sit this morning.
So arriving, arriving in your seat, wherever you're sitting,
landing, landing comfortably,
in your cushion, your chair.
And letting the breath, letting the breath move through the body.
Each moment a new arrival, each moment a new breath.
Each moment this magic of this unexpected life moving through you.
Not the same as the moment before.
So meeting the newness, meeting the freshness, instead of, oh, the same old, same old.
How can we meet this new breath, this new moment of feeling in the body?
Or the sense of awe?
Fully present.
As if fully present for the birth of the child.
Thank you.
And allowing there to be a settledness, a presence, maybe even embracing a sense of
ease, if there is any in the body noticing, noticing any resistance as well as if there
is any connecting with. And if you notice any resistance anywhere, that's okay too. Notice
if the resistance can be held, as being completely valid and holding the resistance with care.
Honoring whatever is arising in this moment, whether it's resistance or its ease, not turning away.
And opening up to and sitting with whatever is arising this moment. Sitting with, breathing
with honoring. And notice what might happen if you turn towards instead of turning away.
What might be tight or challenging and turn towards it with ease and openness to deeply
listen to whatever is happening in this moment in your body.
And if there are any thoughts.
Plans, emotions, memories. Also meeting them, meeting them with presence.
With stability of groundedness of this body, not turning away, not pushing them away, perhaps.
A different way of being, with whatever arises. Finding enough strength and stability in the
body.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Having a sense that you are not just sitting alone on your own this morning or whatever the time zone might be.
Feeling the presence of many others.
Sitting, practicing with you.
Meeting. Meeting what's arising in this moment.
Meeting.

Both, what is showing up and how are you showing up with it, just dropping the question.
Let's see what comes up.
And whatever answer comes up, not chastising yourself, but becoming aware of what is happening
in this moment.
Let's see what comes up and how are you showing up with it, not chastising yourself, but
how are you showing up with it, not chastising yourself and how are you showing up with it.
Is it possible to choose to show up with just a little more awareness?
Just a tiny bit more embodiment, feeling the body, feeling the feet, the hands,
the breath, just a little more, is it possible?
Is it possible to show up with it, not chastising yourself?

And in the last minute of the sitting
Can you show up with kindness for yourself
No matter what arose or did not arise during the set
Just as simply meet it with kindness
Meet yourself with kindness
Meet yourself with kindness
Meet yourself with kindness
