The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So again, a really warm welcome to everybody.
A really warm welcome.
The welcome is warm, even if the weather may be cold.
There are parts of the continent or other continents.
So one thing that I heard in a drama talk years ago, I don't even know how many years ago, that has some really stayed with me.
And I've seen it turn out to my own practice in my own life. This saying that I heard that was like really intriguing.
And I didn't quite understand it, but it made me feel curious.
Like, wow, I'm not sure what that is, but it sounds like something I'd like to learn more about or know more about or have experience about.
And this was from Gil Fronstor.
And he said, you know, with practice, it's not so much that our problems, all our problems will be solved.
Even though, of course, that's all that we wish.
Or when we all come to practice thinking that there'll be some benefits, including solving some problems.
We have this. So it's not that everything will be solved.
But it helps things to be dissolved, dissolved.
And I thought, I don't know what that means to be something to be dissolved.
But it sounds like it's different problems, you know, to be dissolved, aren't problems anymore.
And so since then, I'm happy to report having many more years of practice under my belt now. I'm happy to report that I do have this experience and hopefully many of you do too.
So we might have this particular idea that how things to be solved would be a particular outcome of how to solve it.
And this terrible boss at work. And how can I make my boss behave better? And we think that that's going to solve the problem or how can I get another job?
That's another way which can solve the problem.
But maybe these problems don't get solved so much, but they get dissolved, which means maybe the boss stays the same.
Maybe the job stays the same. But the problem is drains out.
The same activities, same behaviors, but somehow it's not a problem.
Maybe it's a little bit uncomfortable. Maybe it's not, doesn't match our preferences, but it doesn't have to be a problem.
And we start to see how we assign this label problem to things. And then we have a particular relationship with it and I have to solve it. It must be a failure on my part because this problem has arisen.
It's due to something that I did or didn't do or have to take care of. And this whole barrage of responses arise as soon as this label problem gets assigned.
But I don't want to be a Pollyanna and I'm not saying there aren't difficulties.
What I'm pointing to here is that our relationship to these same activities can shift.
And this is what practice is about, helping us first even see that it's our relationship, right? The same boss, somebody else might think it's fantastic.
The same job might be great for somebody. So it's not inherent in the boss or the job or whatever it is in our life. It's a problem.
Our partners are savings account or what, you know, so many things are living situations.
But with practice we have to A, see that the problem isn't inherent in whatever the other thing is out there.
B, start to see our relationship, start to recognize the role that we have, the relationship that we're creating.
And maybe C, to see that there can be a different relationship.
We're not stuck in this, even though it might feel like it at times, but practice is to help us to see, oh yeah, there can be a different relationship.
One in which that isn't a problem.
As I said, maybe some comfortable doesn't match my preferences, but maybe it's become so familiar. Oh yeah.
The boss is doing their thing. I know that they do this and then I start to feel that and then they do this. We're doing this familiar dance. Okay.
I know because I've seen this so many times that this is just how we are and it's just doesn't have to be such a problem.
We can expand our capacity to be with things that are uncomfortable.
Okay, I'm uncomfortable.
This has a beginning, a middle and an end. It'll end.
So in this way, the problem this drains out some way that I would use to what to go from Stalford said, rather than being sold to get dissolved.
And it wouldn't be happy hour with Diana if she didn't bring in a poem by Rosemary Traumer. I just love this poet. She's fantastic.
Here's her way of communicating or here's her here's Rosemary Traumer's way of expressing this idea.
This poem is really short, just three lines.
One eventual path. But maybe I would like to call that diesel or problems dissolved problems dissolved.
So here's here's Rosemary Traumer's poem.
So long, I dreamt of a key.
It crumbles to dust this old cage around my heart.
So long, I dreamt of a key.
Now it crumbles to dust this old cage around my heart.
So practice helps us to see the cages around our hearts.
We don't have to look for the key. We can just let the cage crumble to dust.
And loving kindness practice is part of a way in which we start to bump up against and to feel and maybe stretch a little bit.
These cages that we have around our hearts.
So maybe they don't first crumble to dust, but maybe they shift and we start to see, oh yeah, maybe there's some malleability here.
Maybe there's some flexibility. Maybe they're not as small or maybe some of the bars between the cages are pretty wide or whatever it might be.
So that is an introduction. Let's let's do some meditation practice and we can help these cages around our hearts, dissolve or crumble to dust.
So we'll start with some little bit of mindfulness practice, just bringing our attention, our awareness to the physical sense of this moment being here now.
Feeling into the bodily sensations, including connecting to whatever it is we're sitting on feeling the pressure against the body.
Tuning into is there a way that you can bring some ease to the body while still maintaining some alertness.
So being upright but not stiff.
Tuning into the sensations of breathing.
And just feeling that rhythm the movement of the body associated with breathing.
Thank you.
And then to begin our loving kindness practice.
Starting where it's easy. There's no reason not to start where it's to not start where it's easy.
So bringing to mind somebody some being from it's easy and complicated straightforward natural to feel warmth towards care.
Goodwill, benevolence, respect, whichever word feels like the right word for you.
Love, kindness. This may be a furry friend. This may be imaginary kittens.
Somebody recently sent me some photos of kittens a calendar those photos of kittens.
I can't help but my heart kind of leaps when I see these just adorable creatures.
Or maybe somebody that you know or somebody's touched your life.
Bringing this level of being to mind.
Connecting them.
And then to support the heart and the mind staying this connection staying with this warm this care and this loving kindness.
We can say these phrases.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.

Now it crumbles to dust this old cage around my heart.
Thank you for watching.
Thank you for watching.
And then to extend our loving kindness to ourselves.

May I be happy.

May I live with ease.

Sometimes the cages around our hearts.
They trouble us a little bit.
That's okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This idea of problems getting dissolved.
That's okay.
Whatever the problem is, the object that we're blaming, the difficulties on shifts.
But maybe as Rosemary Chalmers says, this cage around our hearts.
This constriction or this way of only standing in one place, seeing things from one perspective and not seeing maybe a bigger perspective or not seeing from a different view or something.
I'm not sure I do not want to say that this is easy, that it's quick, and that it's aren't real difficulties in the world to be sure.
There are injustices and there are so many things that cause harm.
But if we're always feeling that we have to be solving all these problems and sometimes that can consume our energy and our time and not give us the space needed to see a bigger picture or to have a different perspective or to feel into our hearts and allow the greatest wisdom to arise, to allow our compassion to arise.
But with loving kindness practice, we can, maybe the heart and the mind just get more familiar with coming from a place of warmth, rather than trying to solve everything, but maybe meet it with some warmth instead of trying to make it be different.
So it can be helpful to talk about some of these ideas, maybe some of the ways in which cages around our hearts crumbled to dust, like I wrote my trauma poem, or maybe how the problem gets drained out, or how problems get dissolved, and how loving kindness practice can be a support for that.
How cultivating our hearts can be a support for that.
So I'd like to put you into groups of three or four, and we'll be in a group for 11 minutes, and we just do a little bit of rebalancing here, as some people flee.
Like, I don't know about this breakout room business.
And I say, you know, in the beginning, with my drama practice, it was hard for me to kind of share with others and talk with others initially too.
Okay, here we go.
Okay, so it's helpful when you're in these breakout groups, not to say like absolutely everything you can say, but maybe just say one point and let it go to the next person.
Then they say one point and then they go to the next person and they say one point and then it comes back around to you.
And maybe you have some new idea. So it's less about informing others about what you know, but it's more about getting to the edge of what you know when creating the conditions where you might have a new idea.
Some spark something, a new understanding or a new idea.
So if it's helpful, you can go in the order of the number of characters in your screen name. If you have a really long screen name, including your place and your pronouns, chances are you'll go last.
And if you have a really short one with just your first name, you might go first.
Here we go.
Okay, welcome back welcome back.
Somebody have a comment or question or something they'd like to share.
Yeah, Craig. Yes.
I don't have any kitties but I threw up an adorable creature as my background.
What's the worst name we didn't get it.
This was his name is kind of a funny name. New Cadillac. His father is named new bar and he's a cow horse he's a ranch horse.
And it's what's new Cadillac which all run together supposed to be cute it's called new Cadillac so I just call him Cadillac.
Nice. Nice.
Beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you, Craig. Thank you for sharing that I noticed as soon as you came back that you had a worse background so now we know the name to thank you.
Jerry.
Well, I don't know.
I realize we're at the end of the time.
Folks, but I guess I mentioned at the end of our group was, I like the idea, like I was thinking of a bird cage.
So birds that are in case they kind of like the cage because it protects them from intruders.
And it also at the same time may feel free when they get out but there's a vulnerability there.
And I guess the vulnerability that I was thinking about that came right at the end small group was, you know, one can have this dissolving.
But then I get into this relativism was there anything that's right and wrong.
So anyway, I leave that.
It's nice right that when things stop being the way that we think that they are or should or something then it's little disorienting and maybe like, well wait, wait.
That were things are not the way that I'm expecting them to be.
That's not exactly what you said Jerry but is there anything that's right or nice.
So with a warm heart, wishing you all a wonderful evening.
And if you'd like to unmute and say goodbye until Thursday.
So, thank you.
Bye.
