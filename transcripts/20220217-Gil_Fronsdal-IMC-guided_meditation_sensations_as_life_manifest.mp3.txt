 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. So hello everyone. It's always special when people gather to practice the Dharma, to practice awareness, showing up for this life of ours in a fuller way or deeper way than maybe we can do in ordinary life. Maybe in a way that we connect to more of ourselves, more of this experience of life. But the topic these days in Satipatthana is contemplation of the corpse. And I think it's significant to recognize that the corpse contemplation occurs right after the four elements, the four elemental properties meditation, that just before we're doing these sensations, the living sensations which are a manifestation of being alive, what animates us, it's what fills us in with life. And when we're no longer alive, then there's no more sensations. The body might still exist as a corpse, but it's not animated with the sensations. It's also not animated with awareness. And it's not animated with the depths of our feelings. So there's something about, for me at least, that the contemplation of a corpse that's not animated, consciousness is not in it anymore, highlights awareness, highlights consciousness, highlights our sensations, our animated life right now. It's kind of like absence often highlights things better. Silence can help us hear sound. A blank piece of paper can highlight a dot that a pen puts on the middle of the paper in a way that you wouldn't be highlighted if it was a piece of paper that was scribbled all over. So the contemplation of the corpse, the way it goes, is this too, my body also, one day will become a corpse. One day will decay or be cremated or it will change to something else, the elements of it, the pieces of it. And perhaps this idea that your body one day will be sensation free, absent of sensation. For now, we have sensations and that can be the place where we center our attention, perhaps highlighted and appreciated or valued more knowing. Not only is it temporary just for this lived life we have, but this lived life we have through our sensations, the way we directly experience ourselves, is a river of change. A river of unfolding, coming and going. You hear a sound, like I hear the train right now, train whistle. I can't grab it or hold on to it, it'll be gone. Now it's gone. Comes and goes. Many of the sensations you have, they peer and disappear maybe repeatedly, like the sensations of breathing. One day your body will not have these sensations. This day you have sensations. But they're fleeting and passing. Perhaps you can settle back, marvel at this animated life of sensations. While they're occurring, one day they won't. So, taking a meditation posture. Oh, let's see, my...... Okay, so there we go. Sorry about this. My laptop froze and I thought maybe I'd lost you, but unmuted. And then I forgot to unmute. I think we're back on. So yes, back on. So it's part of this theme of today's meditation, absence, the end of things. Everything will be gone someday. And on this day, the deep experience of sensation or sensate life is meant to help us not cling to any of it, just aware. So settling into your body and your breathing, following the sensations in your body, noticing when they appear, noticing when they disappear. Following the appearance and disappearance of sensations. The appearance of sensations indicate you're alive. The disappearance of sensations is a reminder it won't always be here. And then we'll sit quietly. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
