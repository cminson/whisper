Greetings, everyone.
And we just practiced together.
Cultivating compassion, 360 degrees for all beings. And I asked you on YouTube to put a word in if you like about what's arising for you and lots of beautiful reflections.
And I'll share a few of them, uplifted, joy, happiness, gratitude, hope and gratitude.
Radiating light of metal, 360 degrees in all dimensions. Bring seeds.
Yeah. Humanity.
Thank you so much for these reflections. It's very common, actually, for this practice of compassion, 360 degrees compassion for all beings everywhere.
To have a sense of expansiveness.
To have a sense of lightness, to have a sense of ease, to have a sense of just joy for it to bring a sense of joy and uplift and an expansiveness.
So if any day you're particularly feeling particularly heavy, this is a great practice to do.
To just expand the heart in its care, feeling expansive. And also you can do this practice in daily life as you're going for a walk.
It's so happy-making. If you're going for a walk or if you're going for a drive, every being you pass by, you share your kindness, you share your goodwill, you share your compassion.
Imagining, yeah, just like you, them too. Just like me. Just like me, they suffer. Just like me, they have challenges. Just like me.
May they have ease. May they have all the resources they need. Just to expand the heart. Otherwise, the mode we tend to operate in, all of us human beings, is, again, evolutionarily, this is what we have.
It's our bequest. It's what we've gotten is a sense kind of being in our own mind, in our own world, thinking about our own problems and our own me, me, me, me. It's just the way that evolutionarily we run.
So if we do this practice for all things everywhere, we tend to become less centered in some good ways, not to be, for our perspective, not to be so narrowed all the time.
We have to consider our lives and our problems and our issues and yes, yes, of course, we are our own primary concern and it's absolutely appropriate for this being who is me to be a primary concern for me.
And yet, sometimes our lens becomes far too tight, just focusing on me, me, me, sometimes it's poor me, why me, oh again me, oh, and instead we can expand.
We can really expand, oh yeah, all beings on this planet, all beings, yeah, we're on this planet together and with Earth Day actually and the timing of the Earth Day today doing this practice together also has, for me, had this sense of oh yes, all of us together on this Earth together.
May we have ease from the suffering, from the pain and suffering of climate change that impacts all of us.
So, different few things I want to share with you today.
One of them is to come back to the word boundaries as we talked about yesterday and I do want to expand that a little bit.
And, and before we go there, there's one other thing I wanted to say about this, this last category, this category of all beings. So, so just a review that we have been practicing in concentric circles starting with ourselves, then the benefactor, dear friend, the neutral being the person we had entanglement with challenges
with which was yesterday and then all beings. So, so with the all beings category, of course, all of these categories are included in all beings all the, as I brought in towards the end.
And it is helpful to, to acknowledge that. And there are different ways that this practice is done today we explored two ways very briefly, and given that we had a YouTube glitch earlier it became even briefer.
One way is directionality.
So, traditionally it's to the north and south and east and west and, and northeast and northwest and all these directions and up and down is expanding.
It could be the eight dimensions or, or sorry, six, six dimensions or it could be eight dimensions around you, or in front of you behind you. So there are different ways to do this.
And also can do this with categories and you can go through categories in your mind, all babies, all adults, all adolescents, all two-legged animals, all four, just so many different categories, all birds, all ducks, all fish, et cetera, or even finer categories.
There are many different ways to do this practice in order for the mind to not numb out, to not numb out and say, oh yeah, all beings, wow, that's, I don't even know how to get there, but you, you, you play around with it.
All, all crickets, may they be well. See, I know whatever categories you can be playful with it too. However, be careful not to get overwhelmed because it can be overwhelming like, wow, so many categories.
And the mind can become a little too full. So if that happens, then it's best to just lean into the shining of this light of goodwill, just resting with the light and just letting it shine, the shine, the shining of, of the goodwill.
And again, as review, but just to keep this in mind that the practice of compassion is where kindness meets suffering. So if we're practicing compassion, there needs to be an acknowledgement of challenges, but without falling into it, without it becoming empathic distress.
And talking about empathic distress as a near enemy on the second day, I believe, of this week.
So, but it, but if we're practicing compassion, there is an acknowledgement of suffering of, of a being and holding that with care and love.
Instead of just, just metta, which is goodwill, which is lovely imagining the being in a neutral state, but, but here we do touch into the suffering.
And again, with climate change, it could be quite easy to imagine, yeah, this being is impacted in ways seen and unseen, or any other way.
So, but be careful not to fall into grief and fall into empathic distress, because that is not helpful. That is a near enemy.
And it's also not pity, which is a less that.
So let me turn.
And actually, this last day is a perfect day to talk about boundaries. So I mentioned this earlier, but the culmination of this practice, the practice of the Brahma Viharas that let's talk about compassion specifically as we were cultivating in this week together.
So as I mentioned, the one of the tests mentioned in Visuddhimaga, the path of purification manual, which is the thousand page practice manual somewhere behind me there.
In this manual, one of the quote unquote tests that is or the test for this practice is, as I mentioned, is if you imagine in the olden times, if you're in a carriage, and in the carriage, you are taken, you know, the bandits come, thieves come and stop the carriage.
And in the carriage, there's you, and there's your benefactor or dear being.
And there is your neutral person. And there is the person you've had challenges with.
The four of you are present.
And the question is, which of you are you going to give up? You have to, in your heart, think about which you're going to give up.
And if you've practiced this to its culmination, to its fruition, if you've practiced the compassion to its fruition, when you consider, when you think about, you know, whom I'm going to give up myself while my life is dear,
but the person I have challenges with, actually, no, no, they're, they're like me, I love them as much as I do, again, not condoning actions, but there's a sense of common humanity.
So this is called dissolving of the boundaries, this practice, this test, because then there is no, there is no boundary, there is no boundary.
So there's dissolving of the boundaries, there's the, the, the boundaries essentially dissolve.
That's the culmination of this practice.
So now coming back to this work in the Western psychological canon, boundaries, you have to have healthy boundaries, etc.
I can, I can see the idea that that can be helpful.
And yet, maybe there's another word that in our, for me, I'll just sharing for me can is more helpful.
And for me, when I think of the word boundary, there's a sense of, oh, yes, there is a wall, and I have, I'm, I'm kind of weak.
And I'm like, oh, okay, just, you know, there's like a tall wall, I'm defending myself, like, don't, don't, don't come here is my boundary.
Whereas the way that I've seen the practice of metta and compassion for me have really shifted and changed this idea of actually having healthy space, healthy space in relationships that may not be helpful or supportive is this sense of,
as I was describing to you today, or, or inviting you to feel into it.
This, the strength of the, the compassion, the strength of, of this light of this, this, this strength, this power, this uprightness, there's a, there is a fierceness that cares about oneself and it cares about the other being.
So it's like a force field, it's like a force field of compassion.
It's like, yes, I care about myself so much that, that, yes, you can be around, you can, it's not that I'm creating a wall between you and me, but yes, you, but out of compassion, not out of hatred, not out of fear, I'm not putting up a wall.
But there is a sense of you cannot hurt me, there's this force field of compassion, I care of self compassion, I care about myself so much, and I care about you so much that it's not that, that this force field is invisible, it's not this boundary that you're putting up.
So, so for me, this works better.
And also, it's aligned with, with the culmination of this practice, which is the solving of the boundaries.
So I can put up boundaries and solve boundaries at the same time for me as a practitioner, it doesn't make sense.
But this uprightness of fierce compassion for me and the other person that we've been entangled with, it, it, it's out of love.
It's, it's giving us space, giving each other space out of love, not out of hatred, not out of fear.
It's a different way, the impact, maybe the effect, maybe in some ways, similar, but she feels very differently.
It feels very differently.
It's not avoidant, it's not pushing away, it's more upright, and it's very loving, it's very full.
I've explored both of these before, and this feels just so much more nourishing.
So I invite you to explore this and see if it works for you. This, this is something that works for me, and I've discovered in my own practice.
So, dear practitioners, it's been delightful, it's been a joy to, to practice with you this whole week.
Thank you so much for your practice, for your cultivation, for your dedication for this beautiful community.
Thank you. May you cultivate compassion for yourself, for all beings everywhere.
May all beings be happy, may all beings be free, including ourselves.
Thanks everyone, and maybe see you at happy hour, come to happy hours at 6 p.m. California time every weekday. See you then, take care, bye.
Thank you.
