 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone and welcome. And as an introduction to this meditation, we discover that often when we sit down to meditate, that the mind has other ideas, that we are concerned with things, that we have a mental tendency to fixate on certain kinds of thoughts, ideas, concerns that we have, and that the simple act of coming back to focus on the breathing can be challenging because the mind has other ideas. There's this strong tendency to be focused on the concerns or focus on the distractions or the fantasies or whatever it might be. And sometimes the mind, when it's focused on its concerns, can be locked in. Sometimes there can be a strong force in that direction, and the mind is not soft or in a receptive, relaxed way because it's concerned about something. There's energy in it. And so one of the things that happens in meditation is softening of that kind of fixation of the mind or preoccupation of the mind, the energy that's so directed at our concerns that sometimes it's locked in. And there's a softening of that, a yielding of that, a quieting of that, a stilling of it that happens. And without that quieting and softening of it, meditation is a battle to come back to the breath over and over again. And sometimes it adds more tension sometimes because of the struggle between these two forces. But if we understand that part of what we're doing in returning to the breathing and focusing on the breathing is helping the mind begin to soften the grip of those concerns, soften its tightness around its energy, its forceful directedness at certain concerns and preoccupations or even with the thinking itself. And then it might be more easier not to have this a battle, but to find a supportive way and a helpful way to support that stilling softening of the mind so that we can stay more focused on the breathing without that being fixated, without that being tight. And so one of the ways to do this is to, of course the mind will wonder off in thought, is to be very careful how you begin again with your breathing, how you resume the focus on the breathing. It's important not to jerk the mind back or forcefully put the mind back or to be critical and upset with the fact that the mind wondered off in thought and is preoccupied. But rather to find a way that's actually pleasant, believe it or not, a pleasant way of returning to the breathing and being there. That the very movement of returning or beginning again or coming back to the breathing or letting the breathing come back into awareness feels like an enjoyable movement. It's like a tai chi move that just feels so beautiful or it feels like it's very graceful. And so that even so much so we look forward to that movement of returning. And so that the very returning to the breathing then can contribute to the softening of the thinking mind. And then we come back and we do it over and over again and slowly the thinking mind relaxes. Sometimes it relaxes because we relax the thinking muscle. Sometimes we can actually quiet a little bit the thinking just to calm it down just intentionally. Sometimes it's just the fact that we're not reinforcing it by continually pouring our mental attention into it, our energy into it. It stops being fed and so it's quiet down. Sometimes with time our ability to say focus on the breathing improves, not because it's a forceful attention, but we've learned to have this kind of steady, committed attention to the breathing that where the interest now becomes stronger to stay there than it is with the distractions. So, and the softening of the mind, quieting of the thinking mind and relaxing of it and settling of it, is, brings us to a place where we can abide, we can just dwell, we can kind of rest with awareness. Rest and awareness rest with the experience of breathing or be stable in it. And that begins opening up new dimensions of mindfulness meditation, dimensions of the insight, because we're not, because we've kind of cleared out enough of the veils of thinking so we can be more settled in the present moment with direct experience. So, in this meditation, maybe you can have some focus on this softening of the mind, the thinking mind, softening, relaxing, quieting, stilling, and part of that is how you return to the breathing. And maybe, however often you wander off, be content that now you get to practice this returning, starting over again in a, you know, in a looking, experimenting to how to find a nice way to do it. So, assuming an upright meditation posture, and maybe a little bit, if you sway back and forth, twist your body a little bit, just gently, as a way of physically connecting to your body, and maybe making small adjustments so that you are a little bit better aligned in your body for meditation. And then letting the body come to stillness, and maybe appreciating that stillness more because you moved a little bit. And feeling the experience of eyes, how does your, how does your eyes feel right now? And if you haven't, close your eyes, gently close your eyes and feel how the eyes are different, where the eyes closed. And see if you can soften your eyes, relax them, maybe having the eyes rest in their sockets. Particularly helpful if we are still kind of searching with the eyes, even with the eyes closed. And then gently taking a few long, slow, deep breaths. And as you exhale, maybe there's some way that you can relax the thinking muscle, softening any tension, tightness associated with thinking, almost as as you exhale, the mind settles into the torso, down, as if the mind has a chance to settle into a nice, soft chair and relax finally, to relax after a long day of work, a long life of working. Letting your breathing return to normal. And still, as you exhale to relax the body some more, the tensions of the mind are also often expressed in the body. Soften the belly, soften in the shoulders, soften in the face. And then gently, maybe lovingly, center your attention on the breathing. Maybe with the idea that using your awareness, you will accompany your breathing. And every time you exhale, let go of your thoughts. Or if you can't let go of them, see if you can quiet the thinking mind. Bring a greater calm to it. If you wonder off in thought, see if you can return to breathing in an enjoyable way. And it might be enjoyable. If you don't have a high standard, but be content with doing the best you can. Over and over again, settling into the breathing. Accompanying the breathing with a soft, committed attention. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. One breath at a time. Returning to your breathing. And with the mind as soft as possible. Let your attention rest. Almost like the mind is resting in the rhythm of breathing. As if the rhythm of breathing is like waves moving across the ocean. Awareness rides the waves up and down. Coming and going. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. Floating on the breathing. As you exhale, perhaps softening the mind. Relaxing the thinking muscle. Imagining the mind as a broad, still, quiet lake. Cool, peaceful. As you exhale, letting go of your thinking. Letting them, your thoughts float away off the surface of the peaceful lake. And whatever is not peaceful. Can you for a few moments be aware of that peacefully, calmly? And then to turn your attention, your calm attention outward into the world. To the people you'll encounter today in your neighborhoods, stores, colleagues, family, friends, who you hold in your heart. While you're resting the mind, the kind of, without fixating on anything, be aware of the people of the world, their joys and their sorrows. The ways in which they live in all kinds of challenging ways. And to look upon it all, gaze upon it with the eyes of care, compassion, quietly, peacefully. Gazing upon the world kindly. Offer your care to the world. Maybe through these words. May I contribute to the welfare and happiness of everyone. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. And may all beings everywhere be free. Thank you.
