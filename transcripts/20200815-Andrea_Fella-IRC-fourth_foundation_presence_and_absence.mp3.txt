So, this morning, we'll begin exploring aspects of the fourth foundation of mindfulness.
And I'll talk for just a few minutes before we settle into a meditation about the fourth
foundation, what it represents, and a little bit about how we'll go in today.
The fourth foundation, the phrase that defines the fourth foundation is one abides, contemplating,
observing phenomena as phenomena, ardent, mindful, fully aware, setting aside greed and
distress for the world.
So, phenomena as phenomena, that's pretty big.
The word that is being translated as phenomena in the Pali is dhamma, and that word has a
number of different meanings, one of which is just the simple experience, phenomena.
What's here?
Another meaning of the word dhamma is the teachings of the Buddha, and this is a way
to understand what's being pointed to in this foundation, because the foundation consists
of five different exercises, we could say, that point to recognizing what's happening
in experience using the frameworks of the Buddhist teaching, and so we're encouraged
to recognize experience in terms of the presence or absence of hindrances.
And this itself, just even one section of that piece of the hindrances, sense, desire,
ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt, we're encouraged to notice
the presence or absence of sense, desire, how it arises, how it passes, the presence
or absence of ill will, et cetera, even just one piece of that, the presence or absence
of sense, desire, in any moment of experience, that will be true.
One of those will be happening, either sense, desire will be present or not.
And so again, we could look at this as not to try to change experience, but within what's
arising, we explore the, we explore the experience from the perspective of this frame, in this
case the frame of the hindrances, or the hindrances present or absent.
It will either be present or absent.
So we could, we can think about the fourth foundation as being this kind of exploration,
what's arising, what phenomena are arising, and exploring from these various perspectives.
The five perspectives offered are the hindrances, noticing the presence and absence of the hindrances,
the five aggregates, which are a set of mental and physical processes that the Buddha describes
as how we can, in particular the processes around which we tend to cling, but they describe
the fullness of our human experience.
Again, every moment of experience, these five processes will be working, and so orienting
towards noticing them.
The six sense spaces is another frame or lens that we can explore our experience through.
Sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and things happening in the mind.
Those are the first three.
Then the fourth one is the seven factors of awakening, wholesome qualities of mind that
support moving towards freedom.
This list is often talked about in counter-poise to the hindrances, that as the hindrances
weaken, as the hindrances pass, as the absence of the hindrances are happening, the presence
of the enlightenment factors is more available.
We see as the hindrances weaken, as the hindrances are not present, the enlightenment factors
may be present.
These are wholesome qualities, mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration,
and equanimity.
The fifth category in this foundation is the Four Noble Truths.
This is not a... all of this, all of these are encouraged to be experiential practices.
We often think of the Four Noble Truths as just statements about experience, but they
can also be understood as perspectives through which to see experience.
Is there suffering arising?
Is there suffering?
How is it arising?
Is there suffering arising of it, noticing the ceasing of it, and noticing the things
that move us in the direction of the ending of suffering?
In any moment, suffering will either be present or not.
It will either be arising or ceasing, or perhaps there will be qualities in the mind that are
supporting the movement towards freedom, while inculcating the path towards freedom.
So, all of these, we could say the phrase, one observes phenomena as phenomena, we could
say one observes the dhamma, the Buddha's teaching, one observes the dhamma in the dhammas,
one observes how the teachings of the Buddha are being revealed in our experience.
Yesterday afternoon, we talked a bit about noticing the presence or absence of greed,
aversion, delusion, and in a way, the two lists of the hindrances and the awakening
factors in the fourth foundation kind of teases those apart a little bit more when greed or
aversion is arising, probably some flavor of the hindrances or delusion, some flavor
of the hindrances will be arising.
So, the fourth foundation looks at a little bit more specificity around what's arising
in experience and to familiarize ourselves with it.
Again, the instructions are when there is sense-desire present, when understands there's
sense-desire present, when it's absent, when understands it's absent, and then there's
the encouragement to notice something about how it's conditioned, how it comes to be,
how it falls apart.
And then the seven factors, as greed, aversion, and delusion diminish, as the hindrances
become less prominent, we can notice the absence, and that's very useful.
And in that place of noticing, oh, the hindrances aren't here, we can begin to be curious about
what is here, which is that when the greed, aversion, and delusion fall away, there's
room for the wholesome qualities to arise.
The fourth foundation encourages us to notice the seven factors, but there's a whole range
of wholesome qualities that we can be curious about, the four divine abidings, the Brahma
Viharas, love, compassion, joy, and equanimity, two of those found in the enlightenment factors,
joy, and equanimity.
There's the list of the ten perfections, which includes qualities like virtue, energy, patience,
generosity, truthfulness, wisdom, letting go, commitment, love, and equanimity.
And so what I want to explore today in our practice and our time together here this morning
is the curiosity about noticing whether the hindrances, if the hindrances are kind of
up, that's what we can look at, noticing that side of things.
As the hindrances fall away, sometimes what happens in meditation is things get kind of
calm, it's like, well, nothing's happening, what do I look at now, what do I do now?
When there's not hindrances in the mind, it can feel kind of flat in a way because we
tend to attune to kind of the highs and lows of experience.
But in that place where there's not the highs and lows, there's the opportunity to begin
to be curious about, what is it like for things to be okay?
What's in the mind when there's no problem?
Sometimes this is clear and obvious that there's kind of delight or joy present, but sometimes
it takes a little bit of landing in that space.
Maybe it's patience, maybe it's curiosity, maybe it's kindness, or calm.
Sometimes we begin to get attuned to those qualities, it's like our system kind of begins
to, Michelle McDonnell uses the phrase, acquire a taste for the subtlety of these experiences.
She used the phrase in particular around calm, we acquire the taste for calm, it is perhaps
something we need to acquire the taste for.
To notice the absence of reactivity, and then what's arising in that space?
What qualities of mind?
And so let's settle in together.
Aware of your experience, bodily experience, and remembering how supportive relaxation
is for awareness, for mindfulness.
You can begin by connecting to the body and just allowing there to be a relaxation, maybe
consciously relaxing areas of tension.
And so interesting way to explore relaxing the body is to, rather than trying to do it,
stop this kind of request or inclination or invitation into the mind and body.
And see how the mind and body respond, may the body relax.
After some time of meditation, often our mind is more malleable, more amenable to these
kinds of invitations.
We're willing to show us how to relax, where that perhaps relaxation is available, may the
body relax.
Connecting to your physical body, the experience that's here, bodily sensations, the breath,
whatever feels most natural with this relaxed attention.
That is naturally received.
And if it's useful, orienting towards perhaps the breath or the body.
Thank you.
as the mindfulness begins to connect with experience.
The way into exploring what's happening in the mind is to kind of be curious about how
am I in relationship to what's happening.
And these body sensations happening, there's almost always some mental flavoring in relationship
to that.
We like it, we don't like it.
We think something else should be happening.
No, perhaps it's okay, no problem.
Opening to how we are in relation to experience can help us to uncover things that are going
on behind the scenes at times, as we may not have seen or recognized were happening.
And then that then can just be something else that we notice.
So maybe we notice in relationship to an uncomfortable, unpleasant body sensation.
Maybe we notice aversion and a hindrance of ill will, then we can just know, ill will
is arising, ill will is present.
Perhaps as you allow that ill will to be there, present in mindfulness, present to
this curious attention, perhaps that ill will becomes less sticky, recedes.
Maybe you notice the releasing of that relationship, and maybe you're noticing that things are
okay, that absence of a hindrance or absence of greed, aversion, and delusion.
What's that like, what's the flavor of no problem if that's happening for you?
So many flavors might be there, might be delight, friendliness, might be curiosity and interest,
might be joy even, could be patience, especially if the okayness is in relationship to something
unpleasant, maybe patience in the mind, no problem this unpleasant is there, maybe even
having an okayness around seeing ill will arising, an interesting way that we can notice
both a hindrance, ill will in the mind, and a wholesome quality that is available to know
it, curiosity and calm, holding the space for that ill will, and again there's nothing
particular to do here, just noticing your experience, maybe the little to do to kind
of be curious about the relationship feels to me when I open to this like the mind broadens
and steps back, it's like well what else is here while this is happening, how is the mind
in relationship to what's happening, it just feel like a stepping back, doesn't have to
be an explicit question in the mind, just an inclination to understand or know that relationship
and so just continuing a simple practice of being aware of your experience, perhaps from
time to time being curious about this relationship and the qualities in the mind, the connection
to what's happening in experience, it will be a flavor of the hindrances or the awakening
factors, a simple connection with experience.
In each moment.
learning how to be aware of what's happening in the mind, there's different ways into
that, and when we talked about earlier in the week, kind of beginning to be familiar
with exactly what the body is, the language of the body, that elemental experience helps
us to recognize the kind of distinction between the experience, the direct bodily experience
and what happens in the mind in relationship to it, so the creation of concepts and relationship
of reactions or responses to what's happening.
So we see that the sensation is one thing, the sensation of pressure or heat or coolness,
and the pleasantness or unpleasant is another piece of the experience that's a mental experience
and then the response to that pleasant or unpleasant, liking, not liking, greed orversion, that's
another mental experience and so we begin to tease apart the body and the mind.
This exploration, another way in that was very powerful in my practice is this reflection
or connection to how is the mind in relationship to what's happening.
So there's the experience, again, this is kind of similar to what I was just saying,
there's the experience potentially of a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch or something
happening, a thought in our mind, and then there's a relationship to it.
We like it, we don't like it.
We want it to be there, we don't want it to be there.
So there's this relationship to experience that we can be curious about.
In that relationship to experience, we could say that there's certain relationships to
experience that are kind of more directly connected to what's happening out there.
We like a particular pleasant experience, bodily sensation, we like it, we don't like
it, and there's that relationship to it.
But our minds are more kind of multifaceted than just taking in something from the outside
and responding to that.
Within a context, we have views and ideas, and often there are relationships to experience
based not just on the sensation or what's happening, but on ideas and agendas that we
have.
For instance, in meditation, we often have an agenda.
We have an agenda to get rid of thoughts.
We have an agenda to allow pleasant experience and to watch unpleasant experience in order
that it dissolve and go away.
So some of these relationships reveal, maybe you're observing something, and you've got
the idea, I want to be with the breath, I want to practice concentration, I want to
be with the breath, but the attention is pulled to something else.
Frustration may arise, not particularly around the thing, the other thing, maybe it's your
pet walking around you.
It may not be so much that you dislike your pet, but that you are frustrated that the
mind is pulled to the pet as opposed to being with the breath because of the agenda.
So the exploration around this relationship to experience is a very powerful tool for
us.
I learned this practice primarily, I mean, I'd heard about this for many years.
Many teachers said, well, how are you in relationship to that?
But Sayada Uteja Nia, my teacher, really emphasized this aspect.
And through a real kind of curiosity about the relationship, almost making that be the
main piece of the exploration, I learned so much about the mind.
And so much about this fourth foundation.
What is it that creates reaction?
What is it that moves the mind in the direction of freedom?
When the mind is okay?
When there's not the reactivity, when the mind is fine with what's happening?
Instead of becoming bored, there's more that's like, wow, well, what's here?
Oh, that there's this interest and curiosity that said, that's got a flavor.
There's this connection, intimacy with experience, that's got a flavor.
So the mind began to get interested in the quality of the mind.
