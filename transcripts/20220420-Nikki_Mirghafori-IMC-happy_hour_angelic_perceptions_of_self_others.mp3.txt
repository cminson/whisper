The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
So, hello, hello and welcome, dear Sangha.
Lovely to be with you in, if not in space, but in time, if not in time,
if you're listening to this later.
Lovely to practice together, however it may be.
So, for the theme for tonight's happy hour,
I'd like to invite us to explore a particular perspective, a perception,
the way we see ourselves, the way we see others.
And to shift it a little bit, to shift it,
and then that shift from this shift, which I will name in a moment,
setting it up from this shift and perception perspective,
then from that, then a sense of meta-kindness can feel different,
or a sense of compassion can feel different from this shifted perspective.
So, the shifted perspective that I'd like to invite us to explore,
and I will guide us in the guided meditation, is this.
As opposed to how we often perhaps see ourselves, or see others,
perhaps we see ourselves as, or we lean into the way our minds perhaps focus on the negative,
on what's challenging, on the dukkha and the suffering.
So, we have this narrative, we have this narrative, which is perfectly fine.
You were human beings, this is how we evolutionary, we've come to be.
We have this narrative, self-narrative, and we often, in our self-narrative,
we see, you know, we're narrating what we want to do,
and oh, maybe this thing didn't get done, or what we did,
we go over it over and over again, and maybe things that didn't go well.
So, there's often stickiness with what's unpleasant, what has been difficult,
what's satisfying, or maybe what I would call our brokenness.
Like, oh, yes, our brokenness, we often lean into that.
Again, evolutionary, evolutionarily, those ancestors who leaned into the pleasant,
they didn't live long enough to pass on their genes,
but the ones who actually were more afraid, those were the ones
who lived long enough to pass on their genes.
So, again, evolutionary, it all makes sense.
And yet, in terms of our personal experience, we tend to see ourselves as these human beings
that are fallible and not perfect, and we're working towards goodness,
and we often forget our beauty, our goodness.
Now, balancing that perspective, what I like to invite us to lean into tonight,
to feel into, is to see our magnificence, the inner goodness, the brilliance,
intelligence for smarts, but just this brightness, this brightness,
as if we were an angel, as if we were an angel.
You can use the word or the concept angel, if you like that,
or you can use as if we were a Buddha within, or as the Buddha within us.
You can use that language.
I want to be flexible with the language and see what works for you.
Or maybe there's a Kwan Yen within to see what works for you.
But maybe for this, I use the word angel because there's something bright about,
again, not making any assertions about nature of reality,
but this angelic qualities of the inner angelic qualities of goodness,
of service, of brightness, of an open, loving heart.
What if we saw ourself as an angel, as this angel who means well,
means to serve, to love, to protect, to be kind, to guide?
What if we leaned into that vision?
How would we see ourselves?
How would we behave?
How would we hold ourselves?
Our intentions, our mistakes, our aspirations, our work, our daily life,
our interactions with others?
When we wake up in the morning, okay, I'm doing angels' jobs.
Okay, this is my work today.
This is, as an angel, this is what I do.
And then how would we see others in the world, other angels,
that they're here to serve, to be kind, to love, to protect?
How would our relationship shift to our minds, to our hearts?
How would we show up?
It might be corrective.
This might be a sorely needed corrective compared to how we often go about our days
and our perspective, the way we perceive ourselves.
So, that's cute.
I need to pass as an entry-level angel, maybe.
That's fine.
Entry level is fine.
Just do whatever works.
So, dear angels, let's practice together and take on these different perspectives
and see how they might shift and guide our practice of loving kindness, compassion, etc.
From this perspective, hey, perspectives are a dime a dozen.
We can choose our perspectives, right?
Let's try this on and see what might shift.
Maybe some habitual patterns of self-judgment.
Maybe they get loosened a little bit.
Maybe we give ourselves a break.
Maybe we love ourselves and others a little more easily.
Let's try this on for size.
So, I'd like to invite you to sit comfortably, whether sitting or lying down,
in a position where you can be for the next 30 minutes with ease,
allowing the back to have a sense of integrity,
to be straight but not over-efforting,
as if it's being pulled up.
There is a magnet on top of your head pulling up.
Your back vertebrae by vertebrae.
Ah, your neck, shoulders.
They can relax.
They can completely relax.
Letting your feet, your sit bones,
letting them be connected to the earth,
releasing,
releasing the weight.
Your earthly weight, your angelic weight onto this earth.
As always, we start by just grounding in the body,
grounding in the body.
Each and every breath breathing in or rather being breathed in.
Let it be natural, let it be received.
The in-breath receives the out-breath released.
Must thoughts arise, not a problem.
They will arise. It's okay.
For the sake of this training together,
smilingly, smilingly tell them thank you.
Thank you and not now.
Let's come back later.
No need for self-judgment.
Let there be kindness, let there be ease in your body and your heart.
With yourself, with the thoughts that arise.
They're not adversaries.
Just untimely right now. It's okay.
Later, later, thank you.
Letting the breath in the body, in the abdomen.
Let it be center stage.
Letting the breath in the body, in the abdomen.
Letting the breath in the body, in the abdomen.
Letting the breath in the body, in the abdomen.
Letting the breath in the body, in the abdomen.
All right.
The in-breath was received in the abdomen,
not in the control tower of the head.
released. Ah, landing. Here. Now.
Not now. Dear thoughts. Just simply here.
Let it be enjoyed. Let it be delicious. This moment of just sitting, being breathed.
Let it be nourishing with your heart.
Gladdening your heart to mind.
Now I'd like to invite you while while we stay embodied.
Feeling the body, the breath, the body relaxed.
To bring to your heart maybe a kind act you offer to someone.
The way you helped them, supported them.
Maybe a phone call with a friend, a patient ear, a gift,
a donation to a call as you care about some act of kindness, generosity, patience.
Bring it to your heart, to your heart, mind.
And let it gladden. Let yourself relish the goodness.
How it perhaps affected the other, being or beings.
And how it brings gladness to your heart.
This release, this generosity, this giving away.
Letting yourself relax into, feel into this goodness. It is wholesome to relish goodness.
It expands our heart to more goodness, more kindness, more generosity.
And let yourself, for this moment, later go back to the other perception or the usual
perceptions, but in this moment let it expand. Seeing yourself as kind, as generous,
these qualities let them be felt in your body, brightly.
The slice out of time, seeing yourself as an angel.
Now, generous, kind, patient, the angelic qualities of service and care.
And if your thoughts get in the way, oh no, I'm selfish and not so good. Nothing angelic about
me. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Don't believe, don't believe those thoughts. Don't believe
the self-judging thoughts. Let them go. They're just thoughts. Don't have to believe them.
Don't get in your own way. Don't let these thoughts get in your own way. Experiment.
An angel serving, helping, supporting other angels.
But first leaning into your own, being angelic job, duty, nature.
And to know that your growth as an angel, your freedom is not independent of others.
It's bound with others. So you're giving your generosity, it's not just to help them,
it's to free your own heart.
It's to bring more wings, to give your wings more lift.
It's to uplift you as much as it is to uplift others.
Let yourself see yourself as kind, as generous, in acts of service, not self-centered.
Let yourself see yourself in this way.
Again, we can always go back to the other way later, the end of the hour, but right now experiment.
See what might open up in your heart, in your mind.
Maybe there can be more freedom,
not being attached to fixed views of yourself and others.
Play around with this image of yourself and maybe your daily tasks,
your work, your cleaning, your dishwashing, whatever it is you do, becomes angels' work, angels' job.
Your work isn't just a profession or a way to earn a livelihood, but a way to serve,
to grow, to earn your wings.
Use it more meaning and dimensionality.
It's angel doing angels' work.
And angels, like humans are impermanent, have limited time to love, to serve, to give.
To do this angels' work in this realm, on this earth.
And this earth, which is sacred,
is the only planet we have to live on, to love, to grow, on.
And seeing others, seeing others as angels, their goodness, their beauty, their kindness,
their freedom is bound up with yours.
Their angel wings, their angel rank, is bound up with yours.
Letting yourself receive graciously, so others, other angels can give and be kind,
earned their wings, just as you.
Seeing your own goodness,
the goodness that is more magnificent, brighter than you can ever imagine, give yourself credit for.
Let it be expressed.
Notice from this perspective, as we play around with perceptions,
it becomes easier, or if it shifts,
how accessible kindness, meta, warmth is for yourself, appreciating your own goodness.
And this compassion becomes more accessible for this being, who is me, who is yourself,
the ways that you suffer things that are hard for you, this angel who is trying their best.
And things can be hard in this body, in this mind sometimes. It's okay, it's okay dear.
Because the shift of this perspective, how does the shift, how does it change?
Kindness, meta for others, if you see them as angels.
To see their goodness, their acts of service, their kindness.
To see their goodness, their acts of service, their kindness.
To see their goodness, their acts of service, their kindness.
And you can stay with this perspective or perception, or you can release
and see what is here, how the residue might have shifted some things,
open things up for you, perhaps in unexpected ways.
Can you accept the grace that is to be human?
The grace
of living,
having joy, sorrows,
being kind, serving, helping or acting in ways
that are far from your angelic nature and learning from them, returning, learning, growing.
It's enough to be human, it's actually quite profound to be human.
How awesome, how amazing.
May our practice, may the wholesomeness, the goodness of our practice, our cultivation
serve this angel, this human, who is me, who is us, as well as all other angels, other humans,
in freedom, in waking up.
May all beings be free.
Hello angels, welcome back.
So we have some time for reflections.
Christine says, every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings.
It's great, I'm going to ring the bell a lot then.
So Claire, I see your hand is raised, please.
Mine's also short, but all your references to angels made me immediately think I do practice
Christianity, and there's a hymn, I love music, and there's a hymn that I've always adored,
the main, I'm not going to say this, it wouldn't want to occur, but the main lyric is this little
light of mine, I'm going to let it shine, and it's so sweet, but very much in the spirit of
what you're talking about. Yeah, yeah, lovely, exactly. Thank you for that, Claire, and I brought
that in actually, sometimes in the past, in similar practices, yeah, let your light shine,
exactly, this little light of mine, or this big light of mine, let it shine. Yeah, thank you, Claire.
Bill says, I found the angel idea hard to accept, but then I thought, assume
a virtue if you have it or not, after that it was easier. Beautiful, assume a virtue
if you have it or not, lovely, that's lovely, yeah, beautiful. Erin says on YouTube,
well, as manifestations of the cosmos, we are sort of angels of love, serve others, yep,
absolutely, indeed, indeed, able to serve others in many ways, exactly, that's absolutely right,
that's the spirit of this practice and the invitation for us to see ourselves a little
differently, really see ourselves in this service-oriented way, yeah, yeah, cute,
Mary Christine says, oh, but these ears are my wings, I love it, I love it, Mary Christine,
that is so cute, I love that, that's lovely, yeah, any other reflections, any other,
something that might have come up for you, did this open up this different perspective,
seeing yourself as an angel and others, did it shift something or open in your work, in your
meta, in your compassion for yourself or others, any, any aha moments or questions or complaints,
everything is welcome.
Claire, I see your hand, but you've already spoken, so I'm going to let other people speak.
Catherine, please.
Yeah, it's so interesting since I was not raised like believing in angels, but there's something
about an embodied cosmic experience that just feels really good, like to feel myself as like
my body made of light and then wings, which just, when I imagine that I feel that in my body,
I, my chest opens and I feel this like, you know, my neck and shoulders are often so tight and so
to just like, it's just a gift to imagine and imagine but in my body, that blessing, so thank you.
That's lovely, thank you so much for that, exactly, it's just, again, my intention and hope,
just as you said, wasn't to appeal to any religious views, but just this different, you know, as humans,
we have this idea of angels, these angelic great beings, right, kind, kind, so it's just this,
yeah, this physicality that you express and experience, just a different way of, oh, just uplifted,
shifted, like feeling different, how does that shift? Yeah, beautiful, thanks so much for sharing
that, I love that, lovely. Dave says, thank you for this practice, it really spoke to me,
I was washing windows yesterday and thinking that I want people to know that I love washing windows,
so that they might feel that love as they look through them, oh, that's lovely, that is so
beautiful, that is so beautiful, yeah, this sense of practice, the service aspect, yeah, yeah,
so, yeah, oh, hope you feel better, Dave, yeah, so how about we turn into our practice
in small groups with other angels tonight, just the rubber meeting the road and just can we show up
is just for a moment, again, we can go back to our humaneness, just the sense of this goodness,
this beauty, this expansiveness, and meet others in this small group for just a few minutes,
six, seven minutes or so, and actually I think it'll be, I've said it for seven or eight,
and also see the goodness in others, see the goodness in others, hold them, see them as angels,
see how that perception might actually make how we serve, how we relate different,
so groups will be a size of three roughly, and the invitation is to speak from your own experience,
and just one nugget, just a minute, and then next person will say a nugget, or anyone can say pass,
you can just hold silent space, if you wish, for others, for other angels, to see what it's like to
engage, engage in the space of kindness together in this way, so
I'm going to create the breakout rooms, and again only speaking from your own experience,
not managing, not commenting, just staying close, staying close to your own experience, so I'm about
to open the rooms and take care of yourself, take care of each other in the rooms, here we go.
Any other reflections, maybe something that came up in the group,
if you haven't spoken for a while, would love to hear from you, you can also type in chat, Neil.
So, first of all, I thought this was a lovely meditation,
so one thing that came up for me was, I thought of someone who I'm having difficulty with at work,
and gee, this didn't work for that, and that was not the point of this meditation,
so I dumped him and just moved on, it wasn't like he tainted the whole meditation,
but someone else in my group mentioned talking about a situation that they had found an
interaction with people they had found difficult, so I guess, what do you do when you're doing a
meditation like this and you're running into those sticky situations? Yeah, good question,
so sticky situation, I mean, there's a reason why these sticky situations come up, right,
the mind is still grappling with just finding a way to find peace with the sticky situation,
so the invitation, for example, tonight would be, is it possible, and you said in the case
that you tried, it wasn't possible to see them as enjoying, but maybe what I would do is,
maybe I would persist and I would try to see something kind they have done in the past
or they're doing, not the sticky situation that kind of is upsetting right now, but maybe
they've been kind in the past, maybe at work, maybe there's something you did, I don't know,
they gave you a compliment, just something kinds, or maybe to others, maybe they're on time,
maybe that's one of their gifts, the ways they serve, find something kind, something goodness
about them, or maybe like they have family, they love their family, oh, can you see them as an angel
loving their child or loving their elderly parent or something loving their pet, like maybe find a
way in, and if it still doesn't work, it's okay, then you just bow to it and and realize that maybe
this is a very complicated needs more time needs more time, so those are my invitations, Neil.
Okay, thank you. Thank you, thank you so much. So, dear angels, we've come to the end of the
happy hour, spending this hour practicing together, cultivating a different way of seeing, being
with ourselves, first and foremost, and with others in the world, so may our practice support
ourselves and all beings everywhere, may all beings be free and happy.
Thank you all, thank you so much.
