The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
I felt like last time I talked, we kind of, in a way, had come to an end of the very long series
that I offered on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.
So I was feeling like a new topic, what to bring.
And what occurred to me is something that's near and dear to my own heart,
and that is to reflect about supports for practicing in the midst of our lives,
supports for practicing daily life.
And so the way I thought I would do this is, you know, I've been practicing with daily life practice
for so many years, and I have a lot of supports that I offer sometimes on daily life retreat.
I do a daily life retreat where we go through various tools and supports
for practicing daily life over the course of a week.
I sometimes will offer a talk at the end of retreat about how to bring what we've done on retreat back into daily life.
And then I do speak about it in bits and pieces in these classes,
but I just thought to kind of collect together some of these tools and supports
and not try to do them all at once, but just offer one reflection each day
and then have a conversation about it and what you're noticing in daily life.
So I would be a little more interactive.
So just start with a little bit of a kind of an orientation, I guess,
and for myself, practicing in daily life, the kind of curiosity about being aware
of what's happening for myself in daily life was my earliest practice.
I wasn't so interested in sitting meditation,
but I was interested in understanding how I was getting so caught
and stuck in difficult emotions.
Having read a book about mindfulness that actually was a little bit oriented
towards practicing in the midst of life, I decided to just dive in there.
And so this is my first practice and I learned so much.
Actually, I got into the sitting practice because at some point I realized,
wow, this is really useful for learning how to be with myself
and to navigate stuff in my daily life. Maybe this is why they call it practice.
Maybe this is why they call this sitting thing practice
because it supports you to begin to, it's practice for being aware in the midst of our daily lives.
And so that's why I started sitting.
I didn't really start sitting until a couple of months after exploring my experience in daily life.
And in that process, there were a few kind of tools and tricks that I started with
that seemed to be a good place to begin in terms of offering supports for daily life practice.
So I'll start with some of those first things that I played with.
But first I will just offer, because sometimes in this kind of exploration,
some time into talking about how to practice in daily life,
someone will ask me the question, like, why do we do this?
Why do we try to be mindful in daily life?
It feels like it just is, it's hard in the first place.
And, you know, it feels like I'm just like noticing all the struggles.
And so why do we do this?
And I'd say that, you know, our daily lives are unfold,
our daily lives unfold based on what's happened in our past,
you know, kind of the conditions of our past.
We are often acting from very old, deep habits, patterns, conditioning,
that we're not so aware of.
It's kind of below, a lot of times below the surface of what we are consciously aware of.
We might think of it as below our conscious awareness in our subconscious.
We will burst out and say something and think, why did I say that?
Or we feel a kind of an urge or a momentum of some emotion,
and we know it's connected to old stuff and not so much related to what's happening here,
but we just can't stop ourselves from acting.
And so there's a lot of suffering that happens because of that,
acting from old conditioning, acting from old habits and patterns,
and we suffer, we struggle with that,
and people around us suffer and struggle with that,
and these kind of habits and patterns meet each other,
and we have conflict.
In our families, with our friends, with people that are difficult for us,
it's like across the board we struggle with this.
We have stress, anxiety, confusion, anger, frustration,
all kinds of things that come up because we are not aware.
And so the first piece really is to begin to get curious about,
can we be aware of what's happening underneath?
And yes, we can be aware of what's going on.
It's just that our habit of mind tends to have,
we tend to have a different relationship.
We tend to have a relationship when those habits and patterns of mind come up.
We tend to have the relationship with them or embedded in those emotions,
embedded in frustration, embedded in confusion, embedded in anger,
is the idea that I have to follow this, act with this anger.
This anger knows what to do.
This frustration kind of, you know, it's like I have to figure this out.
As opposed to the kind of the curiosity of,
well, what does it feel like to be a human being experiencing this
in daily life, in this place, in this time?
So this practice in daily life is to begin to orient more towards that curiosity
when we notice something happening.
What does it feel like?
Not what do I need to do about it, but what does it feel like?
And that is the first step when we can begin to land with that,
that experience of what does it feel like?
That begins to bring that unconscious or subconscious conditioning into the surface.
And we get a little bit, we get a little bit of choice potentially
about whether to act from that, maybe we get a little bit.
Over time that grows.
Over time we gain that capacity more and more.
When we begin to see what's happening for ourselves
with this tool of mindfulness when we can recognize,
oh, this is what's happening.
That very recognition can create just a little space to give us a choice.
Do we act? How do we act?
Do we hold our tongue, not say something that's just going to burst for?
So this is a kind of a motivation perhaps for bringing mindfulness into our daily lives
because it does begin to help us not only to see the way we're struggling and suffering,
to see the conditioning, it gives us some space around it.
Often it gives us enough space so that we can navigate it in a more skillful way.
And the very first piece around practice in daily life, for me at least,
I mean there's so many different doorways in to daily life practice.
And so this is why I'm going to just offer a piece each day, each time I'm giving the talks on these mornings
over the course of, I don't know how long it's going to go, we'll see.
How many days we'll explore different tools or avenues or ways in.
But for me the first avenue in was really beginning to try to bring mindfulness into what's happening in my day.
So that's where we'll start, this first piece.
I'm hoping to just offer a couple of pieces, one kind of recognizing mindfulness in daily life
and a support for how to do that.
So that's where I'll start today.
But in order to do this, it sounds so kind of technical or something as we begin to explore it.
Recognize the moment that mindfulness returns in daily life as,
why would I want to do that?
Or a tool that helps you do that.
It seems so silly or ridiculous, it's kind of like the way we begin in sitting practice.
We offer a very simple thing, like try to be with your breath.
And it's not that the breath is the goal, but it really begins to cultivate that capacity we have to be mindful.
And we also, I'm going to start with this analogy essentially.
So in beginning, often in beginning meditation instructions, we do use a simple tool like,
okay, you sit down, you close your eyes, and you try to be with the breath.
Just like you turn your attention and try to be with the breath.
And the first thing you notice pretty much is that the mind wanders.
That it's not easy to be with the breath.
And so what you, you don't actually notice so much the mind wandering.
You notice the moment that you've recognized that the mind has been wandering.
So essentially in that early practice in sitting, what you are mainly noticing is,
well, sometimes you're with the breath, so you're kind of like noticing that when you can.
But often what you're noticing is the return of mindfulness after your mind has wandered.
So you notice the return of mindfulness, and often then the instruction is,
come back to the breath in the, in the sitting, I really encouraged noticing that the mindfulness has returned.
And that's, that's, that's a good skill to practice in the sitting that can help carry into daily life.
So noticing in that moment after the mindful mind has wandered, that the mindfulness has returned.
What is that experience like?
What is it like for mindfulness to return?
In that moment when mindfulness returns, if we are, if we're, if we're thinking about,
oh, the first thing I need to do is get back to the breath.
We might miss that we can actually recognize a difference there.
As the, as the mindfulness returns, there's, there's a kind of, there's a kind of a difference
between what it's like for mindfulness to be here right now,
and what it was like a moment before when mindfulness was lost.
So if we can orient in that moment to, oh, this is what it's like for mindfulness to be here
as opposed to immediately jump to go back to the breath.
Just like, oh, mindfulness is back.
Okay. Wow. This is what it feels like.
And often it's, it's not, it's, it's kind of interesting because that moment of recognizing mindfulness return
or noticing mindfulness itself in that moment, it's both very clear.
We know that mindfulness is back, but we don't quite know how we know.
That's like, we couldn't really describe.
I mean, I use some analogy sometimes like the light comes on or something like that.
But, but the describing the experience of mindfulness returning is pretty, pretty challenging.
We don't have, we don't have a lot of language for that.
But we can begin to recognize it without language.
So, so that's a, that's a place actually where there's a, there's some overlap
between daily life practice and sitting practice.
And in sitting practice, if you can, you know, have that curiosity,
not judge yourself for the fact that mindfulness wanders, that the mind wanders
and that, you know, mindfulness is returning.
It's like every time you're sitting, that moment of mindfulness returning
is an opportunity to get familiar with what it feels like for mindfulness to return.
And as you get familiar with that and sitting practice,
you can also get familiar with it in daily life.
Then what, what I'd say in daily life is that, that moment of mindfulness returning,
it happens actually quite a lot.
But it doesn't quite come to the point where we consciously recognize,
oh, there's mindfulness, because very quickly when we become aware of something like,
you know, I'm walking down the street and I hear a motorcycle, you know, it's like,
or there's some loud sound and there's a little bit of a startle.
If I've been lost in thought, there's a little bit of a startle and there's,
you know, the kind of like orientation back to being here, hearing this sound,
but mostly what the mind will do in that moment is kind of orient to the sound
and think about the sound, you know, it's like, so it's interrupted,
that sound has interrupted the kind of, if you've been lost in thought,
that sound has kind of woken you up and brought you back into the present,
but only for a split second, because if we're not oriented around recognizing mindfulness
in our daily lives, recognizing what that's like for mindfulness to return,
we will kind of jump on to what mindfulness has recognized.
That's our habit. When mindfulness attaches to something
or when attention kind of connects with something,
our habit is to go to the object and think about it.
And so to kind of orient to what is it like for mindfulness to return in daily life,
this is not an easy thing.
While it happens all the time that, you know, we get like a split second of mindfulness,
we rarely recognize it, especially at the beginning,
at the beginning of this kind of practice.
And so this is a first kind of piece,
is can you begin to be curious about when mindfulness returns in daily life?
This is my main daily life practice at this point,
and that combined with, as I recognize mindfulness returning,
it kind of, at this point, it kind of fades in and out.
It doesn't get too far lost, but it's stronger and weaker at times.
And so sometimes I can ride the wave of mindfulness for a stretch of time
and just be like in my kitchen and preparing a meal
and being fairly mindful for the entire time.
So there's kind of like riding those waves,
and then there's the recognizing those returns.
So these are my main daily life practices right now.
But it's taken years for me to get there.
So this practice of recognizing that mindfulness returns,
the moment mindfulness returns,
I found there's some tools that can help us to begin to recognize that moment.
It's kind of like in our, we need some kind of a reference point
to help us recognize that mindfulness has returned.
In daily life, like in the sitting practice,
we've got a lot of reference points to help us remember that mindfulness has returned.
We're sitting, first of all, often.
We're in a still posture.
Often our eyes are closed,
and just the very posture helps us to remember when we kind of recognize,
you know, oh, I'm not actually having that conversation with that person.
I'm attempting to be present with myself.
So there's those things that help us to recognize that mindfulness has returned,
just the simple act of sitting.
And then if we have a reference point like the breath,
we often can recognize, oh, I'm not with the breath.
The mind has wandered off of the breath.
And so the breath can serve as a useful reference point to help us realize,
oh, the mind lost its kind of focus on the breath.
So in daily life, we lose all of these.
You know, we're not sitting in a still posture with anything to help us remember
to be mindful so much.
And so, yeah, we don't have necessarily a reference point like the breath
or something like that, because we're doing so many things.
And so I found this, and this was a suggestion I got from one of that early book,
the book that I don't know if it came from this book.
I actually read back through that book to try to figure out where did I get this idea
so that I could credit whoever it was that gave it to me.
But I haven't been able to find it.
But I seem to connect it with the book Every Day Zen by Joe Gaubeck,
this idea of rather than trying to be mindful all day long,
which is kind of, that's what often we do on retreat.
And that's what we're instructed to try to do as we sit in a meditation,
is to cultivate the mindfulness as much as possible in that time,
to keep coming back to the mindfulness over and over and over again.
And so we might have that idea, okay, what it means in daily life to cultivate mindfulness
is to try to do it all day long.
And that's a great aspiration, but I find it's a pretty high bar.
And for myself, I had attempted to do that.
I had actually met mindfulness sometime in my 20s, I think,
I'd read this book, The Miracle of Mindfulness by Tick Nutt Hahn.
And that was also encouraging daily life mindfulness.
And it's like, wow, that sounds cool. I'll try that.
I'm going to try that tomorrow.
I was reading the book at night. I'll try that tomorrow.
And I forget until I picked up the book the next night.
And after about a week of that, I just thought, well, I guess I can't do this.
I don't know how to do this. And so I forgot about mindfulness until I met it again
about 15 years later.
And that time, I had this other book that I had encouraged something more like a project,
pick something, pick something that you want to kind of orient mindfulness with.
And so this brings a tool in that I found really useful, that is, I picked two things.
And one of them was picking the thing that was really stressing me out, which was my anger.
So I was like, okay, anytime I'm angry, I'm going to try to be aware of that.
Now that tool I'm going to talk about later.
I'm not going to talk about that one right now.
I'm just going to talk about the basics of recognizing mindfulness today.
So the other tool that I picked, and it was kind of, you know, there were no suggestions as far as I remember
in this book about picking, you know, some project to be mindful of.
But I picked something really neutral, just as a kind of like, okay, I'm just going to see,
can I be mindful when I do this activity?
So, you know, so I had these two things, I'm going to try to be mindful when anger comes up
and I'm going to try to be mindful when I do this really simple activity.
And I picked something that happened regularly through my day, through the bulk of my day.
I worked on computers all day.
And at that point, this was in the late 90s, I was switching between DOS and Windows on my computer a lot.
You know, I was a programmer, so I needed to go back to DOS to do some of the programming,
then go back to Windows to test it out.
So I did that a lot, you know, six times an hour, something like that.
So quite a lot, I did that activity.
And I decided to just see if I could become aware of that.
And as I explored this, you know, at first what happened for me was that it was the end of the day.
You know, it was kind of like that book that I'd put down years before.
I was like, I was going to bed at night and it's like, wow, I don't think I remembered once.
I know that I switched between DOS and Windows many times today.
And I didn't notice it once.
This time, to my credit, I didn't give up.
You know, I said, well, I'm just going to try again.
I'm just going to try again.
Yeah, okay, I'm just going to try again.
The book says it's possible I'm going to try again.
And I encourage that kind of attitude, because what I'm describing here about what happened for me
is probably the same kind of thing that will happen for you.
It takes time to begin to connect with these experiences.
Now, it took me a while to realize this, but that moment that I recognized or thought,
that moment that I thought, wow, I haven't remembered mindfulness in that activity all day long.
I didn't remember once.
That very moment was mindfulness returning connected to that activity.
There was the thinking about, oh, I didn't remember to be mindful of that activity.
It's kind of like the mind wanders is like, oh, I'm not paying attention to the breath in sitting meditation.
It's that kind of a reference point, something that happens regularly through the day.
So, you know, you may sit in meditation and maybe your mind wanders 15 minutes.
You know, you've been breathing for a long time.
The mind remembers, oh, haven't been noticing the breathing.
So, this remembering of the reference point in that moment.
Like, okay, yep, have not remembered switching between doors and windows on my computer all day long.
That was the first moment that actually the mindfulness began to get connected to that activity.
And subsequently, in exploring this with other people, I encourage people in that recognition,
knowing, oh, wow, I haven't remembered that.
Just in that moment taken, oh, there's a moment of mindfulness returning.
Mindfulness is back in that moment.
You have the ability, the capacity in that moment to just check in.
How am I right now?
So mindfulness is returned.
What's it like for mindfulness to return?
And how am I right now in a really light, simple way?
And then what the other piece that I discovered for myself around this practice of using this kind of a tool
is to just get on with my day, to not try to hold onto mindfulness in that moment.
Just notice that mindfulness is returned and then just carry on like that first night.
Yep, just getting into bed, preparing for bed, all of that stuff.
Not trying to hold onto it.
Oh, I didn't remember.
Okay, here's mindfulness and yeah, I'll keep trying.
So over the course of a couple weeks, what seemed to happen with this project that I picked
is that I would remember like the first few days I think I remembered at bedtime.
And then, you know, and then I started remembering a couple times in the middle of the day,
like when I took my lunch break, my mind would rest and relax.
And it'd be like, oh yeah, that project haven't been remembering it.
Again, just like, okay, I'm just going to keep trying.
That was how I approached it really was just, I'm going to keep trying.
And I encourage people to have that attitude but also to in that moment, oh, there's mindfulness.
That's a moment of mindfulness returning in daily life.
What's it like?
Oh, I'm eating lunch.
What's it like?
You know, I'm sitting here and I'm chewing.
That's what's going on.
So just kind of like in those moments when mindfulness returns.
It's like you can't in that moment go and be mindful of that activity.
Like I was eating lunch.
I wasn't able to like, oh, let me put myself in front of my computer and be mindful of
switching between dots and windows.
But I could be mindful in that moment of what was happening in that moment.
Just lightly, really light touch.
So a light touch is another piece I encourage here.
A light touch of that.
Oh, I'm aware.
What's obvious?
You can't go back to your reference point often in that moment.
So it's just like, well, what's obvious?
What's here?
Oh, I'm tense.
I'm relaxed.
I'm thinking whatever it is that's happening.
And so over the course of a couple of weeks, I began to notice that I was remembering that
I wasn't remembering more times in the day.
So I still wasn't really connecting it to that switching between dots and windows on
my computer.
That event happened pretty fast.
It was just a little split second.
And in retrospect, I was in the midst of really concentrated focus on what I was doing.
It was a hard thing to pick, actually, because the mind was right in the midst of something.
And it's like, oh, I need to hold on to that and remember that and then switch to dots
and do that thing and then go back.
It was not an easy thing to do because the mind was so engaged.
But I got a lot of moments of remembering mindfulness, remembering that I hadn't recognized it.
So probably seven, eight times in the day, I got that, oh, I'm aware.
I haven't remembered.
OK, just keep trying.
And in your own kind of connecting with something like this, and I will encourage you, I would
encourage you to pick something that would happen regularly through your day.
Like for me, I picked something that happened six times an hour.
So it could be something like reaching for something.
That's a hard one, actually.
Reaching is a hard one.
But you might pick something like drinking water or opening doors.
That's a good one.
Opening anything, like opening the refrigerator, opening a drawer, opening a book.
So any kind of thing like that.
Just pick something neutral that happens regularly through your day.
And then begin, just have that commitment.
It's like an intention.
Can I remember when that happens?
So for myself, again, over the course of a few weeks, I began to see.
I kind of got a little bit of like, well, at least I'm remembering that I've forgotten.
I'm remembering that I haven't remembered.
And I began to, I think I began to also see a little bit of benefit of just a little breaking
in of, oh, I'm aware of what's happening right now, even if it's not connected with Dawson
Windows.
So with that activity that I picked, there's a little bit of like, oh yeah, here I am.
A little bit of like landing with myself multiple times through the day.
And then over time, I remember, I remember at one point, the day, you know, it's kind
of like, I noticed it, I noticed right after I had done the activity, I switched between
Dawson Windows and I was like, oh, I just did it.
So it's like a split second after it had happened.
And that got, I was very excited at that point.
It's like, wow, I almost caught it.
And then very quickly after that, I did begin to notice it.
And so then what happened is that that activity almost became a little mindfulness bell, that
when I did it, it's like, oh, I got a little burst of being aware.
And, you know, and again, not holding onto it because, you know, in the midst of that
activity of programming, to try to hold onto mindfulness kind of disrupts the concentration
that has to happen to do that activity.
So I didn't try to hold onto it.
But just like, oh, there, here it is.
This is, yep, I'm aware.
And, you know, it was, it was a very neutral thing that I picked there.
And that was actually interesting in contrast to the picking the anger picking, you know,
picking being mindful of anger.
I was really glad actually that I had circumstantially, happenstantially picked something really neutral
because it gave me the possibility, you know, when I became aware of anger, it was really unpleasant.
It was like hard to be aware of that.
And when I became aware of these moments of, oh, I haven't remembered, I got all kinds of things,
you know, sometimes I was relaxed, sometimes I was eating, sometimes I was delighted,
sometimes, so there was a lot going on.
And there wasn't a lot of charge around becoming mindful of that activity.
And so I got a sense or a flavor of mindfulness being able to connect with lots of things,
not just like really painful things.
So that was useful to have that kind of contrast actually.
So over the course of, you know, I'd say it was probably a few weeks,
I got to the place where I could start to be aware when that happened.
And then I could start to see just before it would happen.
That was interesting.
I would know I was going to switch between Doss and Windows before I switched between Doss and Windows.
That's actually a really interesting moment.
You know, we can, in that moment, we can start to notice why we're going to do something.
Now in this case, it was pretty, you know, it was connected to what I was doing.
You know, it was just connected to, oh, I need to do this because this is the next thing I need to do.
This is the, you know, this is the flow of what I'm doing with this program.
I need to do this.
But there's other ways that that kind of beginning to connect with why am I going to do this.
You know, sometimes people pick touching their cell phone as an activity.
And that's really interesting as you begin to, you know, notice, oh, I'm touching my cell phone.
You know, it's like, we touch it so often without necessarily many people at least, you know,
kind of have a habit of just picking it up and looking at it, picking it up and looking at it.
And so if you get to that place where you can, you know, know you're going to touch your cell phone beforehand,
you can know why you're going to do it.
You can check in and see, is this just habit or is there something actually I need to check?
You know, so there's all kinds of interesting things that we can begin to learn by having this kind of a tool,
to have this kind of a tool.
So I would encourage you so that kind of the summary of this tool is something that happens regularly through your day.
And I find it useful to encourage people to do something or pick something that's an intentional activity,
something you have to initiate as opposed to like setting the bell on your computer, on your phone to ring
or some alarm on your phone to ring every 10 minutes, you know, to kind of program that.
That's a useful thing to do. That can be a really useful thing to do.
But that's happening from outside. You're trying to connect with, you're trying to remember or let something like break you into mindfulness from the outside.
And this tool that I'm offering is more an initiation, something that you're choosing to do, some activity you're choosing to do.
So there's going to be some motivation, some reason why you're choosing to do it.
And that's a piece of this exploration to begin to see before you do it.
You can begin to notice, I'm going to act before I act.
That kind of thing doesn't happen with the setting and alarm.
So picking some intentional activity that happens regularly through the day.
When you know, and you'll first notice it not connected with the activity so much, you know, it might be that you just remember that you've forgotten.
That's where it begins.
And I'd say in those moments of remembering, so those moments are moments of recognizing mindfulness returning.
Notice that. See if you can start to get familiar with that experience of mindfulness returning around this kind of project that you picked.
What does it feel like for mindfulness to return?
So that first piece that I talked about, noticing that mindfulness returns.
This tool of picking something that happens regularly through your day gives you opportunities to notice that mindfulness has returned.
And so letting that be a piece of this.
And then I would say, when you notice this moment of mindfulness returning, like, you know, you might be able to write it for a little while, but don't necessarily try to hold on to it.
Just get on with your day.
You'll probably start to notice more moments of mindfulness through your day.
This begins to kind of weave a little bit of a thread of mindfulness through your day.
So, but you don't have to try in daily life.
I find trying to be mindful continuously.
People basically give it up because it's so that the pulls out of mindfulness are so strong in daily life.
And the things that we need to do, the habit of not being mindful in the things we do is so strong.
And the kind of like with the computer programming, for instance, there was no way early in my practice that I could have been mindful while doing that.
Because it took a lot of mental, you know, activity to, like, no, hold in the mind all of the pieces of that very focused activity.
The mindfulness wasn't strong enough to be present while I was concentrating on doing that activity.
I did discover over the course of many years of practice with this that mindfulness can go into that activity.
But it doesn't happen when I'm trying to do it.
It's a kind of a gift that the momentum of mindfulness can infuse any activity that's happening.
But trying to do it while we're trying to do something focused and concentrated, it seems to kind of break up the...
It's kind of like you have to think, okay, can I be mindful of creating this line of code?
Okay, can I be mindful of the next thing?
And it kind of breaks up the flow of the activity that we're doing.
So at first I encourage people to not to try to hold on to mindfulness.
Just let those moments come up, recognize them, appreciate them, and then get on with your day.
So that's the first tool I'd like to offer for mindfulness in daily life.
And there's a few minutes for comments or questions.
So any comments or thoughts or reflections?
Okay, so I've been trying to be aware, I mean to be mindful while I'm cooking.
And so when mindfulness returns, you know, I also asked a question you said, you know, like you always said before, what does it feel like?
I don't feel anything.
But I just said, oh, I'm glad that this returns.
And then I just, instead of, like you said, just go on, I would ground myself.
I would pay more attention to the feet and the hands.
Is it okay?
Definitely. I mean, so a couple pieces you mentioned.
One, you don't feel anything when I, you know, like, what does it feel like for mindfulness to return?
You don't really feel anything.
That's, you know, that's often what happens early on in our practice in terms of recognizing what mindfulness is.
And especially in daily life, you know that you became mindful.
So one of the things you could do there is just to say, yes, this is mindfulness.
This is what it feels like to be mindful.
I don't, I can't really describe it.
I can't identify it.
But this is what it's like to be mindful.
And so just kind of like connect with that, you know, it's like, okay, this is the, this is what it's like to be mindful.
And then in doing something like cooking, you know, this is another piece I often suggest.
And I can bring it in here and maybe elaborate a little bit more on it.
The next time that another useful tool to bring in is something that we have to do that doesn't take a lot of mental energy, like cooking.
You know, often, you know, there's a little bit, you know, you have to maybe follow the recipe or, you know, kind of think about the ingredients and things like that.
But, you know, while you're doing a particular piece of it, like, okay, here's all my vegetables, I need to chop my vegetables.
You know, while you're doing a particular piece of it, there's not a lot of thinking that has to happen as you can kind of ground yourself in that.
And so in those kind of situations, and I will often suggest like a chore that you have to do, like making your bed or brushing your teeth or, you know, something that takes a few minutes of time to, to explore the possibility of extending the mindfulness throughout that activity.
So throughout the, the preparing the meal and, and doing things like connecting with your body there, that's useful.
You know, it's like, okay, can I be with my body while I'm doing this?
And that's often what happens to me too in the kitchen. It's almost like a natural thing almost that the, the body movement, there's a lot of body movement in the kitchen, you know, and it's almost a very natural place for the attention to ground or land.
And so yeah, I mean, while you're doing something that doesn't take a lot of effort, or if you can allow the mindfulness to continue.
And I often find that mindfulness will come back in the kitchen and it's like, yeah, there's no, there's nothing I have to think about right now other than what I'm doing in here.
And so it's a little easier to, to have the intention be in that moment.
Yeah, I'm going to stay with mindfulness as long as I can.
So there are times in the day where that's useful and, and there can even be, I sometimes encourage people to, to like make, put notes in certain places like, you know, like on your bathroom mirror, you know, be mindful while brushing your teeth or something on the refrigerator, you know, so that there's something.
But I have found that when I put notes around the house, I have to change them up, you know, because, because it's like, I'll just see right past it after a little while, you know.
So you have to like change color, like have a bunch of different color pieces of paper and change the color regularly or make the, the, you know, draw a picture or do something different.
You have to, you have to change it up because it doesn't take too long before the mind will just like go right past it.
But, but, but finding ways, you know, props or things to help you remember is, is perfectly legitimate in this daily life practice, because it is so hard.
It is so hard to remember.
