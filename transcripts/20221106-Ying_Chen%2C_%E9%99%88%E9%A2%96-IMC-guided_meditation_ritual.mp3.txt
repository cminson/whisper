 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. I just want to do a sound check. I don't think I hear anything. I'll keep talking. Can you all hear me okay? Yeah? Good? In the back? Yeah? All right. So good morning. Good to be here with you all in the hall and also those who are on YouTube through the webcast. So we'll begin this morning with meditation. I'll offer a few words of light guidance in our meditation. And the invitation is to consider the meditation as a ritual. And so for today's practice, whether it's the silent sit or in the Dharma talk, consider this as an unfolding ritual. So we'll begin this ritual with the sound of a bell. As a ritual, there is a beginning, a middle, and end of a process. And this beginning involves maybe some setting up ourselves or preparing ourselves for meditation. And so take a few generous moments to allow ourselves to arrive. Maybe arrive at here and now. If you want to take a few long deep breaths as you breathe out, riding along with the out breath to arrive at this space and this moment. This arriving process is as if we're entering into a secret temple, ancient temple, a temple of this body, this mind and this heart. Maybe there's already a sense of reverence, humility as we arrive and enter into this temple of the body. Taking seats in the center of our being. Maybe first a few moments just to check out the global sense of our being, the physicality of the body, the posture, the moods, emotions that came along. Becoming present and aware. And momentarily we can settle onto our seats as if we're sitting in the center of the temple. A temple of this body, this mind and this heart. Taking a few moments to feel and sense into the contact of the lower half of the body with the floor, the chairs, supported by earth underneath. And settling into the seat. Feeling into this grounded solidity of the earth element in the body. Naturally settling downwards, naturally grounding. Maybe feeling into the bones, the sit bones, thigh bones, firm, steady. And bones throughout the spine, torso. The earth elements in the body naturally grounds, settles down. And we're transitioning to the next part of the ritual of our meditation. From this grounded place, may we open to whatever arises and passes away in our experience. As a ritual we open to the gifts of the process and letting go of our wanting and desires, expectations. Offering ourselves up to what arises, what emerges in our experience. And welcome the movements of the breath. And welcome the dancing sensations in the body. And welcome the waves of emotions. And treat each experience as if we're offering the blessings to all of this experiences, nothing excluded. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
